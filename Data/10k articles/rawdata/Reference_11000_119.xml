'''''Alleyne v. United States''''', {{Ussc|570|___|2013|el=no}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that decided that, in line with ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (2000), all facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to and found true by a jury (not merely determined to be true by a judge's discretion). The majority opinion was written by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan|Kagan]].

==Summary of findings==
In the original trial, the defendant (Alleyne) was convicted of using or carrying a firearm in a violent crime, which carried a mandatory minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment. However, the mandatory minimum would rise to seven years if the accused were found to have "brandished" the firearm during the crime, and to ten years if he had fired it. In the original trial, the judge (not the jury) determined that Alleyne had probably brandished the firearm during the robbery, which caused the mandatory minimum sentence to rise to seven years (which was the sentence imposed).

The Supreme Court found that the question of whether or not the accused had brandished his weapon during the robbery was not merely a "sentencing factor," which the judge could unilaterally decide, but an "ingredient of the offense," which must be assessed and decided upon by the jury. The Court also expressly overruled ''[[Harris v. United States]]'' (2002), which had reached a contrary ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiggin.com/14418|title=SUPREME COURT UPDATE: ALLEYNE V. UNITED STATES (11-9335) AND SALINAS V.

The '''anglerfish''' is a [[fish]] of the [[Teleostei|teleost]] [[order (biology)|order]] '''Lophiiformes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|f|i|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɔːr|m|iː|z}}).&lt;ref name="fishbase"&gt;{{FishBase order | order = Lophiiformes | month = February | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] named for its characteristic mode of [[predation]], in which a fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a [[Aggressive mimicry#Food as an attractant|lure]].

Some anglerfish are also notable for extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] and sexual [[Symbiotic|symbiosis]] of the small male with the much larger female, seen in the suborder Ceratioidei. In these species, males may be several [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than females.&lt;ref name="Pietsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietsch|first=Theodore W.|title=Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes)|journal=Ichthyological Research|date=25 August 2005|volume=52|issue=3|pages=207–236|doi=10.1007/s10228-005-0286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] (dwelling away from the sea floor), while others are [[Benthic zone|benthic]] (dwelling close to the sea floor); some live in the deep sea (e.g., [[Ceratiidae]]), while others on the [[continental shelf]] (e.g., the frogfishes [[Antennariidae]] and the monkfish/goosefish [[Lophiidae]]). Pelagic forms are most [[Anatomical terms of location|laterally]] compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorso]][[ventral]]ly compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.

== Evolution ==
A [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genome]] phylogenetic study suggested the anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the early to mid-[[Cretaceous]], between 130 and 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miya|first=M.|author2=T.

All anglerfish are [[carnivorous]] and are thus adapted for the capture of prey. Ranging in color from dark gray to dark brown, deep-sea species have large heads that bear enormous, crescent-shaped mouths full of long, fang-like teeth angled inward for efficient prey grabbing. Their length can vary from {{convert|8.0|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} to over {{convert|3|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with weights up to {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Anglerfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anglerfish|url=http://deepseacreatures.org/anglerfish|publisher=deepseacreatures.org|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frogfish and other shallow-water anglerfish species are ambush predators, and often appear camouflaged as rocks, sponges or seaweed. &lt;ref name="Camouflage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Camouflage|url=https://www.frogfish.ch/frogfish-camouflage.html|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most adult female ceratioid anglerfish have a luminescent organ called the '''esca''' at the tip of a modified dorsal ray (the '''illicium''', or "fishing rod"). The organ has been hypothesized to serve the obvious purpose of luring prey in dark, deep-sea environments, but also serves to call males' attention to the females to facilitate mating.

The source of luminescence is symbiotic bacteria that dwell in and around the esca, enclosed in a cup-shaped reflector containing crystals, probably consisting of [[guanine]]. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] rods that lack [[Bacterial capsule|capsules]], [[spore]]s, or [[Flagellum|flagella]]. They have double-layered cell walls and [[mesosome]]s. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the [[pH]] and [[tonicity]] of the [[culture medium]] to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the [[bathypelagic zone]] inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Day|first=William T.|title=Bacterial Luminescence in the Deep-Sea Anglerfish|year=1974|publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|location=LA|url=http://www.nhm.org/site/sites/default/files/pdf/contrib_science/CS255.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MunkHansen2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munk|first1=Ole|last2=Hansen|first2=Kjeld|last3=Herring|first3=Peter J.|title=On the Development and Structure of the Escal Light Organ of Some Melanocetid Deep Sea Anglerfishes (Pisces: Ceratioidei)|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|volume=78|issue=04|year=2009|pages=1321|issn=0025-3154|doi=10.1017/S0025315400044520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The light gland is always open to the exterior, so it is possible that the fish acquires the bacteria from the seawater. However, it appears that each species uses its own particular species of bacteria, and these bacteria have never been found in seawater. Haygood (1993) theorized that esca discharge bacteria during spawning and the bacteria are thereby transferred to the eggs.&lt;ref name="MunkHansen2009"/&gt;

In most species, a wide mouth extends all around the anterior circumference of the head, and bands of inwardly inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Angler|volume=2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anglerfish is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to twice as large as its entire body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anglerfish|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/group/anglerfish/|website=National Geographic|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==

=== Swimming and energy conservation ===

In 2005, near [[Monterey, California]], at 1474 metres depth, an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] filmed a female ceratioid anglerfish of the genus ''Oneirodes'' for 24 minutes. When approached, the fish retreated rapidly, but in 74% of the video footage, it drifted passively, oriented at any angle. When advancing, it swam intermittently at a speed of 0.24 body lengths per second, beating its pectoral fins in-phase. The lethargic behaviour of this [[ambush predator]] is suited to the energy-poor environment of the deep sea.&lt;ref name=Luck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luck|first=Daniel Garcia|author2=Pietsch, Theodore W.|title=Observations of a Deep-sea Ceratioid Anglerfish of the Genus Oneirodes (Lophiiformes: Oneirodidae)|journal=Copeia|date=4 June 2008|volume=2008|issue=2|pages=446–451|doi=10.1643/CE-07-075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another in situ observation of three different whipnose anglerfish showed unusual upside-down swimming behavior. Fish were observed floating upside-down completely motionless with the illicium hanging down stiffly in a slight arch in front of the fish. The illicium was hanging over small visible burrows. It was suggested this is an effort to entice prey and an example of low-energy opportunistic foraging and predation. When the ROV approached the fish, they exhibited burst swimming, still upside-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jon A.|title=Upside-Down Swimming Behavior in a Whipnose Anglerfish (Teleostei: Ceratioidei: Gigantactinidae)|journal=Copeia|date=31 December 2001|volume=2002|series=4|pages=1144–1146|jstor=1448539|doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2002)002[1144:udsbia]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jaw and stomach of the anglerfish can extend to allow it to consume prey up to twice its size. Because of the small amount of food available in the anglerfish's environment this adaptation allows the anglerfish to store food when there is an abundance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/anglerfish.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predation ===

The name "anglerfish" derives from the species' characteristic method of predation. Anglerfish typically have at least one long filament sprouting from the middle of their heads, termed the illicium. The illicium is the detached and modified first three spines of the [[anterior]] [[dorsal fin]]. In most anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first. This first spine protrudes above the fish's eyes and terminates in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca), and can move in all directions. Anglerfish can wiggle the esca to make it [[mimicry|resemble]] a prey animal, which lures the anglerfish's prey close enough for the anglerfish to devour them whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William John|title=The Behavior of Communicating: an ethological approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu2ML2rigZ4C&amp;pg=PA381|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04379-4|page=381|quote=Others rely on the technique adopted by a wolf in sheep's clothing—they mimic a harmless species. ... Other predators even mimic their prey's prey: angler fish (Lophiiformes) and alligator snapping turtles ''Macroclemys temmincki'' can wriggle fleshy outgrowths of their fins or tongues and attract small predatory fish close to their mouths.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deep-sea anglerfish of the [[Bathyal zone|bathypelagic zone]] emit light from their [[esca]] to attract prey. This [[bioluminescence]] is a result of [[symbiosis]] with [[bacterium|bacteria]]. The mechanism that ceratioids use to harness them is unknown, but researchers speculate that the bacteria enter the esca through small pores from seawater. Once inside, they multiply until their density is sufficient to produce a bright collective glow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because anglerfish are opportunistic foragers, they show a range of preferred prey with fish at the extremes of the size spectrum, whilst showing increased selectivity for certain prey. One study examining the stomach contents of threadfin anglerfish off the Pacific coast of Central America found these fish primarily ate two categories of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] prey: [[crustaceans]] and [[Teleostei|teleost]] fish. The most frequent prey were [[Pandalidae|pandalid shrimp]]. 52% of the stomachs examined were empty, supporting the observations that anglerfish are low energy consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Espinoza|first=Mario|author2=Ingo Wehrtmann|title=Stomach content analyses of the threadfin anglerfish ''Lophiodes spilurus'' (Lophiiformes: Lophiidae) associated with deepwater shrimp fisheries from the central Pacific of Costa Rica|journal=Revista de Biología Tropical|year=2008|volume=56|series=4|url=http://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?pid=S0034-77442008000400029&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt|accessdate=4 October 2013|doi=10.15517/rbt.v56i4.5772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Hamol u0.gif|thumb|[[Linophrynidae]]: ''[[Haplophryne mollis]]'' female anglerfish with males attached]]
[[File:Antennarius striatus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Antennariidae]]: [[striated frogfish]], ''Antennarius striatus'']]

Some anglerfish, like those of the [[Ceratiidae]], or sea devils employ an unusual mating method.&lt;ref name="SR-20180323"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gorey |first=Colm |title=Scientists stunned to capture first mating footage of bizarre anglerfish |url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/bizarre-anglerfish-mating-video |date=23 March 2018 |work=SiliconRepublic.com |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because individuals are locally rare, encounters are also very rare. Therefore, finding a mate is problematic. When scientists first started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all of the specimens were female. These individuals were a few centimetres in size and almost all of them had what appeared to be [[Parasitism|parasites]] attached to them. It turned out that these "parasites" were highly reduced male ceratioids. This indicates some taxa of anglerfish use a [[polyandry|polyandrous]] mating system.

Certain ceratioids rely on [[parabiosis|parabiotic]] reproduction. Free-living males and unparasitized females in these species never have fully developed gonads. Thus, males never mature without attaching to a female, and die if they cannot find one.&lt;ref name=Pietsch /&gt;  At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed [[Olfactory system|olfactory organs]]&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes |year=1983 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=0-393-01716-8 |page=30 |quote=ceratioid males develop gigantic nostrils...relative to body size, some ceratioids have larger nasal organs than any other vertebrate }}&lt;/ref&gt; that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioid lives solely to find and mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, growth of the [[Gut (anatomy)|alimentary canals]] of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture.&lt;ref name="gould" /&gt; These features mean the male must quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the [[pheromone]]s that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish.

However, the methods anglerfish use to locate mates vary. Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by smell.&lt;ref name=Pietsch /&gt;  When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level.&lt;ref name="gould" /&gt; The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings.&lt;ref name=Pietsch /&gt;  This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures that when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

Symbiosis is not the only method of reproduction in anglerfish. In fact, many families, including the [[Melanocetidae]], [[Himantolophidae]], [[Diceratiidae]], and [[Gigantactinidae]], show no evidence of male symbiosis.&lt;ref name="Pietsch72" /&gt; Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws that are far more effective in hunting than those seen in symbiotic species.&lt;ref name=Pietsch72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietsch|first=Theodore W.|title=A Review of the Monotypic Deep-Sea Anglerfish Family Centrophrynidae: Taxonomy, Distribution and Osteology|journal=Copeia|date=8 March 1972|volume=1972|issue= 1|pages=17–47|jstor=1442779|doi=10.2307/1442779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, sexual symbiosis may be an optional strategy in some species of anglerfishes.&lt;ref name="Pietsch" /&gt; In the [[Oneirodidae]], females carrying symbiotic males have been reported in ''Leptacanthichthys'' and ''Bertella''—and others that were not still developed fully functional gonads.&lt;ref name="Pietsch" /&gt; One theory suggests the males attach to females regardless of their own reproductive development if the female is not sexually mature, but when both male and female are mature, they spawn then separate.&lt;ref name=Pietsch /&gt;

One explanation for the [[evolution]] of sexual symbiosis is that the relatively low density of females in deep-sea environments leaves little opportunity for mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate [[fecundity]], as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female, then symbiotic attachment is ultimately more likely to improve lifetime fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to symbiosis is that the male’s sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he stays always available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate [[facultative]] symbiosis or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miya|first=Masaki|author2=Pietsch, Theodore W |author3=Orr, James W |author4=Arnold, Rachel J |author5=Satoh, Takashi P |author6=Shedlock, Andrew M |author7=Ho, Hsuan-Ching |author8=Shimazaki, Mitsuomi |author9=Yabe, Mamoru |author10= Nishida, Mutsumi |title=Evolutionary history of anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes): a mitogenomic perspective|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=1|page=58|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-58|pmid=20178642|pmc=2836326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spawn of the anglerfish of the genus ''[[Lophius]]'' consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide and greater than {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, E. E. 1891. Notes on the development of the angler-fish (''Lophius piscatorius''). Ninth Annual Report of the Fishery Board for Scotland (1890), Part III: 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own cavity. The spawn is free in the sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins elongated into filaments.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Such an egg sheet is rare among fish.

Northwest European ''[[Lophius]]'' species are listed by the [[International Conference on Environmental Systems|ICES]] as "outside safe biological limits".&lt;ref name="Clover2004"&gt;{{cite book |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |last=Clover |first=Charles |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, anglerfish are known to occasionally rise to the surface during [[El Niño]], leaving large groups of dead anglerfish floating on the surface.&lt;ref name="Clover2004" /&gt;

In 2010, [[Greenpeace]] International added the American angler (''[[Lophius americanus]]''), the angler (''[[Lophius piscatorius]]''), and the black-bellied angler (''[[Lophius budegassa]]'') to its seafood red list—a list of fish commonly sold worldwide with a high likelihood of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=20 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commons category|Anglerfish dishes}}

One family, the [[Lophiidae]], is of commercial interest with fisheries found in western Europe, eastern North America, Africa, and East Asia. In Europe and North America, the tail meat of fish of the genus ''Lophius'', known as monkfish or goosefish (North America), is widely used in cooking, and is often compared to [[lobster]] tail in taste and texture. In Asia, especially Korea and Japan, monkfish liver, known as ''[[ankimo]]'', is considered a delicacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allthesea.com/Deep-Sea-Fish-Goosefish.html | title=Goosefish | publisher=All the Sea | accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-communist mass killings''' are the political [[mass murder]]s of [[communist]]s, alleged communists, or their alleged supporters by people, political organizations or governments [[Anti-communism|opposed to communism]].

The [[Communist movement]] has faced opposition since it was founded and this opposition has often been organized and violent.

== White Terror ==
{{further|First White Terror|White Terror (disambiguation)}}

White Terror is a term coined during the [[French revolution]] in 1795 to denote the counter-revolutionary violence however unorganized it was. Since then, White Terror has been used by both historians and individual groups to mean coordinated counter-revolutionary violence in a broader sense. In the course of history, many White Terror groups have prosecuted, attacked and killed communists, alleged communists and sympathizers as part of their counter-revolutionary and anti-communist agendas.

As a [[sociology|sociological phenomena]], German sociologist [[Klaus Theweleit]] grounds his analysis of "white terror" in male sexual terror against female sexuality, and the psychological conflation of communism with the sexual woman.&lt;ref&gt;Male Fantasies.

The [[Shanghai massacre]] of 12 April 1927 was a violent suppression of [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) organizations in [[Shanghai]] by the military forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s conservative faction in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). Following the incident, the latter carried out a full-scale purge of communists in all areas under their control and even more violent suppressions occurred in cities such as [[Guangzhou]] and [[Changsha]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, Nationalist Revolution 114&lt;/ref&gt; The purge led to an open split between the left- and right-wings of the KMT, with Chiang Kai-shek establishing himself as the leader of the right-wing at [[Nanjing]] in opposition to the original left-wing KMT government led by [[Wang Jingwei]] in [[Wuhan]].

Before dawn on 12 April, gang members began to attack district offices controlled by the union workers, including [[Zhabei]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]] and [[Pudong]]. Under an emergency decree, Chiang ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias, which resulted in more than 300 people being killed and wounded. The union workers organized a [[mass meeting]] to denounce Chiang on 13 April and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more. Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control and he reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the Kuomintang under the control of Du Yuesheng. Over 1,000 communists were arrested, some 300 were executed and more than 5,000 went missing. Western news reports later nicknamed General Bai "The Hewer of Communist Heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Nationalist Notes|newspaper=TIME|date=25 June 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[National Revolutionary Army]] commanders with communist backgrounds who were graduates of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] kept their sympathies hidden and were not arrested and many of them switched their allegiance to the communists after the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jung Chang and Jon Halliday | title = Mao, The Unknown Story | publisher = Random House | year = 2005 | location = New York | url =  | isbn = 0-224-07126-2}} (this book is controversial for its anti-Mao tone and references).&lt;/ref&gt;

The twin rival KMT governments, known as the [[Nanjing–Wuhan split]] (Chinese: 宁汉分裂), did not last long because the [[Wuhan government|Wuhan Kuomintang]] also began to violently purge Communists as well after its leader Wang found out about [[Joseph Stalin]]'s secret order to [[Mikhail Borodin]] that the CPC's efforts were to be organized so it could overthrow the left-wing KMT and take over the Wuhan government. More than 10,000 communists in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Xiamen]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Ningbo]], [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]] and [[Changsha]] were arrested and executed within 20 days. The Soviet Union officially terminated its cooperation with the KMT and Wang, fearing retribution as a communist sympathizer, fled to [[Europe]]. The Wuhan Nationalist government soon disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Kuomintang. In a year, over 300,000 people were killed across China in the suppression campaigns carried out by the KMT.&lt;ref name="Barnouin38"&gt;Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

=== Chinese Civil War ===
During the civil war between the [[Kuomintang]] and the Communists, both factions committed mass violence against civilian populations and even against their own armies, with the aim of obtaining hegemony over China. During the civil war, the Kuomintang anti-Communist faction killed 1,131,000 soldiers before entering combat during its conscription campaigns. In addition, the Kuomintang faction massacred 1 million civilians during the civil war.&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web|last1=R.J.Rummel|title=CHINA'S BLOODY CENTURY|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|El Mozote massacre}}

The [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1979–1992) was a conflict between the [[military]]-led government of [[El Salvador]] and a coalition of five left-wing guerrilla organizations that was known collectively as the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN). A coup on 15 October 1979 led to the killings of anti-coup protesters by the government as well as anti-disorder protesters by the guerrillas and it is widely seen as the tipping point toward civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Elizabeth|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1980, the left-wing political organizations united to form the Coordinated Revolutionaries of the Masses (CRM). A few months later, the left-wing armed groups united to form the Unified Revolutionary Directorate (DRU). It was renamed the FMLN&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, El Salvador, In Depth: Negotiating a settlement to the conflict, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=51&amp;regionSelect=4-Central_Americas#, viewed on 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; following its merger with the [[Communist Party of El Salvador|Communist Party]] in October 1980.

The full-fledged civil war lasted for more than 12 years and saw extreme violence from both sides. It also included the deliberate terrorizing and targeting of civilians by [[death squads]], the recruitment of [[child soldiers]] and other violations of [[human rights]], mostly by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Larsen|first=Neil|editor-first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=Thoughts on Violence and Modernity in Latin America|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|isbn=|pages=381–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of people "disappeared" during the conflict and the United Nations reports that more than 75,000 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html "Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador"] United Nations, 1 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The United States contributed to the conflict by providing large amounts of military aid to the government of El Salvador during the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, El Salvador, In Depth: Negotiating a settlement to the conflict, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=51&amp;regionSelect=4-Central_Americas#, "While nothing of the aid delivered from the US in 1979 was earmarked for security purposes the 1980 aid for security only summed US$6,2 million, close to two-thirds of the total aid in 1979", viewed on 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administrations.

== Germany ==
German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of [[Nazism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007332 Non-Jewish Resistance], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were also among the first to be sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] termed "[[Judeo-Bolshevism]]". Fear of communist agitation was used to justify the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the law which gave Hitler [[plenary powers]]. [[Hermann Göring]] later testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] that the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists prompted President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis. The first concentration camp was built at Dachau in March 1933 to imprison German communists, socialists, trade unionists and others opposed to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;"Horrors of Auschwitz", Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, 27 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Communists, social democrats and other [[political prisoner]]s were forced to wear a [[Nazi concentration camp badges|red triangle]].

In 1936, Germany concluded an international agreement with Japan to fight [[Comintern]]. After the German assault on communist Russia in 1941, the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] was renewed, now with many new signatories from the occupied states across Europe and also Turkey and El Salvador. Thousands of communists from the German occupied territory were arrested and subsequently deported to German [[death camp]]s. Whenever the Nazis conquered a new territory, members of communist, socialist and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups were normally the first persons to be detained or executed right away. On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], evidence of this practise is found in Hitler's infamous [[Commissar Order]] in which he ordered the [[summary execution]] of all political [[commissar]]s captured among Soviet soldiers as well as the execution of all [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] members in German held territory.&lt;ref&gt;"The war that time forgot", ''The Guardian'', 5 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007454|title=Commissar Order|author=|date=|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Einsatzgruppen]] carried out these executions in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hitchens, [http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2008/04/the-gathering-s.html The Gathering Storm], 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Massacres, forced disappearances, torture and summary executions of guerrillas and especially civilian collaborators of the communist{{sfn|McAllister2010|pp=280-281}} [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor]] at the hands of United States-backed security forces had been widespread since 1965. It was a longstanding policy of the military regime and known by United States officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/group-files-show-u-s-knew-guatemala-abuses-article-1.368198 Group says files show U.S. knew of Guatemala abuses].

The repression reached genocidal levels in the predominantly indigenous northern provinces where guerrillas of the [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor]] operated. There, the Guatemalan military viewed the Maya, traditionally seen as subhumans, as being supportive of the guerillas and began a campaign of wholesale killings and disappearances of Mayan peasants. While massacres of Indigenous peasants had occurred earlier in the war, the systematic use of terror against the Indigenous population began around 1975 and peaked during the first half of the 1980s. An estimated 200,000 Guatemalan civilians were killed during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] &amp;ndash; 93% by government forces &amp;ndash; including at least 40,000 persons who "disappeared". Of the 42,275 individual cases of killing and "disappearances" documented by the CEH, 83% of the victims were Maya and 17% [[Ladino people|Ladino]] meaning that by applying these proportions to the estimated 200,000 civilians killed and disappeared in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] overall it can be inferred that up to 166,000 [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and 34,000 [[Ladino people|Ladino]] were killed or disappeared in the genocide.&lt;ref name ="GHCC"&gt;83% of the "fully identified" 42,275 civilians killed by human rights violations during the Guatemalan Civil War were Mayan and 17% Ladino.

A violent anti-Communist purge took place shortly after [[30 September Movement|an abortive coup]] in the capital of [[Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]], which was blamed on the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).

The killings started in October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East [[Java]] and later to [[Bali]] and smaller outbreaks occurred on parts of other islands,&lt;ref name="Cribb 1990, p. 3"&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Sumatra]]. As the [[Sukarno]] presidency began to unravel and [[Suharto]] began to assert control following the coup attempt, the PKI's upper national leaders were hunted down and arrested and some of them were summarily executed and the [[Indonesian Air Force]] in particular was a target of the purge. The party chairman [[Aidit|Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had flown to [[Central Java]] in early October, where the coup attempt had been supported by leftist officers in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Salatiga]] and [[Semarang]].&lt;ref name="Vicker_157"&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow senior party leader [[Njoto]] was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November and First Deputy PKI Chairman [[Lukman|M.H.

== Spain ==
In [[Spain]], the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] (or the "Francoist Repression") refers to the atrocities committed by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] as well as the atrocities that were committed afterwards during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="beevor"&gt;[[Beevor, Antony]].

== Thailand ==
The Thai military government and its [[Internal Security Operations Command|Communist Suppression Operations Command]] (CSOC), helped by the [[Royal Thai Army]], the [[Royal Thai Police]] and paramilitary [[vigilante]]s, reacted with drastic measures to the [[communist insurgency in Thailand|insurgency]] of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] during the 1960s and 1970s. The anti-communist operations peaked between 1971 and 1973 during the rule of Field Marshal [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] and General [[Praphas Charusathien]]. According to official figures, 3,008 suspected communists were killed throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Jularat101"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jularat Damrongviteetham |title=Narratives of the "Red Barrel" Incident: Collective and Individual Memories in Lamsin, Southern Thailand |work=Oral History in Southeast Asia: Memories and Fragments |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2013 |pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative estimates are much higher. These civilians were usually [[extrajudicial killing|killed without any judicial proceedings]].

A prominent example was the so-called [[Red Drum killings|"Red Drum" or "Red Barrel" killings]] of Lam Sai, [[Phatthalung Province]], Southern Thailand, where more than 200 civilians&lt;ref name="Jularat101"/&gt; (informal accounts speak of up to 3,000)&lt;ref name="Haberkorn186"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tyrell Haberkorn |title=Getting Away with Murder in Thailand: State Violence and Impunity in Phatthalung |work=State Violence in East Asia |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=2013 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zipple91"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Matthew Zipple |title=Thailand’s Red Drum Murders Through an Analysis of Declassified Documents |journal=Southeast Review  of Asian Studies |volume=36 |year=2014 |page=91 |url=http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2014/6Zipple.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were accused of helping the communists were burned in red 200-litre oil [[drum (container)|drums]], sometimes after having been killed to dispose of their bodies and sometimes [[death by burning|burned alive]].&lt;ref name="Zipple91"/&gt; The incident was never thoroughly investigated and none of the perpetrators was brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tyrell Haberkorn |title=Getting Away with Murder in Thailand |year=2013 |pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of civilian rule following the [[1973 Thai popular uprising|October 1973 popular uprising]], at least 46 leftist students and activists who had gathered on and around Bangkok's [[Thammasat University massacre|Thammasat University campus were massacred]] by police and right-wing paramilitaries on 6 October 1976. They had been accused of supporting communism. The mass killing followed a campaign of violently anti-communist propaganda by right-wing politicians, media and clerics, exemplified by the Buddhist monk Phra Kittiwuttho's claim that killing communists was not sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Chris Baker |authorlink1=Chris Baker (writer) |author2=Pasuk Pongphaichit |authorlink2=Pasuk Phongpaichit |title=A History of Thailand |edition=Second |publisher=Ocford University Press |year=2009 |pages=191–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Thongchai Winichakul |authorlink=Thongchai Winichakul |title=Remembering/Silencing the Traumatic Past: The Ambivalent Memories of the October 1976 Massacre in Bangkok |work=Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[de jure]]'' '''independence of Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|Независимост на България}}, ''Nezavisimost na Balgaria'') from the [[Ottoman Empire]] was [[Declaration of independence|proclaimed]] on {{OldStyleDate|5 October|1908|22 September}} in the old capital of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] by [[List of Bulgarian rulers|Prince]] [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], who afterwards took the title "[[Tsar]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.

==Background==
[[Bulgaria]] had been a widely autonomous [[Principality of Bulgaria|principality]] since  {{OldStyleDate|3 March|1878|19 February}}, when it was [[liberation of Bulgaria|liberated from Ottoman rule]] in the wake of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]]. Although it was still technically under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Sublime Porte]], this was a [[legal fiction]] that Bulgaria only acknowledged in a formal way.  It acted largely as a  ''[[de facto]]'' independent state.  On {{OldStyleDate|18 September|1885|6 September}}, it had [[unification of Bulgaria|unified with]] the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]]-majority Ottoman autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]]. 

After the liberation, Bulgaria's main external goal was the unification of all Bulgarian-inhabited areas under foreign rule into a single Bulgarian state: the main targets of Bulgarian [[irredentism]] were [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and southern [[Thrace]], which continued to be part of the Ottoman realm. In order to join an anti-Ottoman alliance and claim those territories by war, however, Bulgaria had to proclaim its independence first. This would constitute a violation of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]'s terms, an act unlikely to be approved by the [[Great Powers]].

The chaos that ensued in the Ottoman Empire following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 provided suitable conditions for the Bulgarian proclamation of independence. Many of the Great Powers had also abandoned their support for the Ottomans, looking for territorial gains instead: [[Austria-Hungary]] was [[Bosnian crisis|hoping to annex]] the [[Bosnia Vilayet]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] was looking to seize the empire's [[Arabs|Arab]] territories in the east, and the [[Russian Empire]]'s main target was control over the [[Turkish Straits]]. In September 1908 at a meeting in [[Buchlov]] ({{lang-de|Buchlau}}, contemporary [[Czech Republic]]), envoys of Austria-Hungary and Russia supported each other's plans and agreed not to hinder Bulgaria's proclamation of independence which was likely to take place.

Towards the middle of September, the democratic government of [[Aleksandar Malinov]] had decided that the suitable moment was near. {{OldStyleDate|4 October|1908|21 September}}, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] arrived at [[Rousse]] from a break in his Hungarian mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last= Miller |first= William |author-link= William Miller (historian) |title= The Ottoman Empire and its Successors, 1801-1922 |year= 1923 |place= Cambridge |publisher= At the University Press |url= https://archive.org/stream/ottomanempireitsmill#page/478 |page= 478 |edition= 2nd |accessdate= 22 September 2018  |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awaited there by the government to discuss the final decision on board the ''Krum'' ship. The delegation then took the train to Tarnovo, where the official proclamation would take place. According to recent research,{{huh|date=June 2017}} it was at the [[Dve Mogili]] [[railway station]] that the [[manifesto]] of independence was completed on {{OldStyleDate|5 October|1908|22 September}}.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Independence==
The independence of Bulgaria was formally proclaimed at the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]] in Tarnovo. As part of the proclamation, Ferdinand raised Bulgaria from a principality to a [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|kingdom]], increasing its international prestige. Ferdinand changed his title from knyaz (prince) to tsar (king), and the country would be ready to join the Balkan League and fight the Ottoman Empire in the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–1913.

Bulgaria's declaration of independence was followed by Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia the following day and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]'s union with the [[Cretan State]] (unrecognized until 1913). With the two countries' joint violation of the Treaty of Berlin and the dominant support among European countries, the independence of Bulgaria was internationally recognized by the spring of 1909. The Ottoman Empire did not demand any financial compensation from Bulgaria, which took over the railways run by the [[Oriental Railway Company]] and the taxes in Eastern Rumelia. Russia cancelled forty years of payments the Ottomans owed on the indemnity for the war of 1877–78. This amounted to 125,000,000 [[francs]] (out of a total indemnity of 802,000,000 francs). In turn Bulgaria agreed to transfer its tribute payments—85,000,000 francs over 85 years—to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bodger, "Russia and the End of the Ottoman Empire", in Marian Kent (ed.), ''Great Powers and the End of the Ottoman Empire'' (London: Frank Cass, 1996), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''de jure'' independence is celebrated annually on 22 September as Bulgaria's [[Independence Day]]. On 22 September 2008, Bulgaria celebrated the centenary of its independence.

'''''Codex''''' was a [[game show]] that aired on [[Channel 4]] from 12 November 2006 to 15 December 2007 and was hosted by [[Tony Robinson]].

==Format==
===Series 1===
In the first series, a single team of five explorers solve a series of games in order to win letters that may help them solve a 'codex', an encoded cryptic clue, at the end of the programme.

Before each round, Tony shows the team one or more historical artefacts and gives some background to the objects. The team is then asked to answer seven questions relating to the artefacts in three minutes. If they succeed then two of the symbols of the codex are replaced with the two letters they represent; this is shown to the viewers but not to the team until later in the programme.

Between each round (except after round two) there is a head-to-head challenge where the team is posed a question with a numerical answer. They are each given a numeric keypad, and the person who is furthest from the correct answer is eliminated.

At the end of the show the four people eliminated in the head-to-heads work together to try and decode the codex using the revealed letters. They have three minutes in which to do this, and when they have finished they should have revealed a cryptic clue.

The surviving team member then enters the museum's Reading Room where they are presented with five more artefacts. They must solve the cryptic clue (or whatever the others managed to decipher) to identify what they think is the correct item. They have one minute in which to make their choice. They then take the small box located next to the item back outside. Inside this box is a glass cube revealing whether or not they have won.

The Codex clue describes which of the five artefacts is correct as well as which ones to avoid. Sometimes the clue can be cryptic - for example, in one programme the term "I'm buttercup" referred to a vessel (cup) in the form of a male sheep (ram being an animal that's a 'butter' - i.e. butts things). Similar [[cryptic crossword]]-style tricks are meant to lead the solvers astray - e.g. is the word "lead" meant to be pronounced as in the metal or a dog lead?

===Series 2===
The second series, which began airing on 10 November 2007, employs a new format. Two teams of three answer questions for ten points (with some bonus questions and challenges being worth more), the teams remain in one location with only two rounds where one member each goes off to an artefact, there is no codex to solve at the end, and the questions no longer relate to a common period in history. Victory is decided on points alone. The prize is £3,000 and a trophy. The format for each round is as follows:

# '''Round 1''': There are 10 questions worth 10 points each. Play alternates between the teams and they are allowed to confer.
# '''Round 2''': A buzzer round. One player from each team is nominated to go to an artefact while the rest of the team answers questions for 10 points each. Incorrectly answered questions are passed to the other team, and for every two correct answers the third member is given a bonus question on the artefact for 20 points. There are 5 bonus questions and the round is over when they have all been answered.
# '''Round 3''': "Instant expert" round. Earlier in the day the teams are given identical information packs on a particular artefact and had 1 hour in the museum's library to memorise as many facts as possible. Questions are answered individually, and after each question the contestant is read the next question but then nominates an opponent to answer it, the exception being the first question which is given to the captain of the losing team. There are 5 questions per team and they are worth 10 points each.
# '''Round 4''': One player from each team is nominated to go to an artefact. They each have 60 seconds to try to guess the eight predetermined key words that describe the artefact. Each word is worth 10 points.
# '''Final Round''': A timed round for each team in turn with play cycling between the team members. When the questions begin the team's score begins to count down and the goal is to give five correct answers before their score reaches zero. The team with the most points left is the ultimate victor.

The '''Common Reporting Standard''' (CRS) is an information standard for the '''Automatic Exchange Of Information''' ('''AEOI''') regarding bank accounts on a global level, between tax authorities, which the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) developed in 2014.

Its purpose is to combat [[tax evasion]]. The idea was based on the US [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) implementation agreements and its legal basis is the [[Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters]]. 97 countries had signed an agreement to implement it, with more countries intending to sign later. First reporting occurred in 2017, with many of the rest starting in 2018.

==History==
Until 2014, the parties to most treaties for sharing assets, incomes and tax information internationally had shared it ''upon request'', which was not effective in preventing tax evasion.&lt;ref name=DFBS/&gt;

===2014 declaration===
In May 2014, forty-seven countries tentatively agreed on a "common reporting standard", formally referred to as the ''Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information'': an agreement to share information on residents' assets and incomes automatically in conformation with the standard.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://profwilliambyrnes.com/2014/05/10/47-countries-endorse-oecds-gatca-crs/ 47 Countries Endorse OECD’s GATCA] profwilliambyrnes.com, 10 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsing countries included all 34 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]], as well as Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Africa.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In September 2014, the [[G-20 major economies]], at their meeting in [[Cairns|Cairns, Australia]], issued a G20 Common Reporting Standard implementation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g20australia.org/sites/default/files/g20_resources/library/15%20Common%20Reporting%20Standard%20Implementation%20Plan.pdf Common Reporting Standard Implementation Plan]{{dead link|date=September 2018}} g20australia.org, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The new system was intended to transfer all relevant information automatically and systematically. The agreement has informally been referred to as GATCA (the global version of [[FATCA]])",&lt;ref name=DFBS&gt;[http://www.dbfs.co.uk/knowledge/white-papers/oecd-crs-global-fatca/ DBFS Consultants: "OECD's CRS is like a Global FATCA"] www.dbfs.co.uk, DBFS Financial Consultancy Services, n.d. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "CRS is not just an extension of FATCA".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbfs.co.uk/about/news/march-2015-crs-common-reporting-standard-is-co/ DBFS Consultants: timeline and structure of FATCA and CRS] www.dbfs.co.uk, DBFS Financial Consultancy Services, March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement, 2014-present ===
{{As of|October 2014}}, 51 countries had signed up to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), to automatically exchange information based on Article 6 of the [[Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1628574/china-hong-kong-committed-global-alliance-end-banking-secrecy China, Hong Kong committed to global alliance to end banking secrecy] scmp.com, South China Morning Post, 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement specifies the details of what information will be exchanged and when, as set out in the Standard.&lt;ref name=thebanks&gt;"[https://thebanks.eu/articles/automatic-exchange-of-information-on-financial-accounts Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts]". The Banks.eu, 21 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |July 2015}}, 53 jurisdictions had signed the agreement to automatically exchange information;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/automaticexchange.htm Automatic Exchange of Information] OECD , n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of |July 2016}} 83 jurisdictions had signed the agreement.&lt;ref name=thebanks/&gt;

All [[European Union]] (EU) countries, China, India, Hong Kong, Russia and 109 countries altogether have agreed{{when|date=June 2017}} to become signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/united-arab-emirates-become-the-109th-jurisdiction-to-join-the-most-powerful-multilateral-treaty-against-offshore-tax-evasion-and-avoidance.htm The United Arab Emirates become the 109th jurisdiction to join the most powerful multilateral treaty against offshore tax evasion and avoidance] OECD press release, 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many countries will not participate in the automatic information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebanks.eu/articles/countries-which-will-not-automatically-exchange-account-information Countries Which Will Not Automatically Exchange Account Information] TheBanks.eu, an independent Internet project about banking services in European countries and their dependent territories to help potential investors to find a bank satisfying their requirements, 8 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those that have not signed are small countries. In April 2016, shortly after the release of the [[Panama Papers|Panama papers]], Panama agreed to comply with the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/panama-agrees-to-adopt-global-tax-reporting-standards/a-19190015|title=Panama agrees to adopt global tax reporting standards|last=|first=|date=15 April 2016|website=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jan 2018, Panama has signed the MCAA at the OECD headquarters in Paris and become the 98th jurisdiction joining CRS MCAA. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/news/panama-joins-international-tax-co-operation-efforts-to-end-bank-secrecy.htm|title=Panama joins international tax co-operation efforts to end bank secrecy|last=|first=|date=15 Jan 2018|website=OECD|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US position is unusual. It has not signed this specific treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/world/20151215/1031781550/us-becoming-offshore.html Is US Becoming World’s Leading Offshore Territory?] Sputnik News, 15.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. receives information relating to US citizens' accounts from many countries due to the compliance requirements of the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act#Intergovernmental agreements|FATCA]] act. The United States, in many cases, will reciprocate by sharing banking data with countries for accounts which their citizens hold in the U.S.&lt;ref name="treasury.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Treasury FATCA Resource Center|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information exchanged==
The information and its exchange format are governed by a detailed standard, whose details are listed in a 44 page long document.&lt;ref name="crs reporting standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Reporting Standard (CRS) User Guide and Schema|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/schema-and-user-guide/|publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each participating country will annually automatically exchange with the other country the below information in the case of Jurisdiction A with respect to each Jurisdiction B reportable account, and in the case of Jurisdiction B with respect to each Jurisdiction A reportable account:&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/Automatic-Exchange-Financial-Account-Information-Common-Reporting-Standard.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514041621/http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/automatic-exchange-financial-account-information-common-reporting-standard.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-14 |df= }} OECD&lt;/ref&gt;
# Name, address, [[Taxpayer Identification Number]] and date and place of birth of each Reportable Person. 
# Account number 
# Name and identifying number of the reporting financial institution;
# Account balance or value as of the end of the relevant calendar year (or other appropriate reporting period) or at its closure, if the account was closed.
# Capital gains, depending on the type of the account (dividends, interest, gross proceeds/redemptions, other)

===Reportable accounts===
OECD allows the participating countries to determine what accounts are reportable. "The term "reportable account" means a [Jurisdiction A] reportable account or a [Jurisdiction B] reportable account, depending on the context, provided it has been identified as such pursuant to due diligence procedures, consistent with the Annex, in place in [Jurisdiction A] or [Jurisdiction B]."&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

This means that either jurisdiction may negotiate and determine its own reportable accounts in its agreement.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example, the United States, with its citizenship-based taxation, has established in its [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act#Intergovernmental agreements|FATCA Intergovernmental Agreements]] that, accounts held by US citizens and [[United States person#Taxation|US Persons for Tax purposes]] in the other country's jurisdiction need to be reported via [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act|FATCA]].

== Participants==
The European Union adopted the CRS on 1 January 2016 after amending the part on administrative cooperation re taxation. First reporting was planned for September 2017.

=== Non CRS countries participating in global transparency for tax purposes ===

Of the 154 countries which have signed on the [[Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/about-the-global-forum/members/ The 142 members of the Global Forum are:] OECD, n.d. retrieved 28 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; the following countries have not yet signed on to the CRS:&lt;ref name="oecd.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/crs-by-jurisdiction/#d.en.345489|title=CRS by jurisdiction - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Incomplete list as of June 2017) Armenia, Azerbaijan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Gabon, Georgia, Guatemala, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya, Kingdom of Lesotho, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Moldova, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Macedonia, Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United States.&lt;ref name="oecd.org1"/&gt;

==Reactions==
===Private sector===
In 2016, a legal expert complained that "The CRS has a much more ambitious scope, however, and modelling the standard on the FATCA rules has created problems for implementing it in Europe".&lt;ref name="noseda"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Noseda | first1=Filippo | title=Comment:Privacy v transparency - Withers' Noseda on incoming OECD tax rules opening a new battle front| url=http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/5390-comment-privacy-v-transparency-withers-noseda-on-how-the-incoming-oecd-tax-rules-opening-a-new-battle-front | publisher = legalbusiness.co.uk | accessdate=16 February 2016 |date=February 15, 2016|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a "private sector advocacy group representing financial services and law firms" went even further seeing a "showdown" between the two regimes.&lt;ref name="Burggraf"&gt;{{cite news | last1= Burggraf | first1=Helen  | title= US and OECD showdown seen looming over CRS | url=http://www.internationalinvestment.net/regions/us-and-oecd-showdown-seen-looming-over-crs/ | publisher=internationalinvestment.net/|accessdate=26 March 2016|date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Transparency groups have reacted in various ways, some of them criticising how developing countries were (not) considered and involved.&lt;ref name="icij.org"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |last1=Boland-Rudder|first1=Hamish|title=OECD’s plan to end bank secrecy blasted by activists|url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2014/07/oecds-plan-end-bank-secrecy-blasted-activists|accessdate=24 July 2014|date=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting and providing information can be so costly and difficult for developing countries obviating participation in the scheme. Instead of offering a period of non-reciprocity, where developing countries could simply receive financial data, the only mention of non-reciprocity agreements is catering to [[tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name="icij.org"/&gt;

===Loopholes===
While [[tax haven]]s will have to provide some information, they can use a number of loopholes (unequal standards for how information is shared e.g.) and also elect not to receive any info in return.&lt;ref name="icij.org"/&gt; The [[Financial Transparency Coalition]] criticised the access cost of $73 to download [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]’s report itself, being "a perfect illustration of why this process needs to include low income countries from the start".&lt;ref name="icij.org"/&gt;

The OECD reviews investment mechanisms worldwide to identify risks in compliance and loopholes. It opened a website for [[Whistleblower|whistle-blowers]] to anonymously report CRS violations including for pensions, insurance, and citizenship-for-sale tools. The OECD has investigated and labeled specifically as "low-risk" an investment tool in [[Hong Kong]] called [[Mandatory Provident Fund (Hong Kong)|ORS (Occupational Retirement Scheme)]] which is classified as a "non-reporting financial institutions" and can be used to bypass CRS as it does not need reporting under CRS guidelines and can be used to effectively be like a [[Shell corporation|shell company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21722679-increasingly-popular-loophole-global-tax-compliance-regime-how-becoming|title=How becoming a Hong Kong pensioner can save you tax|website=The Economist|date=May 2017|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''classification scheme''' is the product of arranging things into kinds of things (classes) or into ''groups'' of classes.

In the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of [[metadata]],  often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for an arrangement or division of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common.

In [[linguistics]], [[subordinate]] concepts are described as [[hyponym]]s of their respective superordinates; typically, a hyponym is 'a kind of' its superordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Allan (2002, p. 260), Natural language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC 11179]] metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as [[data element]]s, in a [[metadata registry]].

Some quality criteria for classification schemes are:
* Whether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which makes that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset.
* Whether the classes have overlaps.
* Whether subordinates (may) have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate others don't. Multiple supertypes for one subtype implies that the subordinate has the combined characteristics of all its superordinates. This is called multiple inheritance (of characteristics from multiple superordinates to their subordinates).
* Whether the criteria for belonging to a class or group are well defined.
* Whether the kinds of relations between the concepts are made explicit and well defined.
* Whether subtype-supertype relations are distinguished from composition relations (part-whole relations) and from object-role relations.

==Benefits of using classification schemes==
Using one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits.  Some of these include:
* It allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group.
* It makes it easier to detect duplicate objects.
* It conveys [[semantics]] (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, which meaning is not conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling.
* Knowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to the members of the kind.

==Kinds of classification schemes==
The following are examples of different kinds of classification schemes.  This list is in approximate order from informal to more formal:
* [[thesaurus]] - a collection of categorized concepts, denoted by words or phrases, that are related to each other by narrower term, wider term and related term relations.
* [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] - a formal list of concepts, denoted by controlled words or phrases, arranged from abstract to specific, related by subtype-supertype relations or by superset-subset relations.
* [[data model]] - an arrangement of concepts (entity types), denoted by words or phrases, that have various kinds of relationships. Typically, but not necessarily, representing requirements and capabilities for a specific scope (application area).
* [[network (mathematics)]] - an arrangement of objects in a random graph.
* [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] - an arrangement of concepts that are related by various well defined kinds of relations. The arrangement can be visualized in a [[directed acyclic graph]].

One example of a classification scheme for [[data element]]s is a [[representation term]].

Represented by their respective products, [[VMware]] and [[Parallels, Inc.]] are the two commercial competitors in the [[Macintosh|Mac]] consumer [[platform virtualization]] market. Both products are based on [[hypervisor]] technology and allow users to run an additional 32- or 64-bit [[x86]] [[operating system]] in a [[virtual machine]] alongside [[Mac OS X]] on an [[Intel]]-powered Mac. The similarity in features and functionality between '''[[VMware Fusion]]''' and '''[[Parallels Desktop for Mac]]''' has given occasion for much comparison.

==2007 Benchmark tests==
On August 16, 2007, [[CNET]] published the results of several benchmarks&lt;ref name=cnet_benchmarks&gt;{{cite web |last=Begun |first=Daniel |title=Inside CNET Labs: Windows virtual machine performance on the Mac |url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9760910-1.html |publisher=CNET |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Fusion demonstrated better performance than Parallels Desktop for Mac in SMP-aware applications, which Fusion supports while Parallels does not.  It should also be noted that Boot Camp is a tool for natively booting Windows XP on Intel Macintosh and is not a virtualization product. This comparison is of limited value today, as Parallels Desktop has had 4 major upgrades and VMware Fusion has had 3.

[[File:Fusion chart01.png]] [[File:Fusion chart02.png]]

This comparison was tested on an eight-core, 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz MacPro running [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4.10]], Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac (build 4560) and VMware Fusion 1.0 (build 51348). Fusion and Parallels were both set to 1,024 MB of system memory and a 32 GB hard disk.  Fusion was set to 128 MB of graphics memory, and Parallels Desktop for Mac was set to 64 MB of graphics memory (the maximum for each at that time).&lt;ref name=cnet_benchmarks/&gt;

==2008 Benchmark tests==
In Volume 24, Issue 02 of [[MacTech]], the editors published the results of one-step and task tests between VMware Fusion 1.0, Parallels Desktop 3.0 and Boot Camp and used a PC running Windows XP as a baseline comparison in a native PC environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title=Virtualization Benchmarking How do Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, and VMware Fusion stack up? |accessdate= November 28, 2017 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.24/24.02/VirtualizationBenchmark/ |publisher=MacTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One-step Test: After clicking the mouse or pressing a key, this test requires no further human action.
* Task Test: This tests the interaction between Mac OS X and the virtual environment and requires multiple tests throughout the process.

MacTech found that the faster the physical host computer, the more similarly Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion performed. MacTech did not test multiple processor performance. The following graphs displays the results in seconds.  Shorter bars indicate faster performance.

[[File:Mactech---cross-platform.png]] [[File:mactech---network---file-io.png]]

Each test was run on a [[MacBook]] (2 GB RAM; 1.83&amp;nbsp;GHz Core Duo processor), a [[MacBook Pro]] (4&amp;nbsp;GB RAM; 2.16&amp;nbsp;GHz Core 2 Duo processor) and a [[Mac Pro]] (4&amp;nbsp;GB RAM; Quad Core configuration with two 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors).  MacTech tested Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac Build 5160 and VMware Fusion 1.0 Build 51348.
All tests were done on clean host systems with new installations of Mac OS X 10.4.10 and Office installations and included all of the most up-to-date patches.  No third party software was installed other than Mac OS X, VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop, [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]] and [[Microsoft Office]].

==2009 Benchmark tests==
In March, 2009, Volume 25, Issue 04, [[MacTech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neil|first1=Neil|title=Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion|url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/|website=MacTech|volume=25|issue=4|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests that compared the performance between VMware Fusion 2.0.1 and Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac (build 3540), both running [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.5.

In most of MacTech’s tests, Parallels Desktop performed 14-20% faster than Fusion; however, Fusion ran 10% faster than Parallels Desktop when running Windows XP 32-bit on 2 virtual processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neil|first1=Neil|title=Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion (cont.)|url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-001.html|website=MacTech|volume=25|issue=4|year=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tests were performed on the White [[MacBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], [[iMac]] and [[MacPro]].  Both Fusion and Parallels Desktop were optimized for virtual machine performance.  MacTech’s test included launch and [[CPU]] tests, File and Network IO, Footprint, Application Launch, Application Performance and 3D and HD Graphics.  In many cases, tests were performed after both Adam and Successful launches and were timed using a stopwatch.

'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''' 3D Games tested were [[Civilization IV]]: Colonization and [[Portal (video game)|Portal]].  In Civilization, Parallels Desktop has faster [[Frame rate|FPS]] (Frames Per Second) and performed better on slower machines while Fusion has better, more detailed graphics.  Fusion has difficulty showing the startup video, but Parallels Desktop's graphics are not as rich.  When running Portal, Fusion is faster but its graphics are visibly lighter, while Parallels Desktop has better graphics and visual details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ticktin|first1=Neil|title=Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion (cont.)|url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-003.html|website=MacTech|volume=25|issue=4|year=2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-platform task tests===
MacTech’s cross platform tests timed how long it took users to perform multi-step tasks that moved data between Mac OS X and Windows.  VMware Fusion, which is designed for increased isolation from the host, requires more manual steps to move data between the host and the virtual environment.  Parallels Desktop, which is designed to run transparently with the Mac OS X host, requires fewer steps to perform the same tasks.  Therefore, Parallels Desktop was faster.

===Networking and file I/O tests===
Parallels Desktop occasionally displayed lag anomalies while VMware Fusion's virtual drive performance was very close to that of a physical drive.  VMware Fusion preferred a bridged connection for reliable performance, and Parallels Desktop was consistent regardless of the type of virtual network adaptor used.

===Simultaneous use of VM and host OS===
Parallel Desktop 5 always uses wired memory for hosted OS, while VMWare Fusion 3.0 uses active memory that can be swapped. Giving better performance to hosted VM, this leaves less memory to host OS programs and causes more swapping if you use VM and host OS programs at the same time.

==2010 Benchmark tests==
In 2010 [[MacTech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title= Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion |accessdate= November 28, 2017 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/special/1002-VirtualizationHeadToHead/index-001.html|publisher=MacTech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 26, Issue 01, published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests showing a performance advantage for Parallels Desktop 5 across all subcategories, with an average of 30% faster.

ITPro's November 2010 performance testing results were mixed, with Parallels being slightly faster, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lu|first1=Alan|title=Head to Head: Parallels Desktop 6 vs VMware Fusion 3|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/628492/head-to-head-parallels-desktop-6-vs-vmware-fusion-3/page/0/3|website=ITPro|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 Benchmark tests==
In 2015 [[TekRevue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tanous |first=Jim |title=2015 VM Benchmarks: Parallels 11 vs. Fusion 8 vs. VirtualBox 5 |accessdate= November 28, 2017 |url=http://www.tekrevue.com/2015-vm-benchmarks-parallels-11-vs-fusion-8/ |publisher=TekRevue}}&lt;/ref&gt; published the results of an extensive series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests showing a performance advantage for VMware Fusion 8, across most subcategories, and in particular the 3D ones.

Quoting: "If you look at our Parallels vs. Fusion benchmark results simply by the numbers, then Fusion 8 is the clear winner, taking 11 out of 18 tests and pushing on three more. ... Some users are looking for a virtualization app to play Windows-only games, or crunch data in a Windows-only CPU-intensive app. Those folks should probably go with Fusion 8 this year."

== 2016 Reviews ==
ARS Technica reviewed both Fusion and Parallels updates in August 2016.

'''''Consumers' Checkbook'''''/Center for the Study of Services (stylized as ''Consumers’ CHECKBOOK'') is an independent, nonprofit consumer organization. It was founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.checkbook.org/about''CHECKBOOK About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide survey information to consumers about vendors and service providers. There are both print and online versions in the Boston, Chicago, Delaware Valley, Puget Sound, San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose, Twin Cities, and Washington, D.C., areas. 

==Company overview==
''Consumers' Checkbook'' and Center for the Study of Services were founded by company President Robert Krughoff after he had a bad auto repair experience. In response he founded the publication as a not-for-profit venue for rating professionals in fields including mechanics and plumbers. Over time the publication came to also review other professions and services, like physicians.&lt;ref&gt;David Kestenbaum, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111859728 "New Web Site Lets Patients Rate Their Doctors"], ''NPR'', August 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the intention to provide unbiased information the publication does not carry advertising, but does charge a subscription fee.&lt;ref&gt;Annys Shin, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1182103031.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+18%2C+2006&amp;author=Annys+Shin+-+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.1&amp;desc=30+Years+of+Obsessive+Consumerism "30 Years of Obsessive Consumerism"], ''Washington Post'', Dec 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''Consumers' Checkbook'' came out in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tv440WeuhxEC&amp;pg=PA119|title=The 1-2-3 Money Plan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ratings are based on items including surveys of consumers, reports from undercover shoppers, expert surveys, the number of consumer agency complaints against a company or service provider, and an analysis of publicly available databases. The first publication only covered the Washington DC area. In 1982, its first magazine for another city began, focusing on the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2003 the company expanded to include publications for Seattle-Tacoma, the Twin Cities, Chicago, the Delaware Valley, and Boston.&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uUUMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79|title=Watchdogs and Whistleblowers: A Reference Guide to Consumer Activism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
''Consumers' Checkbook'' publishes an annual Guide to Health Plans for Federal Employees, a health insurance plan cost and quality comparison resource,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedsmith.com/2015/11/23/how-to-save-money-on-your-federal-health-insurance/|title=How to Save Money On Your Federal Health Insurance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; first publishing the work in 1979. The book is published in paper form, and in 2000 its contents were moved online to GuideToHealthPlans.org.&lt;ref name=Mayer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0em3BRee75cC&amp;pg=PA55|title=Computerworld|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1985 and 2004 the company published Bargains, a publication that focused on price comparisons between retailers in both Washington DC and San Francisco. Between 1988 and 1998, they also published DC and San Francisco versions of a ''Checkbook Guide to Area Restaurants''. In 1994 they began publishing the ''Consumer’s Guide to Health Plans''. The company also publishes the ''Consumers’ Guide to Top Doctors'', providing a list of recommended specialists in the 53 largest metro areas of the U.S. as well as the ''Consumers' Guide to Hospitals'', providing ratings for about 4,500 U.S. acute-care hospitals, which it first published in 1988. The Guide to Top Doctors was first published in 1999.&lt;ref name=Mayer /&gt; 

The company also runs the website SurgeonRatings.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/you-need-surgery-so-how-do-you-find-the-right-doctor/2015/07/20/0122e132-2a62-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html|title=You need surgery. So how do you find the right doctor?|author=Lena H. Sun|date=20 July 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2009, the company published “a demonstration project surveying patients about their experience of care with their doctors using the Clinician/Group CAHPS Survey instrument developed by the US Agency for Health Care Research and Quality,” according to Robert Mayer.&lt;ref name=Mayer /&gt; ''Checkbook'' founded Patient Central in 2009, which ranks doctors in Denver-Boulder, Memphis, Kansas City, and New York (Manhattan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111859728|title=New Web Site Lets Patients Rate Their Doctors|date=14 August 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also releases industry specific and city specific surveys of price differences, such as the differences between grocery stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Consumers-CHECKBOOK-Grocery-Prices-346222762.html|title=Consumers' CHECKBOOK Shops Around for Best Grocery Prices, Quality|work=NBC4 Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7news.com/shopping/consumer-group-says-sears-kohls-mislead-customers/679307/|title=Executive editor for Bay Area Consumers' Checkbook says stores like Sears, Kohl's are trying to mislead customers - abc7news.com|work=ABC7 San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Checkbook'' also created the MNsure price comparison site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-site-touts-comparison-shopping-tool-that-looks-beyond-premiums/342112921/|title=MNsure site touts comparison shopping tool that looks beyond premiums|work=Star Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicare claims data and lawsuit==
In 2006, under the Freedom of Information Act, ''Consumers' Checkbook'' sued the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] for records of claims filed by physicians under Medicare. ''Checkbook'' intended to use these claims to report the volume of experience each doctor had with various high-risk procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Theo Francis, [https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2007/08/24/court-orders-medicare-to-release-doctor-data-for-ratings/?mod=hpp_us_blogs "Court Orders Medicare to Release Doctor Data for Ratings"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; HHS held the belief that the release of such data enabled the user to identify individual physicians, and therefore was prohibited from doing so. ''Checkbook'' won the case in the Federal District Court, but the ruling was reversed in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court declined to take the case.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Alonzo-Zaldivar, [http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Feb02/0,4670,MedicareDisclosure,00.html "Appeals court rejects disclosure of Medicare data"], ''FOX News'', February 02, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Checkbook'' has continued to push for the release of Medicare data since losing the case.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Leavitt and Robert Krughoff, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/18/AR2010031803637.html "Release of Medicare data could help reform health-care system"], ''Washington Post'', March 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Shultz, Arnold Milstein and Robert Krughoff, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576580614094740104 "More Transparency, Better Health Care"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car Bargains==
Since 1990, ''Consumers' Checkbook'' has also operated the car-buying and -leasing services, CarBargains and LeaseWise. The service pursues bids on the selected car model from five local dealers, asking them to compete against one another.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica L. Anderson, [http://www.kiplinger.com/columns/car/archive/using-a-car-buying-service-to-find-car-deals.html "How to Use a Car-Buying Service to Find Deals on New Cars"], ''Kiplinger'', November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That same year ''Checkbook'' began publishing the biannual publications CarDeals, a newsletter comparing car prices and financing options.&lt;ref name=Mayer /&gt;

==Recognition==
''Checkbook'' has won the National Press Club's First Place Award for Excellence in Consumer Journalism, and in 2000 was honored, with the Esther Peterson Consumer Service Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/awards.pdf Consumer Federation of America Presents Annual Consumer Service Awards]''Consumer Federation of America'', June 14th, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also received first place in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Plan Choice Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/rwjf-plan-choice-challenge/#winners|title=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Plan Choice Challenge|work=The Health 2.0 Developer Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co.''', 136 F. Supp. 2d. 1271 (S.D. Fla. 2001) was a [[trade secret]] [[misappropriation]] case where [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte Fresh Produce Company]] asserted that [[Dole Food Company]] obtained their specialty [[pineapples]] through non-legal means and were unjustly enriched as a result.

==Facts==
Through the expenditure of time, money, research, and other resources, Del Monte developed a special pineapple variety called MD-2 that was sweeter and contained more [[vitamin C]], [[fiber]], color, and a milder texture than competing pineapples.  Del Monte marketed these pineapples under the name "Del Monte Gold Extra Sweet."  Dole obtained the MD-2 pineapple through non-legal means via a farmer in [[Costa Rica]] who had been hired by Del Monte to grow the pineapple.  Dole then began selling the same variety under the moniker "Dole Premium Select."  The main question presented to the court was whether or not a pineapple could be a protectable trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;'Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co., 136 F. Supp. 2d. 1271 (S.D. Fla. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holding==
The court discussed Del Monte's failure to precisely define what about the pineapple was misappropriated.  The court stated that one cannot necessarily protect a pineapple as a thing, but one can protect something about the pineapple whether it be genetic makeup, growing techniques, etc.  Court ultimately held, however, that a pineapple's genetic information could be a protectable trade secret and that there was misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rowe &amp; Sharon Sandeen, ''Cases and Materials on Trade Secret Law'' (West 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EEMBC''', the '''Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium''', is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit, member-funded organization]] formed in 1997, focused on the creation of standard [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s for the hardware and software used in [[embedded systems]]. The goal of its members is to make EEMBC benchmarks an industry standard for evaluating the capabilities of embedded [[microprocessors|processors]], [[compilers]], and the associated embedded system implementations, according to objective, clearly defined, application-based criteria. EEMBC members may contribute to the development of benchmarks, vote at various stages before public distribution, and accelerate testing of their platforms through early access to benchmarks and associated specifications. 


==Most Popular Benchmark Working Groups==

'''In chronological order of development:'''

AutoBench 1.1 - single-[[Thread_(computing)|threaded]] code for automotive, industrial, and general-purpose applications

[[Networking hardware|Networking]] - single-threaded code associated with moving packets in networking applications.

MultiBench - multi-threaded code for testing scalability of [[multicore]] processors.

[[CoreMark]] - measures the performance of central processing units ([[CPU]]) used in embedded systems

BXBench - system benchmark measuring the [[Web_navigation|web browsing]] user-experience, from the click/touch on a [[URL]] to final page rendered on the screen, and is not limited to measuring only [[JavaScript]] execution.

AndEBench-Pro - system benchmark providing a standardized, industry-accepted method of evaluating [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform performance. It's available for free download in [[Google Play]].

FPMark - multi-threaded code for both single- and double-precision [[floating-point]] workloads, as well as small, medium, and large data sets.

ULPMark - energy-measuring benchmark for ultra-low power [[microcontrollers]]; benchmarks include ULPMark-Core (with a focus on microcontroller core activity and sleep modes) and ULPMark-Peripheral (with a focus on microcontroller peripheral activity such as [[Analog-to-digital converter]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]], [[Real-time clock]], and [[Pulse-width modulation]])

IoTConnect - system-level benchmark measuring performance and energy associated with connecting [[Internet of Things]] devices; the first phase, called IoTMark-BLE, focuses on [[Bluetooth]]

ADASMark - focusing on compute intensive application flows which are common to embedded [[heterogeneous computing]] architectures; the first phase includes real-world workloads from [[Autonomous_car|automotive surround view]].

SecureMark - Measures performance, energy, and memory impact allowing application developers to analyze IoT device security implementations

==Name==

Originally founded as the [[EDN_(magazine) | EDN]] Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium, EEBMC separated from EDN Magazine in 2012, but retained the double "E" in the name.

==Members==

EEMBC divides its members followingly:

* Board - have full working group participation and voting rights plus the right to designate a Director to the Board
* Subcommittee - have participation and voting rights within specific working groups

'''''Gambero Rosso''''' is an Italian food and wine magazine and publishing group founded in 1986.&lt;ref name="WineEc"&gt;[http://wineeconomist.com/2008/02/03/wine-critics-1-gambero-rosso/ The Wine Economist, 3 February 2008: Wine Critics Reviewed: Gambero Rosso]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name literally translates as "red [[prawn]]" and comes from a tavern in ''[[Pinocchio]]'' where [[the Fox and the Cat]] dine.

==History and profile==
''Gambero Rosso'' was initially an eight-page supplement of ''[[il manifesto]]'', first published on 16 December 1986, and was founded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Stefano Bonilli|it}}. It contributed early to spreading the views of "ARCI Gola", which was a forerunner to the [[Slow Food]] movement.

From 1987, Gambero Rosso has published a guide to [[Italian wine]], titled ''Vini d’Italia'', which in a short time became the most influential within Italy. It is also published in English translation under the title ''Italian Wines''. From the 2010 edition, the guide is published without the participation of the Slow Food movement, following controversy over the removal of founder Stefano Bonilli from his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/a200909271.html Gambero Rosso 2010 winners] Jancisrobinson.com, 27 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990, a guide to Italian restaurants was published.

In 1992, ''Gambero Rosso'' was issued by [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso|Gruppo Espresso]] as a monthly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History. 1990s|url=http://www.gruppoespresso.it/en/the-group/history/90s.html|publisher=Gruppo Espresso|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a TV channel, ''Gambero Rosso Channel'', was started in cooperation with [[Rai Sat]]. From July 2009 Gambero Rosso Channel is broadcast by [[Sky Italia]], channel 411. 

In 2002, ''Gambero Rosso'''s ''Città del gusto'' (City of taste) was opened in [[Rome]], featuring TV studios, cooking school, wine bar and professional and educational activities on 10,000 square meters. In Italy there are 4 different 'Città del gusto' in: Rome, Naples, Catania and Palermo. From 2009 [[Paolo Cuccia]] became the Chairman of Gambero Rosso Holding Spa.

From 2012 ''Gambero Rosso'' publishes digital versions of its guides: Vini d'Italia and Ristoranti d'Italia. Apps are available for: Apple iPhone, Samsung Apps, Google Play, Amazon Appstore and Windows 8.

==Wine ratings==
The Gambero Rosso wine ratings in ''Vini d’Italia'' are built up on the number of glasses (''bicchieri'') awarded to a wine, which is indicated in the wine guide with a number of stylized glasses next to the wine's name. The highest rating is three glasses (''Tre Bicchieri''),&lt;ref name="WineEc"/&gt; and the wine guide only includes wines which are seen by the editors as "above average". The ratings are based upon [[blind tasting]] by independent experts. The guide is edited in Italian, English and German language.

* Three glasses indicate "extraordinary wines".
* Two red glasses indicates a wine which was selected as a candidate for three glasses (which far from all wines with two glasses are), but did not make it all the way. This feature was introduced in the 2002 edition.
* Two glasses indicate "very good wines".
* One glass indicates "good wines".

==Ristoranti d'Italia==
The  guide 'Ristoranti d'Italia' (23rd edition in 2013) describes the best Italian restaurants. For each place it attributes  a rating from 60 to 100 and, only for the best restaurants, a number of 'forks' ranging from 1 to 3. In 2013, among 2015 reviewed restaurants, 21 places obtained 3 forks, the highest prize.

'''Gregory v Rangitikei''' [1995] 2 NZLR 208, (1994)  6 TCLR 199 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the sale of property by tender, confirming that an offer inviting tenders to be submitted for the purchase of something did not amount to an offer capable of acceptance to sell that property, but instead merely amounted to an [[invitation to treat]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reinforces the English case of [[Spencer v Harding]] (1870) LR 5 CP 561. However the Court also ruled that there was a breach of the [[Fair Trading Act 1986|Fair Trading Act (1986)]].

==Background==
The RDC advertised some surplus land or sale by tender, with the important caveat of "highest or any tender not necessarily accepted". During the tender process, the RDC discovered that they had previously agreed to sell the property to a neighbouring property owner Roberts.

Ultimately, Gregory was the highest tenderer, although his offer did not meet the council's reserve, and the council declined all tenders. The RDC then proceeded to exclusively negotiate a sale to Roberts, without giving Gregory a chance to purchase the property.

==Held==
The court held that calling a tender is merely an invitation to treat, and so gave none of the tenderers any legal rights. However, it was a breach of section 9 of the Fair Trading Act, and Gregory was awarded damages.

[[File:Morris dancers Thames at Richmond.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Painting of a hobby horse with [[Morris dance]]rs beside the [[River Thames]] at [[Richmond, London]], c.1620]]
The term '''hobby horse''' is used, principally by [[folklore|folklorists]], to refer to the costumed characters that feature in some traditional seasonal customs, processions and similar observances around the world. They are particularly associated with [[May Day]] celebrations, [[Mummers play]]s and the [[Morris dance]] in [[England]]. 
{{Wiktionary|hobby horse}}

==Types of hobby horse==
Hobby horses may be constructed in several different ways. The types most frequently found in the [[United Kingdom]] have been categorised as follows:&lt;ref name='Cawte'&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', pp8–9, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tourney''' horses are meant to look like a person riding a small horse that is wearing a long cloth coat or [[caparison]] (as seen in medieval illustrations of [[jousting]] knights at a tourney or [[tournament]]). A circular or oval frame is suspended around their waist, or chest, with a skirt draped over it hanging down to the ground. The frame has a carved wooden head, often with snapping jaws (operated by pulling a string) attached to it at one end, and a tail at the other. The "rider" may wear a cape or other flowing costume to help cover the frame. In the most elaborate versions, fake legs, meant to be those of the rider, hang down the sides of the skirt, though this seems to be a fairly recent development.&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p187, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sieve''' horses are a simpler version of the tourney horse. Known only in [[Lincolnshire]], they are made from a farm [[sieve]] frame, with head and tail attached, suspended from the performer's shoulders. The performer wears a horse blanket (the kind that includes a headpiece with holes for the eyes and ears) that covers them and the sieve.&lt;ref name=Cawte/&gt;
* '''Mast''' horses are meant to represent the horse (or other animal) itself. They have a head made of wood, or sometimes an actual horse's skull is used; it usually has hinged jaws that can be made to snap. The head is attached to a stick about 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The person acting the creature is covered by a cloth attached to the back of its head; he (or, rarely, she) bends over forwards or crouches, holding the head in front of their own and resting the other end of the stick on the ground. A tail may be attached to the back of the cloth.&lt;ref name=Cawte/&gt; When the cloth is long enough, such as the sheet used by the Welsh ''[[Mari Lwyd]]'', the performer can also stand up, lifting the head in front of their face or above their head.

Not all hobby horses fit into these categories, even within the UK. The famous May Day horses at [[Padstow]] and [[Minehead]] are large constructions, suspended at shoulder level, with only the performer's head emerging; they wear tall, pointed hats and their faces are masked. The Padstow horses have circular frames, with fairly small, snapping-jawed heads on long, straight necks;&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p157–158, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; the Minehead horses are more boat-shaped, with pointed ends and, since about 1880, have had no heads, though they have long, trailing tails, about 2.2&amp;nbsp;m (7&amp;nbsp;ft) long.&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p169, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[South of France]], in Belgium (the ''Ommegang de [[Dendermonde|Termonde]]'') and elsewhere, large hobby horses are carried by multiple performers; their hollow frameworks are constructed in various ways. The ''Danse du Baiar'' at Esquièze the dancers wear à wooden horse head in their breasts when dancing.

In Indonesia, flat [[silhouette]]s of horses are suspended between the dancers' legs (see individual entries, below).

==Customs==

===Britain===

====May Day hobby horses====

=====Padstow=====
[[File:Red obby oss maiden 20050502.jpg|thumb|right|The Old 'Oss capturing a young woman during the May Day festival at Padstow, Cornwall]]
The most famous traditional British hobby horses are probably those of the [[May Day]] [['Obby 'Oss festival]] in [[Padstow]], [[Cornwall]]. They are made from a circular framework, tightly covered with shiny black material, carried on the shoulders of a dancer whose face is hidden by a grotesque mask attached to a tall, pointed hat. A skirt (made from the same material) hangs down from the edge of the frame to around knee-height. There is a small, wooden, horse's head with snapping jaws, attached to a long, straight neck, with a long mane, which sticks out from the front of the frame. On the opposite side there is a small tail of horsehair.

There are two rival horses and their fiercely loyal bands of supporters at Padstow: the '''Old 'Oss''' is decorated with white and red, and its supporters wear red scarves to show their allegiance; the '''Blue Ribbon 'Oss''' (or "Peace 'Oss") is decorated with white and blue and its supporters follow suit [http://home.freeuk.net/bribbonobbyoss/]. A "Teaser" waving a padded club dances in front of each 'Oss, accompanied, as they dance through the narrow streets, by a lively band of [[Accordion|melodeons, accordions]] and drums playing Padstow's traditional May Song. The 'Osses sometimes capture young women beneath the skirt of the hobby horse; often they emerge smeared with black.&lt;ref name='Hole'&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', pp199–201, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children sometimes make "Colt" 'Osses and hold their own May Day parades.

=====Minehead=====
[[File:mineheadhobbyhorse.jpg|thumb|left|Minehead Hobby Horse]]
At [[Minehead]] in [[Somerset]] there are three rival hobby horses, the '''Original Sailor's Horse''', the '''Traditional Sailor's Horse''' and the '''Town Horse'''. They appear on [[Walpurgis Night|May Eve]] (called "Show Night"), on May Day morning (when they salute the sunrise at a crossroads on the ouskirts of town), 2 May and 3 May (when a ceremony called "The Bootie" takes place in the evening at part of town called Cher) [http://www.cajunmusic.co.uk/hh/uk/minehead/index.htm]. Each horse is made of a boat-shaped wooden frame, pointed and built up at each end, which is carried on the dancer's shoulders. As at Padstow, his face is hidden by a mask attached to a tall, pointed hat. The top surface of the horse is covered with ribbons and strips of fabric. A long fabric skirt, painted with rows of multicoloured roundels, hangs down to the ground all round. A long tail is attached to the back of the frame. Each horse is accompanied by a small group of musicians and attendants. The Town Horse is accompanied by "Gullivers", dressed similarly to the horse but without the large frame; as at Padstow, smaller, children's horses have sometimes been constructed [http://www.minehead-online.co.uk/hobbyhorse.htm]. The horses' visits are (or were) believed to bring [[Luck|good luck]].

In the past there was also a similar hobby horse based at the nearby village of [[Dunster]], which would sometimes visit Minehead [https://web.archive.org/web/20070819225534/http://www.england-in-particular.info/horse/h-obby1.html]. The Minehead horse has also visited Dunster Castle on May Day.&lt;ref name='Hole' /&gt;

====Hunting the Earl of Rone====
At [[Combe Martin]] in Devon a custom called "The Hunting of the Earl of Rone" took place on [[Ascension Day]] until 1837, when it was banned. It was revived in 1974 and now takes place over the four days of Spring [[Bank Holiday]]. A [[Jester|fool]] and a hobby horse, accompanied by [[grenadier]]s, search the village for the Earl, who is finally captured, mounted onto a (real) donkey and paraded through the village. He is frequently shot at by the soldiers, falls from his mount, and is revived by the hobby horse and the fool, and returned to his mount. Finally, on reaching the beach, the Earl is executed and thrown into the sea. [http://www.earl-of-rone.org.uk/]&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', pp159–161, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morris and other ritual dance====

Image:Abbots Bromley original hobby horse.jpg|The original Abbots Bromley hobby horse in costume, c.1976
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A hobby horse is depicted in a stained glass window, dating from between 1550–1621, from Betley Hall, Staffordshire, now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, directly below a [[Maypole]] and surrounded by what appear to be [[morris dance]]rs (accession no. C.248-1976) [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O8054/window/].

A painting from c.1620, now in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], Cambridge, shows Morris dancers by the Thames at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]; their party includes a hobby horse.[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/opacdirect/1388.html#1]

Some historical English [[Morris dance]] "sides" (teams) had hobby horses associated with them, but the popularity of such animals with morris sides today probably dates from the early years of the morris revival, when [[Ilmington]] Morris created a tourney horse, ridden by Sam Bennett for many years. Some modern revival sides have extended their animal repertoire in various imaginative and appropriate ways, e.g. Pig Dyke Molly [[molly dance]]rs, who wear black and white costumes and makeup, have a hobby [[zebra]].

A hobby horse takes part in the ancient [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance]]. The old original horse (see gallery, above) has been replaced by a more realistic carving in recent years.

====Other customs including hobby horses====

=====Hodening or Hoodening=====
A custom which took place at, or in the lead-up to, Christmas in eastern Kent, involving a group of ploughmen or other farmworkers leading a [[Hoodening|Hooden Horse]] (a horse's head made of wood, set on a short pole, with snapping jaws (sometimes set with nails for teeth) operated by a person hidden under a piece of sacking or a stable-blanket to represent the animal's body). The custom, described as "only just extinct" by folklorist [[Violet Alford]] in 1952, has since been revived in various places.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', pp148–150, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Alford'&gt;Alford, Violet (1952). ''Introduction to English Folklore'', p57, Bell (no ISBN)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Laare Vane''=====
A [[New Year]] custom from the [[Isle of Man]], involving a white-painted wooden horse's head with red-painted snapping jaws, with a white sheet attached. Draped in the sheet, a man would carry the head, racing unexpectedly into the room and chase any girls present out of the house, followed by the rest of the company. When the ''Laare Vane'' (white mare) caught a girl she would take his place under the sheet to carry the horse back into the house, sitting away from the others while a kind of [[Long Sword dance|sword-dance]] was performed with sticks by six male dancers to the tune "Mylecharane's March" played on the fiddle. As the climax of the dance the fiddler would enter the circle of dancers and be imprisoned by their intertwined sticks; the dancers then, with wild cries, "cut off his head" and he fell to the ground. The "dead" fiddler was then blindfolded and led to the ''Laare Vane'', and knelt with his head in her lap. Another person would question the fiddler about events in the coming year (particularly who would become [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]]s) and his replies were believed to be true predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mona (ed. Stephen Miller), ''Manx Folk-Song, Folk Dance, Folklore: Collected Writings'' (pp5, 10, 15–16), Chiollagh Books, Onchan, Isle of Mann, 1994, {{ISBN|1-898613-06-0}} (online version [http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~stephen/chiollaghbooksfirstseries/CBPOD02S.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Mari Lwyd''=====
[[File:Penglaz2.JPG|thumb|left|The modern Cornish ''Penglaz'']]
[[File:Antrobus Soul Cakers.jpg|thumb|left|The Antrobus Soul-cakers with Dick, the Wild Horse (mid 1970s)]]
A similar creature, the ''[[Mari Lwyd]]'' ("Grey Mare" in English), also made from a horse's skull, with a white sheet attached, took part in [[New Year]] house-visiting, luck-bringing rituals in south-east Wales. Gaining access to the house was a challenge; the ''Mari Lwyd'' party and those in the house took turns to improvise verses of a song. If the household failed to come up with a final verse the ''Mari'' was allowed to enter; if not, it was turned away. The custom has been revived in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', pp185–187, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Old Horse, 'Owd 'Oss or Poor Old Hoss=====
In parts of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and around Sheffield there existed, into the early 20th century (and until 1970 at [[Dore]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folk-network.com/miscellany/christmas/luck-visiting.html SRFN Miscellany: Luck-visiting in the Old South Riding]&lt;/ref&gt;) a Christmas and New Year custom of going from house to house performing a short play or dramatised song called ''The Old Horse'', ''T'Owd 'Oss'' or ''Poor Old Horse''. The horse was of the "mast" type, constructed in a similar way to the Wild Horse of the Soul-cakers and the hooden horses of Kent. The earliest record is from 1840, at [[Ashford-in-the-Water]], Derbyshire.&lt;ref name="Cawte, EC p123"&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p123, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of performance still continues at Richmond, Yorkshire, at Christmas. Three men dressed in hunting pink lead a horse "made from the stuffed skin of a horse's head on a pole" and the man who plays it hidden under a horse-blanket. The men sing the ''Poor Old Horse'' song and the horse snapped its jaws at the end of each verse.&lt;ref name="Cawte, EC p123"/&gt; The custom as now performed in Richmond Market Place around midday on Christmas Eve involves the horse's "death and resurrection" (he crouches down and then rises up when a [[French horn|hunting horn]] is blown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://calendarcustoms.com/articles/poor/ Calendar Customs website: Poor Old Hoss]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Penglas'' or ''Penglaz''=====
The name of this creature from [[Cornwall]] translates as "grey head". It was a "hooden" or "mast" type of horse, either carved from wood or made from a horse's skull, like the Welsh ''Mari Lwyd'', and accompanied the Christmas [[Guiser]]s. Its body was a horse's hide or horse cloth. Sometimes it was led or ridden by Old Penglaze, a man with a blackened face who carried a staff. The animal has been revived in [[Penzance]] in recent years as [[Golowan Festival#Penglaz the Penzance 'Obby 'Oss|Penglaz the Penzance 'Obby 'Oss]] and now appears on "Mazey Eve" and 23 June (St John's Eve) as part of a modern [[Midsummer]] festival, instead of around midwinter.

=====Plough Monday mummers=====
In Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire and some other parts of the East Midlands of England, mummers' plays were performed, on or around [[Plough Monday]] in early January, by teams known variously as Plough Stots, Plough Jags, Plough Jacks, Plough Bullocks or Plough Witches. In North Lincolnshire, large teams of elaborately costumed mummers, often having some of the characters duplicated, paraded through the village streets, sometimes splitting up into smaller groups to enter houses and perform extracts from their traditional play. Photographs of teams from [[Scunthorpe]], Burringham, Scotter, [[Burton-upon-Stather]] and elsewhere showed double gangs with two hobby horses. They were of the sieve type, made by hanging the wooden frame of a large sieve, with a small wooden horse's head and horsehair tail attached, around the performer's waist, However, in an unusual variation, the "rider" was then disguised by wearing a horse-cloth which covered his head and body to the knees, so that he appeared to be a horse riding a horse.&lt;ref name="Hole"/&gt;

=====Salisbury Giant and Hob-Nob=====
The Salisbury Giant, a 12&amp;nbsp;ft-tall (3.5m) figure sometimes said to represent [[Saint Christopher]], is a processional figure unique in Britain. The current figure's wooden frame was rebuilt c.1850 although it is probable that he existed in the 15th century. It rarely appears nowadays, being kept in the [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]], along with its companion '''Hob-Nob''', a tourney-type hobby horse, a mischievous character which used to clear the way for the Giant in the processions that were held by the Tailor's [[Guild]] on [[Midsummer's Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091123180704/http://www.salisburymuseum.org.uk/collections/medieval-salisbury/giant-and-hob-nob.html Salisbury &amp; South Wiltshire Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p30, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Hob-Nob's rider's face and body were disguised with a substantial veil. The first clear mention of the hobby horse is in 1572 (along with a "[[Maid Marian|mayde Marrians]] Coate") in the records of the Tailors' Guild (who, in 1873, finally sold both hobby-horse and Giant to the Museum). The processions, which also involved [[morris dance]]rs until around 1911, continued sporadically on various occasions into the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', pp29–35, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Soul-caking or Souling=====
Some regional variants of the [[Mummers Play#Local seasonal variants|mummers play]], performed around [[All Souls' Day]] in [[Cheshire]], included a non-speaking character called the "Wild Horse", made from a horse's skull mounted on a short pole. The horse was played by a man, hidden under a cloth attached to the pole, who bent forward to rest the pole on the ground. He could usually snap the horse's jaws loudly to frighten onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', pp284–285, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Winster Hobby Horses=====
{{Main article|Winster Guisers}}
[[File:Winster Hobby horses &amp; mummers (small).jpg|thumb|350px|left|The three Winster hobby horses and other performers, c.&amp;nbsp;1870]]
A possibly unique custom involving three hobby horses is known only from a photograph taken at [[Winster]] Hall, Derbyshire, in about 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p122, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; (The picture appears to have been taken in winter, as the climbing plants on the wall are leafless.) Eight or nine performers are involved; all (bar one?) have facial disguise.

The performers are grouped around a mast horse (possibly 'Snap Dragon'; see below) with a shiny black head made from a painted skull set on a short pole. Behind it are two men in threatening postures, one is waving a long stick like the handle of a brush or rake, the other probably a [[besom broom]] (blurred).

Two more men wearing military-looking jackets, buttoned to the neck, and white trousers stand astride small hobbyhorses of an apparently unique design: a cylindrical body, "about three inches diameter and two feet long", held between the rider's legs (supported at the front by a cord or narrow strap around the rider's neck), with a flat, curved wooden neck and a small, stylised head with snapping jaws (apart from their mouths, the horses look almost like simple [[rocking horse]]s with the legs removed). The horsemen are masked in light-coloured cloth.

Another character wears a rather voluminous, tattered, long, dark dress; busily brushing the ground with a besom broom, "she" is reminiscent of the character Besom Bet who appears in some [[Mummers Play|mummers plays]]. The last two characters are playing [[rough music]] on [[bladder fiddle]]s.

The performance may have been arranged by [[Llewellyn Jewitt|Llewellynn Jewitt]], who lived at the hall between 1868 and 1880. In 1931, Stanley Evans ("Folk Dancing in Derbyshire", ''Derbyshire Countryside'', vol 1, no 2, April 1931, p29) suggested the performers may have been performing a mumming play. Cawte dismissed this suggestion: "if so it is a most unusual one, there is no sign of the combatants, the pair of horses is of an unusual design, and the mast horse seems to be the centre of attention."&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', p121, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his field notes, made in 1908, folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] referred to a hobby horse "without a curtain" being connected with the [[morris dance]] at Winster; he also mentions a "Snap Dragon" made from "a real horse's head" (skull?) dug up for the purpose, but does not say whether it was associated with the morris. It seems he did not see them himself and his account published in 1924, long after his visit to Winster, is confusing. In 1966, Winster morris dancers stated that there had never been a hobby horse associated with their morris, but that there had been a separate horse ceremony involving a skull that was reburied each year.&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, EC, ''Ritual Animal Disguise'', pp120–123, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In notes published after his death, Llewellynn Jewitt noted how, in 1867, a dozen or so groups of traditional performers (several groups of guisers, the Wensley mummers, 'The Hobby Horse' and the 'Snap Dragon') called at Winster Hall in just four days between Christmas and New Year. He noted that, on 27 December, "In the evening the Winster 'Snap Dragon' and 'Hobby Horse' conjoined came to us — ten men, one as Snap Dragon, two with Hobby Horses, two devils, etc., etc. We had them in the kitchen and gave them money."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Samuel Carter, The Life and Death of Llewellynn Jewitt: With Fragmentary Memoirs of Some of his Famous Literary and Artistic Friends (1889) Online text, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph may well show one such "conjoined" team.

=====Derby Tup=====
{{Main article|Mummers Play#The Derby Tup}}
Originally created in the same way as a mast horse or hooden horse, the '''Derby Tup''' ([[Sheep|ram]]) represented a male sheep. It took part in a dramatised version of the ''Derby Ram'' folksong, which was performed in northern [[Derbyshire]] and around [[Sheffield]] during the Christmas season by teams of boys. It is "killed" by a butcher and its "blood" is collected in a large bowl. In some versions it is brought back to life by a quack doctor, like a character in the [[Mummers play]].

====Austria====

=====Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]=====
The ''Fasnacht'' (carnival) procession in Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, south-west Austria, features a large band of musicians, some in fancy dress, and is led by a large, rather frisky hobby horse. It has a hollow body, covered by a long white sheet that almost reaches the ground, with a long neck and head apparently made of cardboard or papier-mâché; it is carried by two people who are hidden beneath the sheet. The horse has a few coloured ribbons attached to its mane, bridle and tail. Its reins are held by a man dressed in a red jacket, and it is closely followed by a boy (who occasionally prods it with a wooden hay-fork) and a blacksmith in an apron (who carries a bag containing a hammer). Other stock characters in the parade include four masked, smartly dressed "old men" with walking sticks. From time to time the horse falls to the ground and is then "shod" (the smith hammers the shoe soles of one or other of the carriers, who kick out, wildly). The man who leads it sometimes breathes into its mouth or nostrils. It then revives and continues through the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnivalkingofeurope.it/activities/video/filmSanktLorenzen.php ''Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, Carinthia (A)'': Film by Michele Trentini, made 16 February 2010] Carnival King of Europe (website of Museo degli Usi e Costumi della Gente Trentina, San Michele all'Adige - Italy) (accessed 20 Nov 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Espès-Undurein|Ezpeize]] the formal dancing is suddenly interrupted by a wild invasion. An unruly gang of rustically dressed characters, wearing masks or facial disguise, rushes into the dancing area in pairs, with loud cries. Some wave clubs. Some have furry tails. There is a doctor and a nurse, in white coats with a red cross on the back. They all race around the dancing space in an anti-clockwise direction and then fall to the ground in a writhing heap.&lt;ref name="carnivalkingofeurope.it"&gt;[http://www.carnivalkingofeurope.it/activities/video/filmEspes.php ''Carnaval de Espes'': Film by Michele Trentini, 25 January 2009] Carnival King of Europe (website of Museo degli Usi e Costumi della Gente Trentina, San Michele all'Adige - Italy) (accessed 20 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Carnaval de Lantz, Spain=====
A more rustic-looking horse of similar basic construction is part of the celebrations of the Carnaval de [[Lantz, Spain|Lantz]], Spain. Called the ''zaldiko'', it forms an essential part of the carnival procession, together with the ''ziripot'', a strange character in an enormous straw-stuffed costume.&lt;ref name='DanseBasque'/&gt;

=====Parade of Giants and Big-heads, Pamplona, Spain=====
[[File:Comparsa pamplona jorge urdanoz.jpg|thumb|right|Pamplona's giants and big-heads, with the 6 ''zaldiko'' (far left)]]
Dressed in red trimmed with yellow, six tourney horses (''xaldiko''&lt;ref name='DanseBasque'/&gt; or ''zaldiko'') take part in the ''Comparsa de gigantes y cabezudos'' in [[Pamplona]] (Iruña) in [[Navarre]] (Nafarra). More realistic than the other Basque examples, they replicate the whole upper part of a horse's body from head to tail, with a skirt attached below. Each "rider" wears a pointed cap with a tassel and used to wield an inflated bladder on a stick; now, like the [[tricorn]]ed big-heads called ''Kilikis'' who parade with them, they carry a phallic ''verga'' made of foam-rubber which they use to belabour the onlookers.

=====Lumeçon, Ducasse de Mons=====
{{Main article|Ducasse de Mons}}
[[File:Saint-Georges-et-dragon.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century illustration of the Mons dragon with hobby horses]]
Also known as the "Doudou", the Ducasse de Mons is a festival that takes place on [[Trinity Sunday]] in the town of [[Mons]] and consists of two parts. The first is a procession with the [[shrine]] of [[Saint Waltrude]]. The second part, called the ''Lumeçon'', depicts the combat of [[Saint George|St George and the Dragon]] and features a large processional dragon with an enormously long, stiff tail. Saint George's attempts to kill the dragon with his lance all fail, so he then dispatches it with a [[pistol]]! An illustration from the 19th century clearly shows the dragon with three hobby-horses of the "tourney" type, but modern photographs and descriptions of the event show these animals are made of cow-hide and look more like dogs; they are known as ''Chinchins'' or ''Chins-Chins'' (a corruption of ''chien'', dog) and their role is to aid St. George.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Ducasse de Mons|French Wikipédia article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has been recognised by [[UNESCO]] since 2005 as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] under the general heading of "Processional Giants and Dragons in Belgium and France".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00153 UNESCO Intangible History website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====

=====Killing the Mare, Shrovetide=====
The finale to the [[Shrovetide]] processions in the town of [[Hlinsko]], in the [[Czech Republic]], and six nearby villages (including [[Hamry (Chrudim District)|Hamry]], [[Blatno (Chrudim District)|Blatno]], [[Studnice (Chrudim District)|Studnice]] and [[Vortová]]), in the Hlinecko region of eastern [[Bohemia]], is a ritual called "Killing the Mare''.

Accompanied by a [[brass band]], men and boys wearing colourful costumes representing traditional characters spend a whole day going from door to door, visiting every household in their community (except those known to be in [[mourning]]). Details differ slightly from place to place, but there are usually two or three hobby-horses (of the tourney type). Other characters include the Straw Men, dressed in costumes made of rice-straw, with blacked faces, and tall, pointed straw hats; they embrace women and roll with them on the ground, which is said to confer fertility. Housewives gather straw from the Straw Men's skirts as a good luck charm, taking it home to feed their geese and chickens.

With the "Little Wife" (a man dressed as a woman) and the "dotted man", four dancers representing [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] perform a ritual dance in front of each house, to ensure wealth for the family and a good harvest. They must lift their legs as high as possible to ensure tall crops of [[flax]]. They wave handkerchieves, as in the English [[morris dance]] but originally wielded [[sabre]]s instead.

At the end of the day the men perform a ritual called "Killing the Mare". One of the group's hobby horses, is judged and then "killed" for its alleged sins. It is then "[[Resurrection|brought back to life]]" (with alcohol) and a dance ensues, involving the onlookers. This custom has survived despite being banned in the 18th and 19th centuries by the [[Catholic Church]] and in the 20th by the [[Socialism|Socialist]] government. It has now been recognised by [[UNESCO]] as an element of mankind's [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/index.php?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=1677 A film on the UNESCO website; many of the above details were taken from the film's narration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hobby-horse customs exist in the [[Languedoc]] area of southwest France, which is a stronghold for "[[totem]]" animals, with many towns and villages having their own particular creature; most appear at [[carnival]] time and/or their local patronal festivals, saint's days and other festivities.&lt;ref name=Frenchwiki&gt;[[:fr:Animaux totémiques de l'Hérault|French Wikipédia: Animaux totémiques de l'Hérault]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Le Poulain de Pézenas''=====
[[File:Pezenas poulain.JPG|thumb|right|The Poulain from Pézenas (visiting [[Steenvoorde]], in northeast France, for the Festival of Giants in 2006)]]
At [[Pézenas]] there is a huge creature called ''Le Poulain'' or ''Lo Polin'' ([[Occitan]] for "the colt"), carried by nine men and led by another, accompanied by a band of musicians. The ''Poulain'' has a realistically carved wooden head, with a snapping jaws and an extending neck that can reach up to first-floor windows; money or other offerings put into its mouth tumble down inside its neck. Its semi-cylindrical body is covered with a dark blue cloth, now decorated with stars and the [[coat of arms]] of Pézenas. Below the frame it has a tricolor skirt.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jean-Marie, "''Le Poulain, Pézenas''",  pp9–10 &amp; 22, Cercle de Collectionneurs de Pézenas, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Poulain'' carries two effigies on its back, one male, one female, called ''Estieinou'' and ''Estieinette'' (or ''Estieineta''). Although the first written reference to the ''Poulain'' is from 1615, the creature is supposed to commemorate a visit to the town in 1226 by [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], during which the king's favourite mare fell ill. She had to be left behind in Pézenas while Louis continued with the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. On his return he was astonished to find that not only was his mare now fully recovered, but she had also given birth to a fine colt, which was duly presented to him, adorned with ribbons. In return he decreed that the town should construct a wooden colt to be used to celebrate all its public festivities (this legend was first recorded in 1701).&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jean-Marie, "''Le Poulain, Pézenas''",  pp2–4, Cercle de Collectionneurs de Pézenas, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Its early appearances were on the public feast days of [[Saint Blaise]] (3 February), [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] (24 June) and the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]] (15 Aug). As a symbol of power, it also appeared at times when the town's ''prévôt'' distributed bread to the poor (the last such was in 1911), as well as visits by royalty or other dignitaries. The ''Poulain'' was burned in 1789, during the [[French Revolution]], because of its royal associations, but was revived in 1803. Since then it has appeared at [[Mardi Gras]] and other festive occasions. Its framework, once a weighty construction of [[Castanea sativa|chestnut]], has been made of aluminium since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jean-Marie, "''Le Poulain, Pézenas''", pp6–8, Cercle de Collectionneurs de Pézenas, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the ''Poulain'' had no riders; ''Estieinou'' and ''Estieinette'' (sometimes spelled ''Estiénon'' and ''Estiéneta'' in the French manner) are meant to recall another royal occasion when [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] visited the town in 1622; the Maréchal de Bassompierre, following the King, was crossing the river Peyne on horseback. He saw a peasant-woman having difficulty making the crossing on foot and gallantly offered her a seat on his horse. Their merry arrival in the town caused great amusement and so the two effigies were made to remember the event.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jean-Marie, "''Le Poulain, Pézenas''",  pp2-3, Cercle de Collectionneurs de Pézenas, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been smaller, junior ''Poulains'' in Pézenas, made by or for children; the Pézenas ''fadas'' also have a full-sized version of their own. There have also been similar creatures or imitations elsewhere, some of which still continue. There is a very lively ''Poulain'' at [[Saint-Thibéry]] and others are (or have been) known at [[Adissan]], [[Alignan-du-Vent]], [[Florensac]], [[Montblanc, Hérault|Montblanc]] and [[Vias, Hérault|Vias]] (where it is linked to a local legend of a medieval famine and is known as ''lo Pouli de la Fabo'' – the colt of the bean). They have also been recorded at [[Agde]], [[Caux, Hérault|Caux]], [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]], [[Castelnau-le-Lez|Castelnau]], [[Valros]] and [[Nizas, Hérault|Nizas]], all in the [[Languedoc]]. An outlier in the [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], at St Pierre de [[Soulan]], was instigated by a former inhabitant of Pézenas.&lt;ref name=Frenchwiki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jean-Marie, "''Le Poulain, Pézenas''",  p32, Cercle de Collectionneurs de Pézenas, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Lou chivalet'' or ''le chevalet''=====
Hobby horses of the tourney type, with a frame suspended around the dancer's waist, can also appear at various festivities in the Languedoc. An illustration of the ''chivalet'' dance, and its traditional tune, and an old photograph of an animal of this type, are on show in the folk museum at Agde. It is particularly associated with Florensac, where it is called ''le chevalet'', and is considered the town's totem.&lt;ref name='FrenchwikiBessan'&gt;[[:fr:Bessan#Traditions|Bessan in French Wikipédia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevalet of [[Cournonterral]] in the Hérault died out around 1980 but was revived in March 2011 as part of the annual carnival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/20742735 Official video of the revival Chivalet on 5 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''L'âne de Bessan''=====
[[File:Ane de Bessan.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Âne de Bessan'']]
The Donkey or Ass of Bessan is another of the Languedoc's "totem" animals. Much smaller than the Poulain, it is made from a frame covered in cloth and decorated with crepe paper flowers and painted motifs. Under its skirt it is carried by four men, led by another who dresses in white, with a tricolor sash, and cracks a whip. The ''Âne'' dances from side to side and backwards and forwards to traditional tunes played nowadays on various instruments, although until the 1970s it was only the traditional ''hautbois'' (a type of oboe) and drums. Sometimes the beast bucks its hindquarters into the air, supported only by the leader and the first dancer, who twirls around; the other three stand ready to catch the frame as it descends. The ''Âne'' is brought out to open the feast of [[Lawrence of Rome|St Laurent]], appearing first at 5pm on the Saturday closest to the saint's day, accompanied by firecrackers and bells, then again on the Sunday morning when it goes to a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] to be blessed, before its final dance.&lt;ref name='FrenchwikiBessan'/&gt;

There is also an '''''Âne''''' at [[Gignac, Hérault|Gignac]].&lt;ref name=Frenchwiki/&gt;

'''''Le Cheval-Bayard''''' de Clermont-l'Hérault was revived in 1988, after more than a century and a half. The town's original ''cheval-bayard'' was burned in 1815; known as the ''[[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]]'' (''baiard'' in Occitan), meaning a [[Bay (horse)|bay horse]], its origins have been traced back to the 9th century.&lt;ref name='FrenchwikiBessan'/&gt;

=====Other "totem" animals of the Hérault=====
Perhaps the best-known is the '''''Chameau''''' (Camel) of [[Béziers]], which dates from 1613, two years earlier than the Poulain of Pézenas. There is a large and impressive '''''Boeuf''''' (Bull) at [[Mèze]], with a huge mouth; it is said to date back to at least 1229. '''''Lo Picart''''', at [[Saint-Jean-de-Fos]], is a ferocious ram; it has existed since at least 1683. [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]] has a goat. Sometimes the choice of animal is based on a play on words: [[Loupian]] has, unsurprisingly, a wolf (''Loup''). (One of the most recent, and possibly the most bizarre, "totems" is '''''Le Porquet''''' of [[Pinet, Hérault|Pinet]], a caterpillar, created in the early 1970s.)&lt;ref name=Frenchwiki/&gt;

=====Odenwald: Christmas ''Bock'', ''Esel'' and ''Schimmelreiter''=====
Various creatures used to appear in the [[Odenwald]] around Christmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waldweihnachten.de/htm/index.htm ''Waldweihnachten'' website (in German)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Straw bear (German traditional character)|straw bears]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100916021308/http://www.waldweihnachten.de/htm/strohnickel.htm Waldweihnachten: Strohnickelgestalten (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bock'' figures(variations of which can also be found in Sweden and other parts of Scandiniavia around Midwinter and Christmas time perhaps having links to the Germanic God Thor and perhaps even older fertility rights). The ''bock'' (the name can be translated as "goat", "buck", "ram" or "stag") was made in a similar way to a mast horse, but using a long, two- or three-pronged hayfork that formed form its horns, covered in a white sheet, partly stuffed to form a head with a face painted onto it; these were sometimes held up outside windows to frighten the householder. Sometimes two people stood under the sheet to form a longer-bodied creature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100916021212/http://www.waldweihnachten.de/htm/bock.htm Waldweihnachten: Bockgestalten (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Weihnachtsesels'' (Christmas donkeys) were made in a similar way, usually with two people bending over under a darker coloured blanket, rather like a [[pantomime]] horse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100916021221/http://www.waldweihnachten.de/htm/esel.htm Waldweihnachten: Eselgestalten (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''schimmelreiter'' was a more elaborate construction, made from two (or more) large sieves or riddles fastened in an upright position in front of and behind the "rider" at chest level. The front sieve had a stuffed fabric head and neck attached. The whole was covered with a sheet with a small hole in the centre to allow just the rider's head to show.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100916021252/http://www.waldweihnachten.de/htm/schimmelreiter.htm Waldweihnachten: Schimmelreiter (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====

=====''Láir Bhán''=====
The teams of Irish mummers known as [[Wren day|Wrenboys]] who perform on [[Saint Stephen's Day]] (26 December) in pubs and private houses have been known to include a white hobby horse (''Láir Bhán'' – c.f. [[Hobby horse#Laare Vane|Laare Vane]], above) of the tourney type, and this has survived into the present century, at [[Dunquin]] in [[County Kerry]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vi6kuJIDw&amp;feature=related ''Dreoilín Dhún Chaoin'' / Dunquin Wren 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; At Ballycotton, in Co.

=====''Lajkonik''=====
::{{Main article|Lajkonik}}
The city of [[Kraków]] has a hobby-horse called the ''[[Lajkonik]]'' which traditionally appears on the first Thursday after the religious feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and parades through the streets, collecting money, accompanied by musicians and costumed followers, some in traditional Polish costume, others in oriental dress, who carry horsetail insignia. The colourful costume of the ''Lajkonik'' represents a bearded [[Tatars|Tatar]] warrior, who carries a golden mace and is mounted on a white horse. To be touched by the mace is said to bring good luck. The custom is said to have been carried on for 700 years, and various stories are told to explain its origins. The hobby horse has become an unofficial symbol of Kraków, and versions often appear as tourist attraction in the Market Square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lajkonik]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basque Country (greater region)|The Basque country]] on the borders of [[France]] and [[Spain]] has a strong [[Basque dance|dance tradition]]. Several dances are linked to seasonal festivals. The ''zamaltzain'', a hobby horse of the "tourney" type, with a small wooden head and a short, lacy skirt, takes part in some dances and processions in Zuberoa (La [[Soule]], the easternmost part of the Basque country) in places such as [[Espès-Undurein|Ezpeize]],&lt;ref name="carnivalkingofeurope.it"/&gt; [[Mauléon-Licharre|Maule]], [[Ordiarp|Urdiñarbe]], [[Barcus|Barkoxe]], [[Alçay|Altza]], [[Aussurucq|Altzürükü]] and [[Tardets-Sorholus|Atarratze]].&lt;ref name='DanseBasque'&gt;Truffaut, Thierry, ''La Danse Basque'', Lauburu, Bidart, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The "rider" wears elaborate costume of red or black including a ''koha'', a tall, beribboned hat, which always has a mirror on the front.&lt;ref name='DanseBasque'/&gt; "''Zamaltzain''" means muleteer or mule-keeper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011213144535/http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/ Online Basque dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The dance in which the "mules" take part is danced by two teams, one dressed in red, the other in black, and is said by some scholars (such as Eugène Goyhénèche of the University of Pau) to represent an attack on a village by the men of another.&lt;ref name='DanseBasque'/&gt;

=====Catalonia=====
[[File:Els Caballets of Olot 2008.jpg|thumb|right|''Els cavallets'' (the little horses) at [[Olot]], Catalonia]]
There are many festivals in the [[Catalonia]] region of north-east Spain which involve processions with [[Gigantes y cabezudos|giant]]s and outsize animals; some also involve hobby horses (of the "tourney" type, but with a more-or-less realistic head and body, nowadays often constructed from fibreglass).

Larger figures of [[mule]]s are also found in several places, carried by two performers whose legs are visible beneath a skirt hanging from the animal's hollow body. (In addition, [[dragon]]s of various sorts are also popular, as are bulls, eagles and lions; many have [[fireworks]] attached to them, or set off around them.

=====Fiesta de Santa Tecla, Tarragona=====
The [[Santa Tecla Festival]] takes place at [[Tarragona]] from 15–24 September and includes [[Thecla|the saint's]] day, 23 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tarragona.cat/lajuntament/conselleries/cultura/festes/santa-tecla/guia# |title=Official Santa Tecla website (in Catalan) |access-date=2011-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125195610/http://www.tarragona.cat/lajuntament/conselleries/cultura/festes/santa-tecla/guia# |archive-date=2011-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of animals, real and mythical, are impersonated in the parades that form a major part of the festivities. Among them is a larger-than-life ''Mulassa'' (mule) carried by two dancers who are hidden under its skirts, apart from their legs.

The other creatures that take part are the ''àliga'' (eagle), ''bou'' (bull), ''cucafera'' ([[Cuco|coco]], a mythical monster), ''drac de Sant Roc'' (dragon of [[Saint Roch]]), ''lleó'' (lion), and ''víbria'' (a female [[wyvern]] with prominent breasts). Several of these have fireworks attached to their extremities, or are showered with sparks by their attendants, and are a spectacular sight.

'''Kuda Kepang''' (woven bamboo horses, also known as ''Kuda Lumping'' or ''Jaran Kepang'') originate in the state of [[Johor]] and performances are often given at weddings by Malayan men of [[Java]]nese origin in [[Singapore]] and elsewhere. Led by a ''Danyang'', a typical troupe today comprises 9 horsemen, 2 medicine men, 5 [[gamelan]] musicians and 9–15 'guardians'.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100714054514/http://www.singaporekopitiam.sg/blogs/hidayah-amin/item/65-kuda-kepang Singapore Kopitam blog: Huda Kepang] Description of performances, with photographs and video links&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern performances re-enact the stories of the nine Muslim evangelists who waged battles to bring Islam to Java, but nowadays they are often kept brief and intended simply for entertainment; they may even be performed by women.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; The gamelan percussion orchestra is made up of 2 drums, a hanging gong, two knobbed gongs on a wooden frame, and 5 tubular bamboo chimes called ''angklung''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/folk/kuda_kepang.html Musical Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the fuller, more elaborate performances, however, include states of [[shaman]]istic [[trance]]-like possession, and the custom may have originally been a form of [[totem]]ic worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Folk_Dance/Kuda_Kepang/kuda_kepang.htm Dance Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs from the early 20th century, in the collection of Amsterdam's [[Tropenmuseum]] (Museum of the Tropics), show another ritual dance, the ''[[Reog|Reog Ponogoro]]'', involving a huge tiger mask and costume (''Singa Barong''), accompanied by ''Jatil'' riding woven bamboo hobby horses who perform the Jaran Kepang dance.

====Newfoundland Mummering====
In [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], hobby horses of the "mast" type were sometimes used by the mummers or 'janneys' who went [[mummering]] around the Christmas season; they also took a '''Christmas bull''', made in a similar manner, on their house-to-house visits. The mischievous horse was not intended to be malevolent, but its appearance and antics often frightened those it visited or encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/IntangibleCulturalHeritageUpdateDecember2009/ichupdate012web#page/n3/mode/2up O'Brien, Andrea, "The Hobby Horse", in ''Intangible Cultural Heritage Update'', Dec 2009, p2, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Mummering was dying out but has enjoyed a recent revival, and the first Mummers Festival (held in St John's in December 2009) even had workshops on making hobby horses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/IntangibleCulturalHeritageUpdateDecember2009/ichupdate012web#page/n3/mode/2up ''Intangible Cultural Heritage Update'', Dec 2009, pp3 &amp; 5, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/IchUpdate021-December2010/ichupdate021#page/n1/mode/2up Squarey, Melissa, "Hobby Horse Workshops" in ''Intangible Cultural Heritage Update'', Dec 2010, p2, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''hobby'' is glossed by the [[OED]] as "a small or middle-sized horse; an ambling or pacing horse; a pony." The word is attested in English from the 14th century, as [[Middle English]] ''hobyn''. [[Old French]] had ''hobin'' or ''haubby'', whence Modern French ''aubin'' and Italian ''ubino''. But the Old French term is apparently adopted from English rather than vice versa. OED connects it to "the by-name ''Hobin'', ''Hobby''", a variant of ''Robin''" (compare the abbreviation ''Hob'' for ''Robert''). This appears to have been a name customarily given to a cart-horse, as attested by [[White Kennett]] in his ''Parochial Antiquities '' (1695), who stated that "Our ploughmen to some one of their cart-horses generally give the name of Hobin, the very word which [[Philippe de Commines|Phil. Comines]] uses, Hist. VI. vii." Another familiar form of the same Christian name, ''Dobbin'' has also become a generic name for a cart-horse.

[[Samuel Johnson]], ''Dictionary of the English Language'', 1755, glosses "A strong, active horse, of a middle size, said to have been originally from Ireland; an ambling nag."

Hoblers or Hovellers were men who kept a light nag that they may give instant information of threatened invasion. (Old French, hober, to move up and down; our hobby, q.v.) In mediæval times their duties were to reconnoitre, to carry intelligence, to harass stragglers, to act as spies, to intercept convoys, and to pursue fugitives. [[Henry Spelman]] (d. 1641) derived the word from "hobby".

{{quote|Hobblers were another description of cavalry more lightly armed, and taken from the class of men rated at 15 pounds and upwards.|[[John Lingard]]|''The History of England'', (1819), vol. iv. chap. ii. p. 116.}}

The Border horses, called hobblers or [[Horses in the Middle Ages#Hobbies|hobbies]], were small and active, and trained to cross the most difficult and boggy country, "and to get over where our footmen could scarce dare to follow." - [[George MacDonald Fraser]], ''The Steel Bonnets, The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers''.

My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', the characters' hobby-horses, or particular obsessions, are discussed in detail. Here, Uncle Toby's obsession with the military leads to him and Trim - who gets caught up in Toby's enthusiasm - to begin acting out military actions. Illustration by [[George Cruikshank]].]]
From the term "hobby horse" came the expression "to ride one's hobby-horse", meaning "to follow a favourite pastime", and in turn, the modern sense of the term ''[[hobby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"hobby," ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2010-06-26. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50106771]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also connected to the ''[[draisine]]'', a forerunner of the [[bicycle]], invented by Baron [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]].  In 1818, a London coach-maker named Denis Johnson began producing an improved version, which was popularly known as the "hobby-horse".&lt;ref&gt;David V. Herlihy, ''Bicycle'', Yale University Press, 2004; pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic movement, [[Dada]], is possibly named after a French child's word for hobby horse.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, Dada &amp; les dadaïsmes, Paris, Gallimard, ''Folio Essais'', n° 257, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immigration officer''' is a [[law enforcement]] official whose job is to ensure that [[immigration]] legislation is enforced.  This can cover the rules of entry for [[Visa (document)|visa]] applicants, [[foreign national]]s or those seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and [[criminal law]]s.

==United Kingdom==
{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}
United Kingdom immigration officers were previously employees of the [[UK Border Agency]], and now work for [[Immigration Enforcement]], a [[Home Office]] command, and are appointed by the [[Home Secretary]], whose powers are conferred by the [[Immigration Act 1971]] and who also act in accordance with [[Immigration Rules]]. The Immigration Rules are statutory instruments laid down by [[Parliament]] under Section 3(2) of the 1971 Act which governs the regulation of entry into the United Kingdom. The Rules are amended by Primary Legislation when required, and provide a framework to ensure that those that come to, or remain in, the UK do so legally, and those that do not can be removed. Immigration officers' powers over citizens of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and their family members are governed by the [[EEA Regulations (UK)|Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006]].

Immigration officers have the power of arrest and detention conferred on them by the [[Immigration Act 1971]], when both at ports and inland. In practice, port immigration officers exercise powers under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 and inland immigration Officers under S28A-H of the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 17 of Schedule 2.  This has led to separate training for port and inland officers, where port officers are not trained in [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] (PACE).  "Designated Immigration Officers" are port immigration officers who have been trained in detention under PACE. The archetypal power of arrest is for an immigration or nationality offence, which involves a person's entitlement to be in the UK.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.immigration.media/what-are-immigration-officers-powers-of-stop-arrest/ "What are immigration officers powers of stop &amp; arrest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091352/http://www.immigration.media/what-are-immigration-officers-powers-of-stop-arrest/ |date=2015-04-02 }}, "Immigration Media", 20 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Though immigration officers also have powers of arrest outside immigration and nationality offences under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Crime and Courts Act 2013,&lt;ref name="what"/&gt; and under the Terrorism Act 2000 discussed below.

Before the UKBA was established, British immigration officers were not uniformed, but they now wear a uniform with rank insignia.

===At ports===
An immigration officer at a port has the power to detain any person without arrest who is not a [[British citizen]] to investigate whether they qualify for entry to the United Kingdom under Schedule 2 of the [[Immigration Act 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1971/cukpga_19710077_en_5#pt3-l1g19 Immigration Act 1971(c. 77)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schedule 2 also gives an immigration officer the power to arrest without warrant anyone who is liable to detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1971/cukpga_19710077_en_11#sch2 Para 17, Schedule 2, Immigration Act 1971(c. 77)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act created a provision for the Secretary of State to designate individuals as a "general customs official".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090011_en_2#pt1-pb2-l1g3 |title=Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration officers who have received the appropriate training are designated as general customs officials and can carry out customs functions in additions to their immigration ones. The passing of the act supersedes the process where the Customs Commissioners would designate officers as customs officials.

Designated Immigration Officers (DIOs) are designated by the Home Secretary, and only if they are fit and proper for the purpose, and suitably trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070030_en_1#pb1-l1g1 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Section 2 of the UK Borders Act, DIOs can detain any person without arrest in a port in [[England]], [[Wales]] or [[Northern Ireland]] if they think that the individual may be liable to [[arrest]] by a [[constable]] for any offence under Section 24 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] or Article 26(1), (2) or (3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, or if there is a warrant for their arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070030_en_1#pb1-l1g1 Section 2, UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They can be searched and detained using reasonable force for up to three hours, and can be pursued if they leave the port.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070030_en_1#pb1-l1g2 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a DIO detains a person, they must arrange for a constable to attend as soon as is reasonably practicable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; It is an offence to abscond, assault or obstruct a DIO exercising their powers under this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070030_en_1#pb1-l1g3 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Immigration Officers also have far broader powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 to examine, question, and search anyone in order to establish whether or not they appear to be or have been concerned in the commission, preparation or
instigation of acts of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_19#sch7 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be detained under Schedule 7 for up to 9 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Act 2007. Schedule 7, para. 6(4)&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Officer need not have reasonable suspicion that the detainee has in fact been involved in terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Act 2007. Schedule 7, para 2(4)&lt;/ref&gt; The detainee has a duty to provide the Immigration Officer with all information requested and a failure to do so constitutes an offence, punishable by 3 months imprisonment and a fine.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorism Act 2007. Schedule 7, para 5(a) and para 18(2)(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inland ===

The '''Islamic Defenders Front''' ({{lang-ar|  الجبهة الدفاعية الإسلامية}}),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trackingterrorism.org/group/front-pembela-islam-islamic-defenders-front-fpi Front Pembela Islam (Islamic Defenders Front -- FPI].

''Human Rights Without Frontiers''.&lt;/ref&gt; also known by the acronym '''FPI''' ({{lang-id|'''Front Pembela Islam'''}}) or '''Islam Defenders Front''', is a [[far-right]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamist]] [[Indonesia]]n political organization formed in 1998. It was founded by [[Muhammad Rizieq Shihab]] with the backing from Indonesian military, police generals and political elites.&lt;ref name="ICG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wi"/&gt; The organization's leader is Ahmad Shabri Lubis who was inaugurated in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimedianews.com/2015/05/ini-ketua-umum-fpi-yang-baru-ust-ahmad.html Ini Ketua Umu FPI Yang Baru Ust.

FPI originally started as a civil [[vigilante]] that positioned itself as an [[Islamic religious police|Islamic moral police against vice]], whose activity was unauthorized by the government. FPI targeted several ''[[warung]]s'', stores, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues which were perceived as discourteous for selling [[Alcohol in Indonesia|alcohol]] or open during [[Ramadhan]].&lt;ref name="Jejak FPI-CNN"/&gt; 
Later, it transformed itself into an Islamist [[pressure group]] with active [[online campaign]]s.&lt;ref name="JP-FPI-Chinese Indo"&gt;{{cite news | title = FPI threatens Chinese Indonesians | author = Sita W.

The organization has been known to have organized various religious or political mass protests; the most prominent example being the [[November 2016 Jakarta protests]] and several other rallies against the incumbent [[Jakarta]] governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]] in the following months. Other prominent protests orchestrated by FPI is a rally in the American Embassy condemning the [[Iraq War]], which dates back as far as late 2003. The protests are criticized as conducting [[hate crime]]s in the name of [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Frost  | first = Frank  | author2 = Rann, Ann  | author3 = Chin, Andrew  | title = Terrorism in Southeast Asia  | publisher = Parliament of Australia, Parliamentary Library  | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/FAD/sea.htm  | accessdate = 2010-11-30  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100328010709/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/FAD/sea.htm  | archivedate = 2010-03-28  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jejak FPI-CNN"&gt;{{cite news | title = Jejak FPI dan Status 'Napi' Rizieq Shihab | author1 = M Andika Putra | author2 = Raja Eben Lumbanrau | work = CNN Indonesia | date = 17 January 2017| url = http://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20170117092140-20-186830/jejak-fpi-dan-status-napi-rizieq-shihab/ | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and religious-related violence.&lt;ref name="JP-FPI disband call"&gt;{{cite news | title = Petition calls for disbandment of FPI |author = Arya Dipa | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 18 January 2017 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/18/petition-calls-for-disbandment-of-fpi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FPI was founded on 17 August 1998 by [[Muhammad Rizieq Shihab|Habib Muhammad Rizieq Syihab]]. Rizieq Shihab is a [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] [[Arab Indonesians|Arab Indonesian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arrohim.com/biografi-ringkas-al-habib-m-rizieq-bin-husein-syihab |title=Biografi Ringkas Al Habib M.

The establishment received backing from military and police generals, including former Jakarta Police Chief Nugroho Jayusman. It is also associated with former [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] commander [[Wiranto]].&lt;ref name="ICG"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Indonesia: Implications of the Ahmadiyah Decree |journal=International Crisis Group Update Briefing |issue=78 |publisher=International Crisis Group |location=Jakarta/Brussels |date=7 July 2008 |url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Indonesia_08_07_07_Implications_of_the_Ahmadiya_Decree.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked US diplomatic cables obtained through [[WikiLeaks]] say that FPI allegedly received funding from the police and former political elites.&lt;ref name="wi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/05/wikileaks-national-police-funded-fpi-hard-liners.html |title=WikiLeaks: National Police funded FPI hard-liners |date=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization nominally aims to implement [[sharia]] law in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Bu"&gt;{{Citation |last=Budi Setiyarso |title=Street Warriors |newspaper=Tempo magazine, English edition |pages=41 |date=30 November 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it transformed itself into an Islamist pressure group which furthers their political motives by promoting what is considered as religious or racial propaganda throughout the Internet and occasional anti-government campaigns.&lt;ref name="JP-FPI-Chinese Indo" /&gt; However, in January 2017, several FPI's official [[Twitter]] accounts were suspended due to violations of Twitter rules, including spamming, incivility and threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC Indonesia |title=Pembekuan akun Twitter FPI 'bukan permintaan' Kominfo |date=16 January 2017 |url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-38633797 |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and actions==
===Actions against religious pluralism===
FPI has been vocal against [[liberalism]] and [[multiculturalism]], and to the extension [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] doctrine which upholds religious pluralism. On 1 June 2008, FPI staged an attack against members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were holding a rally coinciding the commemoration day of Pancasila near the [[Monas]] monument in the city center. The attack was upheld as a response to the perceived threat by AKKBB against FPI. The incident was referred to by media as [[Monas Incident]]. The incident had caused media outrage and lead to the arrest of Rizieq Shihab among 56 other FPI members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | title = Hard-liners ambush Monas rally   | newspaper = [[The Jakarta Post]]| location = Jakarta    | date = 2 June 2008  | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/02/hardliners-ambush-monas-rally.html  | accessdate = 2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizieq was later imprisoned for one year and six months, after being convicted over attacks against masses of AKKBB.&lt;ref name="Jejak FPI-CNN"/&gt; In January 2017, Police declared FPI leader Rizieq Shihab a suspect for alleged Pancasila defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police declare FPI leader Rizieq Shihab suspect for alleged Pancasila defamation | author = Arya Dipa | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = January 30, 2017| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/30/police-declare-fpi-leader-rizieq-shihab-suspect-for-alleged-pancasila-defamation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FPI also often holds protests against what it sees as [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christianization of Indonesia]]. Notable cases include GKI Yasmin Bogor, and HKBP Church Bekasi, where the group used violence to force them to close down their churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2012/01/24/173379395/Masalah-GKI-Yasmin-Jadi-Catatan-Dunia|title=Masalah GKI Yasmin Jadi Catatan Dunia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/bekasi-fpi-leader-murhali-implicated-in-stabbing-of-hkbp-church-elder/396223|title=Bekasi FPI Leader Murhali Implicated in Stabbing of HKBP Church Elder|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920083210/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/bekasi-fpi-leader-murhali-implicated-in-stabbing-of-hkbp-church-elder/396223|archivedate=2010-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FPI also endorsed the [[Singkil]] administration for closing around 20 churches in Singkil, [[Aceh]]. The Singkil case stirred the controversy for the use of the [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|local administrative law in accordance with Sharia]], which runs counter against the Indonesian constitution which guarantees freedom of religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgi.or.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=409:catatan-kronologis-penyegelan-gereja-gereja-di-aceh-singkil&amp;catid=95:liputan-pgi&amp;Itemid=486|title=Catatan Kronologis Penyegelan Gereja-gereja di Aceh Singkil}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, FPI and related Islamist groups staged a mass protest against the construction of a new Christian church in [[Bekasi]], [[West Java]]. The protest developed into a riot and scuffle with the police, resulting in several property damages and five police officers left injured.&lt;ref&gt; http://m.liputan6.com/news/read/2898273/demo-tolak-pembangunan-gereja-di-bekasi-ricuh-5-polisi-terluka &lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions against Ahmadiyya===
One of Rizieq Shihab's propaganda campaign openly called for hostility against [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadis]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woodward |first=Mark  |last2=Rohmaniyah |first2=Inayah  |last3=Amin|first3=Ali |last4=Ma’arif|first4=Samsul  |last5=Coleman |first5=Diana Murtaugh |last6=Umar |first6=Muhammad Sani |date=2012 |title=Ordering what is right, forbidding what is wrong:two faces of Hadhrami dakwah in contemporary Indonesia |url=https://www.academia.edu/4439444/Ordering_what_is_right_forbidding_what_is_wrong_two_faces_of_Hadhrami_dakwah_in_contemporary_Indonesia |journal= |volume=46 |number=2 |pages=132 136 (our of pp. 105–46) |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''We call on the Muslim community. Let us go to war with Ahmadiyyah! Kill Ahmadiyyah wherever they are!........ And, if they talk about human rights? Human rights are satanic! Human rights are crap!.....If they want to know who is responsible for killing Ahmadiyyah, it is I; it is FPI and others from the Muslim community who are responsible for killing Ahmadiyyah! Say that Sobri Lubis ordered it, that Habib Rizieq and FPI ordered it! ''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

FPI has been suspected acting in the background of the assault of the Ahmadiyya community and killing of three on 6 February in 2011. The assault was led by a group of over thousand people, wielding rocks, machetes, swords, and spears. The group attacked the house of an Ahmadi leader in Cikeusik, [[Banten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/indonesia-ahmadiyya-killings-verdicts-will-not-stem-discrimination-2011-07-28|title=Indonesia: Ahmadiyya killings verdicts will not stem discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a group attacked the Ahmadiyya headquarters near [[Bogor]] and harassed its members in areas such as in [[East Lombok]], Manislor, [[Tasikmalaya]], [[Parung]], and [[Garut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifelived/indonesias-ahmadis-look-for-a-home-in-novel/522461|title=Indonesia's Ahmadis Look for a Home in Novel|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910142510/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifelived/indonesias-ahmadis-look-for-a-home-in-novel/522461|archivedate=2012-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions against perceived communist threat===
FPI often employs [[anti-communism]] as its political motivation. In June 2010, along with other organizations, FPI attacked a meeting on free healthcare in [[East Java]], mistaking it for a meeting of the banned [[Communist Party of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | title = ‘Deplorable’ FPI Strikes Again   | newspaper = [[The Jakarta Globe]]   | location = Jakarta   | date = 25 June 2010   | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/deplorable-fpi-strikes-again/382537   | accessdate = 2010-11-30   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100628142839/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/deplorable-fpi-strikes-again/382537   | archivedate = 28 June 2010   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, FPI called for the withdrawal of [[Rupiah]] banknotes, accused them of displaying the image of the banned [[hammer and sickle]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FPI leader calls for withdrawal of banknotes with ‘communist symbol’ | author = Safrin La Batu | newspaper =  The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = January 23, 2017| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/23/fpi-leader-calls-for-withdrawal-of-banknotes-with-communist-symbol.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; FPI allegations, however, was rejected by [[Bank Indonesia]] (BI), referring to it as a [[recto-verso]] security feature of BI logo for the new Rupiah banknotes. FPI was accused of stirring public unrest by slandering Bank Indonesia and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FPI leader questioned for allegedly insulting rupiah | author = Safrin La Batu | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = January 23, 2017| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/23/fpi-leader-questioned-for-allegedly-insulting-rupiah.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-government campaigns and relations with opposition parties===
The FPI has been vocal in campaigns against the incumbent governments, starting in President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono|Yudhoyono]]'s presidency. The campaign is said to be more intense during the [[Joko Widodo]] era and after [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]]'s alleged blasphemy case in 2016. Because of this, the FPI is widely seen as an opposition movement, and is reportedly known to have close relations with opposition coalition parties. Various FPI leaders and senior cadres recently developed closer ties with numerous opposition figures.

===Actions against perceived defamation of Islamic sensitivity===
FPI had been sensitive toward the perceived defamation and violation of Islamic norms in various aspects of society. In its early days, FPI had targeted shops at Garut and [[Makassar]] that sold alcohol during Ramadan month, some of which were reportedly ransacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/garut-police-take-a-stance-against-fpi/|title=Garut Police Take a Stance Against FPI| newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] | date = 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nightclubs, bars, and cafes have been also targeted by FPI for perceived unconformity with the Islamic norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bamualim  |first1=Chaider S. |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |title=Islamic Militancy and Resentment against Hadhramis in Post-Suharto Indonesia: A Case Study of Habib Rizieq Syihab and His Islam Defenders Front  |url=http://cssaame.dukejournals.org/content/31/2/267.abstract |journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East |volume=31 |number=2 |pages=267-281 |doi=10.1215/1089201X-1264226 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, FPI and other Islamic organizations including [[Indonesian Mujahedeen Council]] had protested against the issue of ''[[Playboy Indonesia]]''. The protest had led to the eviction of the ''Playboy'' office from Jakarta to [[Bali]].&lt;ref name=jap&gt;{{cite news|author=Jane Perlez|title=Playboy Indonesia: Modest Flesh Meets Muslim Faith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/world/asia/24bali.html?_r=0|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=24 July 2006|location=Denpasar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, FPI accused [[LGBT]] activists, such as [[Lady Gaga]]&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; and [[Irshad Manji]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/10/irshad-manji-book-tour-in-indonesia-runs-into-trouble-with-islamic-thugs/|title=Irshad Manji book tour in Indonesia runs into trouble with Islamic ‘thugs'}}&lt;/ref&gt; of being "devils", and threatened their safety. This had erupted controversy in 2013 during [[Born This Way Ball#Controversies|the Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way tour'']],&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18224783|title=Lady Gaga 'devastated' as Indonesia concert cancelled}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the eventual cancellation of concerts in Indonesia. The action was criticized for being a violation of Indonesian law sanctioning violent threat, as prescribed in Kitab Undang-Undang Pidana, article 336.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hukum.unsrat.ac.id/uu/kuhpidana.htm|title=KITAB UNDANG-UNDANG HUKUM PIDANA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, FPI lambasted the Regent of [[Purwakarta]], [[Dedi Mulyadi]], accusing him of being a ''[[Shirk (Islam)|musyrik]]'' (polytheist) after he put up statues of [[Wayang golek|Sundanese puppet characters]] in a number of city parks throughout Purwakarta in West Java. FPI considered Dedi of debasing Islamic tenets by violating the [[Aniconism in Islam|aniconist principle of Islam]], as well as using the [[Sundanese culture|Sundanese]] greeting ''Sampurasun'', instead of the Muslim-approved ''[[Assalamualaikum]]''. In December 2015, around a hundred FPI members conducted sweeping against the Regent. Its members inspected cars passing through the front gate of [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] (TIM) in Central Jakarta where the Indonesia Theater Federation Award was being held, attempting to stop Dedi from attending the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police under fire for allowing sweeping FPI raids | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = 31 December 2015 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/31/police-under-fire-allowing-sweeping-fpi-raids.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition and uprising against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama===
FPI had been known for its constant efforts to topple the administration of Jakarta governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], popularly known as ''Ahok''. FPI had criticized Basuki's background as a [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]] and [[Chinese Indonesian]], both being the minority, citing that the position of the governor of Jakarta should be reserved only for [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="JP-FPI-Chinese Indo"/&gt; In 2014, FPI held a demonstration in front of Jakarta DPRD Building. FPI refused Basuki to become Jakarta's governor after being left by [[Joko Widodo]] who was elected as [[President of Indonesia|President]] in the same year.&lt;ref name="Jejak FPI-CNN"/&gt;

In late 2016, during the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017|2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election season]], FPI led the national outrage against Basuki for his alleged [[blasphemy]] against the [[Qur'an]]. As a response to the perceived blasphemy, FPI had made seven protests titled "Aksi Bela Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-05|title=Aksi Bela Islam|url=https://id.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aksi_Bela_Islam&amp;oldid=12913388|journal=Wikipedia bahasa Indonesia, ensiklopedia bebas|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;", (Indonesian for "Action for Defending Islam") in order to create a pressure against Basuki and demanded for his imprisonment. The protests were culminated in [[November 2016 Jakarta protests]], [[December 2016 Jakarta protests]] and [[February 2017 Jakarta protests]]. They were done once a month until Basuki's final conviction on May 2017, in which he was sentenced to two years.

==Receptions==
===General public===
There have been calls by Indonesians, mainly mainstream Muslims, other religious organizations, political communities and ethnic groups, FPI to be disbanded or banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 19 January 2017 | title = Protesters Deliver Petition, Demand FPI to be Disbanded | author = Iqbal T Lazuardi S |work = Tempo.co| url = https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2017/01/19/055837759/Protesters-Deliver-Petition-Demand-FPI-to-be-Disbanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Demo, Ratusan Warga Dayak Minta FPI Dibubarkan | date = 20 January 2017 | author = Caroline Damanik | work = Kompas.com | language = Indonesian | url = http://regional.kompas.com/read/2017/01/20/16023791/demo.ratusan.warga.dayak.minta.fpi.dibubarkan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various critics and media outlets have described FPI as inciting [[Islamic extremism|extremism]], [[racism]] and [[bigotry]], particularly noting its occasional hate crimes, [[discrimination]] against minority and [[religious intolerance]].&lt;ref name="JP-FPI disband call"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = University Students in Manado Take to Streets to Demand FPI Disbandment | work = Jakarta Globe | url = http://jakartaglobe.id/news/university-students-manado-take-streets-demand-fpi-disbandment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Crisis Report called it "an urban thug organization", emphasizing on their violent vigilantism.&lt;ref name="ICG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bu"/&gt; The group has been also criticized for the use of violence; the police have recorded that FPI engaged in 29 cases of violence and destructive behaviour in 2010 and 5 cases in 2011 in the following provinces: West Java, Banten Province, [[Central Java]], [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.kompas.com/read/2012/02/19/08095913/FPI.Involved.in.34.Violence.Cases.in.2010-2011 |title=FPI Involved in 34 Violence Cases in 2010-2011 |date=February 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010323/http://english.kompas.com/read/2012/02/19/08095913/FPI.Involved.in.34.Violence.Cases.in.2010-2011 |archivedate=October 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection in Kalimantan ===
On February 11, 2012 hundreds of protesters from the local community in [[Palangkaraya]], [[Central Kalimantan]]; mainly from the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribe; staged a protest at the [[Tjilik Riwut Airport]] to block the arrival of four senior leaders of the group, who wanted to inaugurate the provincial branch of the organization. Due to security concerns, the management of the airport ordered all FPI members to remain on board of the aircraft while other passengers disembarked. FPI members were then flown to [[Banjarmasin]] in [[South Kalimantan]]. The deputy chairman of the Central Kalimantan Dayak Tribe Council (DAD) later said that the organization had asked the Central Kalimantan Police to ban the group's provincial chapter as FPI's presence would create tension, particularly as Central Kalimantan is known as a place conducive to religious harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/11/senior-fpi-officials-booted-out-palangkaraya.html |title=Senior FPI officials booted out of Palangkaraya |date=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213195142/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/11/senior-fpi-officials-booted-out-palangkaraya.html |archivedate=February 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal letter from the Central Kalimantan administration stated that they firmly rejected FPI and would not let them establish a chapter in the province because it "contradicts the local wisdom of the Dayak tribe that upholds peace". The letter was sent to the Minister of Coordination of Political, Legal and Security Affairs with copies being sent to the President of Indonesia, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] Chief, the Speaker of the House, the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|the Home Minister]] and the National Police Chief. Up till now, FPI has been banned all over the Kalimantan Region by Kalimantan's people for their disruptive and divisive actions against their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/23/central-kalimantan-officially-rejects-fpi.html |title=Central Kalimantan officially rejects FPI |date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">'''John Thompson Platts''' (1830–1904), was a British language scholar. His [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hindi]] grammars were a marked advance upon the work of any English predecessor, and are still in use today.

==Biography==

Platts was born in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], on 1 August 1830, the second son of Robert Platts of [[Calcutta]], who died young leaving behind a large family and a widow in difficult circumstances. After being educated at [[Bedford School]] in England, Platts returned to [[India]] and, between 1858 and 1859, worked as [[mathematics]] master at Benares College and in charge of Saugor School in the [[Central Provinces]].  In 1861 he was appointed mathematical professor and headmaster of Benares College. In 1864, Platts became assistant inspector of schools, second circle, [[North-West Provinces|Northwest Provinces]] and, in 1868, he became officiating inspector of schools, northern circle, Central Provinces. He retired in March 1872, owing to ill-health.

Platts then returned to [[England]], and settling in [[Ealing]], occupying himself by teaching [[Hindi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], having mastered both languages. In June 1880, he was elected teacher of [[Persian language]] at [[Oxford University]]. He matriculated from [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in February 1881 and, in June 1881, became Master of Arts ''[[honoris causa]]''. In March 1901, he received the degree of Master of Arts by decree. He died suddenly in [[London]] on 21 September 1904, and was buried at [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] near [[Oxford]].

Platts married twice: first, in 1856, in [[Lahore]], [[India]], to Alice Jane Kenyon, by whom he had three sons and four daughters; and second, in 1876, to Mary Elizabeth Hayes of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. They had one son.

*2. ''A Hindustani-English Dictionary'' (1881).
*3. ''A Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi, and English'' (1884).
*4. ''A Grammar of the Persian Language, Part I: Accidence'' (1894).
*He also edited the text of ''Gulistan of Sa'di'' (1872), and published ''Sa'di (Shaikh Muslihuddin Shirazi)'', photographed from manuscripts under his supervision (1891). He translated the ''Ikhwanu-s-Safa'' of Maulavi Ikram Ali (1875), and the ''Gulistan of Sa'di'' (1876).

The '''Top Ten List''' was a regular segment of the [[television program]]s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].'' Each night, host [[David Letterman]] would present a list of ten items, compiled by his writing staff, that circulated around a common theme.

The lists were usually given humorous topics such as, ''Top Ten Signs Your Kid Had A Bad First Day At School'' or, ''Top Ten Rejected James Bond Gadgets'' or based on current events. Letterman would also occasionally give an intentionally absurd and mundane category, such as ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_qMMZgmLF8 Top Ten Numbers Between One and Ten]'', drawing humor from the silliness of ranking such mundane items.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

== Origin ==
Letterman's top ten skit was thought of when [[Steve O'Donnell (writer)|Steve O'Donnell]] was head writer of the "Late Night With David Letterman" show.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{citation |work= [[People (magazine)|People]] |date= 1990-08-27 |volume= 34 |issue= 8 |title= And the No.1 Reason David Letterman Keeps Reading the Top 10 List–Well, It's Funnier Than His Monologue |first=Tom|last=Gliatto|authorlink=Tom Gliatto|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118559,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;{{citation |work= [[Reading Eagle]] |author=Larry McShane, Associated Press |date=1991-11-02 |title=Letterman lists take country by storm |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19911102&amp;id=OeUiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MaMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1276,529629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Donnell, the Top Ten List was an "almost simultaneous inspiration arriving from staffers [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]], Randy Cohen and Robert “Morty” Morton — largely prompted by the ridiculous 'eligible bachelor' lists in a local New York paper that included the 84-year-old [[William S. Paley|Bill Paley]]. 'Why, we can put such nonsense together ourselves!' we exclaimed. And we did." &lt;ref name=steve&gt;{{citation |work= [[New York Times]] |title= David Letterman’s Top Ten On Air Moments |author= [[Steve O’Donnell]] |date=2015-05-07 |url= http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/david-letterman-top-10-moments-steve-odonnell/?ref=t-magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 1985, the very first list, "The Top Ten Things That Almost Rhyme With Peas" was broadcast.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{citation |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |title= No chance of a list-less columnist this time of year |author= [[Phil Rosenthal]] |date= 2009-12-13 |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-sun-phil-rosenthal-1213dec13,0,3569113.column |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091218165409/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-sun-phil-rosenthal-1213dec13,0,3569113.column |archivedate= 2009-12-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The switch from NBC to CBS ==
Before Letterman's departure for CBS, NBC had insisted that the "Top Ten List" was the [[intellectual property]] of the network, and demanded that it not be used on his new show; Letterman rebutted that the list was not NBC's property or even his own, since he had stolen the concept from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wivb.com/2015/05/20/news-4s-close-encounters-with-david-letterman-from-the-90s/|last=Walker|first=Jacquie|title=News 4's close encounters with David Letterman from the 90s|work=WIVB-TV|date=May 20, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loose compromise was reached where it would be renamed the "Late Show Top Ten," although Letterman would soon simply refer to it once again as the "Top Ten List," with no repercussions.

The only significant modifications in the ''Late Show'' years have been the elimination of mentioning a "home office" (such as [[Wahoo, Nebraska]]),{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the addition of a computer-animated introduction and closing as well as background graphics.

== Presentation ==
[[File:U.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno, left, and Soldiers assigned to the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) perform the Top 10 list on the "Late Show with David Letterman" in New York City June 12, 2013 130612-A-KF670-001.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Army soldiers present a Top 10 List on the ''Late Show'' in June 2013.]]The entries are read by Letterman in reverse countdown order, and are accompanied by a [[drum roll]] performed by [[CBS Orchestra]] drummer [[Anton Fig]]. There are six montages: the pyramids, the athletes (usually used for a sports-themed top ten list), the taxi cabs, the water towers, the sewer covers, and, in time for the [[United States Presidential Election, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]], the campaign trail.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The conclusion of the list is then followed by a brief performance by the band, usually a pop song relating to the topic of the list in some way.

Occasionally, the list is given by a guest presenter (such as [[John Malkovich]] reading "Ten Things That Sound Creepy When Said by John Malkovich" or [[Casey Kasem]] reading the recurring category "Top Ten Numbers Between One and Ten"). At times, the list has also been given by a series of presenters, with each providing one entry; for example, the list for "Ten Things I've Always Wanted to Say to Dave", was used for Letterman's final show in 2015 and included entries from [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Tina Fey]] and [[Bill Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Late Night with David Letterman:’ Stars recite final Top 10 list|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/david-letterman-final-top-10-list-article-1.2230190|accessdate=May 21, 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four animated characters have recited a Top Ten list on the show:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Homer Simpson]] (3 times), [[Peter Griffin]], [[Stewie Griffin]] and [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]].

Perhaps to break the monotony of daily list, the show will occasionally add a twist to the presentation, sometimes by altering the nature of the list itself. One notable example occurred on November 27, 2001. Introduced as "Top Ten Ways [[Osama bin Laden]] Can Improve His Image," the list consisted of only one entry: "#10. There's no way he can improve his image. He's a murdering, soul-less asshole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=McIntee | first=Mark | title=This Week's Show Recap: Monday, December 31, 2001 Show#1717 | publisher=CBS.com | date = November 27, 2001|quote=quote, then "End of list. One item. That's all that was needed. And the audience showed their appreciation by giving the longest sustained applause since Dave's return from his heart thing. This told me one of two things. 1. The audience either loved this Top Ten list, or 2. They hate the Top Ten in general and were glad it was only one item.|url=http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20011231.phtml | accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common source of confusion regarding the Top Ten List is why the #1 entry is usually seen as the least funny. This even inspired the ''Late Show'' to run a pre-taped bit in 1998, humorously exploring the apparent mystery, and to mention it again on December 29, 1999, when the list "Top Ten Phrases That Were Not Spoken This Millennium," included the #1 entry of, "Why is the number one always so damn funny?"  Writer [[Bill Scheft]] confirmed this in a 2007 interview on ''[[Costas on the Radio]]'', stating that the writers use the three funniest entries on #10 (to start the list strong), #6, (which usually accompanies an on-screen slide change), and #2 (the last opportunity for a laugh before the completion of the bit).

David Letterman and the Late Show writers have released four volumes of Top Ten Lists through CBS book publisher, [[Pocket Books]]. The first two volumes were originally released in hardcover and later mass-market paperback editions while the latter two editions only had hardcover releases.
* ''The "Late Night with David Letterman" Book of Top Ten Lists'' (1990).&lt;ref name="Top10Book1"/&gt;
* ''Roman Numeral Two!! An Altogether New Book of Top Ten Lists from "Late Night with David Letterman"'' (1991).&lt;ref name="Top10Book2"/&gt;
* ''David Letterman's Book of Top Ten Lists and Zesty Lo-Cal Chicken Recipes.''  (1995).&lt;ref name="Top10Book3"/&gt;
* ''David Letterman's NEW Book of Top Ten Lists and Wedding Patterns for the Husky Bride'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Top10Book4"/&gt;

==Radio usage==
For nearly two decades each Top Ten list was packaged into a nationally syndicated radio feature, distributed by [[WestwoodOne|Westwood One]] for use the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dial-global.com/index.php/programming/features/late-show-with-david-letterman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502072600/http://dial-global.com/index.php/programming/features/late-show-with-david-letterman |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following shows from which the list was omitted, or if Letterman was on vacation, the feature would utilize a list from the archives. The feature was often edited for time, and occasionally edited for content which may have been appropriate for late-night TV, but not morning radio.

In late 2013 Westwood One informed "Top 10" affiliates that it was ceasing distribution of the feature.  The last Top 10 list for radio aired Friday, January 3, 2014.  No other radio network picked up the feature for the rest of the TV show's run.

==In popular culture==
The television [[cartoon]] ''[[Garfield &amp; Friends]]'' referenced the feature with an episode entitled ''Top Ten,'' where [[Garfield]] presents Top Ten lists on various topics ranging from "How to Tell When Garfield is Full," and "Why [[Jon Arbuckle]] Will Never Have a Date," to "Why the House will Never Get Robbed."  The Buddy Bears provide the accompanying music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhchWAGdUbY|title=Garfield &amp; Friends - A Matter of Conscience, Grape Expectations, Top Ten|first=|last=Bonkers D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1601">'''Mesoamerican creation myths''' are the collection of [[creation myth]]s attributed to, or documented for, the various cultures and civilizations of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Mesoamerican literature]].

The Maya gods included [[Kukulkán]] (also known by the [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] name [[Gukumatz]] and the Aztec name [[Quetzalcoatl]]) and [[Tepeu]]. The two were referred to as the Creators, the Forefathers or the Makers. According to the story, the two gods decided to preserve their legacy by creating an Earth-bound species looking like them. The first attempt was man made from mud, but Tepeu and Kukulkán found that the mud crumbled. The two gods summoned the other gods, and together they decided to make man from wood. However, since these men had no soul and soon lost loyalty to the creators, the gods destroyed them by rain. Finally, man was constructed from [[maize]], the Mayans staple and sacred food. The deity [[Itzamna]] is credited as being the creator of the calendar along with creating writing.

{{italic title}}
{{Nihongo3||物の哀れ|'''Mono no aware'''}}, literally "the pathos of things", and also translated as "an empathy toward things", or "a sensitivity to ephemera", is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for the awareness of {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life.

==Origins==
The term comes from Heian period literature, but was picked up and used by 18th century [[Edo period]] Japanese cultural scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]] in his literary criticism of ''[[The Tale of Genji]],'' and later to other seminal Japanese works including the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. It became central to his philosophy of literature and eventually to [[Culture of Japan|Japanese cultural tradition]].

==Etymology==
The phrase is derived from the Japanese word {{nihongo3||物|mono}}, which means "thing", and {{nihongo3||哀れ|aware}}, which was a [[Heian period]] expression of measured surprise (similar to "ah" or "oh"), translating roughly as "pathos", "poignancy", "deep feeling", "sensitivity", or "awareness".  Thus, ''mono no aware'' has frequently been translated as "the 'ahh-ness' of things", life, and love. Awareness of the transience of all things heightens appreciation of their beauty, and evokes a gentle sadness at their passing. In his criticism of ''The Tale of Genji'' Motoori noted that ''mono no aware'' is the crucial emotion that moves readers. Its scope was not limited to [[Japanese literature]], and became associated with Japanese cultural tradition (see also ''[[sakura]]'').&lt;ref name=khoon&gt;Choy Lee, Khoon. ''Japan: Between Myth and Reality''. 1995, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
Notable [[manga]] artists who use ''mono no aware''–style storytelling include [[Hitoshi Ashinano]], [[Kozue Amano]], and [[Kaoru Mori]]. In [[anime]], both ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' by [[Isao Takahata]] and ''[[Mai Mai Miracle]]'' by [[Sunao Katabuchi]] emphasize the passing of time in gentle notes and by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past.  The Japanese director [[Yasujirō Ozu]] was well known for creating a sense of ''mono no aware'', frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying {{nihongo3|"Fine weather, isn't it?"|いい天気ですね|''"''Ii tenki desu ne''?"''}}, after a familial and societal paradigm shift, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan. Ozu has often expressed feelings by showing the faces of objects rather than the face of an actor. Some examples include two fathers contemplating the rocks in a "dry landscape" garden, and a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just left home after getting married. These images exemplified ''mono no aware'' as powerfully as the expression on the greatest actor's face.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/|title=2. Mono no aware: the Pathos of Things|last=|first=|date=10 October 2011|website=plato.stanford.edu|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his book about courtly life in [[ancient Japan]], ''The World of the Shining Prince'', [[Ivan Morris]] compares ''mono no aware'' to [[Virgil]]'s term ''[[lacrimae rerum]]'', Latin for "tears of things".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Ivan I. ''The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan''. 1994, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] author [[Ken Liu]]'s short story, "Mono no Aware", won the 2013 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906045317/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by works like the science fiction manga ''[[Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō]]'', Liu sought to evoke an "aesthetic primarily oriented towards creating in the reader an empathy towards the inevitable passing of all things", and to acknowledge "the importance of memory and continuity with the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mamatas |first=Nick |title=Q/A With Ken Liu (and the return of Intern Kathleen) |url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |publisher=Haikasoru |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040356/http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]- and [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]]-winning British novelist [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] ends many of his novels without any sense of resolution. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realization brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection of the Japanese idea of ''mono no aware''.

Films like [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]'', [[ Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[Black Rain (1989 Japanese film)|Black Rain]]'' and [[ Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[I Live in Fear]]'' have all been associated with the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|title=BLACK RAIN: Reflections on Hiroshima and Nuclear War in Japanese Film|author=|date=|website=www.crosscurrents.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174259/http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known examples of ''mono no aware'' in contemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, found throughout Japanese art and perpetuated by the large masses of people that travel annually to view and picnic under cherry trees. The trees are not considered to be of special value concerning their beauty in relation to other trees, such as apple or pear trees. Cherry tree blossoms are valued because of their transience, normally associated with the fact that the blossoms fall off the tree after only a week or so after first budding. It is the evanescence of the beauty of the cherry blossom that evokes the weary perspective of ''mono no aware'' in the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''National Gallery''' is an [[art museum]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in [[Central London]]. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} 

The Gallery is an [[exempt charity]], and a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/organisation/constitution/ |title=Constitution |publisher=The National Gallery |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406213015/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/organisation/constitution/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. It is among the [[List of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums]] in the world, after the [[Louvre]], the [[British Museum]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="worldrank"&gt;[http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheArtNewspaper2013_ranking.pdf Top 100 Art Museum Attendance], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 2014. Retrieved on 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] bought 38 paintings from the heirs of [[John Julius Angerstein]] in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]], and by private donations, which today account for two-thirds of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gentili|Barcham|Whiteley|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is small compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting "from [[Giotto]] to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]"&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian (2003). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists''. Oxford Oxford University Press, p. 413. The formula was used by [[Michael Levey]], later the Gallery's eleventh director, for the title of a popular survey of European painting: Levey, Michael (1972). ''From Giotto to Cézanne: A Concise History of Painting''. London: Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potterton|1977|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is no longer the case.

The present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] from 1832 to 1838. Only the façade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]] for British art in 1897. 

The Sainsbury Wing, an extension to the west by [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]], is a notable example of [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernist]] architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is [[Gabriele Finaldi]].

The Gallery was caught in controversy in 2018 over having some of the most expensive exhibition prices ever seen in London&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/06/national-gallerys-22-ticket-revives-debate-exhibition-prices&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

===Call for a National Gallery===
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a robed figure, arms extended, standing outside on a small platform among people doing various things such as talking to each other, but most of whom are looking at him.|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], from the collection of [[John Julius Angerstein]]. This became the founding collection of the National Gallery in 1824. The painting has the [[accession number (library science)|accession number]] NG1, making it officially the first painting to enter the Gallery.]]
The late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in [[Florence]] around 1789 (as the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]]), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British [[Royal Collection]] remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir [[Robert Walpole]] put his collection up for sale. The MP [[John Wilkes]] argued for the government to buy this "invaluable treasure" and suggested that it be housed in "a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Moore |title=Sir Robert Walpole's pictures in Russia |work=Magazine Antiques |date=2 October 1996 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016151632/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by [[Catherine the Great]]; it is now to be found in the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersburg]].

A plan to acquire 150 paintings from the [[Orléans collection]], which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penny|2008|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the Gallery, including "NG1", arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799 the dealer Noel Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] had assembled it for the king of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], before the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] in 1795 abolished Polish independence.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"/&gt; This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, [[Dulwich College]], on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and the collector Joseph Count Truchsess, both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (both made in 1803) were also declined.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"/&gt;

Following the Walpole sale many artists, including [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Flaxman]], had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The [[British Institution]], founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre,&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, Peter (1979). ''Some aspects of the early years of the British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom 1805–1825''. MA dissertation, Courtauld Institute of Art., p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Institution's founding members, Sir [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|George Beaumont, Bt]], would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.

In 1823 another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased [[John Julius Angerstein]]. Angerstein was a Russian-born émigré banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by [[Raphael]] and [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' series. On 1 July 1823 [[George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover|George Agar Ellis]], a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician, proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that it purchase the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy Angerstein's collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by [[Austria]] finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for £57,000.

===Foundation and early history===
[[File:National Gallery at 100 Pall Mall.jpg|alt=Drawing of a three storied building, seen from the street. Women in long dresses date the picture.|thumb|right|upright|100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the home of the National Gallery from 1824 to 1834]]

The National Gallery opened to the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. Angerstein's paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend [[William Holwell Carr]]'s bequest of 35 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crookham|2009|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Keeper of Paintings, [[William Seguier]], bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.

The National Gallery at [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] was frequently overcrowded and hot and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment. But Agar Ellis, by then a trustee of the Gallery, appraised the site for being "in the very gangway of London"; this was seen as necessary for the Gallery to fulfil its social purpose.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; Subsidence in No. 100 caused the Gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] described as a "dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held".&lt;ref name="Taylor2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=36–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to [[Carlton House Terrace]].&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408 'Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery', ''Survey of London: volume 20: St Martin-in-the-Fields, pt III: Trafalgar Square &amp; Neighbourhood''] (1940), pp. 15–18. Date accessed: 15 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 construction began on a new building by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] on the site of the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]] in [[Charing Cross]], in an area that had been transformed over the 1820s into [[Trafalgar Square]]. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy [[West End of London|West End]] and poorer areas to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all [[social classes]] outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to [[South Kensington]] was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, "The ''existence'' of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Langmuir|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1837 until 1868 the [[Royal Academy]] was housed in the east wing of the building.

===Growth under Eastlake and his successors===
15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the Trustees' independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by [[High Renaissance]] masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the Gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, David (2004). "Eastlake, Sir Charles Lock (1793–1865)", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A critical [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German [[art historian]] [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]], whom the Gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and the Prime Minister, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], was the Keeper of Paintings at the Gallery, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]], who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the [[Arundel Society]], and knew most of London's leading art experts.

[[File:Piero della Francesca - Battesimo di Cristo (National Gallery, London).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], one of Eastlake's purchases]]

The new director’s taste was for the [[Early Renaissance painting|Northern and Early Italian Renaissance]] masters or "primitives", who had been neglected by the Gallery’s acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. Eastlake made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the Gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Vol. 9, p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; among the former such seminal works as [[Paolo Uccello]]’s ''Battle of San Romano''. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, [[William Boxall]], and his widow [[Elizabeth Eastlake|Lady Eastlake]].

The Gallery’s lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings was made by [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]]; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so they were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at [[Marlborough House]].&lt;ref name="BakerHenry"&gt;Baker, Christopher and Henry, Tom (2001). "A short history of the National Gallery" in ''The National Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue''. London: National Gallery Company, pp. x–xix&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as [[J. M. W. Turner]] was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crookham|2012|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]] the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with [[John Ruskin]] to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|pp=72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.

The third director, Sir [[Frederick William Burton]], laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from [[Blenheim Palace]], Raphael's ''[[Ansidei Madonna]]'' and Van Dyck's ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles I]]'', with a record-setting grant of £87,500 from the Treasury, brought the Gallery's "golden age of collecting" to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=87–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Gallery purchased Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|Ambassadors]]'' from the [[William Pleydell-Bouverie, 5th Earl of Radnor|Earl of Radnor]] in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]], allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on [[Millbank]], which allowed [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[John Constable|Constable]] to remain in Trafalgar Square.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:RokebyVenus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a nude woman seen from behind, reclining on a couch. She is looking at her reflection in a mirror held by a winged child.|thumb|right|''Venus at her Mirror'' (''[[The Rokeby Venus]]'') by [[Diego Velázquez]]]]
The agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the foundation of the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]], a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez's]] ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' in 1906, followed by Holbein's ''Portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]'' in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr [[Ludwig Mond]] gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the ''[[Mond Crucifixion]]'' by Raphael, to the Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm The Mond Bequest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102111149/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm |date=2 November 2005 }} (Official NG website)&lt;/ref&gt; Other bequests of note were those of [[George Salting]] in 1910, [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1916 and Sir [[Hugh Lane]] in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.

In a rare example of the political protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the ''Rokeby Venus'' was damaged on 10 March 1914 by [[Mary Richardson]], a campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], in protest against the arrest of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellinis]], causing the Gallery to close until the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], when the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spalding|1998|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reception of Impressionist art at the Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s ''[[The Umbrellas (Renoir painting)|Umbrellas]]'', to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in [[Dublin]]. Although eagerly accepted by the director [[Charles Holroyd]], they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] wrote that "I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane died on board the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to [[Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane|Dublin City Gallery ("The Hugh Lane")]] and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.

A fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] in 1923 bought [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat's]] ''[[Bathers at Asnières]]'' and other notable modern works for the nation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934 these transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.

===World War II===
[[File:The Evacuation of Paintings From London during the Second World War HU36302.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings being evacuated from the National Gallery during the Second World War]]
Shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]] the paintings were evacuated to various locations in [[Wales]], including [[Penrhyn Castle]], the university colleges of [[Bangor University|Bangor]] and [[Aberystwyth University|Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by [[Winston Churchill]], who wrote in a telegram to the director [[Kenneth Clark]], “bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped by the fact that the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.&lt;ref name="BakerHenry"/&gt;

For the course of the war [[Myra Hess]], and other musicians, such as [[Moura Lympany]], gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building, to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in London was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of art exhibitions were held at the Gallery as a complement to the recitals. The first of these was ''British Painting since Whistler'' in 1940, organised by [[Lillian Browse]],&lt;ref name=farr&gt;Farr, Dennis (2006). [http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/newsletter/spring_2006/p04browse.shtml "Empathy for Art and Artists: Lillian Browse, 1906–2005"]. ''Newsletter'' of the Courtauld Institute of Art, Issue 21: Spring 2006.

Yeats]]'' held from 1 January – 15 March 1942, which was seen by 10,518 visitors.&lt;ref name=1942cat&gt;Clark, Sir Kenneth (1942). ''Exhibition of Paintings by Sir William Nicholson and Jack B. Yeats'', exhibition catalogue. London: National Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reed&gt;Reed, Patricia (2011). ''William Nicholson: Catalogue raisonné of the Oil Paintings''. London; New Haven: Modern Art Press, Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978 0 300 17054 2}}. pp. 636–638&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of work by war artists, including [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Stanley Spencer]], were also held; the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] had been set up by Clark in order "to keep artists at work on any pretext".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|pp=91–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 a request from an artist to see [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Portrait of Margaretha de Geer'' (a new acquisition) resulted in the "Picture of the Month" scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic [[Herbert Read]], writing that year, called the National Gallery "a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.

===Post-war developments===

}}

In the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for [[Old Masters]] – and even more so for the [[Impressionists]] and [[Post-impressionism|Post-impressionists]] – have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (bought in 1962) and [[Titian]]’s ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir [[Paul Getty]], enabling many major purchases to be made.&lt;ref name="BakerHenry"/&gt; In April 1985 [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover]] and his brothers, the Hon. [[Simon Sainsbury]] and Sir [[Timothy Sainsbury]], had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directorship of [[Neil MacGregor]] saw a major rehang at the Gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 [[Italian Baroque]] paintings from Sir [[Denis Mahon]]. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a [[Guercino]] from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4&amp;nbsp;million in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronaca.com/archives/000503.html |title=Sir Denis Mahon |publisher=Cronaca |date=23 February 2003 |accessdate=8 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207042707/http://www.cronaca.com/archives/000503.html |archivedate=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahon's bequest was made on the condition that the Gallery would never [[Collection (museum)#Deaccessioning|deaccession]] any of its paintings or charge for admission.&lt;ref name="Gaskell"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaskell|2000|pp=179–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, the gallery has run a scheme that gives a studio to contemporary artists to create work based on the permanent collection. They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.

The respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin |last=Bailey |title=National Gallery may start acquiring 20th-century art |publisher=[[The Art Newspaper]] |date=2 November 2005 |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=55 |accessdate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015437/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=55 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century there have been three large fundraising campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s ''[[Madonna of the Pinks]]'', in 2008, for Titian's ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'', and in 2012, Titian's ''[[Diana and Callisto]]''. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] for £95&amp;nbsp;m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous [[Bridgewater Loan|collection of the Duke of Sutherland]]. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director [[Charles Saumarez Smith]] expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.&lt;ref name=gayford&gt;

The first suggestion for a National Gallery on Trafalgar Square came from [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], who envisaged it on the site of the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]], while a [[Parthenon]]-like building for the [[Royal Academy]] would occupy the centre of the square.&lt;ref name=Liscombe&gt;{{Harvnb|Liscombe|1980|pp=180–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession prevented this scheme from being built, but a competition for the Mews site was eventually held in 1831, for which Nash submitted a design with [[Charles Robert Cockerell|C. R. Cockerell]] as his co-architect. Nash's popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Summerson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Summerson|1962|pp=208–9}}. Summerson's "mantelpiece" comparison inspired the title of Conlin's 2006 history of the Gallery, ''The Nation's Mantelpiece'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins had hoped to build a "Temple of the Arts, nurturing contemporary art through historical example",&lt;ref&gt;''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Vol. 33, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; but the commission was blighted by parsimony and compromise, and the resulting building was deemed a failure on almost all counts.

The site only allowed for the building to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the façade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and a far cry from the commanding focal point that was desired for the northern end of the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the façade, originally intended for Nash's [[Marble Arch]] but abandoned due to his financial problems.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} The eastern half of the building housed the [[Royal Academy]] until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.

The building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to the ''Literary Gazette'' in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years before completion, its infamous "pepperpot" elevation appeared on the frontispiece of ''Contrasts'' (1836), an influential tract by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothicist]] [[Augustus Pugin|A. W. N.

===Alteration and expansion (Pennethorne, Barry and Taylor)===

The first significant alteration made to the building was the single, long gallery added by Sir [[James Pennethorne]] in 1860–1. Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=384–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir [[Charles Barry]] in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in [[Kensington]], where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry's son [[Edward Middleton Barry]] proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as "a strong plagiarism upon [[St Paul's Cathedral]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Hyde|1982|pp=116–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome [[Neo-Renaissance]] design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a [[Greek cross]]-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan. This was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.

Pennethorne's gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]] extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]] family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic, Lord Leighton]]’s painting of ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'' (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century: modernisation versus restoration===
[[File:Boris Anrep mosaic, The National Gallery - The Awakening of the Muses.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Boris Anrep#National Gallery mosaics (1928–52)|The Awakening of the Muses]]'' (1933), a mosaic by Boris Anrep.]]
Later additions to the west came more steadily but maintained the coherence of the building by mirroring Barry's cross-axis plan to the east. The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and Trustee [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Lord Duveen]]. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the Gallery. From 1928 to 1952 the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of [[mosaic]]s by [[Boris Anrep]], who was friendly with the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the [[Albert Memorial]]'s ''[[Frieze of Parnassus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=404–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central mosaic depicting ''The Awakening of the Muses'' includes portraits of [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Greta Garbo]], subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of ''Modern Virtues'', including "Humour" and "Open Mind"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|2004|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century the Gallery's late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;See for example National Gallery (corporate author) (1974). ''The Working of the National Gallery''. London: National Gallery Publishing, p. 8: "the National Gallery has suffered from the visual pretentiousness of its 19th century buildings". The modernist North Galleries opened the following year.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crace ceiling decorations in the entrance hall were not to the taste of the director [[Charles Holmes]], and were obliterated by white paint.&lt;ref name=Jury2007&gt;They were restored only in 2005. {{cite news

The North Galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended ceilings, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985–6. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to "lack a positive architectural character" were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.&lt;ref name="Gaskell"/&gt;

}}

The most important addition to the building in recent years has been the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991. The building occupies the "Hampton's site" to the west of the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. The Gallery had long sought expansion into this space{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] proposal by [[Richard Rogers]], among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm [[Ahrends, Burton and Koralek]], who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] compared the design to a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "monstrous carbuncle", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4285069.stm|title=Prince's new architecture blast|accessdate=16 June 2007 | date=21 February 2005 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1162818.stm|title=No cash for 'highest slum'|accessdate=16 June 2007 | date=9 February 2001 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury]] and his brothers [[Simon Sainsbury|Simon]] and Sir [[Tim Sainsbury]]. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.

[[File:Galería Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 173.JPG|thumb|left|The main [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of the Sainsbury Wing]]
In contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir [[John Soane]]'s toplit galleries for the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the church interiors of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (the stone dressing is in ''pietra serena'', the grey stone local to Florence){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of [[false perspective]], as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by [[Cima da Conegliano|Cima]] of ''The Incredulity of St Thomas''. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]] in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.

Following the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the Gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]], opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir [[Paul Getty]]. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a "West Wing Project" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern façade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.

==Controversies==

[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|The restoration of [[Titian]]'s ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' from 1967 to 1968 was a controversial restoration at the National Gallery, due to concern that the painting's [[wikt:tonality|tonality]] had been thrown out of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, apart from those who criticise inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The Gallery's detractors accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake's appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment – a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], a [[Aelbert Cuyp|Cuyp]] and a [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] – were unveiled to the public in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery's most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to ''[[The Times]]'' under the pseudonym "Verax" savaging the institution's cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] set up to investigate the matter cleared the Gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.

[[File:Vignetta-Punch-Restauro.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An 1847 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] depicting the restoration controversy then ongoing]]

The last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was seventy-one years ago in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by Chief Restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of [[varnish]], which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured them with time, may have resulted in the loss of "harmonising" glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by [[Ernst Gombrich]], a professor at the [[Warburg Institute]] who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with "offensive superciliousness" by the National Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walden|2004|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.

[[File:George Bellows - Men of the Docks - 1912 - The National Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[George Bellows]]: ''[[Men of the Docks]]'' (1912)]]
The National Gallery has also been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's decision in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the [[Venice|Venetian]] school as works by [[Giorgione]] (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of ''Samson and Delilah'' (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested by a group of art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those who were involved in the purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterrubens.org/home.asp|title=AfterRubens.org: The Strange Story of the Samson and Delilah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, ''[[Men of the Docks]]'', by U.S. artist [[George Bellows]], was bought by the National Gallery for $25.5&amp;nbsp;million (£15.6&amp;nbsp;million). It was the first major American painting to be purchased by the Gallery. Director [[Nicholas Penny]] termed the painting a new direction for the Gallery – a non-European painting in a European style. Its sale was controversial in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott (12 February 2014). "Randolph sale of art to National Gallery sparks criticism". Inside Higher Ed.

==Notes==
{{refbegin|2}}
:'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} Sculptures and applied art are in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at [[Tate Modern]]. Some British art is in the National Gallery, but the National Collection of British Art is mainly in [[Tate Britain]].

:'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} St Martin's Workhouse (to the east) was cleared for the construction of E. M. Barry's extension, whereas [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] stayed until 1911, supposedly because of the need for troops to be at hand to quell disturbances in Trafalgar Square. ({{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=401}}) Wilkins hoped for more land to the south, but was denied it as building there would have obscured the view of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].

:'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} They are as follows: above the main entrance, a blank roundel (originally to feature the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] face) flanked by two female figures (personifications of Europe and Asia/India, sites of his campaigns) and high up on the eastern façade, [[Minerva]] by [[John Flaxman]], originally [[Britannia]].

In [[Christian]] scribal practice, '''nomina sacra''' (singular: '''''nomen sacrum''''' from [[Latin]] '''''sacred name''''') is the abbreviation of several frequently occurring divine names or titles, especially in [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of [[Holy Scripture]]. A nomen sacrum consists of two or more letters from the original word spanned by an [[overline]].

Metzger lists 15 such expressions from Greek papyri: the Greek counterparts of ''God'', ''Lord'', ''Jesus'', ''Christ'', ''Son'', ''Spirit'', ''David'', ''Cross'', ''Mother'', ''Father'', ''Israel'', ''Savior'', ''Man'', ''Jerusalem'', and ''Heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Metzger, ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; These ''nomina sacra'' are all found in Greek manuscripts of the 3rd century and earlier, except ''Mother'', which appears in the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;''Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts'' - Philip Comfort and David Barrett (1999) pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nomina sacra'' also occur in some form in [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (indicated by the ''[[wikt:՟|pativ]]''), [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Nubian]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] (indicated by the ''[[titlo]]'').

==Origin and development==

[[File:Nomina sacra IC XC 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Nomina sacra IC XC, from the Byzantine Greek ΙΗCΟΥC ΧΡΙCΤΟC (Jesus Christ). Detail from an icon at the Troyan Monastery in Bulgaria. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Icon_of_Virgin_and_Child_in_Anti-Chamber_of_church_at_monastery.JPG See complete icon]]]
''Nomina sacra'' are consistently observed in even the earliest extant Christian writings, along with the [[codex]] form rather than the [[scroll|roll]], implying that when these were written, in approximately the second century, the practice had already been established for some time. However, it is not known precisely when and how the ''nomina sacra'' first arose.

The initial system of ''nomina sacra'' apparently consisted of just four or five words, called ''nomina divina'': the Greek words for ''Jesus'', ''Christ'', ''Lord'', ''God'', and possibly ''Spirit''. The practice quickly expanded to a number of other words regarded as sacred.&lt;ref&gt;S. D. Charlesworth, "Consensus standardization in the systematic approach to ''nomina sacra'' in second- and third-century gospel manuscripts", ''Aegyptus'' 86 (2006), pp. 37-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the system of ''nomina sacra'' that came to prevail, abbreviation is by ''contraction'', meaning that the first and last letter (at least) of each word are used. In a few early cases, an alternate practice is seen of abbreviation by ''suspension'', meaning that the initial two letters (at least) of the word are used; e.g., the opening verses of Revelation in {{Papyrus link|18}} write {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς Χριστός}} (''Jesus Christ'') as {{overline|ΙΗ}} {{overline|ΧΡ}}. Contraction, however, offered the practical advantage of indicating the [[Ancient Greek nouns#Cases|case]] of the abbreviated noun.

It is evident that the use of ''nomina sacra'' was an act of reverence rather than a purely practical space-saving device, as they were employed even where well-established abbreviations of far more frequent words such as ''and'' were avoided, and the ''nomen sacrum'' itself was written with generous spacing. Furthermore, early scribes often distinguished between mundane and sacred occurrences of the same word, e.g. a ''spirit'' vs. the ''Spirit'', and applied ''nomina sacra'' only to the latter (at times necessarily revealing an exegetical choice), although later scribes would mechanically abbreviate all occurrences.

Scholars have advanced a number of theories on the origin of the ''nomina sacra''. An obvious parallel that likely offered some inspiration is the Jewish practice of writing the divine name of God, commonly rendered as Jehovah or Yahweh in English, as the Hebrew [[tetragrammaton]] (transliterated as YHWH) even in Greek Scriptures. The Septuagint manuscript [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1007|LXX P.Oxy.VII.1007]] uses two Paleo-Hebrew ''yodh's'' with a horizontal line through them for YHWH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earliest Christian Artifacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins|author=Larry W. Hurtado|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?hl=es&amp;id=w5FpP9ZxqlYC&amp;q=1007#v=snippet&amp;q=1007&amp;f=false|isbn=0802828957}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an abbreviated form of the Name of God translitered as {{overline|YY}}). Pavlos Vasileiadis, a Doctor of Theology at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], quoting Gerard Gertoux, states that "the subsequent use of the contracted forms of the original nomina sacra κ[ύριο]ς [({{overline|κς}})] and θ[εό]ς [({{overline|θς}})] within Christian manuscripts probably reflects the Jewish practice of replacing the Tetragrammaton by י[הו]ה.",&lt;ref name=VasileiadisOPTH&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of rendering the sacred Tetragrammaton in Greek|author=Pavlos D. Vasileiadis|journal=[[Open Theology]] |volume=1 |year=2014 |pages=56–88 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opth.2014.1.issue-1/opth-2014-0006/opth-2014-0006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GertouxYHWHIEUA&gt;{{cite book |last=Gertoux |first=Gerard |title=The Name of God Y.eH.oW.aH which is pronounced as it is written I_Eh_oU_Ah: Its story |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Md. |year=2002 |isbn=0761822046 |url=https://books.google.com.gt/books/about/The_Name_of_God_Y_eH_oW_aH_which_is_Pron.html?id=bz_9HQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; transliterated in koine Greek as ιά.&lt;ref name=jewishenciclopediatetra&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Tetragrammaton |author= Crawford Howell Toy |author2=Ludwig Blau |year=1906 |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14346-tetragrammaton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek culture also employed a number of ways of abbreviating even proper names, though none in quite the same form as the ''nomina sacra''. Inspiration for the contracted forms (using the first and last letter) has also been seen in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], where Jesus speaks of himself as "the beginning and the end" and "the first and the last" as well "[[the Alpha and the Omega]]".&lt;ref&gt;Colin H. Roberts, ''Manuscript, Society, and Belief in Early Christian Egypt'' (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek numerals]] have been suggested as the origin of the [[overline]] spanning the whole ''nomen sacrum'', with the suspended form {{overline|ΙΗ}} being simply the ordinary way of writing ''eighteen'', for example.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hurtado, [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/nomin_s.pdf "The Origin of the Nomina Sacra: A Proposal"], ''JBL'' 117 (1998), pp. 655-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">The '''Parker Society''' was a [[text publication society]] set up in 1841 to produce editions of the works of the early Protestant writers of the [[English Reformation]]. It was supported by both the [[High Church]] and [[evangelical]] wings of the [[Church of England]], and was established in reaction against the [[Tractarian]] movement of the 1830s. Its Council was dominated by evangelicals, but not to the exclusion of other views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Toon |title=Evangelical Theology 1833–1856 |year=1979 |publisher=Marshall, Morgan &amp; Scott |isbn=0-551-05582-0 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response, a group of Tractarians founded the [[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank M. Turner |title=John Henry Newman: The Challenge to Evangelical Religion |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-17309-3|pages=357–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society took its name from [[Matthew Parker]] (1504–1575), [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1559 to 1575, and a prominent collector of manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.churchsociety.org/churchman/documents/Cman_122_3_Cinnamond.pdf |title=The Reformed Treasures of the Parker Society |author=Andrew Cinnamond|journal=Churchman|publisher=Church Society |year=2008 |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=221–242 |access-date=13 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It published four or five volumes a year, to 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A general index to the publications of the Parker Society|url=https://archive.org/stream/ageneralindextot00unknuoft#page/n827/mode/2up|author=Henry Gough|publisher=The Parker Society|date=1855|access-date=13 Sep 2015|at=Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Gilliver''' (born  14 June 1964) is a [[lexicographer]] and Associate Editor of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

==Career==
Gilliver's parents were both linguists. He attended [[Barnard Castle School]], and has a degree in Mathematics from [[Jesus College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Magazine, 5 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2014|reason=neither pages nor URL}} and a qualification in Information Science from Liverpool.

As of 2013, he was responsible for the largest three or four entries in the current electronic revision, including the largest (that for [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29winchester.html?_r=0 "run"], which took him over 9 months and has 645 meanings for the verb form alone).

In 2016 Gilliver published a history of the OED,&lt;ref&gt;''A history of the OED'', OED News, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which took most of the previous decade to write.

He and his partner sing in various choirs, including the [[Oxford Bach Choir]] (which they helped to administer for some years), and Fiori Musicali.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiori-musicali.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
Gilliver, a longtime editor who also seems to be the OED’s resident historian, points out that the dictionary feels obliged to include words that many would regard simply as misspellings. No one is particularly proud of the new entry as of December 2003 for nucular, a word not associated with high standards of diction. "Bizarrely, I was amazed to find that the spelling n-u-c-u-l-a-r has decades of history," Gilliver says. "And that is not to be confused with the quite different word, nucular, meaning 'of or relating to a nucule.'"|"Cyber-neologoliferation"||James Gleick, ''New York Times'', 2006{{citation needed|date=July 2014|n.b.= This requires a citation by someone (not me!) who's *confirmed* the supposed transcription of the quote against the source, which i *have not done*. A G-search suggests the Nov 5, 2006 ''NYTimes'' might be the right place to confirm the quote, &amp; get page #(s).}}}}

The '''Prentis House''', built in 1773 in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]] by the Dickinson family, is typical of the indigenous style of [[Saltbox]] architecture that developed in [[New England]] during the [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] period and remained in use, particularly in rural areas, through the Revolution.  The Prentis House was relocated to the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], and furnished with 17th and 18th century period furniture and decorative arts.

[[Saltbox]] architecture developed as builders devised a simple way to enlarge their European-inspired Capen Houses built during the early years of colonization. The term “Saltbox” refers to the structure’s characteristic asymmetrical roofline that extends on one side from the peak of the roof to the first floor thus resembling the profile of an early wooden salt container. Builders would typically position a saltbox structure so that the extended roof faced north diminishing the impact of winter winds while the façade windows faced south collecting warmth from the sun. 

Typical of the style, Prentis House is built around a massive central chimney, which supports much of the building’s weight. Seven [[flue]]s meet on the second floor in a huge beehive-shaped formation before the chimney narrows again at the roofline.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993.

R. L. Polk &amp; Company was founded by [[Ralph Lane Polk]] in 1870 in Detroit, MI as a publisher of business directories. In 1872, the company first published a City Directory, for Evansville, Indiana, plus a listing of post offices in nine states. Additional directories followed in the ensuing years as the business grew.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;[http://usa.polk.com/Company/Heritage/ R.L.

In 1921, a conversation between Ralph Lane Polk II and [[Alfred P. Sloan]] (who later became president of General Motors) helped fuel R. L. Polk &amp; Company's entry into the automotive industry. During the conversation, Sloan asked Polk to impartially tabulate and publish statistical information on cars and trucks in operation. R.L. Polk &amp; Company launched its motor vehicle statistical operations in 1922, when the first car registration reports were published.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071116145915/http://www.salesforce.com/customers/business-services/case-studies/rlpolk.jsp Retrieved on 11/4/08&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, R.L. Polk &amp; Co. published its first Passenger Car Registration Report, covering 58 makes and accounting for 9.2 million passenger automobiles on America's highways.

From 1951 to 1958, the company pioneered the use of electronic punch card tabulating equipment.

'''Rebar detailing''' is the discipline of preparing 'shop/placing' drawings or [[Shop drawing|shop drawings]] of steel reinforcement for [[construction]].

[[Architect]]/[[Engineer]]s(A/E) prepare 'Design Drawings' that develop required strengths by applying [[rebar]] size, spacing, location, and lap of [[steel]].

By contrast, 'Shop/Placing Drawings' apply the intent of the 'Design drawings' for the ironworker. They call out the quantity, description, placement, bending shapes with dimensions and laps of the reinforcing steel. Various applications are used to produce bar bending schedules which can be directly fed into CNC machines that cuts and bends the rebar to the desired shapes.

The fabrication of the bars are scheduled and the placing/fixing sequence indicated, adding the elements required to support those bars during construction.

'Shop/Placing Drawings' are submitted to the A/E for review of compliance with design drawings before construction can proceed. These drawings must be detailed using the ACI &amp; CRSI Specifications (United States), ACI &amp; RSIC Specifications (Canada).

Rebar detailing is usually assigned to Rebar Fabricators in-house teams, and rebar detailing companies. The great majority of rebar detailing companies are stationed in The Middle East and India. However there are a few Rebar Detailers in the United States, but not many due to the low cost of having the detailing done overseas. The wages for a Rebar Detailer in the US and Canada is from $30,000 to $90,000 per year but the large fabricators will send it overseas where it will only cost them between $3,000 and $7,000 per year because of the difference in the money value.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Small Computer System Interface''' ('''SCSI''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|ʌ|z|i}} {{respell|SKUZ|ee}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of SCSI|last=Field|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and [[Peripheral|peripheral devices]]. The SCSI standards define [[SCSI command|commands]], protocols, electrical, optical and logical [[Interface (computing)|interfaces]]. SCSI is most commonly used for [[hard disk drive]]s and [[tape drive]]s, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and [[CD-ROM|CD]] [[Optical disc drive|drives]], although not all controllers can handle all devices. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific [[SCSI Peripheral Device Type|peripheral device types]]; the presence of "unknown" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements.

The ancestral SCSI standard, X3.131-1986, generally referred to as SCSI-1, was published by the X3T9 technical committee of the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986.  SCSI-2 was published in August 1990 as X3.T9.2/86-109, with further revisions in 1994 and subsequent adoption of a multitude of interfaces.  Further refinements have resulted in improvements in performance and support for ever-increasing storage data capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?document_name=ANSI%20INCITS%20131&amp;item_s_key=00009673&amp;item_key_date=911231 |title=ANSI INCITS 131 94th Edition, 2004 |publisher=global.ihs.com |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Parallel interface===
SCSI is derived from "SASI", the "[[Shugart Associates]] System Interface", developed circa 1978 and publicly disclosed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI Draft SASI Standard, Rev D, February 17, 1982, pg. ii states, "9/15/81 first presentation to ANSI committee X3T9-3 (2 weeks following announcement in Electronic Design)."&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Larry Boucher]] is considered to be the "father" of SASI and ultimately SCSI due to his pioneering work first at Shugart Associates and then at [[Adaptec]].&lt;ref name="CHM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiLUIJ3ke-o |title="How Computer Storage Became a Modern Business", Computer History Museum, March 9, 2005 |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SASI controller provided a bridge between a hard disk drive's low-level interface and a host computer, which needed to read blocks of data. SASI controller boards were typically the size of a hard disk drive and were usually physically mounted to the drive's chassis. SASI, which was used in mini- and early microcomputers, defined the interface as using a 50-pin flat ribbon connector which was adopted as the SCSI-1 connector. SASI is a fully compliant subset of SCSI-1 so that many, if not all, of the then-existing SASI controllers were SCSI-1 compatible.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI SCSI Standard, X3.131-1986, June 23, 1986, 2nd, foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until at least February 1982, ANSI developed the specification as "SASI" and "Shugart Associates System Interface;"&lt;ref name="ANSI"&gt;Working document for ANSI meeting on March 3, 1982, "SASI SHUGART ASSOCIATES SYSTEM INTERFACE, Revision D, February 17, 1982"&lt;/ref&gt; however, the committee documenting the standard would not allow it to be named after a company. Almost a full day was devoted to agreeing to name the standard "Small Computer System Interface", which Boucher intended to be pronounced "sexy", but ENDL's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endl.com/ |title=ENDL Inc. Home Page |publisher=Endl.com |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dal Allan pronounced the new acronym as "scuzzy" and that stuck.&lt;ref name="CHM"/&gt;

A number of companies such as [[NCR Corporation]], Adaptec and Optimem were early supporters of SCSI.&lt;ref name="ANSI"/&gt; The NCR facility in [[Wichita, Kansas]] is widely thought to have developed the industry's first SCSI controller chip; it worked the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ncr/scsi-1.htm |title=NCR Collection (LSI Logic)at Smithsonian Museum |publisher=Smithsonianchips.si.edu |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "small" reference in "small computer system interface" is historical; since the mid-1990s, SCSI has been available on even the largest of computer systems.

Since its standardization in 1986, SCSI has been commonly used in the [[Amiga]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] (now part of [[Oracle Corporation]]) computer lines and PC server systems. Apple started using the less-expensive [[parallel ATA]] (PATA, also known as ''IDE'') for its low-end machines with the [[Macintosh Quadra]] 630 in 1994, and added it to its high-end desktops starting with the Power Macintosh G3 in 1997. Apple dropped on-board SCSI completely in favor of IDE and [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] with the (Blue &amp; White) Power Mac G3 in 1999, while still offering a [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] SCSI host adapter as an option on up to the Power Macintosh G4 (AGP Graphics) models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3074?viewlocale=en_US |title=Power Macintosh G3, G4: Differences Between Available SCSI Cards |publisher=Apple, Inc.|date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun switched its lower-end range to [[Serial ATA]] (SATA). Commodore included SCSI on the Amiga 3000/3000T systems and it was an add-on to previous Amiga 500/2000 models. Starting with the Amiga 600/1200/4000 systems Commodore switched to the IDE interface. Atari included SCSI as standard in its [[Atari MEGA STE]], [[Atari TT]] and [[Atari Falcon]] computer models. SCSI has never been popular in the low-priced IBM PC world, owing to the lower cost and adequate performance of ATA hard disk standard. However, SCSI drives and even SCSI [[RAID]]s became common in PC workstations for video or audio production.

==={{Anchor|SERIAL-VARIANTS}}Modern SCSI===
Recent physical versions of SCSI{{mdashb}}[[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), SCSI-over-[[Fibre Channel Protocol]] (FCP), and [[USB Attached SCSI]] (UAS){{mdashb}}break from the traditional [[parallel SCSI]] [[bus (computing)|bus]] and perform data transfer via serial communications using [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links. Although much of the SCSI documentation talks about the parallel interface, all modern development efforts use serial interfaces. Serial interfaces have a number of advantages over parallel SCSI, including higher data rates, simplified cabling, longer reach, improved fault isolation and [[full-duplex]] capability. The primary reason for the shift to serial interfaces is the [[clock skew]] issue of high speed parallel interfaces, which makes the faster variants of parallel SCSI susceptible to problems caused by cabling and termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.infostor.com/index/articles/display/232832/articles/infostor/volume-9/issue-7/features/special-report/the-benefits-of-serial-attached-scsi-sas.html |title=The benefits of Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) |author=David Allen |date=2005-07-01 |access-date=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-physical [[iSCSI]] preserves the basic SCSI [[paradigm]], especially the command set, almost unchanged, through embedding of SCSI-3 over [[TCP/IP]]. Therefore, iSCSI uses ''logical connections'' instead of physical links and can run on top of any network supporting IP. The actual physical links are realized on lower [[OSI model|network layers]], independently from iSCSI. Predominantly, [[Ethernet]] is used which is also of serial nature.

SCSI is popular on high-performance workstations, servers, and storage appliances. Almost all RAID subsystems on servers have used some kind of SCSI hard disk drives for decades (initially Parallel SCSI, recently SAS and Fibre Channel), though a number of manufacturers offer [[Serial ATA|SATA]]-based RAID subsystems as a cheaper option. Moreover, SAS offers compatibility with SATA devices, creating a much broader range of options for RAID subsystems together with the existence of [[nearline SAS]] (NL-SAS) drives. Instead of SCSI, modern desktop computers and notebooks typically use SATA interfaces for internal hard disk drives, with [[M.2]] and PCIe gaining popularity as SATA can bottleneck modern [[solid-state drive]]s.

==Interfaces==
{{Main|SCSI connector}}
SCSI is available in a variety of interfaces. The first was [[parallel SCSI]] (also called SCSI Parallel Interface or SPI), which uses a [[parallel communications|parallel]] [[Bus (computing)|bus]] design. Since 2005, SPI was gradually replaced by [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), which uses a [[Serial communications|serial]] design but retains other aspects of the technology. Many other interfaces which do not rely on complete SCSI standards still implement the [[#SCSI command protocol|SCSI command protocol]]; others drop physical implementation entirely while retaining the [[SCSI architectural model]]. [[iSCSI]], for example, uses [[TCP/IP]] as a transport mechanism, which is most often transported over [[Gigabit Ethernet]] or faster [[computer network|network]] links.

SCSI interfaces have often been included on computers from various manufacturers for use under [[Microsoft Windows]], [[classic Mac OS]], [[Unix]], [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Linux]] operating systems, either implemented on the [[motherboard]] or by the means of plug-in adaptors. With the advent of [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] drives, provision for parallel SCSI on motherboards was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shuangbao Paul Wang|title=Computer Architecture and Security: Fundamentals of Designing Secure Computer Systems|isbn=978-1118168813|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel SCSI===
[[Image:Scsi-1 gehaeuse.jpg|thumb|Two SCSI-2 connectors]]

{{Main|Parallel SCSI}}

Initially, the ''SCSI Parallel Interface'' (SPI) was the only interface using the SCSI protocol. Its standardization started as a [[single-ended signaling|single-ended]] 8-bit [[system bus|bus]] in 1986, transferring up to 5&amp;nbsp;MB/s, and evolved into a low-voltage [[differential signaling|differential]] 16-bit bus capable of up to 320&amp;nbsp;MB/s. The last SPI-5 standard from 2003 also defined a 640&amp;nbsp;MB/s speed which failed to be realized.

Parallel SCSI specifications include several synchronous transfer modes for the parallel cable, and an asynchronous mode. The asynchronous mode is a classic request/acknowledge protocol, which allows systems with a slow bus or simple systems to also use SCSI devices. Faster synchronous modes are used more frequently.

==Cabling==
[[File:SCSI-terminator-exposed-hdr-0a.jpg|thumb|right|Bus terminator with top cover removed]]

===SCSI Parallel Interface===
Internal parallel SCSI cables are usually [[ribbon cables|ribbons]], with two or more 50–, 68–, or 80–pin connectors attached. External cables are typically shielded (but may not be), with 50– or 68–pin connectors at each end, depending upon the specific SCSI bus width supported. The 80–pin [[Single Connector Attachment]] (SCA) is typically used for hot-pluggable devices

===Fibre Channel===
[[Fibre Channel]] can be used to transport SCSI information units, as defined by the [[Fibre Channel Protocol]] for SCSI (FCP). These connections are hot-pluggable and are usually implemented with optical fiber.

===Serial attached SCSI===
[[Serial attached SCSI]] (SAS) uses a [[Serial Attached SCSI#Connectors|modified]] [[Serial ATA]] data and power cable.

===iSCSI===
[[iSCSI]] (Internet Small Computer System Interface) usually uses [[Ethernet]] connectors and cables as its physical transport, but can run over any physical transport capable of transporting [[Internet Protocol|IP]].

===SRP===
The [[SCSI RDMA Protocol]] (SRP) is a protocol that specifies how to transport SCSI commands over a reliable RDMA connection. This protocol can run over any RDMA-capable physical transport, e.g. [[InfiniBand]] or [[Ethernet]] when using [[RDMA over Converged Ethernet|RoCE]] or [[iWARP]].

===USB Attached SCSI===
[[USB Attached SCSI]] allows SCSI devices to use the [[Universal Serial Bus]].

===Automation/Drive Interface===
The Automation/Drive Interface − Transport Protocol (ADT) is used to connect removable media devices, such as tape drives, with the controllers of the libraries (automation devices) in which they are installed. The ADI standard specifies the use of [[RS-422]] for the physical connections. The second-generation ADT-2 standard defines iADT, use of the ADT protocol over IP (Internet Protocol) connections, such as over [[Ethernet]]. The Automation/Drive Interface − Commands standards (ADC, ADC-2, and ADC-3) define SCSI commands for these installations.

==SCSI command protocol==
{{Main|SCSI command}}
In addition to many different hardware implementations, the SCSI standards also include an extensive set of command definitions. The SCSI command architecture was originally defined for [[parallel SCSI]] buses but has been carried forward with minimal change for use with iSCSI and serial SCSI. Other technologies which use the SCSI command set include the [[ATAPI|ATA Packet Interface]], [[USB mass storage device class|USB Mass Storage class]] and [[Serial Bus Protocol 2|FireWire SBP-2]].

In SCSI terminology, communication takes place between an [[SCSI initiator|initiator]] and a [[SCSI target|target]]. The initiator sends a [[SCSI command|command]] to the target, which then responds. SCSI commands are sent in a Command Descriptor Block ([[SCSI CDB|CDB]]). The CDB consists of a one byte operation code followed by five or more bytes containing command-specific parameters.

At the end of the command sequence, the target returns a [[SCSI Status Code|status code]] byte, such as 00h for success, 02h for an error (called a [[SCSI check condition|Check Condition]]), or 08h for busy. When the target returns a Check Condition in response to a command, the initiator usually then issues a [[SCSI Request Sense Command|SCSI Request Sense command]] in order to obtain a key code qualifier ([[KCQ]]) from the target. The Check Condition and Request Sense sequence involves a special SCSI protocol called a [[SCSI contingent allegiance condition|Contingent Allegiance Condition]].

There are four categories of SCSI commands: N (non-data), W (writing data from initiator to target), R (reading data), and B (bidirectional). There are about 60 different [[SCSI command]]s in total, with the most commonly used being:

*Test unit ready: Queries device to see if it is ready for data transfers (disk spun up, media loaded, etc.).
*Inquiry: Returns basic device information.
*Request sense: Returns any error codes from the previous command that returned an error status.
*Send diagnostic and Receive diagnostic results: runs a simple self-test, or a specialised test defined in a [[SCSI diagnostic pages|diagnostic page]].
*Start/Stop unit: Spins disks up and down, or loads/unloads media (CD, tape, etc.).
*Read capacity: Returns storage capacity.
*Format unit: Prepares a storage medium for use. In a disk, a [[low level format]] will occur. Some tape drives will erase the tape in response to this command.
*Read: (four variants): Reads data from a device.
*Write: (four variants): Writes data to a device.
*Log sense: Returns current information from [[SCSI log pages|log pages]].
*Mode sense: Returns current device parameters from [[SCSI mode pages|mode pages]].
*Mode select: Sets device parameters in a mode page.

Each device on the SCSI bus is assigned a unique SCSI identification number or ID. Devices may encompass multiple logical units, which are addressed by [[logical unit number]] (LUN). Simple devices have just one LUN, more complex devices may have multiple LUNs.

A "direct access" (i.e. disk type) storage device consists of a number of logical blocks, addressed by Logical Block Address ([[SCSI LBA|LBA]]). A typical LBA equates to 512 bytes of storage. The usage of LBAs has evolved over time and so four different command variants are provided for reading and writing data. The Read(6) and Write(6) commands contain a 21-bit LBA address. The Read(10), Read(12), Read Long, Write(10), Write(12), and Write Long commands all contain a 32-bit LBA address plus various other parameter options.

The capacity of a "sequential access" (i.e. tape-type) device is not specified because it depends, amongst other things, on the length of the tape, which is not identified in a machine-readable way. Read and write operations on a sequential access device begin at the current tape position, not at a specific LBA. The block size on sequential access devices can either be fixed or variable, depending on the specific device. Tape devices such as half-inch [[IBM 9 track|9-track tape]], [[Digital Data Storage|DDS]] (4&amp;nbsp;mm tapes physically similar to [[digital audio tape|DAT]]), [[Exabyte (company)|Exabyte]], etc., support variable block sizes.

==Device identification==

===Parallel interface===
{{Technical|section|date=June 2008}}

On a parallel SCSI bus, a device (e.g. host adapter, disk drive) is identified by a "SCSI ID", which is a number in the range 0–7 on a narrow bus and in the range 0–15 on a wide bus. On earlier models a physical jumper or switch controls the SCSI ID of the initiator ([[host adapter]]). On modern host adapters (since about 1997), doing I/O to the adapter sets the SCSI ID; for example, the adapter often contains a BIOS program that runs when the computer boots up and that program has menus that let the operator choose the SCSI ID of the host adapter. Alternatively, the host adapter may come with software that must be installed on the host computer to configure the SCSI ID. The traditional SCSI ID for a host adapter is 7, as that ID has the highest priority during bus arbitration (even on a 16&amp;nbsp;bit bus).

The SCSI ID of a device in a drive enclosure that has a back plane is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is installed into, depending on the model of the enclosure. In the latter case, each slot on the enclosure's back plane delivers control signals to the drive to select a unique SCSI ID. A SCSI enclosure without a back plane often has a switch for each drive to choose the drive's SCSI ID. The enclosure is packaged with connectors that must be plugged into the drive where the jumpers are typically located; the switch emulates the necessary jumpers. While there is no standard that makes this work, drive designers typically set up their jumper headers in a consistent format that matches the way that these switches implement.

Setting the bootable (or first) hard disk to SCSI ID 0 is an accepted IT community recommendation. SCSI ID 2 is usually set aside for the floppy disk drive while SCSI ID 3 is typically for a CD-ROM drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groth|first=David|author2=Dan Newland |editor=|others=|title=A+ Complete Study Guide (2nd Edition)

===General===
Note that a SCSI target device (which can be called a "physical unit") is often divided into smaller "logical units". For example, a high-end disk subsystem may be a single SCSI device but contain dozens of individual disk drives, each of which is a logical unit. Further, a RAID array may be a single SCSI device, but may contain many logical units, each of which is a "virtual" disk—a stripe set or mirror set constructed from portions of real disk drives. The SCSI ID, WWN, etc. in this case identifies the whole subsystem, and a second number, the logical unit number (LUN) identifies a disk device (real or virtual) within the subsystem.

It is quite common, though incorrect, to refer to the logical unit itself as a "LUN".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern SCSI transport protocols, there is an automated process for the "discovery" of the IDs. The SSA initiator (normally the host computer through the 'host adaptor') "walk the loop" to determine what devices are connected and then assigns each one a 7-bit "hop-count" value.  [[Fibre Channel]] – Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) initiators use the LIP (Loop Initialization Protocol) to interrogate each device port for its WWN ([[World Wide Name]]). For iSCSI, because of the unlimited scope of the (IP) network, the process is quite complicated. These discovery processes occur at power-on/initialization time and also if the bus topology changes later, for example if an extra device is added.

==Device Type==
{{main|SCSI Peripheral Device Type}}
While all SCSI controllers can work with read/write storage devices, i.e. disk and tape, some will not work with some other device types; older controllers are likely to be more limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40F_HTML/MAN/MAN7/0003____.HTM |title=An example of an old SCSI interface which supported only named mass storage devices |publisher=H30097.www3.hp.com |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes by their driver software, and more Device Types were added as SCSI evolved. Even CD-ROMs are not handled by all controllers. Device Type is a 5-bit field reported by a [[SCSI Inquiry Command]]; defined [[SCSI Peripheral Device Type]]s include, in addition to many varieties of storage device, printer, scanner, communications device, and a catch-all "processor" type for devices not otherwise listed.

==SCSI enclosure services==
In larger SCSI servers, the disk-drive devices are housed in an intelligent enclosure that supports [[SCSI Enclosure Services|SCSI Enclosure Services (SES)]]. The initiator can communicate with the enclosure using a specialized set of SCSI commands to access power, cooling, and other non-data characteristics.

The '''SOAP note''' (an acronym for '''subjective''', '''objective''', '''assessment''', and '''plan''') is a method of documentation employed by health care providers to write out notes in a [[patient]]'s chart, along with other common formats, such as the [[admission note]]. Documenting patient encounters in the [[medical record]] is an integral part of practice workflow starting with patient appointment scheduling, to writing out notes, to [[medical billing]].

The SOAP note originated from the ''problem-oriented medical record'' (POMR), developed by [[Lawrence Weed]], MD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Lee |title=Interview with Lawrence Weed, MD: The father of the problem-oriented medical record looks ahead |journal=The Permanente Journal |date=Summer 2009 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=84–89 |pmid=20740095 |url=http://www.thepermanentejournal.org/issues/2009/summer/395-interview-with-lawrence-weed-md.html |publisher=[[Kaiser Permanente]] | pmc=2911807 |doi=10.7812/tpp/09-068}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially developed for physicians, who at the time, were the only health care providers allowed to write in a medical record. Today, it is widely adopted as a communication tool between inter-disciplinary healthcare providers as a way to document a patient's progress.

SOAP notes are commonly found in [[electronic medical record]]s (EMR) and are used by providers of various backgrounds. Prehospital care providers such as [[emergency medical technician]]s may use the same format to communicate patient information to [[emergency department]] clinicians. Physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, podiatrists, chiropractors, acupuncturists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, school psychologists, speech-language pathologists, certified athletic trainers (ATC), sports therapists, music therapists, among other providers use this format for the patient's initial visit and to monitor progress during follow-up care.

==Components==
The four components of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferri |first=Fred F. |date=2014 |origyear=1987 |title=Ferri's practical guide: fast facts for patient care |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=1–34 |isbn=9781455744596 |oclc=861675782}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length and focus of each component of a SOAP note vary depending on the specialty; for instance, a surgical SOAP note is likely to be much briefer than a medical SOAP note, and will focus on issues that relate to post-surgical status.

===Subjective component===
Initially the patient's ''chief complaint'', or CC. This is a very brief statement of the patient (quoted) as to the purpose of the office visit or hospitalization.

If this is the first time a physician is seeing a patient, the physician will take a ''history of present illness'', or HPI. This describes the patient's current condition in narrative form. The history or state of experienced symptoms are recorded in the patient's own words. All information pertaining to subjective information is communicated to the healthcare provider by the patient or his/her representative. It will include all pertinent and negative [[symptoms]] under ''review of body systems''. Pertinent medical history, surgical history, family history, and social history, along with current medications, smoking status, drug/alcohol/caffeine use, level of physical activity and allergies, are also recorded. A [[SAMPLE history]] is one method of obtaining this information from a patient.

Subsequent visits for the same problem briefly summarize the history of present illness (HPI), including pertinent testing + results, referrals, treatments, outcomes and followups.

The mnemonic below refers to the information a physician should elicit before referring to the patient's "old charts" or "old carts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Charlie|title=History of Present Illness (HPI)|url=http://meded.ucsd.edu/clinicalmed/history.htm|work=A Practical Guide to Clinical Medicine|publisher=University of California San Diego|date=16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''O'''nset
* '''L'''{{Not a typo|ocation}}
* '''D'''uration
* '''CH'''aracter (sharp, dull, etc.)
* '''A'''lleviating/'''A'''ggravating factors
* '''R'''adiation
* '''T'''emporal pattern (every morning, all day, etc.)
* '''S'''everity

Variants on this mnemonic (more than one could be listed here) include [[OPQRST]] and LOCQSMAT:

* '''L'''{{Not a typo|ocation}}
* '''O'''nset (when and mechanism of injury—if applicable)
* '''C'''hronology (better or worse since onset, episodic, variable, constant, etc.)
* '''Q'''uality (sharp, dull, etc.)
* '''S'''everity (usually a pain rating)
* '''M'''odifying factors (what aggravates/reduces the symptoms—activities, postures, drugs, etc.)
* '''A'''dditional symptoms (un/related or significant symptoms to the chief complaint)
* '''T'''reatment (has the patient seen another provider for this symptom?)

===Objective component===
The objective section of the SOAP includes information that the healthcare provider observes or measures from the patient's current presentation, such as:

* Vital signs and measurements, such as weight.
* Findings from [[physical examination]]s, including basic systems of cardiac and respiratory, the affected systems, possible involvement of other systems, pertinent normal findings and abnormalities.
* Results from laboratory and other diagnostic tests already completed.

===Assessment===
A medical diagnosis for the purpose of the medical visit on the given date of the note written is a quick summary of the patient with main symptoms/diagnosis including a [[differential diagnosis]], a list of other possible diagnoses usually in order of most likely to least likely. The assessment will also include possible and likely etiologies of the patient's problem. It is the patient's progress since the last visit, and overall progress towards the patient's goal from the physician's perspective. In a pharmacist's SOAP note, the assessment will identify what the drug related/induced problem is likely to be and the reasoning/evidence behind it. This will include etiology and risk factors, assessments of the need for therapy, current therapy, and therapy options. When used in a problem-oriented medical record (POMR), relevant problem numbers or headings are included as subheadings in the assessment.

Clinical psychologist Barbara Lichner Ingram, in her book on [[clinical formulation]], used the word "hypothesis" in place of "assessment", resulting in the acronym SOHP instead of SOAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ingram |first=Barbara Lichner |date=2012 |origyear=2006 |title=Clinical case formulations: matching the integrative treatment plan to the client |edition=2nd |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=82t0t7e1A1AC&amp;pg=PA6 6] |isbn=9781118038222 |oclc=723035074 |quote=In this book, the term ''hypothesis'' (or ''hypotheses section'' of report) will substitute for ''assessment'', resulting in the SOHP acronym. That acronym can be pronounced as 'soap' but reminds us that we will be ''formulating with clinical hypotheses'' instead of plugging in a simple diagnostic label.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan===
The plan is what the health care provider will do to treat the patient's concerns—such as ordering further labs, radiological work up, referrals given, procedures performed, medications given and education provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ball |first1=Jane |last2=Dains |first2=Joyce E. |last3=Flynn |first3=John A. |last4=Solomon |first4=Barry S. |last5=Stewart |first5=Rosalyn W. |date=2019 |origyear=1987 |title=Seidel's guide to physical examination: an interprofessional approach |edition=9th |location=St. Louis, MO |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=58–73 |isbn=9780323481953 |oclc=1002290924}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan will also include goals of therapy and patient-specific drug and disease-state monitoring parameters. This should address each item of the differential diagnosis. For patients who have multiple health problems that are addressed in the SOAP note, a plan is developed for each problem and is numbered accordingly based on severity and urgency for therapy. 
A note of what was discussed or advised with the patient as well as timings for further review or follow-up are generally included.

Often the Assessment and Plan sections are grouped together.

==An example==
A very rough example follows for a patient being reviewed following an appendectomy. This example resembles a surgical SOAP note; medical notes tend to be more detailed, especially in the subjective and objective sections.

The plan itself includes various components:
* Diagnostic component: continue to monitor labs
* Therapeutic component: advance diet
* Referrals: follow up with Cardiology within three days of discharge for stress testing as an out-patient.
* Patient education component: that is progressing well
* Disposition component: discharge to home in the morning

It also requires a belief in a certain institutional means to achieve those ends; whatever that may mean in positive terms, it certainly presupposes, at a minimum, the belief that these ends and values cannot be achieved in an economic system in which there is widespread private ownership of the means of production…Those who favor socialism generally speak of social ownership, social control, or socialization of the means of production as the distinctive positive feature of a socialist economic system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hastings, Mason and Pyper |first=Adrian, Alistair and Hugh |title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=21 December 2000 |isbn=978-0198600244 |page=677 |quote=Socialists have always recognized that there are many possible forms of social ownership of which co-operative ownership is one...Nevertheless, socialism has throughout its history been inseparable from some form of common ownership.

* [[State ownership]], where the government owns all means of production
* [[Cooperative]] ownership, which might take the form of a [[employee stock ownership plan]] in a market economy, a [[worker's cooperative]] (where employees own and [[Workers' self-management|self-manage]] the organization), [[consumers' co-operative]], [[housing cooperative]] (owned by the residents), etc.
* [[Common ownership]], where the entire society shares things
* [[Citizen ownership of equity]], where the government or employee pension organizations own the stock of corporations in a market socialist economy

Varieties of socialism can be categorized in a variety of ways:&lt;ref name="Nove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Lamb 2006. p. 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In fact, socialism has been both centralist and local; organized from above and built from below; visionary and pragmatic; revolutionary and reformist; anti-state and statist; internationalist and nationalist; harnessed to political parties and shunning them; an outgrowth of trade unionism and independent of it; a feature of rich industrialized countries and poor peasant-based communities" Michael Newman. Socialism: A very Short introduction. Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reformism]] versus [[revolutionary socialism]] – whether a socialist economy should be obtained through changes made by existing governmental systems or whether a revolution should overthrow the existing government
* [[State socialism]] versus [[libertarian socialism]] – whether economic control and ownership should be centralized (such as with a [[command economy]] or [[state capitalism]] where government-owned corporations dominate a market economy) or decentralized among small collectively owned organizations or industrial guilds
* [[Democratic socialism]] (advocating [[worker's self-management]] and [[workplace democracy]] within a [[market socialist]], [[Participatory economics|participatory]] or [[Decentralized planning|decentralized planned economy]]) versus [[authoritarian]] socialism as seen in [[Marxist-Leninist]] countries such as the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Often, this definition is invoked to distinguish democratic socialism from authoritarian socialism as in Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989), in Donald F.

Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics; at times overlapping with trade unions, and at other times independent and critical of unions; and present in both industrialised and developing countries. Originating within the socialist movement, [[social democracy]] has embraced a [[mixed economy]] with a market that includes substantial state intervention in the form of [[income redistribution]], [[regulatory economics|regulation]], and a [[welfare state]]. [[Economic democracy]] proposes a sort of market socialism where there is more decentralized control of companies, currencies, investments, natural resources.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|[[Utopian socialist]] pamphlet of [[Rudolf Sutermeister]]]]
For Andrew Vincent, "[t]he word ‘socialism’ finds its root in the Latin ''sociare'', which means to combine or to share. The related, more technical term in Roman and then medieval law was ''societas''. This latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent. Modern political ideologies. Wiley-Blackwell publishing. 2010. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "socialism" was created by [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], one of the founders of what would later be labelled "[[utopian socialism]]". Simon coined the term as a contrast to the liberal doctrine of "[[individualism]]", which stressed that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry 1600, p. 540"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society – From 1600, Volume 2''. Ninth Edition. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009. p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; The original "utopian" socialists condemned liberal individualism for failing to address social concerns during the industrial revolution, including poverty, social oppression and gross inequalities in wealth, thus viewing liberal individualism as degenerating society into supporting selfish [[Egotism|egoism]] that harmed community life through promoting a society based on competition.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry 1600, p. 540"/&gt; They presented socialism as an alternative to liberal individualism based on the shared ownership of resources, although their proposals for socialism differed significantly. Saint-Simon proposed economic planning, scientific administration and the application of modern scientific advancements to the organisation of society. By contrast, [[Robert Owen]] proposed the organisation of production and ownership in cooperatives.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry 1600, p. 540"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=The Global Economy and its Economic Systems |publisher=South-Western College Pub |date=28 February 2013 |isbn=978-1285055350 |page=159 |quote=Socialist writers of the nineteenth century proposed socialist arrangements for sharing as a response to the inequality and poverty of the industrial revolution. English socialist Robert Owen proposed that ownership and production take place in cooperatives, where all members shared equally. French socialist Henri Saint-Simon proposed to the contrary: socialism meant solving economic problems by means of state administration and planning, and taking advantage of new advances in science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "socialism" is also attributed to [[Pierre Leroux]]&lt;ref&gt;Leroux: socialism is "the doctrine which would not give up any of the principles of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. "Individualism and socialism" (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Marie Roch Louis Reybaud]] in France; and in Britain to Robert Owen in 1827, father of the [[cooperative movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, etymology of socialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1972). ''A History of Western Philosophy''. Touchstone. p. 781&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition and usage of "socialism" settled by the 1860s, becoming the predominant term among the group of words "co-operative", "mutualist" and "associationist", which had previously been used as synonyms. The term "communism" also fell out of use during this period, despite earlier distinctions between socialism and communism from the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Williams 1983 288"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Raymond |title=Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society, revised edition |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-19-520469-8 |page=288 |chapter=Socialism |quote=Modern usage began to settle from the 1860s, and in spite of the earlier variations and distinctions it was socialist and socialism which came through as the predominant words ... Communist, in spite of the distinction that had been made in the 1840s, was very much less used, and parties in the Marxist tradition took some variant of social and socialist as titles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early distinction between socialism and communism was that the former aimed to only socialise production while the latter aimed to socialise both production and consumption (in the form of free access to final goods).&lt;ref name="Steele 1992 43"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=David |title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |year=1992 |isbn=978-0875484495 |page=43 |quote=One widespread distinction was that socialism socialised production only while communism socialised production and consumption.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marxists employed the term "socialism" in place of "communism" by 1888, which had come to be considered an old-fashion synonym for socialism. It was not until 1917 after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] that "socialism" came to refer to a distinct stage between capitalism and communism, introduced by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a means to defend the Bolshevik seizure of power against traditional Marxist criticisms that Russia's [[productive forces]] were not sufficiently developed for socialist revolution.&lt;ref name="Steele 1992 44-45"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=David |title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |year=1992 |isbn=978-0875484495 |pages=44–45 |quote=By 1888, the term 'socialism' was in general use among Marxists, who had dropped 'communism', now considered an old fashioned term meaning the same as 'socialism' ... At the turn of the century, Marxists called themselves socialists ... The definition of socialism and communism as successive stages was introduced into Marxist theory by Lenin in 1917 ... the new distinction was helpful to Lenin in defending his party against the traditional Marxist criticism that Russia was too backward for a socialist revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction between "communist" and "socialist" as descriptors of political ideologies arose in 1918 after the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party renamed itself to the All-Russian Communist Party, where communist came to specifically mean socialists who supported the politics and theories of [[Leninism]], Bolshevism and later [[Marxism–Leninism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Busky |first=Donald F. |title=Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey |publisher=Praeger |date=20 July 2000 |isbn=978-0275968861 |page=9 |quote=In a modern sense of the word, communism refers to the ideology of Marxism-Leninism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although communist parties continued to describe themselves as socialists dedicated to socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Raymond |title=Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society, revised edition |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-19-520469-8 |page=289 |chapter=Socialism |quote=The decisive distinction between socialist and communist, as in one sense these terms are now ordinarily used, came with the renaming, in 1918, of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) as the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). From that time on, a distinction of socialist from communist, often with supporting definitions such as social democrat or democratic socialist, became widely current, although it is significant that all communist parties, in line with earlier usage, continued to describe themselves as socialist and dedicated to socialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "socialism" and "communism" eventually accorded with the adherents' and opponents' cultural attitude towards religion. In Christian Europe, communism was believed to be the [[Atheism|atheist]] way of life. In Protestant England, the word "communism" was too culturally and aurally close to the Roman Catholic [[communion rite]], hence English atheists denoted themselves socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Williams |title=Keywords: a vocabulary of culture and society |publisher=Fontana |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-00-633479-8|title-link=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that in 1848, at the time when ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was published, that "socialism was respectable on the continent, while communism was not". The [[Owenites]] in England and the [[Fourierists]] in France were considered "respectable" socialists, while working-class movements that "proclaimed the necessity of total social change" denoted themselves communists. This latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of [[Étienne Cabet]] in France and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, ''Preface to the 1888 English Edition of the Communist Manifesto'', p. 202. Penguin (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[moral philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of economic socialism within a liberal context. In later editions of his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that "as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/ John Stuart Mill]". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 10 July 2007. Retrieved 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realise social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions." Bruce Baum, "[J. S. Mill and Liberal Socialism]", Nadia Urbanati and Alex Zacharas, eds., ''J. S. Mill's Political Thought: A Bicentennial Reassessment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; While democrats looked to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] as a democratic revolution, which in the long run ensured liberty, equality and fraternity, Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gildea, "1848 in European Collective Memory", in Evans and Strandmann, eds.

Modern political ideologies. Wiley-Blackwell publishing. 2010. p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The Chartists gathered significant numbers around the People's Charter of 1838, which demanded the extension of suffrage to all male adults. Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first trade unions and consumers' cooperative societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.&lt;ref&gt;Nik Brandal, Øivind Bratberg and Dag Einar Thorsen. ''The Nordic Model of Social Democracy''. Pallgrave-Macmillan. 2013. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; A later important socialist thinker in France was [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who proposed his philosophy of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] in which "everyone had an equal claim, either alone or as part of a small cooperative, to possess and use land and other resources as needed to make a living".&lt;ref name="britannica.com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism |title=socialism |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also currents inspired by dissident Christianity of [[Christian socialism]] "often in Britain and then usually coming out of left liberal politics and a romantic anti-industrialism"&lt;ref name="George Thomas Kurian 2011"/&gt; which produced theorists such as [[Edward Bellamy]], [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] and [[Charles Kingsley]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"The origins of socialism as a political movement lie in the Industrial Revolution."

The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term "socialism".&lt;ref name="fsmitha.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html |title=Adam Smith |publisher=Fsmitha.com |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and would be based on equal opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm |title=2:BIRTH OF THE SOCIALIST IDEA |publisher=Anu.edu.au |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2011}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.&lt;ref name="fsmitha.com"/&gt; The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress,&lt;ref name="fsmitha.com"/&gt; thus embodied a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]]. Other early socialist thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hodgkin]] and Charles Hall, based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labour—the cost of the labour (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]] viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

West European social critics, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]], and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. They advocated reform, with some such as Robert Owen advocating the transformation of society to small communities without private property. Robert Owen's contribution to modern socialism was his understanding that actions and characteristics of individuals were largely determined by the social environment they were raised in and exposed to.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"/&gt; On the other hand, [[Charles Fourier]] advocated [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] which were communities that respected individual desires (including sexual preferences), affinities and creativity and saw that work has to be made enjoyable for people.&lt;ref&gt;"In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion – this is the famous theory of "attractive labour." Fourier sexualises work itself – the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts....The Harmonian does not live with some 1600 people under one roof because of compulsion or altruism, but because of the sheer pleasure of all the social, sexual, economic, "gastrosophic," cultural, &amp; creative relations this association allows &amp; encourages".[http://hermetic.com/bey/lemonade.html "The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times A Position Paper] by [[Hakim Bey]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of Owen and Fourier were tried in practice in numerous [[intentional communities]] around Europe and the American continent in the mid-19th century.

==== Paris Commune ====
[[File:Commune 28 mars.jpeg|thumb|The celebration of the election of the Commune on 28 March 1871—the [[Paris Commune]] was a major early implementation of socialist ideas]]
The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. The Commune elections held on 26 March elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite internal differences, the council began to organise the public services essential for a city of two million residents. It also reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly-democratic [[social democracy]].

Because the Commune was only able to meet on fewer than 60 days in all, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the entire period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[night working|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakery|bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return, by the city [[pawnshop]]s, of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs, pledged during the siege.&lt;ref name="Milza, Pierre, La Commune"&gt;Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner. The Commune nonetheless recognised the previous owner's right to compensation.&lt;ref name="Milza, Pierre, La Commune"/&gt;

=== First International ===
[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]
The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), often called the First International, was founded in London in 1864. The International Workingmen's Association united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blin |first=Arnaud |title=The History of Terrorism |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-24709-3 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, socialists and [[social democrats]]. The IWA held a preliminary conference in 1865 and had its first congress at [[Geneva]] in 1866. Due to the wide variety of philosophies present in the First International, there was conflict from the start. The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] who opposed communism and [[statism]]. However, shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers (called collectivists while in the International) joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps headed by Marx and Bakunin respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation. But it is desirable to consider some of the factors underlying the final emergence of a predominantly anarchist International in 1872." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas.

The followers of Bakunin were called [[collectivist anarchist]]s and sought to collectivise ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labour of each individual. Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. By contrast, anarcho-communists sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. Errico Malatesta put it: "[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one".&lt;ref name="dwardmac.pitzer.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers |author=Errico Malatesta |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html |website=Anarchy Archives |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-communism]] as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by [[Carlo Cafiero]], Emilio Covelli, [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] republicans.&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicious pp. 111-113"&gt;Nunzio Pernicone, "Italian Anarchism 1864–1892", pp. 111–13, AK Press 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm "Michael Bakunin – A Biographical Sketch"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syndicalism]] emerged in France inspired in part by the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and later by [[Fernand Pelloutier]] and [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism "Socialism"] at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It developed at the end of the 19th century out of the French trade-union movement (''syndicat'' is the French word for trade union). It was a significant force in Italy and Spain in the early 20th century until it was crushed by the fascist regimes in those countries. In the United States, syndicalism appeared in the guise of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], or "Wobblies", founded in 1905.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Syndicalism is an [[economic system]] where industries are organised into [[confederations]] (syndicates)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syndicalism |title=Syndicalism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the economy is managed by negotiation between specialists and worker representatives of each field, comprising multiple non-competitive categorised units.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. pp. 65–66, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism is thus a form of communism and economic [[corporatism]], but also refers to the political movement and tactics used to bring about this type of system. An influential anarchist movement based on syndicalist ideas is [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. ''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice''. AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.

The [[Fabian Society]] is a [[History of socialism in Great Britain|British socialist]] organisation which was established with the purpose of advancing the principles of socialism via [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and [[Reformism|reformist]] means.&lt;ref name=gt76&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Margaret |title=The Story of Fabian Socialism |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804700917 |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society laid many of the foundations of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and subsequently affected the policies of states emerging from the [[decolonisation]] of the [[British Empire]], most notably India and Singapore. Originally, the Fabian Society was committed to the establishment of a [[socialist economy]], alongside a commitment to [[British imperialism]] as a progressive and modernising force.&lt;ref name="Discovering Imperialism: Social Democracy to World War I, p. 249"&gt;''Discovering Imperialism: Social Democracy to World War I'', 25 November 2011. (p. 249): "the pro-imperialist majority, led by Sidney Webb and George Bernard Shaw, advanced an intellectual justification for central control by the British Empire, arguing that existing institutions should simply work more 'efficiently'."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the society functions primarily as a [[think tank]] and is one of fifteen [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] affiliated with the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia (the [[Australian Fabian Society]]), in Canada (the [[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]] and the now disbanded [[League for Social Reconstruction]]) and in New Zealand.

[[Guild socialism]] is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guild]]s "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism |title=Guild Socialism |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. Inspired by medieval guilds, theorists such as [[Samuel George Hobson|Samuel G. Hobson]] and [[G. D. H. Cole]] advocated the public ownership of industries and their organisation into guilds, each of which would be under the democratic control of its trade union. Guild socialists were less inclined than Fabians to invest power in a state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At some point, like the American [[Knights of Labor]], guild socialism wanted to abolish the wage system.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Second International ===
As the ideas of Marx and Engels took on flesh, particularly in central Europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889–1923'']. Retrieved 12 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was termed the Socialist International and Engels was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. Anarchists were ejected and not allowed in, mainly due to pressure from Marxists.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962 pp. 263"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). pp. 263–64&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned "into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian]] socialism. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labor movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]".&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962 pp. 263"/&gt;

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution. [[Eduard Bernstein]] was a leading [[Social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany who proposed the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution|Social Reform or Revolution?]]''. Revolutionary socialism encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define "revolution" differently from one another. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels emphasised the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning, as a first step, the "battle of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', Selected Works, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1917, the patriotism of [[World War I]] changed into [[political radicalism]] in most of Europe, the [[Socialism in the United States|United States]] and Australia. Other socialist parties from around the world who were beginning to gain importance in their national politics in the early 20th century included the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[French Section of the Workers' International]], the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], the [[Socialist Party of America]] in the United States, the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Argentinian Socialist Party]] and the Chilean Partido Obrero Socialista.

==== Russian Revolution ====
{{main|Russian Revolution}}
In February 1917, [[February Revolution|revolution exploded in Russia]]. Workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils), the monarchy fell and a [[Provisional Government of Russia, 1917|provisional government]] convoked pending the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return to his country from exile in Switzerland.

Lenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism as predicted by Marx, as well as analyses on the social conditions of his contemporary time. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working and concerning with how to make ends meet. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in Petrograd, Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia was not over, but had only begun and that the next step was for the workers' soviets to take full state authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik's party programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be given to the peasant and working class through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force in the soviets and on 7 November the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by Bolshevik Red Guards in what afterwards known as the "[[Great October Socialist Revolution]]". The rule of the provisional government was ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]—the world's first constitutionally socialist state—was established. On 25 January 1918 at the [[Petrograd Soviet]], Lenin declared "Long live the world socialist revolution!"&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, Vladimir. ''Meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of workers and soldiers' deputies 25 January 1918'', Collected works, Vol 26, p. 239. Lawrence and Wishart, (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed an immediate armistice on all fronts and transferred the land of the landed proprietors, the crown and the monasteries to the peasant committees without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, Vladimir. ''To workers Soldiers and Peasants'', Collected works, Vol 26, p. 247. Lawrence and Wishart, (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after assuming executive power on 25 January, Lenin wrote ''Draft Regulations on Workers' Control'', which granted workers control of businesses with more than five workers and office employees and access to all books, documents and stocks and whose decisions were to be "binding upon the owners of the enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, Vladimir. ''Collected Works'', Vol 26, pp. 264–65. Lawrence and Wishart (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Governing through the elected soviets and in alliance with the peasant-based [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], the Bolshevik government began nationalising banks and industry; and disavowed the national debts of the deposed [[Romanov]] royal régime. It [[Sue for peace|sued for peace]], withdrawing from World War I and convoked a [[Constituent Assembly]] in which the peasant [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (SR) won a majority.&lt;ref&gt;

Strictly, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries won whereas the Left Socialist Revolutionares were in alliance with the Bolsheviks.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constituent Assembly elected Socialist-Revolutionary leader [[Victor Chernov]] President of a Russian republic, but rejected the Bolshevik proposal that it endorse the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledge the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. The next day, the Bolsheviks declared that the assembly was elected on outdated party lists&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the RSDLP (Bolsheviks) group at the Constituent Assembly meeting 5 January 1918'' Lenin, ''Collected Works'', Vol 26, p. 429.

Parties which did not want to be a part of the resurrected Second International (ISC) or Comintern formed the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (IWUSP, also known as Vienna International/Vienna Union/Two-and-a-Half International) on 27 February 1921 at a conference in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISC and the IWUSP joined to form the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (LSI) in May 1923 at a meeting in [[Hamburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing groups which did not agree to the centralisation and abandonment of the soviets by the Bolshevik Party led [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]—such groups included [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="carr1985"&gt;Carr, E.H. – The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923.

The Bolshevik Russian Revolution of January 1918 engendered communist parties worldwide and their concomitant [[revolutions of 1917–1923]].

Pluto (1975))&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Lenin and Trotsky organised the world's communist parties into a new international association of workers—the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), also called the Third International.

The Russian Revolution also influenced uprisings in other countries around this time. The [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] resulted in the replacing Germany's imperial government with a republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the formal establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]] in August 1919 and included an episode known as the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Munich Soviet (or "Council Republic") of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though – like most revolutions – its stated goals were not exactly "temporary". Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture, along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B.

By 1920, the [[Red Army]] under its commander Trotsky had largely defeated the royalist White Armies. In 1921, [[War Communism]] was ended and under the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) private ownership was allowed for small and medium peasant enterprises. While industry remained largely state-controlled, Lenin acknowledged that the NEP was a necessary capitalist measure for a country unripe for socialism. Profiteering returned in the form of "NEP men" and rich peasants ([[kulak]]s) gained power in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1924nepmen&amp;Year=1924 |title=Soviet history: NEPmen |publisher=Soviethistory.org |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722164645/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1924nepmen&amp;Year=1924 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the role of Trotsky in this episode has been questioned by other socialists, including ex Trotskyists. In the United States, [[Dwight Macdonald]] broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] by raising the question of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which Trotsky as leader of the [[Soviet Red Army]] and the other Bolsheviks had brutally repressed. He then moved towards [[democratic socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattson, Kevin. 2002. ''Intellectuals in Action: The Origins of the New Left and Radical Liberalism, 1945–1970''.

This was later republished with the title ''Politics Past''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar critique of Trotsky's role on the events around the Kronstadt rebellion was raised by the American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]. In her essay "Trotsky Protests Too Much", she says: "I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin's rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__Trotsky_Protests_Too_Much.html |title=Trotsky Protests Too Much |website=theanarchistlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth congress ====
In 1922, the fourth congress of the [[Communist International]] took up the policy of the [[United Front]], urging communists to work with rank and file Social Democrats while remaining critical of their leaders, whom they criticised for betraying the working class by supporting the war efforts of their respective capitalist classes. For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the communist parties. When the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] applied to affiliate to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1920, it was turned down.

On seeing the Soviet State's growing coercive power in 1923, a dying Lenin said Russia had reverted to "a bourgeois tsarist machine... barely varnished with socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Serge|Serge, Victor]], ''From Lenin to Stalin'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; After Lenin's death in January 1924, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]—then increasingly under the control of [[Joseph Stalin]]—rejected the theory that socialism could not be built solely in the Soviet Union in favour of the concept of "[[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]]". Despite the marginalised [[Left Opposition]]'s demand for the restoration of Soviet democracy, Stalin developed a bureaucratic, [[authoritarian]] government that was condemned by democratic socialists, anarchists and Trotskyists for undermining the initial socialist ideals of the Bolshevik Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Serge, Victor, ''From Lenin to Stalin'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brinton |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Brinton |title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917–1921 : The State and Counter-revolution |publisher=[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] |year=1975 |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |accessdate=22 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220120533/http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |archivedate=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=December 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2011}}

In 1924, the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] was established and was ruled by the [[Mongolian People's Party]]. The Russian Revolution and the appearance of the Soviet State motivated a worldwide current of national communist parties which ended having varying levels of political and social influence. Among these there appeared the [[Communist Party of France]], the [[Communist Party USA]], the [[Italian Communist Party]], the [[Chinese Communist Party]], the [[Mexican Communist Party]], the [[Brazilian Communist Party]], the [[Chilean Communist Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]].

==== Spanish Civil War ====

[[File:Milicianas CNT-FAI.png|thumb|200px|[[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminist]] militia during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] in 1936]]
In Spain in 1936, the national [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup, sparking the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.&lt;ref name='Bolloten 1984, p. 54'&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolloten |first=Burnett |authorlink=Burnett Bolloten |title=The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |date=15 November 1984|page=1107|isbn=978-0-8078-1906-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolloten 1984, p. 54"/&gt; The events known as the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], Aragon, [[Andalusia]] and parts of [[Levante, Spain|Levante]].

Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]] the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivisation]] enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[Agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]]. Anarchist historian [[Sam Dolgoff]] estimated that about eight million people participated directly or indirectly in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Dolgoff]].

==== Post-World War II ====
[[Leon Trotsky]]'s [[Fourth International]] was established in France in 1938 when [[Troskyism|Trotskyists]] argued that the [[Communist International|Comintern]] or Third International had become irretrievably "lost to [[Stalinism]]" and thus incapable of leading the international working class to political power.&lt;ref name="transitional"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/tp/index.htm ''The Transitional Program]''. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[Nazism]] and the start of [[World War II]] led to the dissolution of the LSI in 1940. After the War, the Socialist International was formed in Frankfurt in July 1951 as a successor to the LSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, social democratic governments introduced social reform and [[wealth redistribution]] via state welfare and taxation. Social democratic parties dominated post-war politics in countries such as France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium and Norway. At one point, France claimed to be the world's most state-controlled capitalist country. The nationalised public utilities included Charbonnages de France (CDF), Electricité de France (EDF), Gaz de France (GDF), Air France, Banque de France and Régie Nationale des Usines Renault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sund.ac.uk/~os0tmc/contem/trente1.htm |title=Les trente glorieuses: 1945–1975 |publisher=Sund.ac.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010635/http://www.sund.ac.uk/~os0tmc/contem/trente1.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] was elected to office based on a radical socialist programme. The Labour government nationalised major public utilities such as mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron, steel and the Bank of England. British Petroleum was officially nationalised in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Nationalisation_of_Anglo-Iranian_Oil_Company%2C_1951 |title=Nationalisation of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, 1951 |publisher=Yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=11 June 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Crosland]] said that in 1956 25% of British industry was nationalised and that public employees, including those in nationalised industries, constituted a similar proportion of the country's total employed population.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, Anthony, ''The Future of Socialism'', pp. 9, 89.

[[File:Olof Palme statsminister, tidigt 70-tal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Olof Palme]], [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] for the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]]]]
The [[Nordic model]] is the economic and [[social model]]s of the [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland). During most of the post-war era, Sweden was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in cooperation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry.&lt;ref name="svensteinmo"&gt;''Globalization and Taxation: Challenges to the Swedish Welfare State''. By Sven Steinmo.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party held power from 1936 to 1976, 1982 to 1991, 1994 to 2006 and 2014 to present. [[Tage Erlander]] was the leader of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] and led the government from 1946 to 1969, an uninterrupted tenure of twenty-three years, one of the longest in any democracy. From 1945 to 1962, the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] held an absolute majority in the parliament led by [[Einar Gerhardsen]] who was Prime Minister with seventeen years in office. This particular adaptation of the [[Mixed economy|mixed market economy]] is characterised by more generous [[welfare states]] (relative to other developed countries), which are aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy, ensuring the universal provision of basic human rights and stabilising the economy. It is distinguished from other welfare states with similar goals by its emphasis on maximising labour force participation, promoting gender equality, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and extensive benefit levels, large magnitude of redistribution and expansionary fiscal policy.&lt;ref name="Esping-Andersen"&gt;Esping-Andersen, G.

It was based on a system of state ownership of industry managed through [[Gosplan]] (the State Planning Commission), [[Gosbank]] (the State Bank) and the [[Gossnab]] (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply).

Economic planning was conducted through a series of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]]. The emphasis was on fast development of heavy industry and the nation became one of the world's top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it lagged in light industrial production and consumer durables.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] was a spontaneous nationwide [[revolt]] against the government of the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and its Soviet-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956.

The following are references in English on the conflicting positions of [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808752,00.html ''l'Unità''], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808824,00.html Antonio Giolitti and party boss Palmiro Togliatti], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868066,00.html Giuseppe Di Vittorio] and [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pietro-Nenni Pietro Nenni].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Giuseppe Di Vittorio]] (chief of the Communist trade union [[CGIL]]) repudiated the leadership position as did the prominent party members [[Antonio Giolitti]], [[Loris Fortuna]] and many other influential communist intellectuals, who later were expelled or left the party. [[Pietro Nenni]], the national secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], a close ally of the PCI, opposed the Soviet intervention as well. Napolitano, elected in 2006 as [[President of the Italian Republic]], wrote in his 2005 political autobiography that he regretted his justification of Soviet action in Hungary and that at the time he believed in party unity and the international leadership of Soviet communism.{{cite book |last=Napolitano |first=Giorgio |year=2005 |title=Dal Pci al socialismo europeo.

Within the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), dissent that began with the repudiation of Stalin by [[John Saville]] and [[E.P. Thompson]], influential historians and members of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]], culminated in a loss of thousands of party members as events unfolded in Hungary. [[Peter Fryer]], correspondent for the CPGB newspaper ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|The Daily Worker]]'', reported accurately on the violent suppression of the uprising, but his dispatches were heavily censored; Fryer resigned from the paper upon his return, and was later expelled from the Communist Party.

In France, moderate Communists, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], resigned, questioning the policy of supporting Soviet actions by the [[French Communist Party]]. The French anarchist philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] wrote an [[open letter]], ''[[The Blood of the Hungarians]]'', criticising the West's lack of action. Even [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], still a determined Communist Party member, criticised the Soviets in his article ''Le Fantôme de Staline'', in ''Situations VII''. Sartre, Jean-Paul (1956), [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-21/2005-06-21-809020 L’intellectuel et les communistes français {{fr icon}}]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Le Web de l'Humanite, 21 June 2005.

==== Third World ====
In the post-war years, socialism became increasingly influential throughout the so-called [[Third World]]. Embracing a new [[Third World socialism]], countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America often nationalised industries held by foreign owners. The Chinese [[Kuomintang Party]], the previous ruling party in Taiwan, was referred to as having a socialist ideology since Kuomintang's revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese socialism as part of its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dirlik |first=Arif |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-aGLEtx7AYC&amp;pg=PA20|title=The Marxism in the Chinese revolution |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-3069-0 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Von KleinSmid Institute of International Affairs, University of Southern California.

The [[Chinese Revolution (1946−1950)|Chinese Revolution]] was the second stage in the [[Chinese Civil War]] which ended in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] led by the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. The term "Third World" was coined by French demographer [[Alfred Sauvy]] in 1952 on the model of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], which according to the [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]] represented everything, but was nothing "because at the end this ignored, exploited, scorned Third World like the Third Estate, wants to become something too".

The emergence of this new political entity in the frame of the [[Cold War]] was complex and painful. Several tentatives were made to organise newly independent states in order to oppose a common front towards both the United States' and the Soviet Union's influence on them, with the consequences of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] already at works. The [[Non-Aligned Movement]] constituted itself around the main figures of Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of India, President [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia, leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] who successfully opposed the French and British imperial powers during the 1956 [[Suez crisis]]. After the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] which ended the French war against [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Vietnam, the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]] gathered Nasser, Nehru, Tito, [[Sukarno]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]].

As many African countries gained independence during the 1960s, some of them rejected capitalism in favour of a more [[afrocentric]] economic model. The main architects of [[African socialism]] were [[Julius Nyerere]] of [[Tanzania]], [[Léopold Senghor]] of [[Senegal]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of [[Ghana]] and [[Sékou Touré]] of [[Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedland and Rosberg Jr. |first=William and Carl |title=African Socialism |year=1964 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=California |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cuban Revolution]] (1953–1959) was an armed revolt conducted by [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[26th of July Movement]] and its allies against the government of Cuban [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fulgencio Batista]]. The revolution began in July 1953 and finally ousted Batista on 1 January 1959, replacing his government with Castro's revolutionary state. Castro's government later reformed along communist lines, becoming the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] in October 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98937598 "Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'"].

In the United States, the New Left was associated with the [[Hippie|Hippie movement]] and anti-war college campus protest movements as well as the black liberation movements such as the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Hugh |title=In the Shadow of the Panther: Huey Newton and the Price of Black Power in America |year=1994 |publisher=Perseus Books |isbn=978-0-201-48341-3 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initially formed in opposition to the "Old Left" Democratic Party, groups composing the New Left gradually became central players in the Democratic coalition.&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman"/&gt;

==== Protests of 1968 ====
{{main|Protests of 1968}}
The protests of 1968 represented a worldwide escalation of social conflicts, predominantly characterised by popular rebellions against military, capitalist and bureaucratic elites who responded with an escalation of [[political repression]]. These protests marked a turning point for the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States, which produced revolutionary movements like the [[Black Panther Party]]; the prominent civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] organised the "[[Poor People's Campaign]]" to address issues of economic justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington |last=Isserman |first=Maurice |page=281 |isbn=978-1-58648-036-3 |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; while personally showing sympathy with democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism."{{cite book |title=Liberating Visions: Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African-American Thought |last=Franklin |first=Robert Michael |page=125 |publisher=Fortress Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8006-2392-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the [[Tet Offensive]], protests also sparked a broad movement in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] all over the United States and even into London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. In 1968 in Carrara, Italy, the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Italian Anarchist Federation|Italian]] and the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.

Mass socialist or communist movements grew not only in the United States, but also in most European countries. The most spectacular manifestation of this were the [[May 1968 protests in France]] in which students linked up with strikes of up to ten million workers and for a few days the movement seemed capable of overthrowing the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In many other capitalist countries, struggles against dictatorships, state repression and colonisation were also marked by protests in 1968, such as the beginning of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] in Mexico City and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the [[military dictatorship in Brazil]]. Countries governed by communist parties had protests against bureaucratic and military elites. In Eastern Europe there were widespread protests that escalated particularly in the [[Prague Spring]] in Czechoslovakia. In response, Soviet Union occupied Czechoslovakia, but the occupation was denounced by the [[Italian Communist Party|Italian]] and [[French Communist Party|French]]&lt;ref name="OSA"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Devlin |first=Kevin |publisher=Open Society Archives |title=Western CPs Condemn Invasion, Hail Prague Spring |url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/135-2-510.shtml |accessdate=20 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; communist parties and the [[Communist Party of Finland]]. Few western European political leaders defended the occupation, among them the [[Portuguese Communist Party|Portuguese communist]] secretary-general [[Álvaro Cunhal]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Mitrokhin (2005), p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Communist Party of Luxembourg|Luxembourg party]]&lt;ref name="OSA"/&gt; and conservative factions of the [[Communist Party of Greece]].&lt;ref name="OSA"/&gt;

In the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], a social-political youth movement mobilised against "[[bourgeois]]" elements which were seen to be infiltrating the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. This movement motivated [[Maoism]]-inspired movements around the world in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, the Socialist International (SI) had extensive contacts and discussion with the two powers of the [[Cold War]], the United States and the Soviet Union, about East-West relations and arms control. Since then, the SI has admitted as member parties the Nicaraguan [[FSLN]], the left-wing [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], as well as former communist parties such as the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] of Italy and the [[FRELIMO|Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (FRELIMO). The SI aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in [[Carnation Revolution|Portugal (1974)]] and [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain (1975)]].

Many social democratic parties, particularly after the Cold War, adopted [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] market policies including [[privatisation]], [[deregulation]] and [[financialisation]]. They abandoned their pursuit of moderate socialism in favour of [[market liberalism]]. By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain, [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, the Western [[welfare state]] was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Teeple (2000).

In the United Kingdom, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] made a public attack against the [[Entryism|entryist]] group [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] at the 1985 Labour Party conference. The Labour Party ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the Labour Party, and the party gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 miner's strike]] over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html Socialist International – Progressive Politics For A Fairer World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a "[[Third Way]]" which called for a re-evalutation of welfare state policies.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3–4, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: "The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
African socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent. [[Julius Nyerere]] was inspired by [[Fabian socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruud van Dijk|author2=William Glenn Gray|author3=Svetlana Savranskaya|author4=Jeremi Suri|author5=Qiang Zhai|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&amp;pg=PA880+|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-88021-0|page=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a firm believer in rural Africans and their traditions and [[ujamaa]], a system of collectivisation that according to Nyerere was present before European imperialism. Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.

=== Asia ===
In Asia, states with socialist economies—such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam—have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets. Forms include the Chinese [[socialist market economy]] and the Vietnamese [[socialist-oriented market economy]]. They utilise [[State enterprise|state-owned corporate]] management models as opposed to modelling socialist enterprise on traditional management styles employed by government agencies. In China living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the [[late-2000s recession]], but centralised political control remained tight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html |title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript |accessdate=12 July 2008 |date=11 April 2006 |website=Frontline |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] in his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'', later supported by other academics,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Lankov]].

Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under ''[[Đổi Mới]]'', the government of Vietnam encourages private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.&lt;ref name="Loan"/&gt; The Vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports and foreign investment.

The objectives of the [[Party of European Socialists]], the European Parliament's socialist and social democratic bloc, are now "to pursue international aims in respect of the principles on which the European Union is based, namely principles of freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy, respect of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and respect for the Rule of Law".

== Social and political theory ==
Early socialist thought took influences from a diverse range of philosophies such as civic [[republicanism]], [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]], [[romanticism]], forms of [[materialism]], [[Christianity]] (both Catholic and Protestant), [[natural law]] and [[natural rights theory]], [[utilitarianism]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] political economy.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent. Modern political ideologies. Wiley-Blackwell publishing. 2010. pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosophical basis for a lot of early socialism was the emergence of [[positivism]] during the [[European Enlightenment]]. Positivism held that both the natural and social worlds could be understood through scientific knowledge and be analyzed using scientific methods. This core outlook influenced early social scientists and different types of socialists ranging from anarchists like [[Peter Kropotkin]] to technocrats like [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11291/Socialism-Socialism-during-its-Mature-Phase.html |title=Socialism during its "mature phase" |year=2013 |publisher=Science Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Claude Henri de Saint-Simon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henri de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]], early French socialist]]
The fundamental objective of socialism is to attain an advanced level of material production and therefore greater productivity, efficiency and rationality as compared to capitalism and all previous systems, under the view that an expansion of human productive capability is the basis for the extension of freedom and equality in society.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism and the Market: The Socialist Calculation Debate Revisited''. Routledge Library of 20th Century Economics, 8 February 2000. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-0415195867}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of socialist theory hold that human behaviour is largely shaped by the social environment. In particular, socialism holds that social [[mores]], values, cultural traits and economic practices are social creations and not the result of an immutable natural law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claessens |first=August |title=The logic of socialism |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=April 2009 |isbn=978-1104238407 |page=15 |quote=The individual is largely a product of his environment and much of his conduct and behavior is the reflex of getting a living in a particular stage of society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, Enrico, "Socialism and Modern Science", in ''Evolution and Socialism'' (1912), p.&amp;nbsp;79:&lt;blockquote&gt; Upon what point are orthodox political economy and socialism in absolute conflict? Political economy has held and holds that the economic laws governing the production and distribution of wealth which it has established are natural laws ... not in the sense that they are laws naturally determined by the condition of the social organism (which would be correct), but that they are absolute laws, that is to say that they apply to humanity at all times and in all places, and consequently, that they are immutable in their principal points, though they may be subject to modification in details. Scientific socialism holds, the contrary, that the laws established by classical political economy, since the time of Adam Smith, are laws peculiar to the present period in the history of civilized humanity, and that they are, consequently, laws essentially relative to the period of their analysis and discovery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The object of their critique is thus not human avarice or human consciousness, but the material conditions and man-made social systems (i.e. the economic structure of society) that gives rise to observed social problems and inefficiencies. [[Bertrand Russell]], often considered to be the father of analytic philosophy, identified as a socialist. Russell opposed the class struggle aspects of Marxism, viewing socialism solely as an adjustment of economic relations to accommodate modern machine production to benefit all of humanity through the progressive reduction of necessary work time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |url=http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html |title=In Praise of Idleness |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature and define freedom as a state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava. ''Political Theory: An Introduction''. Pearson Education India, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The socialist concept of individuality is thus intertwined with the concept of individual creative expression. Karl Marx believed that expansion of the productive forces and technology was the basis for the expansion of human freedom and that socialism, being a system that is consistent with modern developments in technology, would enable the flourishing of "free individualities" through the progressive reduction of necessary labour time. The reduction of necessary labour time to a minimum would grant individuals the opportunity to pursue the development of their true individuality and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marx |first=Karl |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch14.htm |title=The Grundrisse |year=1857–1861|quote=The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement), thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Magdoff |first=Fred |last2=Yates |first2=Michael D. |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/091109magdoff-yates.php |title=What Needs To Be Done: A Socialist View |publisher=Monthly Review|accessdate=23 February 2014|date=November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need and therefore a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that "making money", or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand (the production of [[use-value]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''Let's produce for use, not profit''.

Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of [[productive forces]] in the economy. According to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralised, socialised institutions based on private appropriation of revenue''—''but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs''—''until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Fredrich.

Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation, which incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work, inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion while (the corrective measures) reduce the overall efficiency of the market economy.&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197–98)&lt;/ref&gt; These corrective policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as [[minimum wage]]s, [[Unemployment benefit|unemployment insurance]], taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labour, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production. In essence, social welfare policies cripple capitalism and its incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long-run.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists, 1998. pp. 60–61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', 1998. pp. 60–61"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists argue that the establishment of a [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] is the only way to overcome these deficiencies. Socialists and specifically [[Marxian Socialism|Marxian socialists]] argue that the inherent conflict of interests between the working class and capital prevent optimal use of available human resources and leads to contradictory interest groups (labour and business) striving to influence the state to intervene in the economy in their favor at the expense of overall economic efficiency.

Early socialists ([[Utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] and [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]) criticised capitalism for concentrating [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society.&lt;ref&gt;in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009).

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The writings of [[Karl Marx]] provided the basis for the development of [[Marxism|Marxist]] political theory and [[Marxian economics]]]]
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that socialism would emerge from historical necessity as capitalism rendered itself obsolete and unsustainable from increasing internal contradictions emerging from the development of the [[productive forces]] and technology. It was these advances in the productive forces combined with the old [[social relations of production]] of capitalism that would generate contradictions, leading to working-class consciousness.&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62, ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx and Engels held the view that the consciousness of those who earn a wage or salary (the [[working class]] in the broadest Marxist sense) would be moulded by their conditions of [[wage slavery]], leading to a tendency to seek their freedom or [[emancipation of labour|emancipation]] by overthrowing ownership of the means of production by capitalists and consequently, overthrowing the state that upheld this economic order. For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[withering away of the state|state would wither away]]. The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede [[communism]]. The major characteristics of socialism (particularly as conceived by Marx and Engels after the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871) are that the [[proletariat]] would control the means of production through a [[socialist state|workers' state]] erected by the workers in their interests. Economic activity would still be organised through the use of incentive systems and social classes would still exist, but to a lesser and diminishing extent than under capitalism.

For orthodox Marxists, socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of "from each according to his ability, [[to each according to his contribution]]" while upper stage communism is based on the principle of "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]", the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaff |first=Kory |title=Philosophy and the Problems of Work: A Reader|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham, Md |year=2001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdLh5EMehwgC&amp;pg=PA224 224] |isbn=978-0-7425-0795-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walicki |first=Andrzej |title=Marxism and the leap to the kingdom of freedom: the rise and fall of the Communist utopia |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, Calif |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8047-2384-8 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued that the material productive forces (in industry and commerce) brought into existence by capitalism predicated a cooperative society since production had become a mass social, collective activity of the working class to create commodities but with private ownership (the relations of production or property relations). This conflict between collective effort in large factories and private ownership would bring about a conscious desire in the working class to establish collective ownership commensurate with the collective efforts their daily experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karl Marx, Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of the state ===
Socialists have taken different perspectives on the [[State (polity)|state]] and the role it should play in revolutionary struggles, in constructing socialism and within an established socialist economy.

In the 19th century the philosophy of state socialism was first explicitly expounded by the German political philosopher [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]. In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective of the state, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Thus Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to "wither away". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism.{{Sfn | Berlau | 1949 | p = 21}}

Preceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists including [[Reformism|reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. Following the victory of Leninism in Russia, the idea of "[[state socialism]]" spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with ‘democratic centralism’, ‘central planning’, and State ownership of the means of production. |ref=p. 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism (and social ownership) with state ownership over the means of production because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct and unique institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism) and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-156161-0 |page=169 |quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it amounts to a distortion of historical description, to use them beyond the social world or culture whose denizens they are. Now ownership or property – also, so I believe, taxation – are such denizens of the world of commercial society, exactly as knights and fiefs are denizens of the feudal world. But so is the state (a denizen of commercial society).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utopian versus scientific ===
{{main|Utopian socialism|Scientific socialism}}
Utopian socialism is a term used to define the first currents of modern socialist thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html |title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as reactionary.&lt;ref name=Draper&gt;{{cite book |last=Draper |first=Hal |title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms |year=1990 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0853457985 |pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a negative term in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"/&gt;

Religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorised as [[Religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as "utopian socialist".

For Marxists, the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' "[w]hat the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers",&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, Communist Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society.

=== Reform versus revolution ===
{{main|Revolutionary socialism|Reformism}}
Revolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of "revolution". Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[Impossibilism|impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[Trade union|unions]] and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninism|Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolution" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no.2 (April–June 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.

Reformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] democratic socialism. Reformism is the belief that socialists should stand in parliamentary elections within capitalist society and if elected utilise the [[machinery of government]] to pass political and social reforms for the purposes of ameliorating the instabilities and inequities of capitalism.

== Economics ==
{{main|Socialist economics}}
{{see also|Production for use}}
Socialist economics starts from the premise that "individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another. Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it. Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The original conception of socialism was an economic system whereby production was organised in a way to directly produce goods and services for their utility (or use-value in classical and Marxian economics): the direct allocation of resources in terms of physical units as opposed to financial calculation and the economic laws of capitalism (see [[law of value]]), often entailing the end of capitalistic economic categories such as [[Renting|rent]], [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=20 |quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories – such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent – and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognised the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilise the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fully developed socialist economy, production and balancing factor inputs with outputs becomes a technical process to be undertaken by engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition: "Socialist Economy" |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |page=117 |quote=In such a setting, information problems are not serious, and engineers rather than economists can resolve the issue of factor proportions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Market socialism]] refers to an array of different economic theories and systems that utilise the market mechanism to organise production and to allocate factor inputs among socially owned enterprises, with the economic surplus (profits) accruing to society in a [[social dividend]] as opposed to private capital owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=September 2003 |isbn=978-0-415-24187-8 |page=70 |quote=Market socialism is a general designation for a number of models of economic systems. On the one hand, the market mechanism is utilised to distribute economic output, to organise production and to allocate factor inputs. On the other hand, the economic surplus accrues to society at large rather than to a class of private (capitalist) owners, through some form of collective, public or social ownership of capital.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of market socialism include [[libertarianism|libertarian]] proposals such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], based on classical economics, and neoclassical economic models such as the [[Lange Model]]. However, some economists such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Mancur Olson]] and others not specifically advancing anti-socialists positions have shown that prevailing economic models upon which such democratic or market socialism models might be based have logical flaws or unworkable presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph |title=Whither Socialism? |publisher=The MIT Press |date=January 1996 |isbn=978-0262691826|quote=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mancur Olson, Jr., 1965, 2nd ed., 1971.

The ownership of the [[means of production]] can be based on direct ownership by the users of the productive property through [[worker cooperative]]; or [[common ownership|commonly owned]] by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production; or [[public ownership]] by a state apparatus. Public ownership may refer to the creation of [[state-owned enterprises]], [[nationalisation]], [[municipalisation]] or autonomous collective institutions. Some socialists feel that in a socialist economy, at least the "[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|commanding heights]]" of the economy must be publicly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/068483569X |title=Excerpt from Commanding Heights |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Economic liberalism|economic liberals]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right libertarians]] view [[Private enterprise|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and the market exchange as natural entities or moral rights which are central to their conceptions of freedom and liberty and view the economic dynamics of capitalism as immutable and absolute, therefore they perceive [[public ownership]] of the [[means of production]], [[cooperatives]] and [[economic planning]] as infringements upon liberty.&lt;ref name="milton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sangam.org/taraki/articles/2006/11-25_Friedman_MGR.php?uid=2075 |title=On Milton Friedman, MGR &amp; Annaism |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bellamy |first=Richard |title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-56354-3 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management and control over the activities of enterprises are based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximise occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982. p. 197"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (p. 197): "The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organisation; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labour. Such an organisation involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy."&lt;/ref&gt;

The role and use of money in a hypothetical socialist economy is a contested issue. According to the [[Austrian school of economics|Austrian school]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], an economic system that does not use [[money]], financial calculation and [[Market price|market pricing]] would be unable to effectively value [[capital good]]s and coordinate production and therefore these types of socialism are impossible because they lack the necessary information to perform economic calculation in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Von Mises, ''Socialism'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |accessdate=8 September 2008 |last=Von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |year=1990 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Robert Owen]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated various forms of [[labour voucher]]s or labour credits, which like money would be used to acquire articles of consumption, but unlike money they are unable to become [[Financial capital|capital]] and would not be used to allocate resources within the production process. Bolshevik revolutionary [[Leon Trotsky]] argued that money could not be arbitrarily abolished following a socialist revolution. Money had to exhaust its "historic mission", meaning it would have to be used until its function became redundant, eventually being transformed into bookkeeping receipts for statisticians and only in the more distant future would money not be required for even that role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch04.htm ''Leon Trotsky: The Revolution Betrayed''] (1936).

=== Planned economy ===
{{main|Planned economy}}
A planned economy is a type of economy consisting of a mixture of public ownership of the means of production and the coordination of production and distribution through [[economic planning]]. There are two major types of planning: decentralised-planning and centralised-planning. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |pages=120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as "command economies", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Richard E. |title=Command Economy |url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an "administered" or "managed" economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nove |first=Alec |title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |isbn=978-0043350492 |page=78 |quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J. Wilhelm, Hillel Ticktin. They all in their very different ways note the fact that plans are often (usually) unfulfilled, that information flows are distorted, that plan-instructions are the subject of bargaining, that there are many distortions and inconsistencies, indeed that (as many sources attest) plans are frequently altered within the period to which they are supposed to apply...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although central planning was largely supported by [[Marxist–Leninist]]s, some factions within the Soviet Union before the rise of [[Stalinism]] held positions contrary to central planning. Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings 1932–33, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.&lt;/ref&gt; [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].&lt;ref name="hayek"&gt;F.

=== Self-managed economy ===
{{see also|Decentralised planning|Economic democracy|Workers' self-management}}
A self-managed, decentralised economy is based on autonomous self-regulating economic units and a decentralised mechanism of resource allocation and decision-making. This model has found support in notable classical and neoclassical economists including [[Alfred Marshall]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jaroslav Vanek]]. There are numerous variations of self-management, including labour-managed firms and worker-managed firms. The goals of self-management are to eliminate exploitation and reduce [[Social alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=Routledge |date=September 2003 |isbn=978-0-415-24187-8 |pages=8–9 |quote=One finds favorable opinions of cooperatives also among other great economists of the past, such as, for example, John Stuart Mill and Alfred Marshall...In eliminating the domination of capital over labour, firms run by workers eliminate capitalist exploitation and reduce alienation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guild socialism]] is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guild]]s "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism |title=Guild Socialism |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; It was strongly associated with [[G. D. H. Cole]] and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].

One such system is the cooperative economy, a largely free [[market economy]] in which workers manage the firms and democratically determine remuneration levels and labour divisions. Productive resources would be legally owned by the [[cooperative]] and rented to the workers, who would enjoy [[usufruct]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Vanek, Jaroslav, ''The Participatory Economy'' (Ithaca, NY.: Cornell University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of decentralised planning is the use of [[cybernetics]], or the use of computers to manage the allocation of economic inputs. The socialist-run government of [[Salvador Allende]] in Chile experimented with [[Project Cybersyn]], a real-time information bridge between the government, state enterprises and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cybersyn.cl/ingles/cybersyn/cybernet.html |title=CYBERSYN/Cybernetic Synergy |publisher=Cybersyn.cl |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, more recent variant is [[participatory economics]], wherein the economy is planned by decentralised councils of workers and consumers. Workers would be remunerated solely according to effort and sacrifice, so that those engaged in dangerous, uncomfortable and strenuous work would receive the highest incomes and could thereby work less.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], ''The Political Economy of Participatory Economics'' (Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary model for a self-managed, non-market socialism is [[Pat Devine]]'s model of negotiated coordination. Negotiated coordination is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |format=PDF |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Bauwens]] identifies the emergence of the open software movement and [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]] as a new alternative [[mode of production]] to the capitalist economy and centrally planned economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources and the production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499 |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production |date=12 January 2005 |publisher=CTheory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[private property]] and capitalism in favour of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan James Mayne|title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was practiced in [[Catalonia]] and other places in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] during the Spanish Civil War. [[Sam Dolgoff]] estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution.&lt;ref name=Dolgoff1974&gt;{{citation |last=Dolgoff |first=S. |title=The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution |year=1974 |isbn=978-0-914156-03-1|title-link=The Anarchist Collectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] established a system based on market-based allocation, social ownership of the means of production and self-management within firms. This system substituted Yugoslavia's Soviet-type central planning with a decentralised, self-managed system after reforms in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Estrin, Saul. 1991. "Yugoslavia: The Case of Self-Managing Market Socialism." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 5(4): 187–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that "re-organising production so that workers become collectively self-directed at their work-sites" not only moves society beyond both capitalism and [[state socialism]] of the last century, but would also mark another milestone in human history, similar to earlier transitions out of slavery and feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). [http://www.democracyatwork.info/ ''Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism'']. [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-QnzAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 pp. 13–14].
* "The disappearances of slaves and masters and lords and serfs would now be replicated by the disappearance of capitalists and workers. Such oppositional categories would no longer apply to the relationships of production, Instead, workers would become their own collective bosses. The two categories – employer and employee – would be integrated in the same individuals."&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Wolff claims that [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] is "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organisation of production".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard]] (24 June 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 12 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State-directed economy ===
{{see also|State socialism}}
State socialism can be used to classify any variety of socialist philosophies that advocates the ownership of the [[means of production]] by the [[State (polity)|state apparatus]], either as a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism, or as an end-goal in itself. Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.

A state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee's administration. In the biography of the 1945 United Kingdom Labour Party Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]], Francis Beckett states: "[T]he government... wanted what would become known as a mixed economy".&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', (2007) Politico's.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationalisation in the United Kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation). [[British Aerospace]] was a combination of major aircraft companies [[British Aircraft Corporation]], [[Hawker Siddeley]] and others. [[British Shipbuilders]] was a combination of the major shipbuilding companies including [[Cammell Laird]], [[Govan Shipbuilders]], [[Swan Hunter]] and [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]], whereas the nationalisation of the coal mines in 1947 created a coal board charged with running the coal industry commercially so as to be able to meet the interest payable on the bonds which the former mine owners' shares had been converted into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Socialist Party of Great Britain |authorlink=Socialist Party of Great Britain |title=The Strike Weapon: Lessons of the Miners' Strike |publisher=Socialist Party of Great Britain |location=London |year=1985 |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/pdf/ms.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614065637/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/pdf/ms.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardcastle |first=Edgar |authorlink=Edgar Hardcastle |title=The Nationalisation of the Railways |journal=[[Socialist Standard]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1947 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hardcastle/1947/02/railways.htm |accessdate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market socialism ===
{{main|Market socialism}}
Market socialism consists of publicly owned or cooperatively owned enterprises operating in a [[market economy]]. It is a system that utilises the market and [[Price system|monetary prices]] for the allocation and accounting of the [[means of production]], thereby retaining the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: "It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large."&lt;/ref&gt; In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. [[Neoclassical economist]] [[Léon Walras]] believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=21 |quote=For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.

[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]
[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labour theory of value]] that holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labour necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Socialists in Union Square, N.Y.C..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Socialists in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], New York City on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] 1912]]
The major socialist political movements are described below. Independent socialist theorists, [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] authors and academic supporters of socialism may not be represented in these movements. Some political groups have called themselves socialist while holding views that some consider antithetical to socialism. The term "socialist" has also been used by some politicians on the [[right-wing politics|political right]] as an epithet against certain individuals who do not consider themselves to be socialists and against policies that are not considered socialist by their proponents.

There are many variations of socialism and as such there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism. However, there have been common elements identified by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Dictionary of Socialism'' (1924), Angelo S. Rappoport analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include: general criticisms of the social effects of [[private ownership]] and control of capital – as being the cause of poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality and a lack of economic security; a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the [[means of production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] and [[Means of exchange|exchange]] (the degree and means of control vary amongst socialist movements); an agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon [[social justice]], including social equality, economic protection of people and should provide a more satisfying life for most people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Concepts of Socialism'' (1975), [[Bhikhu Parekh]] identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society: sociality, social responsibility, cooperation and planning.&lt;ref name="Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study ''Ideologies and Political Theory'' (1996), [[Michael Freeden]] states that all socialists share five themes: the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals; second, that it considers human welfare a desirable objective; third, that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive; fourth, it holds the belief of human equality; and fifth, that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change.&lt;ref name="Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2"/&gt;

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

=== Democratic socialism ===
{{main|Democratic socialism}}
Modern democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to promote the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.

The major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to "humanise" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to "humanise" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} "Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state – pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.&lt;ref&gt;This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who "argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145–63 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms "democratic socialism" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leninism and precedents ===
{{main|Blanquism|Marxism–Leninism}}
[[Blanquism]] refers to a conception of revolution generally attributed to [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] which holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/blanquism.php WisdomSupreme.com definition of Blanquism], last retrieved 25 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Having seized power, the revolutionaries would then use the power of the state to introduce socialism. It is considered a particular sort of "putschism"—that is, the view that political revolution should take the form of a ''[[putsch]]'' or ''coup d'état''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyouth.com/archives/theory/glossary/b.html#Blanquism NewYouth.com entry for Blanquism], last retrieved 25 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]]&lt;ref name="bern"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lenin |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch06.htm#s2 |title=The State and Revolution |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised [[Vladimir Lenin]] that his conception of revolution was elitist and essentially Blanquist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosa Luxemburg]] as part of a longer section on Blanquism in her "Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy" (later published as "Leninism or Marxism?"), writes: "For Lenin, the difference between the [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] and Blanquism is reduced to the observation that in place of a handful of conspirators we have a class-conscious proletariat. He forgets that this difference implies a complete revision of our ideas on organisation and, therefore, an entirely different conception of centralism and the relations existing between the party and the struggle itself. Blanquism did not count on the [[direct action]] of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organise the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup. Indeed, to assure the success of the revolutionary conspiracy, it was considered wiser to keep the mass at some distance from the conspirators.Rosa Luxemburg, [http://www.marx.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/questions-rsd/ch01.htm ''Leninism or Marxism?''], [http://www.marx.org Marx.org], last retrieved 25 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism–Leninism]] is a political ideology combining [[Marxism]] (the [[Scientific socialism|scientific socialist]] concepts theorised by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]) and [[Leninism]] (Lenin's theoretical expansions of Marxism which include [[anti-imperialism]], [[democratic centralism]] and [[Vanguardism#Political party|party-building principles]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Marxism–Leninism''. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism–Leninism was the official ideology of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] (1919–1943) and later it became the main guiding ideology for [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Maoists]] and [[Stalinists]].

[[Christian socialism]] is a broad concept involving an intertwining of the Christian religion with the politics and economic theories of socialism.

[[Islamic socialism]] is a term coined by various [[Muslim]] leaders to describe a more [[Spirituality|spiritual]] form of socialism. Muslim socialists believe that the teachings of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] are compatible with principles of [[Social equality|equality]] and [[public ownership]] drawing inspiration from the early Medina welfare state established by [[Muhammad]].

Many [[Socialism and LGBT rights|socialists were early advocates for LGBT rights]]. For early socialist [[Charles Fourier]], true freedom could only occur without suppressing passions, as the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. Writing before the advent of the term "homosexuality", Fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and ''androgénité''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that "affirming one's difference" can actually enhance social integration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816–18, not published widely until 1967: Paris: Éditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he passionately advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. Wilde's [[libertarian socialist]] politics were shared by other figures who actively campaigned for homosexual emancipation in the late 19th century such as [[Edward Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of "the Cause". (McKenna, Neil. 2003.

He is known for his roles in helping to found several gay organisations, including the [[Mattachine Society]], the first sustained gay rights group in the United States which in its early days had a strong marxist influence. The ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'' reports that "[a]s Marxists the founders of the group believed that the injustice and oppression which they suffered stemmed from relationships deeply embedded in the structure of American society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Mattachine.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mattachine Society at Dynes, Wayne R.

An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]].

Radical [[red-green alliance]]s have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical greens and other radical left groups. In [[Denmark]], the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the [[European Parliament]], a number of far-left parties from Northern Europe have organised themselves into the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]].

=== Syndicalism ===
{{main|Syndicalism}}
Syndicalism is a social movement that operates through industrial trade unions and rejects [[state socialism]] and the use of establishment politics to establish or promote socialism. They reject using state power to construct a socialist society, favouring strategies such as the [[general strike]]. Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production. Some Marxist currents advocate syndicalism, such as [[DeLeonism]]. [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|theory of anarchism]] which views [[syndicalism]] as a method for workers in [[capitalist society]] to gain control of an economy and with that control influence broader society. The [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] largely orchestrated by the anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] offers an historical example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Dolgoff]].

The '''Sydney Mint''' in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], is the oldest public building in the [[Sydney central business district]].  Built between 1811 and 1816 as the southern wing of the [[Sydney Hospital]], it was then known as the ''Rum Hospital''.  In 1854 a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] was established on the site with the hospital building used to house mint staff as well as providing a residence for the Deputy Mint Master. A coining factory was built at the rear.  Both of these structures have exceptional heritage significance and have been associated with major events in the colonial history of New South Wales.   

Located in Sydney’s central business district at 10 [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]], it is near many other famous Australian historical buildings including [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]], [[St. James Church, Sydney|St James' Church]] and [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliament House]]. The building is now the head office of the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] and is listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045151|Mint Building|fn=S90/01189; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045802|Mint Building and Hyde Park Barracks Group|fn=EF10/20645; S90/1189;S96/465|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of the building are open to the public.

==History==
[[File:General Hospital Sydney model.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Model of the South Wing of the General Hospital]]
===General Hospital and The Dispensary (1811&amp;ndash;1854)===
In 1811, [[Governor Macquarie|Governor Lachlan Macquarie]] commenced planning for a new general [[hospital]] in Sydney which was to be his first major public building. The contractors were paid with 45,000 gallons of rum hence the name ''Rum Hospital''.  Construction was completed in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hht.net.au/museums/the_mint/2|title=The Mint: Surgeons|work=Historic Houses Trust website|publisher=Historic Houses Trust, NSW State Government|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its design is loosely based on ancient [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek architecture]] with its two tiers of columns made of cedar timber in the style of [[Doric order|Doric]] mouldings. The columns are angled inwards creating an optical illusion imitating the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

A dispensary opened in 1842 replacing the south wing after which the rest of the site was used as a military hospital until 1854.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sydney Mint (drawing).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Drawing of the Sydney Mint and the Coining Factory]] --&gt;

===Royal Mint and the Coining Factory (1855&amp;ndash;1926)===
The [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Secretary of State]] gave acceptance to the colonial government to establish a mint in Sydney which was to be the first branch of the [[Royal Mint]] outside [[England]].  The rear side of the mint became the coining factory. There were frequently major upgrades on the mint during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. However, by 1926, with the [[Melbourne Mint|Melbourne]] and [[Perth Mint]]s having much better technology and being more profitable, the mint was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hht.net.au/museums/the_mint/3|title=The Mint: Coins|work=Historic Houses Trust website|publisher=Historic Houses Trust, NSW State Government|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, 19 year old [[William Stanley Jevons]] and Francis Bowyer Miller were appointed Assayers to the Mint. Captain Edward Wolstenholme, of Royal Engineers, was appointed Deputy Master and Chief Officer, Charles Elonis Superintendent of the Bullion Office, Joseph Trickett Superintendent of the Coining Department, Robert Huat First Clerk in the Bullion Office and Elliott Knipe Registrar and Accountant.&lt;ref&gt;1854 'COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.', The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), 8 November, p. 8. , viewed 11 Oct 2016, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12959267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government offices, Law Courts and the Museum (1927&amp;ndash;present)===
The Government Insurance Office moved into the building as soon as the Mint closed. Soon other government offices followed, including the Local Government Superannuation Board, the Electrical Contractors and Licensing Board and the Family Endowment Department. Government offices kept arriving and going for another fifty years. Gradually these buildings were being demolished.

It was expected that law courts would be established after the demolitions, however activists successfully led a campaign in 1979 to preserve the Mint buildings as well as Hyde Park Barracks. The [[premier of New South Wales]], [[Neville Wran]], announced that the Mint would come under control of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. The [[museum]] closed down in 1997 and the building’s ownership was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust.

The Mint was recently named as one of 30 projects that have reshaped the built environment since 1978. "The refurbishment project is an example of the Integration of services systems (by [[Steensen Varming]] ), to provide a modern, functional headquarters while minimising the impact on the heritage and archaeological fabric of a site."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsdlive.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3121000{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cloisters''' is a museum in [[Fort Tryon Park]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]], [[New York City]], specializing in European medieval architecture, sculpture and decorative arts, with a focus on the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] periods. Governed by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], it contains a large collection of medieval artworks shown in the architectural settings of French monasteries and abbeys. Its buildings are centered around four [[cloisters]]—the Cuxa, Saint-Guilhem, Bonnefont and Trie—which were purchased by American sculptor and art dealer [[George Grey Barnard]], dismantled in Europe between 1934 and 1939, and moved to New York. They were acquired for the museum by financier and philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] Other major sources of objects were the collections of [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[Joseph Brummer]].

The museum's building was designed by architect [[Charles Collens]], on a site on a steep hill, with upper and lower levels. It contains medieval gardens and a series of chapels and themed galleries, including the Romanesque, Fuentidueña, Unicorn, Spanish and Gothic rooms.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=1}} The design, layout and ambiance of the building is intended to evoke a sense of medieval European monastic life.{{sfn|Landais|1992|p= 43}}

It holds about 5,000 works of art and architecture, all European and mostly dating from the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] to the [[Renaissance art|early Renaissance]] periods, mainly during the 12th through 15th centuries. The varied objects include stone and wood sculptures, [[tapestries]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s and panel paintings, of which the best known include the c. 1422 [[Early Netherlandish]] ''[[Mérode Altarpiece]]'' and the c. 1495–1505 [[Flemish]] ''[[Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' tapestries.

Rockefeller purchased the museum site in Washington Heights in 1930, and donated it and the Bayard collection to the Metropolitan in 1931. Upon its opening on May 10, 1938, the Cloisters was described as a collection "shown informally in a picturesque setting, which stimulates imagination and creates a receptive mood for enjoyment".&lt;ref name="met1926"&gt;"The Opening of the Cloisters". ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Volume 21, No. 5, 1926. pp. 113–116&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
The basis for the museum's architectural structure came from the collection of George Grey Barnard, an American sculptor and collector who almost single-handedly established a [[medieval art]] museum near his home in the [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] section of [[Upper Manhattan]]. Although he was a successful sculptor who had studied at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], his income was not enough to support his family. Barnard was a risk taker and led most of his life on the edge of poverty.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}} He moved to Paris in 1883 where he studied at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]].{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}} He lived in the village of [[Moret-sur-Loing]], near [[Fontainebleau]], between 1905 and 1913,{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 11}} and began to deal in 13th- and 14th-century European objects to supplement his earnings. In the process he built a large personal collection of what he described as "antiques", at first by buying and selling stand-alone objects with French dealers,{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 309}} then by the acquisition of ''in situ'' architectural artifacts from local farmers.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}}

[[File:George Grey Barnard and Clare Frewen Sheridan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Grey Barnard|Barnard]] and [[Clare Sheridan]] at his cloister in New York City, 1921]]
Barnard was primarily interested in the abbeys and churches founded by monastic orders from the 12th century. Following centuries of pillage and destruction during wars and revolutions, stones from many of these buildings were reused by local populations.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}} A pioneer in seeing the value in such artifacts, Barnard often met with hostility to his effort from local and governmental groups.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 11}} Yet he was an astute negotiator who had the advantage of a professional sculptor's eye for superior stone carving, and by 1907 he had built a high-quality collection at relatively low cost. Reputedly he paid $25,000 for the Trie buildings, $25,000 for the Bonnefort and $100,000 for the Cuxa cloisters.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=8}} His success led him to adopt a somewhat romantic view of himself. He recalled bicycling across the French countryside and unearthing fallen and long-forgotten Gothic masterworks along the way. He claimed to have found the tomb effigy of Jean d'Alluye face down, in use as a bridge over a small stream.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 309}} By 1914 he had gathered enough artifacts to open a gallery in Manhattan.{{sfn|Siple|1938|p=88}}

[[File:John D. Rockefeller Jr. cph.3a03736.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] in 1920]]
Barnard often neglected his personal finances,{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=8}} and was so disorganized that he often misplaced the origin or provenance of his purchases. He sold his collection to [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] in 1925 during one of his recurring monetary crises.{{sfn|Hayward|Shepard|Clark|2012|p=38}} The two had been introduced by the architect [[William W. Bosworth]].{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=2}} Purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the acquisition included structures that would become the foundation and core of the museum.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}}{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 11}} Rockefeller and Barnard were polar opposites in both temperament and outlook and did not get along; Rockefeller was reserved, Barnard exuberant. The English painter and art critic [[Roger Fry]] was then the Metropolitan's chief European acquisition agent and acted as an intermediary.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 310}} Rockefeller eventually acquired Barnard's collection for around $700,000, retaining Barnard as an advisor.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=18}}

In 1927 Rockefeller hired [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]], son of one of the designers of [[Central Park]], and the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm to create a park in the Fort Washington area.{{sfn|Husband|2013|pp=6 &amp; 26}} In February 1930 Rockefeller offered to build the Cloisters for the Metropolitan.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=6}} Under consultation with Bosworth,{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 11}} he decided to build the museum at a {{convert|66.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} site at Fort Tryon Park, which they choose for its elevation, views, and accessible but isolated location.{{sfn|Siple|1938|p=88}} The land and existing buildings were purchased that year from the [[C. K. G. Billings]] estate and other holdings in the Fort Washington area.  The Cloisters building and adjacent {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} gardens were designed by Charles Collens.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 12}} They incorporate elements from abbeys in [[Catalonia]] and France. Parts from [[Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa|Sant Miquel de Cuixà]], [[Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert]], [[Proupiary|Bonnefont-en-Comminges]], Trie-sur-Baïse and [[Froville]] were disassembled stone-by-stone and shipped to New York City, where they were reconstructed and integrated into a cohesive whole. Construction took place over a five-year period from 1934.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/the-cloisters-museum-and-gardens The Cloisters Museum and Gardens]". The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved May 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller bought several hundred acres of the [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|New Jersey Palisades]], which he donated to the State in an effort to preserve the view from the museum.{{sfn|Husband|2013|pp=16–20}} The Cloisters' new building and gardens were officially opened on May 10, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cloisters Opened on Tryon Heights | website=The New York Times | date=May 11, 1938 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/05/11/archives/cloisters-opened-on-tryon-heights-rockefeller-disclaims-praise-as.html | access-date=November 28, 2018 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the public was not allowed to visit until four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=4,473 Visit the Cloisters | website=The New York Times | date=May 15, 1938 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/05/15/archives/4473-visit-the-cloisters-crowd-exceeds-expectations-at-opening-of.html | access-date=November 28, 2018 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early acquisitions===

Rockefeller financed the purchase of many of the early collection of works, often buying independently and then donating the items to the museum.&lt;ref name="met1926" /&gt; His financing of the museum has led to it being described as "perhaps the supreme example of curatorial genius working in exquisite harmony with vast wealth."{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 308}} The second major donor was the industrialist [[J. P. Morgan]], founder of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] in New York, who spent the last 20 years of his life acquiring artworks, "on an imperial scale" according to art historian Jean Strous,{{sfn|Strouse|2000|p=4}} spending some $900 million (inflation adjusted) in total. After his death, his son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.]] donated a large number of works from the collection to the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name="Islamic"&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2011/islamic-art The Making of a Collection: Islamic Art at the Metropolitan]". Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2012. Retrieved August 19, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major early source of objects was the art dealer [[Joseph Brummer]] (1883–1947), long a friend of a curator at the Cloisters, [[James Rorimer]].  Rorimer had long recognized the importance of Brummer's collection, and purchased large quantities of objects in the months after Brummer's sudden death in 1947. According to Christine E. Brennan of the Metropolitan, Rorimer realized that the collection offered works that could rival the Morgan Collection in the Metropolitan's Main Building, and that "the decision to form a treasury at The Cloisters was reached... because it had been the only opportunity since the late 1920s to enrich the collection with so many liturgical and secular objects of such high quality."&lt;ref name="cb" /&gt; These pieces, including works in gold, silver and ivory, are today held in the Treasury room of the Cloisters.&lt;ref name="cb"&gt;Brennan, Christine.

==Collection==
The museum's collection of artworks consists of approximately five thousand individual pieces. They are displayed across a series of rooms and spaces, mostly separate from those dedicated to the installed architectural artifacts. The Cloisters has never focused on building a collection of masterpieces, rather the objects are chosen thematically yet arranged simply to enhance the atmosphere created by the architectural elements in the particular setting or room in which they are placed.&lt;ref name="met1926" /&gt; To create the atmosphere of a functioning series of cloisters, many of the individual works, including  capitals, doorways, stained glass and windows are placed within the architectural elements themselves.{{sfn|Freeman|Rorimer|1960|p=2}}

===Panel paintings and sculpture===

The museum has an extensive collection of medieval European [[frescoes]], ivory statuettes, [[Reliquary Cross (The Cloisters)|reliquary]] wood and metal shrines and crosses, as well as examples of the very rare [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]s.{{sfn|Ellis| Suda |2016|p= 89}} It has liturgical metalwork vessels and rare pieces of Gothic furniture and metalwork.{{sfn|Rorimer|1948|p=237}} Many pieces are not associated with a particular architectural setting, so their placement in the museum may vary.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=125}} Some of the objects have dramatic provenance, including those plundered from the estates of aristocrats during the [[French Revolutionary Army]]'s occupation of the Southern Netherlands.{{sfn|Ridderbos |Van Veen |Van Buren |2005 |pp= 177 &amp; 194}} The Unicorn tapestries were for a period used by the French army to cover potatoes and keep them from freezing.{{sfn|Tomkins |1970|p= 313}}  The set was purchased by Rockefeller in 1922 and six of the tapestries hung in his New York home until donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1938.{{sfn|Cavallo|1998|p=15}}

===Illuminated manuscripts===
The museum's collection of [[illuminated book]]s is small, but of exceptional quality. J.P. Morgan was a major early donor, but although his taste leaned heavily towards rare printed and illuminated books,{{sfn|Strouse|2000|p=5}} he donated very few to the Metropolitan, instead preserving them at the Morgan Library.&lt;ref name="Islamic" /&gt; At the same time, the consensus within the Met was that the Cloisters should focus on architectural elements, sculpture and decorative arts to enhance the environmental quality of the institution, whereas manuscripts were considered more suited to the Morgan Library in lower Manhattan.{{sfn|Nickel|Hoffeld|Deuchler|1971|p=1}} The Cloisters' books are today displayed in the Treasury room, and include the French "[[Cloisters Apocalypse]]"  (or "Book of Revelation", c. 1330, probably [[Normandy]]),{{sfn|Deuchler|1969|p=146}} [[Jean Pucelle]]'s "[[Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux]]" (c. 1324–28), the "[[Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg]]", attributed to [[Jean Le Noir (illuminator)|Jean Le Noir]] and the "[[Belles Heures du Duc de Berry]]" (c. 1399–1416) attributed to the [[Limbourg brothers]].{{sfn |Husband |2008 |p=x}} In 2015 the Cloisters acquired a small Netherlandish [[Book of Hours]] illuminated by [[Simon Bening]].&lt;ref name="SM"&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/-/media/Files/About%20The%20Met/Annual%20Reports/2015-2016/Annual%20Report%202015-16%20Report%20from%20the%20Director%20and%20President.pdf Annual Report for the Year 2014–15: Report from the Director and the President]".

The "Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux" is a very small early Gothic book of hours containing 209 folios, of which 25 are full page miniatures. It is lavishly decorated in [[grisaille]] drawings, [[historiated initial]]s and almost 700 [[border image]]s. [[Jeanne d'Évreux]] was the third wife of [[Charles IV of France]], and after their deaths the book went into the possession of Charles' brother, [[Jean, duc de Berry]]. The use of grisaille (shades of gray) drawings allowed the artist to give the figures a highly sculptural form,{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p=99}} and the miniatures contain structures typical of French [[Gothic architecture]] of the period. The book has been described as "the high point of Parisian court painting", and evidence of "the unprecedentedly refined artistic tastes of the time".{{sfn|Ingo|2014|p=210}}

The "Belles Heures" is widely regarded as one of the finest extant examples of manuscript illumination, and very few books of hours are as richly decorated. It is the only surviving complete book attributed to the Limbourg brothers.{{sfn|Pächt|1950|pp=39–40}} Rockefeller purchased the book from [[Maurice de Rothschild]] in 1954, and donated it to the Metropolitan.{{sfn|Freeman|1956|pp= 93–101}}

The very small "Bonne de Luxembourg" manuscript (each leaf 12.5 × 8.4 × 3.9&amp;nbsp;cm) is attributed to [[Jean Le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]], and noted for its preoccupation with death. It was commissioned for [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne de Luxembourg]], [[Duchess of Normandy]], daughter of [[John the Blind]] and the wife of [[John II of France]], probably at the end of her husband's life, c. 1348–49. It was in a private collection for many years, and thus known only through poor-quality photographic reproductions until acquired by the museum in 1969. Produced in [[tempera]], [[grisaille]], ink and gold leaf on [[vellum]], it had been rarely studied and was until that point misattributed to [[Jean Pucelle]]. Following its acquisition, it was studied by art historians, after which attribution was given to Le Noir.{{sfn|Deuchler|1971|p=267}}

===Tapestries===

While examples of textile art are displayed throughout the museum, there are two dedicated rooms given to individual series of [[tapestry|tapestries]], the South Netherlandish  ''Nine Heroes'' (c. 1385){{sfn|Young|1979|p=58}} and [[Flanders|Flemish]]''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' (c. 1500).{{sfn|Bolton|2018|p= 294}} The Nine Heroes room is entered from the Cuxa cloisters.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=58}} Its 14th-century tapestries are one of the earliest surviving examples of tapestry, and are thought to be the original versions following widely influential and copied designs attributed to Nicolas Bataille.  They were acquired over a period of twenty years, involving the purchase of more than 20 individual fragments which were then sewn together during a long reassembly process. The chivalric figures represent the scriptural and legendary [[Nine Worthies]], who consist of three pagans ([[Hector]], [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]), three Jews ([[Joshua]], [[David]] and [[Judas Maccabeus]]) and three Christians ([[King Arthur]], [[Charlemagne]] and [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]). Of these, five figures survive: Hector, Caesar, Joshua, David and Arthur.{{sfn|Stoddard|1972|p= 425}} They have been described as representing "in their variety, the highest level of a rich and powerful social structure of later fourteenth-century France".{{sfn|Young|1979|p=62}}

[[File:The Unicorn is Attacked MET1.jpg|thumb|"The Unicorn is Attacked", from ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' tapestries. Brussels or [[Liège]], c.{{nbsp}}1495–1505]]
The ''Hunt of the Unicorn'' room can be entered from the hall containing the ''Nine Heroes'' via an early 16th-century door carved with representations of unicorns.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=65}} The unicorn tapestries consist of a series of large, colourful hangings and fragment textiles{{sfn|Siple|1938|p= 89}} designed in Paris{{sfn|Stoddard|1972|p= 425}} and woven in Brussels or Liège. Noted for their vivid colourization -dominated by blue, yellow-brown, red, and gold hues-and the abundance of a wide variety of flora,{{sfn|Rorimer|1942|p= 13, 18}} they were produced for [[Anne of Brittany]] and completed c. 1495–1505.{{sfn|Rorimer|1942|p= 39}} The tapestries were purchased by Rockefeller in 1922 for about one million dollars, and donated to the museum in 1937.{{sfn|Rorimer|1942|p= 7}} They were cleaned and restored in 1998, and are now hung in a dedicated room on the museum's upper floor.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Richard.

The large "Nativity" panel (also known as "Christ is Born as Man's Redeemer") from c. 1500, South Netherlandish (probably in [[Brussels]]), ''Burgos Tapestry'' was acquired by the museum in 1938. It was originally one of a series of eight tapestries representing the salvation of man,{{sfn|Rorimer|1938|p= 61}} with individual scenes influenced by identifiable panel paintings, including by [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/70007576 Christ Is Born as Man's Redeemer (Episode from the Story of the Redemption of Man)]".

Jane Hayward, a curator at the museum from 1969 who began the museum's second phase of acquisition, describes stained glass as "unquestioningly the preeminent form of Gothic medieval monumental painting".{{sfn|Hayward|Shepard|Clark|2012|p=31}} She bought c.{{nbsp}}1500 [[Heraldry|heraldic]] windows from the [[Rhineland]], now in the Campin room with the ''Mérode Altarpiece''. Hayward's addition in 1980 led to a redesign of the room so that the installed pieces would echo the domestic setting of the altarpiece. She wrote that the Campin room is the only gallery in the Met "where domestic rather than religious art predominates...a conscious effort has been made to create a fifteenth-century domestic interior similar to the one shown in [Campin's] ''Annunciation'' panel."{{sfn|Hayward|Shepard|Clark|2012|p=32}} Other significant acquisitions include late 13th-century [[grisaille]] panels from the Château-de-Bouvreuil in [[Rouen]], glass work from the [[Sées Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais]] at [[Sées]],{{sfn|Hayward|Shepard|Clark|2012|p=32}} and panels from the Acezat collection, now in the Heroes Tapestry Hall.{{sfn|Hayward|Shepard|Clark|2012|p=303}}

==Exterior==
The building is set into a steep hill, and thus the rooms and halls are divided between an upper entrance and a ground-floor level. The enclosing exterior building is mostly modern, and is influenced by and contains elements from the 13th-century church at Saint-Geraud at Monsempron, France, from which the northeast end of the building borrows especially. It was mostly designed by the architect [[Allen &amp; Collens|Charles Collens]], who took influence from works in Barnard's collection. At times to the frustration of the architects and builders, Rockefeller closely managed both the building's design and construction.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=32}}

[[File:The Cloisters from Garden.jpg|left|thumb|Bonnefont garden and cloisters]]
The building contains architecture elements and settings relocated mostly from four French abbeys, which between 1934 and 1939 were transported, reconstructed and integrated with new buildings in a project overseen by Collins. He told Rockefeller that the new building "should present a well-studied outline done in the very simplest form of stonework growing naturally out of the rocky hill-top. After looking through the books in the Boston Athenaeum&amp;nbsp;...we found a building at Monsempron in Southern France of a type which would lend itself in a very satisfactory manner to such a treatment."{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=32}}

The architects sought to both memorialize the north hill's role in the [[American Revolution]], and provide a sweeping view over the [[Hudson River]]. Construction of the exterior began in 1935. The stonework originates from several European sources, primarily limestone and granite,{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=35}} and includes four Gothic windows from the refectory at [[Sens]], and nine arcades.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=41}} The dome of the Fuentidueña Chapel was especially difficult to fit into the planned area.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=38}} The east elevation is mostly formed from limestone and contains nine arcades from the Benedictine priory at [[Froville]], and four [[flamboyant]] French Gothic windows from the Dominican monastery at Sens.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=41}}

===Cloisters===
====Cuxa====
[[File:Cuxa Cloister MET DP132222.jpg|220px|thumb|The Cuxa Cloister, c. 1130–40]]
Located on the south side of the building's main level, the Cuxa cloisters are the museum's centerpiece both structurally and thematically.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=33}} They were originally erected at the Benedictine Abbey of [[Abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa|Sant Miquel de Cuixà]] on [[Canigou|Mount Canigou]], in the northeast French Pyrenees, which was founded in 878.&lt;ref name="met1"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/470314 Cuxa Cloister]".

The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]-shaped garden once formed a center around which monks slept in cells. The original garden seemed to have been lined by walkways around [[Arcade (architecture)|adjoining arches]] lined with capitals enclosing the [[Quadrangle (architecture)|garth]]. {{sfn|Bayard|1997|pp= 37–42}} It is impossible now to represent solely medieval species and arrangements; those in the Cuxa garden are approximations by botanists specializing in medieval history.{{sfn|Bayard|1997|pp= 37–42}} The oldest plan of the original building describes [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s.{{sfn|Bayard|1997|pp= 37–42}} Although the walls are modern, the capitals and columns are original and cut from pink Languedoc marble from the [[Pyrenees]].{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=22}} The intersection of the two walkways contains an eight-sided fountain.{{sfn|Peck|1996|p=31}}

The capitals were carved at different points in the abbey's history and thus contain a variety of forms and abstract geometric patterns, including scrolling leaves, pine cones, sacred figures such as Christ, the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], angels, and monstrous creatures including two-headed animals, lions restrained by apes, [[Hybrid beasts in folklore|mythic hybrids]], a mermaid and inhuman mouths consuming human torsos.{{sfn|Dale|2001|p=407}}{{sfn|Horste|1982|p=126}} The motifs are derived from popular fables,&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt; or represent the brute forces of nature or evil,{{sfn|Calkins |2005|=112}} or are based on late 11th- and 12th-century monastic writings, such as those by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153).{{sfn|Dale|2001|p=402}} The order in which the capitals were originally placed is unknown, making their interpretation especially difficult, although a sequential and continuous narrative was probably not intended.{{sfn|Dale|2001|p=406}} According to art historian Thomas Dale, to the monks, the "human figures, beasts, and monsters" may have represented the "tension between the world and the cloister, the struggle to repress the natural inclinations of the body".{{sfn|Dale|2001|p=410}}

====Saint-Guilhem====
[[File:Cloisters-724.jpg|thumb|Saint-Guilhem Cloisters]]
The Saint-Guilhem cloisters were taken from the site of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert]], and date from 804 AD to the 1660s.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 58}} Their acquisition around 1906 was one of Barnard's early purchases.

Those beside the mouth of hell contain representations of the devil and tormenting beasts, with, according to Young, "animal-like body parts and cloven hoofs [as they] herd naked sinners in chains to be thrown into an upturned monster's mouth".{{sfn|Young|1979|p=26}}

The Guilhem cloisters are inside the museum's upper level and are much smaller than originally built.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=23}} Its garden contains a central fountain{{sfn|Bayard|1997|p= 81}} and plants potted in ornate containers, including a 15th-century glazed [[earthenware]] vase. The area is covered by a skylight and plate glass panels which conserves heat in the winter months. Rockefeller had initially wanted a high roof and [[clerestory]] windows, but was convinced by [[Joseph Breck (curator)|Joseph Breck]], curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan, to install a skylight. Breck wrote to Rockefeller that "by substituting a skylight for a solid ceiling...the sculpture is properly illuminated, since the light falls in a natural way; the visitor has the sense of being in the open; and his attention, consequently, is not attracted to the modern superstructure."{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=39}}

====Bonnefont====
[[File:Bonnefont Cloisters.jpg|thumb|View of the Bonnefont cloisters]]
The Bonnefont cloisters were assembled from several French monasteries, but mostly come from a late 12th-century [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] {{ill|Abbaye de Bonnefont|fr}} at Bonnefont-en-Comminges, southwest of [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Rorimer|Serrell|1972|p=20}} The abbey was intact until at least 1807, and by the 1850s all of its architectural features had been removed from the site, often for decoration of nearby buildings.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=93}} Barnard purchased the stonework in 1937.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=98}} Today the Bonnefont cloisters contain 21 double capitals, and surround a garden that contains many features typical of the medieval period, including a central [[wellhead]], raised flower beds and lined with [[Wattle (construction)|wattle fences]].&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, Sarah.

{{Main|The Fuentidueña Apse}}
[[File:The cloisters chapel reconstruction.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[The Fuentidueña Apse]], Spanish, c. 1175–1200]]
The Fuentidueña chapel is the museum's largest room,{{sfn|Rorimer|1951|p=267}} and is entered through a broad oak door flanked by sculptures which include  leaping animals. Its centerpiece is the [[The Fuentidueña Apse|Fuentidueña Apse]], a semicircular Romanesque recess built between about 1175 to 1200 at the Saint Joan church at [[Fuentidueña]], [[Segovia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/473008 Crucifix]". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved May 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, the church was long abandoned and in disrepair. 

It was acquired by Rockefeller for the Cloisters in 1931, following three decades of complex negotiation and diplomacy between the Spanish church and both countries' art-historical hierarchies and governments. It was eventually exchanged in a deal that involved the transfer of six [[fresco]]es from [[San Baudelio de Berlanga]] to the Prado, on an equally long-term loan.{{sfn|Wixom|1988|p=36}} The structure was disassembled into almost 3,300 mostly sandstone and limestone blocks, each individually cataloged, and shipped to New York in 839 crates.&lt;ref&gt;"Monumental Moving Job". New York: ''Life Magazine'', October 20, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was rebuilt at the Cloisters in the late 1940s{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 36}} It was such a large and complex reconstruction that it required the demolition of the former "Special Exhibition Room". The chapel was opened to the public in 1961, seven years after its installation had begun.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 38}}

The apse consists of a broad arch leading to a [[barrel vault]], and culminates with a half-dome.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=14}}  The capitals at the entrance contain representations of the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and [[Daniel in the lions' den]].{{sfn|Wixom|1988|p=38}} The piers show Martin of Tours on the left and the angel [[Gabriel]] announcing to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|The Virgin]] on the right. The chapel includes other, mostly contemporary, medieval artwork. They include, in the dome, a large fresco dating to between 1130–50, from the Spanish Church of Sant Joan de Tredòs. The fresco's colorization resembles a [[Byzantine]] [[mosaic]] and is dedicated to the ideal of Mary as the mother of God.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=17}} Hanging within the apse is a crucifix made between about 1150 to 1200 for the {{ill|Convent of St. Clara|es|Convento de Santa Clara (Astudillo)}} in [[Astudillo, Palencia|Astudillo]], Spain.{{sfn|Husband|2013|p=42}} Its reverse contains a depiction of the Agnus Dei ([[Lamb of God]]), decorated with red and blue foliage at its frames.{{sfn|Wixom|1988|p=39}} The exterior wall holds three small, narrow and stilted windows,{{sfn|Wixom|1988|p=38}} which are nevertheless designed to let in the maximum amount of light. The windows were originally set within imposing fortress walls; according to the art historian Bonnie Young "these small windows and the massive, fortress-like walls contribute to the feeling of austerity...typical of Romanesque churches."{{sfn|Young|1979|p=14}}

===Langon chapel===
{{Main|Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean}}
[[File:Chapel from Notre-Dame-du-Bourg at Langon MET DP255163.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Langon Chapel, French, 12th century]]
The Langon chapel is on the museum's ground level. Its right wall was built around 1126 for the Romanesque [[Cathédrale Notre-Dame-du-Bourg de Digne]].{{sfn|Young|1979|p=31}} The chapter house consists of a single [[aisle]] [[nave]] and [[transept]]s{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 47}} taken from a small [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] parish church built around 1115 at Notre Dame de Pontaut.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=40}} When acquired, it was in disrepair, its upper level in use as a storage place for tobacco. About three-quarters of its original stonework was moved to New York.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 47}} 

The chapel is entered from the Romanesque hall through [[Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean|a doorway]], a large, elaborate French Gothic stone entrance commissioned by the [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian court]]{{sfn|Siple|1938|p=88}} for [[Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey]] in [[Burgundy]], France. Moutiers-Saint-Jean was sacked, burned, and rebuilt several times. In 1567, the [[Huguenot]] army removed the heads from the two kings, and in 1797 the abbey was sold as rubble for rebuilding. The site lay in ruin for decades and lost further sculptural elements until Barnard arranged for the entrances' transfer to New York. The doorway had been the main portal of the abbey, and was probably built as the south transept door. 

Carvings on the elaborate white [[Oolite|oolitic]] limestone doorway depict the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and contains foliated capitals and statuettes on the outer piers; including two kings positioned in the [[embrasure]]s and various kneeling angels. Carvings of angels are placed in the [[archivolt]]s above the kings.{{sfn|Forsyth|1978|pp=33, 38}} The large figurative sculptures on either side of the doorway represent the early [[Franks|Frankish]] kings [[Clovis I]] (d. 511) and his son [[Chlothar I]] (d. 561).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/470313 Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean]".

===Romanesque hall===
The Romanesque hall contains three large church doorways, with the main visitor entrance adjoining the Guilhem Cloister. The monumental arched [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] doorway is from [[Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey|Moutier-Saint-Jean de Réôme]] in France and dates to c. 1150.{{sfn|Siple|1938|p=88}} Two animals are carved into the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]]; both rest on their hind legs as if about to attack each other. The capitals are lined with carvings of both real and imagined animals and birds, as well as leaves and other fauna.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=6}} The two earlier doorways are from [[Laféline|Reugny, Allier]], and [[Poitou]] in central France.{{sfn|Landais|1992|p= 43}} The hall contains four large early-13th-century stone sculptures representing the Adoration of the Magi, frescoes of a lion and a [[wyvern]], each from the [[Monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza]] in north central Spain.{{sfn|Siple|1938|p=88}} On the left of the room are portraits of kings and angels, also from the monastery at Moutier-Saint-Jean.{{sfn|Young|1979|p=6}} The hall contains three pairs of columns positioned over an entrance with molded archivolts. They were taken from the Augustinian church at [[Reugny, Indre-et-Loire|Reugny]].{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 78}} The Reugny site was badly damaged during the French Wars of Religion and again during the French Revolution. Most of the structures had been sold to a local man, Piere-Yon Verniere, by 1850, and were acquired by Barnard in 1906.{{sfn|Barnet| Wu|2005|p= 58}}

===Treasury room===
The Treasury room was opened in 1988 to celebrate the museum's 50th anniversary. It largely consists of small luxury objects acquired by the Met after it had built its initial collection, and draws heavily on acquisitions from the collection of Joseph Brummer.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2006/medieval-treasury-reopens-at-the-cloisters Medieval Treasury Reopens at The Cloisters]".

Focusing on medieval art and architecture, it holds over 15,000 volumes of books and journals, the museum's archive administration papers, curatorial papers, dealer records and the personal papers of Barnard, as well as early glass lantern slides of museum materials, manuscript [[facsimile]]s, scholarly records, maps and recordings of musical performances at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/libraries-and-study-centers/the-cloisters-library-and-archive "The Cloisters Library and Archives"].

These include photographs of medieval objects from the collection of [[George Joseph Demotte]], and a series taken during and just after [[World War II]] showing damage sustained to monuments and artifacts, including tomb effigies. They are, according to curator Lauren Jackson-Beck, of "prime importance to the art historian who is concerned with the identification of both the original work and later areas of reconstruction".{{sfn|Jackson-Beck|1989|p=2}} Two important series of prints are kept on [[microfilm]]: the "Index photographique de l'art en France" and the German "[[Marburg Picture Index]]".{{sfn|Jackson-Beck|1989|p=2}}

==Governance==
The Cloisters is governed by the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Metropolitan's collections are owned by a private corporation of about 950 fellows and benefactors. The board of trustees comprise 41 elected members, several officials of the City of New York, and persons honored as trustees by the museum. The current chairman of the board is the businessman and art collector [[Daniel Brodsky]], who was elected in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin.

The museum's architectural settings, atmosphere and acoustics have made it a regular setting both for musical recitals and as a stage for medieval theater. Notable stagings include ''[[Le Miracle de Théophile|The Miracle of Theophilus]]'' in 1942, and John Gassner's adaption of ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/medieval-drama Medieval Drama at The Cloisters]".

[[File:User-trash-full.svg|thumb|Example of a "trash can/recycling bin containing files" icon, here designed by the [[Tango Desktop Project]].]]

In [[computing]], the '''Trash''' (also known as the '''Recycle Bin''' in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and by other names in other operating systems ) is temporary storage for [[computer file|files]] that have been deleted in a [[file manager]] by the user, but not yet permanently erased from the file system. Typically, a recycle bin is presented as a special [[file directory]] to the user (whether or not it is actually a single directory depends on the implementation), allowing the user to browse deleted files, [[undeletion|undelete]] those that were deleted by mistake, or delete them permanently (either one by one, or by the "Empty Trash" function).

Within a trash folder, a record is kept of each file and/or directory's original location. On certain operating systems, files must be moved out of the trash before they can be accessed again.

Whether or not files deleted by a program go to the recycle bin depends on its level of integration with a particular [[desktop environment]] and its function. Low-level utilities usually bypass this layer entirely and delete files immediately. A program that includes file manager functionality may or may not send files to the recycle bin, or it may allow the user to choose between these options.

== History ==

A small icon of a waste container for deleting files was implemented during the development of the [[Apple Lisa]] user interface in 1982, where it was called the “Wastebasket.” The concept carried over to the Apple [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]], as the “Trash”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Busy_Being_Born.txt |title=Macintosh Stories: Busy Being Born |publisher=Folklore.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in the pre-OS 9 “[[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|International English]]” localization, which retained “Wastebasket.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/extras/trivia%7cmacos|title=GUIdebook &gt; Extras &gt; Trivia |publisher=Folklore.org |year=2006 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.]] sued to prevent other software companies from offering graphical user interfaces similar to its own. Apple lost most of its claims but courts agreed Apple's Trash ''icon'' was original and protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html |title=APPLE COMPUTER, INC. v. MICROSOFT CORP., 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Apple software may use other metaphors for file deletion, such as Recycle Bin, Smart Eraser, or Shredder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DD1239F934A1575BC0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=PERSONAL COMPUTERS; Norton Desktop for Windows | first=Peter H. | last=Lewis | date=27 August 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early versions of the Macintosh [[Finder (software)|Finder]], Trash contents were listed in volatile memory. Files moved to the Trash would appear there only until the Finder session ended, then they would be automatically erased. When [[System 7]] was released, the Trash became a folder that retained its contents until the user chose to empty the trash.

Microsoft first implemented the "trash can" concept in [[MS-DOS]] 6, under the name ''Delete Sentry'': When a file was deleted, it was moved to a hidden SENTRY folder at the root of the drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/96826 | title = Delete Sentry Automatically Purges Files When Necessary | work = Microsoft Support | publisher = Microsoft Corporation | accessdate = 3 June 2010 | quote = When Microsoft Undelete is using the Delete Sentry level of protection, files that are deleted are stored in a hidden SENTRY directory in the root of the drive. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/1994/june94/pcn0603/pcn0603.asp | title = Now You Delete It, Now You Don't | work = PC Operating Instructions, Vol.5 Issue 6 | publisher = Smart Computing | date = June 1994 | accessdate = 3 June 2010 | quote = Delete Sentry. This is the most reliable file-recovery method. This method sets up a hidden directory named SENTRY. UNDELETE saves the contents of all deleted files in this directory. Because these files are kept in the hidden directory, it doesn't matter whether the originals have been written over or not. UNDELETE simply restores the files you want from the SENTRY directory.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] introduced its current trash system, the ''Recycle Bin'', with [[Windows 95]], as an area to store and review files and folders prior to deletion.&lt;ref name="RBOverview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/136517/EN-US/|title=How the Recycle Bin Stores Files|accessdate=2008-09-08|date=2007-01-19|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, the original location record of the file is stored, but the folder itself didn't allow subdirectories. When a folder is deleted, its containing files are moved into the bin and mixed with other deleted files. The directory structure can only be restored if the batch of files are "undeleted". The current (revised) Recycle Bin allows for subdirectory trees to exist within folders that have been moved there.

== Implementations ==

Recycle bin functionality is usually integrated into a [[desktop environment]] and its [[file manager]]. Examples include:

* [[MS-DOS]] 6.x, with [[Microsoft Undelete]], as "Delete Sentry"
* [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], with [[Finder (software)|Finder]], as "Trash" (or Wastebasket in defunct localisations)
* [[Microsoft Windows]], with [[Windows Explorer]] (later called [[File Explorer]] starting with Windows 10), as "Recycle Bin"
* [[GNOME]] and [[MATE (software)|MATE]] ([[Linux]]), with [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] and Caja, respectively
* [[KDE]] ([[Linux]]), with [[Konqueror]] and [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]
* [[Xfce]] ([[Linux]]), with [[Thunar]]
* [[Amiga]], with [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]]. The [[Professional File System]] added trashcan-esque behavior at the filesystem level.
Some implementations may contain "shredding" functionality to counter [[data remanence]].

=== Linux desktop environments ===

The KDE, GNOME&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41850 |title=Bug 41850&amp;nbsp;– Trash should follow fdo trash spec (adds restoring facilities) |publisher=Bugzilla.gnome.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Xfce implementations comply with the [[freedesktop.org]] Trash specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html |title=Trash specification |publisher=Freedesktop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring that any applications written with this specification in mind will be interoperable with any trash can implementation.

Although the various Linux desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, and Xfce provide a trash mechanism, there is traditionally no simple way to trash something from the [[command line interface]]. Some third-party applications, such as [[trash-cli]], provide commands on the command-line to use the trash, compatible with the FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification.

=== macOS ===

Under macOS, when a file is deleted in Finder, it is moved to a .Trashes folder, and when viewing the device's available space the space occupied by the deleted files is shown as occupied.

In macOS Sierra, the user can turn on an option to have the Trash delete after 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/macos-sierra-empty-trash/|title=Here's Why You May Never Need to Empty Trash in macOS Sierra|work=TekRevue|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microsoft Windows ===
[[File:Windows Recycle Bin.png|thumb|Recycle Bin in [[Windows Vista]]]]

[[Microsoft]]'s ''Recycle Bin'' is implemented as a [[special folder]] with columns like ''Date deleted'' and ''Original location''. Typically only files deleted via [[Windows Explorer]] (but not necessarily other Windows graphical interfaces such as file selection dialogs) will be put into the Recycle Bin; files deleted via the [[Command Prompt (Windows)|Command Prompt]] are permanently deleted, as (by default) are files deleted via operating system [[Application Programming Interface|APIs]] and applications other than Windows Explorer.&lt;ref name="RBShellDelete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/120681 |title=Files Deleted at MS-DOS Prompt Do Not Go to Recycle Bin |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some operating system APIs do, however, allow applications to recycle files rather than delete them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17612/how-do-you-place-a-file-in-recycle-bin-instead-of-delete |title=c# - How do you place a file in recycle bin instead of delete? |publisher=Stack Overflow |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous Windows operating systems and in MS-DOS, [[undeletion]] was the only way to recover accidentally or intentionally deleted files.

As standard, the Recycle Bin only stores files deleted from hard drives, not from removable media, such as memory cards, thumb drives, or floppy disks, nor does it store files deleted from network drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recycle_bin.mspx?mfr=true |title=Recycle Bin overview: Windows XP Professional Product Documentation |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are methods to make it work on network paths, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/windows/en-US/a349801f-398f-4139-8e8b-b0a92f599e2b/enable-recycle-bin-on-mapped-network-drives |title=Enable Recycle Bin on mapped network drives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Recycle Bin has a setting to configure the amount of deleted files it can store. Free disk space allocated for this is not actually used until files are deleted  from folders and stored in the Recycle Bin. In versions of Windows prior to [[Windows Vista]],  the default configuration of  the Recycle Bin is a global setting for all drives to hold 10% of  the total capacity of each host hard drive volume to store deleted files. For example, on a volume with a capacity of 20 gigabytes, the Recycle Bin will hold up to 2 gigabytes of deleted files. This can be changed anywhere  from 0 to 100%  of the drive space, but will not be allowed to exceed 3.99GB of space, even if the user-indicated % of the drive space is larger than 3.99GB. If the  Recycle Bin fills up to maximum capacity, the oldest files will be deleted  in order to accommodate the newly deleted files.&lt;ref name="RBOverview"/&gt; If a file is too large for  the Recycle Bin, the user will be prompted to immediately and permanently delete the file instead. This 3.99GB limit does not apply in Windows Vista and later Windows versions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The actual location of  the Recycle Bin depends on the type of operating system  and file system. On older [[File Allocation Table|FAT]]  file systems  (typically Windows 98 and prior), it is located in  ''Drive:\RECYCLED''. In  the [[NTFS]] filesystem (Windows 2000, XP, NT) it is ''Drive:\RECYCLER''. On  Windows Vista and Windows 7 it  is ''Drive:\$Recycle.Bin'' folder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/31/520225.aspx |title=Why does the Recycle Bin have different file system names on FAT and NTFS? | work = The Old New Thing  |publisher=MSDN Blogs |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Recycle Bin can be accessed from the desktop or Windows Explorer,{{how|date=August 2014}} or by typing shell:RecycleBinFolder in the [[Run command|Run dialog box]] ({{keypress|Win|R}}). It is the only icon shown by default on the Windows XP desktop. When accessed  from the desktop,  the Recycle Bin options  and information are different from those of  the physical  Recycle Bin folders seen on each partition in  [[Windows Explorer]]. From [[Windows XP]] onwards, with [[NTFS]], different users cannot see the contents of each other's Recycle Bins.

Prior to Windows Vista, a file in the Recycle Bin is stored in its physical location and renamed as ''D&lt;original drive letter of file&gt;&lt;#&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;''.&lt;ref name="RBOverview"/&gt; A hidden file called ''info2'' (''info'' in Windows 95 without the [[Windows Desktop Update]]) stores the file's original path and original name in binary format.&lt;ref name="RBOverview"/&gt; Since Windows Vista, the "meta" information of each file is saved as ''$I&lt;number&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;'' and the original file is renamed to ''$R&lt;number&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;''.

When the user views the Recycle Bin, the files are displayed with their original names. When the file is "Restored" from the Recycle Bin, it is returned to its original directory and name.&lt;ref name="RBOverview"/&gt;

In Windows Explorer, files are moved to the Recycle Bin in a number of ways:
* By right-clicking on a file and selecting delete from the menu
* Selecting the file and pressing the delete key
* Selecting delete from the ''Task pane'' in Windows XP
* Selecting the file and choosing delete from the File menu (in Windows XP Explorer)
* By dragging and dropping a file into the Recycle Bin icon
* From the ''Send To'' menu
* From a [[context menu]] command or some other function in a software application (usually configurable)

It is possible to bypass the Recycle Bin and directly delete a file by holding the SHIFT key while performing an action that would normally send a file to the trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320031 |title=HOW TO: Bypass the Recycle Bin When You Delete Files and Folders in Windows XP |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==

Apple’s macOS has long allowed dragging a disk icon to the Trash as a method for unmounting and/or physically ejecting a [[diskette|disk]], but this does not place the disk in the Trash folder nor does it erase the disk. In macOS the Trash icon temporarily changes to an Eject or Disconnect symbol whenever storage volumes are dragged. The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines cite such behavior as an example of a discouraged metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/unstable/principles-match.html.en |title=Create a Match Between Your Application and the Real World |publisher=Library.gnome.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9021">'''X3J13''' is the name of a technical [[committee]] which was part of [[INCITS]] (known at the time as '''X3''').  The X3J13 committee was formed in 1986 to draw up an [[ANSI]] [[Common Lisp]] [[Technical standard|standard]] based on the first edition of the book ''[[Common Lisp the Language]]'' (also known as "CLtL", or "CLtL1"), by [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], which was previously a ''[[de facto]]'' standard for the language.  The primary output of X3J13 was an American National Standard for programming language [[Common Lisp]] (X3.226/1994), approved December 8, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Lisp FAQ, http://www.faqs.org/faqs/lisp-faq/part4/section-10.html&lt;/ref&gt; X3J13 later worked with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] working group [[ISLISP|SC22/WG16]] on an internationally standardised dialect of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] named [[ISLISP]].

==Organisation==
The original chair of the committee was Doctor Robert Mathis of [[Ohio State University]], with Mary van Deusen as secretary.  [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]] was originally the vice-chair.  In later years, Mathis stepped down as chair and Steele assumed that role.

The efforts of the committee were guided by its [[charter]], the successful creation of which is credited to the coordinating efforts of Susan P. Ennis, a representative of [[Amoco|Amoco Production Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kent Pitman]]: ''"X3J13 Charter"'' (annotated), http://www.nhplace.com/kent/CL/x3j13-sd-05.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The charter lays out the committee's goals and priorities, as well as a broadly defined list of some topics to be addressed.

==Subcommittees==
The committee formed several subcommittees to help its members better concentrate their efforts.

===Cleanup subcommittee===
The Cleanup Subcommittee, chaired by [[Larry Masinter]], established a standardised format for the submission of proposals for voting.  These issue writeups,&lt;ref&gt;Larry Masinter's repository of X3J13 passed cleanup issues at Xerox PARC, ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/cl/cleanup/passed/&lt;/ref&gt; while not themselves part of the standard, were deemed sufficiently useful for the [[Common Lisp HyperSpec]] to include and [[cross-reference]] them for the benefit of readers, providing information about the original intent of the committee in its decisions.  These writeups also serve as a historical record of those alternate solutions to problems which were, ultimately, not adopted.

===Compiler subcommittee===
Chaired by Sandra Loosemore, this subcommittee created proposals for issues relating to Lisp [[compilation (programming)|compilation]].  Guy Steele acknowledged in the second edition of ''Common Lisp the Language'' the large contribution of the Compiler Subcommittee toward clarifying the compilation process described in the first edition, parts of which Steele himself describes as "vague".&lt;ref name="cltl2-ack"&gt;[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]]: ''"Common Lisp the Language" (second edition)'', Acknowledgments.  Digital Press, 1984; {{ISBN|0-932376-41-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iteration subcommittee===
Jon L. White was the chair of the [[Iteration]] Subcommittee.  Among the issues dealt with by this subcommittee was the generalized &lt;code&gt;LOOP&lt;/code&gt; [[Macro (computer science)#Lisp macros|macro]] &amp;mdash; a [[domain-specific language]] to which the second edition of [[CLtL]] devoted an entire chapter.  The "[[ALGOL]]-like" [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of this macro, differing from Lisp's more usual [[S-expression]] syntax, was and remains somewhat controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard P. Gabriel]] and Guy L. Steele, Jr.: ''"The Evolution of Lisp"''[http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/HOPL2-Uncut.pdf], page 85.  ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 231-270, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character subcommittee===
The Character Subcommittee, chaired by Thom Linden, had the task of defining how the standard would deal with the issues surrounding different [[character sets]].  The resolution of these matters &amp;mdash; particularly the ability to use any character in the name of a [[Symbol (Lisp)|symbol]] &amp;mdash; was intended to make Common Lisp simpler for international users.

===Error handling subcommittee===
Chaired by [[Kent Pitman]], the Error Handling Subcommittee plugged what was described as "the biggest outstanding hole in Common Lisp"&lt;ref name="cltl2-ack"/&gt; with the [[Common Lisp#Condition system|condition system]], a general mechanism for handling [[Exception handling|errors]], warnings, and other exceptional situations.

The committee referred to the resulting specification as a "condition system" rather than an "error system"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhplace.com/kent/CL/Revision-18.txt Common Lisp Condition System, Revision #18]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to accommodate a single system for handling exceptional situations of various kinds, whether fatal or non-fatal, whether continuable or not, and whether the result of program error or mere resource limitation (such as stack overflow).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41474/AI_WP_268.pdf?sequence=4 Exceptional Situations in Lisp] by [[Kent Pitman]], MIT AI Laboratory Working Paper 268, February 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;   Conditions are "signaled" at one point in the code and may be handled at another point. This usage of the term "signal" is different from the typical operating system's notion of [[signal (computing)|signals]] (except on [[Lisp machine]]s where this variant usage of the term evolved&lt;ref&gt;Signalling and Handling Conditions, a hardcopy publication of Symbolics, Inc., 1983 (with technical contributions by David L. Andre, [[Bernard Greenberg]], [[David A. Moon]], Mike McMahon, [[Daniel Weinreb]])&lt;/ref&gt;); the operating system notion of [[signal (computing)|signaling]] was out of scope for this committee, and consequently was not addressed in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  Asynchronous interrupts and IEEE floating point trapping was also out of scope for this committee's work and was not addressed in the standard.

===Drafting subcommittee===
Kathy Chapman was the chair for the Drafting Subcommittee, which was responsible for the drafting of the actual [[Technical standard|standard document]].  In addition, the subcommittee oversaw efforts to keep [[terminology]] consistent and accurate throughout the committee's activities.

==Final document==
The final [[Technical standard|standard]] produced by the X3J13 committee was published as [[American National Standard]] X3.226, and also in [[hypertext]] form as the [[Common Lisp HyperSpec]].

===Relation to "Common Lisp the Language"===
The book ''[[Common Lisp the Language]]'', although mostly authored by [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], was the product of an ad hoc committee that had formed around 1980 and had worked collaboratively to produce the original ''de facto'' standard for [[Common Lisp]] prior to the formation of X3J13.  X3J13 began its work with ''Common Lisp the Language'' as a base document and proceeded from there in the design of what would become ANSI Common Lisp.  Steele himself served on the committee and gave them permission to use any or all parts of its first edition in their efforts.

Documents published by X3J13 were later used, together with [[quotation]]s from certain committee members, in the production of the Second Edition, which was released in 1990, allowing the Common Lisp community a way to preview many features that were expected to appear in the committee's final standard document.  The Second Edition of ''Common Lisp the Language'' bears similarity to the standard in content, though not in form.  However, substantive changes were made, in the form of both additions and deletions, between the publication of the book and the final draft of the [[ANSI]] standard.

In sum, the original edition of ''Common Lisp the Language'' was the document upon which X3J13 originally based its work.  The Second Edition, by contrast, was Steele's personal work, not a committee product and had no official status within X3J13 or ANSI.  As acknowledged in the Second Edition preface, it was not authorized by X3J13, the choice of content as a snapshot of the work in progress was not formally synchronized with X3J13, and the final version was not reviewed or approved by X3J13.
