The '''1938 Constitution of [[Romania]]''' was the fundamental law of Romania from the time of its adoption until 1940. It formed the legal basis for the royal dictatorship of King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].

Carol engineered a [[self-coup]] on February 10 and seized emergency powers.  Soon afterward university professor [[Istrate Micescu]] began working on a new constitution, based on suggestions from the King.  Micescu's draft was made public on February 20. Four days later, voters were obliged to appear before their local election bureaus and [[Romanian constitutional referendum, 1938|vote verbally]] (“yes” or “no”) on the charter. Of 4,303,064 who voted, 4,297,581 (99.87%) approved with only 5,483 (0.13%) voting against; silence was deemed to be approval.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ro011938 Rumänien, 24. Februar 1938 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was promulgated on February 27 and published in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'' the next day.

The document, comprising eight titles and 100 articles, effectively codified Carol's emergency powers, turning his reign into a legal dictatorship.  It abandoned the principle of [[separation of powers]] in favour of royal supremacy. The rights and freedoms codified in the 1923 Constitution were also swept away, at least in practice, by provisions that banned "revolutionary propaganda."  The King exercised legislative power through a [[corporatism|corporatist]] Parliament, and exercised executive power through a government that he appointed and dismissed without parliamentary involvement.  He could dissolve Parliament at any time and rule by decree, and was the sole person empowered to amend the Constitution.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

As with the 1923 Constitution, Parliament was [[bicameral]].  The lower house, the Assembly of Deputies, was to be elected every six years and composed of members of the following professional categories: agriculture and manual labour; industry and commerce; intellectual occupations. Deputies were elected in single-member districts, by secret and compulsory ballot; districts were drawn so as to assure adequate representation based on voters’ professions. The upper house, the Senate, was composed of members appointed by the King, members by right and members elected in single districts (in the same manner as Assembly members). The proportion of appointed and elected members was equal, while senators by right had to meet the same conditions as set out in the 1923 Constitution. Appointed and elected senators had nine-year terms, while one-third of senators’ terms were renewed every three years.  In December, the [[National Renaissance Front]] was formed as the only legally permitted party.

[[File:Regele Carol II si constitutia din 1938.jpg|thumb|200px|left|King Carol II signing the Constitution on 27 February 1938]]
King Carol suspended the constitution on September 5, 1940, and parliament was dissolved. Through a decree signed that day, titled “For the investment with full powers of the president of the Council of Ministers and the restriction of royal prerogatives”, the king transferred his authoritarian powers to General [[Ion Antonescu]], who did not convene a parliament and ruled the country by decree until he was [[King Michael Coup|ousted]] on August 23, 1944. After this date, a constitutional and transitional regime was established until a [[Constituent Assembly]] could meet to draft a new constitution, until which time the provisions of the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866]] and 1923 constitutions were applied. On July 15, 1946, the [[Petru Groza]] government issued a decree that bore a constitutional character; this document abolished the Senate and established a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] system (the Assembly of Deputies) and granted universal suffrage to all citizens over 21, including women.

On December 30, 1947, after King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]]’s forced abdication, Parliament adopted a constitutional law that proclaimed the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian People’s Republic]] and abrogated “the Constitution of 1866 as modified on 29 March 1923 and 1 September 1944”. Until the [[1948 Constitution of Romania|1948 Constitution]] was adopted, legislative power was in the hands of the Assembly of Deputies that met following the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 elections]], while the executive was composed of a five-member presidium elected by the Assembly: [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[Ştefan Voitec]], [[Ion Niculi]] and [[Gheorghe Stere]].

Scholefield, British Columbia Historical Association, Vancouver, British Columbia 1913]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a treaty between the [[United States]] and Spain in 1819 that ceded [[Florida]] to the U.S. and defined the boundary between the U.S. and [[New Spain]]. It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy. It came in the midst of increasing tensions related to Spain's territorial boundaries in North America against the United States and Great Britain in the aftermath of the American Revolution; it also came during the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or [[garrison]]s. It decided to cede the territory to the United States through the Adams–Onís Treaty in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] in [[Spanish Texas]]. The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean, in exchange for the U.S. paying residents' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5,000,000 and relinquishing the US claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas, under the terms of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

The treaty remained in full effect for only 183 days: from February 22, 1821, to August 24, 1821, when Spanish military officials signed the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] acknowledging the independence of [[Mexico]]; Spain repudiated that treaty, but Mexico effectively took control of Spain's former colony. The [[Treaty of Limits (Mexico–United States)|Treaty of Limits]], signed in 1828 and effective in 1832, recognized the border defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty as the boundary between the United States and Mexico.

==History==
The Treaty was negotiated by [[John Quincy Adams]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under U.S. President [[James Monroe]], and the Spanish "minister plenipotentiary" (diplomatic envoy) [[Luis de Onís y González-Vara]], during the reign of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]].&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, pp. 170–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
[[File:1822_Geographical,_Statistical,_and_Historical_Map_of_Florida_by_Henry_Charles_Carey,_Isaac_Lea_and_Fielding_Lucas.png|thumb|Spanish [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]] 1810–1821]]
Spain had long rejected repeated American efforts to purchase Florida. But by 1818, Spain was facing a troubling colonial situation in which the cession of Florida made sense. Spain had been exhausted by the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814) against Napoleon in Europe and needed to rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries in Central America and South America were beginning to demand independence. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida, encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the border between New Spain (a large area including today's Mexico, Central America, and much of the current US Western States) and the United States. With minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain the [[Seminole]] warriors who routinely crossed the border and raided American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United States.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;Weeks&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1819, Spain was forced to negotiate, as it was losing hold on its [[Spanish Empire#The New World|American empire]], with its western territories primed to revolt.{{cn|date=February 2018}} While fighting escaped African-American slaves, outlaws, and Native Americans in U.S.-controlled [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the [[First Seminole War]], American General [[Andrew Jackson]] had pursued them into [[Spanish Florida]]. He built [[Fort Scott (Flint River, Georgia)|Fort Scott]], at the southern border of Georgia (i.e., the U.S.), and used it to destroy the [[Negro Fort]] in [[Florida panhandle|northwest Florida]], whose existence was perceived as an intolerable disruptive risk by Georgia plantation owners.

To stop the Seminole based in [[East Florida]] from raiding Georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves, the U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory. This included the 1817–1818 campaign by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War, after which the U.S. effectively seized control of Northeastern Florida; albeit for purposes of lawful government and administration (in the state of Georgia); but not for the outright annexation of territory for Georgia; for additional US Territory; or, for the creation of another U.S. state.

Adams said the U.S. had to take control because Florida (along the border of Georgia &amp; Alabama Territory) had become "a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Deconde, ''A History of American Foreign Policy'' (1963) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Spain asked for British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President Monroe's cabinet demanded Jackson's immediate dismissal for invading Florida, but Adams realized that his success had given the U.S. a favorable diplomatic position. Adams was able to negotiate very favorable terms.&lt;ref name="Weeks"/&gt;

===Louisiana===
&lt;!-- [[File:United States 1803-04-1804-03.png|thumb|The [[Louisiana Purchase]]]] --&gt;
[[File:Mississippiriver-new-01.png|thumb|The [[Mississippi River#Watershed|Mississippi River Basin]]]]
In 1521, the Spanish Empire created the ''Virreinato de Nueva España'' (Viceroyalty of New Spain) to govern its conquests in the Caribbean, North America, and later the Pacific Ocean.  In 1682, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] claimed [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]] for France.&lt;ref&gt;On April 9, 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle claimed the [[Mississippi River]] and "all lands whose waters flow to it" for King [[Louis XIV of France]].  La Salle named the region ''|La Louisiane'' in honor of the king.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Spanish Empire, this was an intrusion into the northeastern frontier of Nueva España.  In 1691, Spain created the [[Spanish Texas|Province of Tejas]] in Nueva España in an attempt to inhibit French settlement west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Fearing the loss of his American territories in the [[Seven Years' War]], King [[Louis XV of France]] ceded ''La Louisiane'' to King [[Charles III of Spain]] with the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] in 1762.  The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1763 split ''La Louisiane'' with the portion east of the Mississippi River becoming a part of [[British North America]] and the portion west of the river becoming the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|District of Luisiana]] of Nueva España.  This eliminated the French threat to Nueva España, and the Spanish provinces of Luisiana, Tejas, and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]] coexisted with only loosely defined borders.  In 1800, French First Consul [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] forced King [[Charles IV of Spain]] to cede Luisiana to France with the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]].  Spain continued to administer Luisiana until 1802, when Spain publicly transferred the district to France.  The following year, Napoleon sold La Louisiane to the United States to raise money for his military campaigns.

The United States and the Spanish Empire disagreed over the territorial boundaries of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.  The United States maintained the claim of France that Louisiana included the Mississippi River and "all lands whose waters flow to it."  To the west of [[New Orleans]], the United States assumed the French claim to all land east and north of the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hämäläinen |first=Pekka |title=The Comanche Empire |year=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-12654-9 |page=156 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;At the time of the treaty negotiations, the exploration of the western Mississippi River Basin had only begun.  A modern definition of the border initially claimed by the United States begins at the mouth of [[Sabine Pass]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] ({{coord|29.67822|-93.83430|format=dms|name=Sabine Pass}}), thence up the Sabine River to its source ({{coord|33.32108|-96.21598|format=dms|name=Source of Sabine River}}), thence due north (a distance of about {{convert|400|m|sp=us}} along meridian 96°12'58"W) to the southern extent of the [[Red River of the South#Watershed|Red River drainage basin]] ({{coord|33.32474|-96.21589|format=dms|name=33°19′29″N 96°12′57″W}}), thence westward along the southern extent of the Red River drainage basin to the [[tripoint]] of the Red River, [[Arkansas River]], and [[Brazos River]] [[drainage basin]]s ({{coord|34.70300|-103.66035|format=dms|name=Red–Arkansas–Brazos tripoint}}), thence northwestward along the southern extent of the [[Arkansas River]] drainage basin to the tripoint of the Mississippi River, [[Colorado River]], and [[San Luis Valley|San Luis]] drainage basins ({{coord|38.34760|-106.25274|format=dms|name=Mississippi–Colorado–San Luis tripoint}}), thence northward along the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] to the tripoint of the Mississippi River, Colorado River, and [[Columbia River]] drainage basins (on [[Three Waters Mountain]]) ({{coord|43.38676|-109.78260|format=dms|name=Mississippi–Colorado–Columbia tripoint}}).  At this tripoint the United States claim to the [[Oregon Country]] began (see [[#Oregon Country]].)&lt;/ref&gt;  Spain maintained that all land west of the [[Calcasieu River]] and south of the [[Arkansas River]] belonged to Tejas and Santa Fe de Nuevo México (see [[#New Spain]].)

The United Kingdom claimed the region west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] between the undefined borders of [[Alta California]] and [[Russian America|Russian Alaska]] on the basis of (1) the [[third voyage of James Cook]] in 1778, (2) the [[Vancouver Expedition]] in 1791–1795, (3) the solo journey of [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] to the [[North Bentinck Arm]]&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|52|22|43|N|127|28|14|W|format=dms|name=Alexander Mackenzie marker}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1792–1793, and (4) the exploration of [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] in 1807–1812.  The [[Nootka Convention#Third Nootka Convention|Third Nootka Convention]] of 1794 called for the joint and exclusive British–Spanish exploitation of the region.

The United States claimed essentially the same region on the basis of (1) [[Robert Gray's Columbia River expedition|the voyage]] of [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] up the [[Columbia River]] in 1792, (2) the United States [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–1806, and (3) the establishment of [[Fort Astoria]]&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|46.18820278|-123.8274694|format=dms|name=Fort Astoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Columbia River in 1811.  On 20 October 1818, the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] was signed setting the border between British North America and the United States east of the Continental Divide along the [[49th parallel north]] and calling for joint Anglo-American occupancy west of the Great Divide.  The Anglo-American Convention ignored the Nootka Convention of 1794 which gave Spain joint rights in the region.  The Convention also ignored Russian settlements in the region.  The United States referred to this region as the [[Oregon Country]], while the United Kingdom referred to the region as the [[Columbia District]].

On 16 July 1741, the crew of the [[Russian Navy|Imperial Russian Navy]] ship ''Saint Peter'' (''Апостол Пётр''), captained by [[Vitus Bering]], sighted [[Mount Saint Elias]], &lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|60.2937540|-140.9289760|format=dms|name=Mount Saint Elias}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth-highest summit in North America.  They became the first Europeans to land in northwestern North America.  The [[Fur trade#Russian fur trade|Russian fur trade]] soon followed the discovery.  By 1812, the [[Russian Empire]] claimed [[Russian America|Alaska and the Pacific Coast of North America]] as far south as the Russian settlement of [[Fort Ross, California|Fortress Ross]],&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|38.5140796|-123.2436186|format=dms|name=Fortress Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; only {{convert|105|km|0|abbr=none|sp=us}} northwest of the Spain's [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio Real de San Francisco]].

The Spanish Empire claimed all lands west of the Continental Divide throughout the Americas.&lt;ref group="notes" name=Pacific_Coast&gt;The claim of Spain to all lands west of the Continental Divide in the Americas dated to the [[papal bull]] ''[[Inter caetera]]'' issued by [[Pope Alexander VI]] on May 4, 1493, which granted to the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] the rights to colonize all "pagan lands" 100 leagues west of the [[Azores]] and south of the [[Cape Verde|Cabo Verde islands]].  This edict was superseded by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] signed on June 7, 1494, which divided the Earth into hemispheres along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cabo Verde islands.  In 1513, explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] claimed the entire "Mar de Sur" (Pacific Ocea]) and all lands adjacent for the Crowns of Castile and Aragon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1774 and 1779, King Charles III of Spain ordered [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|three naval expeditions north along the Pacific Coast]] to assert Spain's territorial claims.  In July 1774, [[Juan José Pérez Hernández]] reached [[Parallel 54°40′ north|latitude 54°40′ north]] off the northwestern tip of [[Langara Island]] before being forced to turn south.  On 15 August 1775, [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] reached the [[59th parallel north|latitude 59°0′]] before returning south.  On 23 July 1779, [[Ignacio de Arteaga y Bazán]] and Bodega y Quadra reached Puerto de Santiago on Isla de la Magdalena (now [[Port Etches]] on [[Hinchinbrook Island (Alaska)|Hinchinbrook Island]])&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|60.3302778|-146.6044444|format=dms|name=Puerto de Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they held a formal possession ceremony commemorating [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], the [[patron saint]] of Spain.  This marked the northernmost Spanish exploration in the Pacific Ocean.

Between 1788 and 1793, Spain launched several more [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest#1788 voyage of Martínez and Haro|expeditions]] north of Alta California.  On 24 June 1789, [[Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra]] established the Spanish colony of [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]]&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{coord|49.59163|-126.615458|format=dms|name=Santa Cruz de Nuca}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the northwest coast of [[Vancouver Island]].  Asserting Spain's claim of exclusive sovereignty and navigation rights, Martínez seized several ships in [[Nootka Sound]] provoking the [[Nootka Crisis]] with the British Empire.  In negotiations to resolve the crisis, Spain claimed that its Nootka Territory extended north from Alta California to the [[61st parallel north]] and from the Continental Divide west to the [[147th meridian west]].  On 11 January 1794, the Spanish Empire and the British Empire signed the [[Nootka Convention#Third Nootka Convention|Third Nootka Convention]] which called for the abandonment of all permanent settlements on Nootka Sound.  Santa Cruz de Nuca was formally abandoned on 28 March 1795.  The Convention also called for joint and exclusive British–Spanish exploitation of the Nootka Territory.  On 19 August 1796, the Spanish Empire joined the [[French First Republic]] in war against the British Empire with the signing of the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso]], thus ending Spanish and British cooperation in the Americas.

East of the Continental Divide, the Spanish Empire claimed all land south of the Arkansas River that was west of the [[Medina River]] and all land south of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] that was west of the [[Calcasieu River]].&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;At the time of the treaty negotiations, the course of the Calcasieu, Red and Arkansas Rivers were only partially known and the location of the Continental Divide was yet to be determined.  A modern definition of the border initially claimed by Spain begins at the mouth of Calcasieu Pass on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] ({{coord|29.76125|-93.34429|format=dms|name=Calcasieu Pass}}), thence up the Calcasieu River to its source ({{coord|31.2654598|-93.2129426|format=dms|name=Source of Calcasieu River}}), thence due north (along meridian 93°12'47"W) to the Red River ({{coord|31.89271|-93.2129426|format=dms|name=Red River at 96°12′58″W}}), thence up the Red River to the meridian (99°15′19″W) of the source of the Medina River ({{coord|34.37222|-99.25532|format=dms|name=Red River at 99°15′19″W}}), thence due north along that meridian (99°15′19″W) to the Arkansas River ({{coord|38.05290|-99.25532|format=dms|name=Arkansas River at 99°15′19″W}}), thence up the Arkansas River to its source ({{coord|39.25832|-106.34364|format=dms|name=Source of Arkansas River}}), thence due west (a distance of about {{convert|12|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} along the parallel 39°15'30"N) to the Continental Divide ({{coord|39.25832|-106.48266|format=dms|name=Continental Divide at 39°15'30"N}}), thence northward along the Continental Divide presumably all the way to the [[Bering Strait]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast disputed region between the territorial claims of the United States and Spain was occupied primarily by [[Native Americans in the United States|native peoples]] with very few [[Indian Trade|traders]] of either Spain or the United States.  In the south, the disputed region between the Calcasieu River and the Sabine River encompassed [[Los Adaes]], the first capital of Spanish Texas.  The region between the Calcasieu and Sabine rivers become a lawless [[no man's land]].  The United States saw great potential in these western lands, and hoped to settle their borders.  Spain, seeing the end of New Spain, hoped to employ its territorial claims before it would be forced to grant Mexico its [[Treaty of Córdoba|independence]] (later in 1821). Spain hoped to regain much of its territory after the regional demands for independence subsided.

===Details of the treaty===
[[File:United States 1821-07-1821-08.png|thumb|The Adams–Onís Treaty]]
The treaty, consisting of 16 articles&lt;ref name=Dewitt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adamonis.htm|website=Sons of Dewitt Colony|publisher=TexasTexas A&amp;M University,|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428202343/http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adamonis.htm|archivedate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed in Adams' State Department office at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=John Quincy|title=Diary of John Quincy Adams|volume=31|page=44|url=http://www.masshist.org/jqadiaries/php/popup?id=jqad31_44}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 22, 1819, by [[John Quincy Adams]], [[U.S. Secretary of State]], and [[Luis de Onís y González-Vara|Luis de Onís]], Spanish minister. Ratification was postponed for two years, because Spain wanted to use the treaty as an incentive to keep the United States from giving diplomatic support to the revolutionaries in South America. As soon as the treaty was signed, the [[U.S. Senate]] ratified unanimously; but because of Spain's stalling, a new ratification was necessary and this time there were objections. [[Henry Clay]] and other Western spokesmen demanded that Spain also give up [[Texas]]. This proposal was defeated by the Senate, which ratified the treaty a second time on February 19, 1821, following ratification by Spain on October 24, 1820. Ratifications were exchanged three days later and the treaty was proclaimed on February 22, 1821, two years after the signing.&lt;ref&gt;Deconde, ''History of American Foreign Policy,'' p 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty closed the first era of United States expansion by providing for the cession of East Florida under Article 2; the abandonment of the controversy over West Florida under Article 2 (a portion of which had been seized by the United States); and the definition of a boundary with the Spanish province of Mexico, that clearly made Spanish Texas a part of Mexico, under Article 3, thus ending much of the vagueness in the boundary of the Louisiana Purchase. Spain also ceded to the U.S. its claims to the Oregon Country, under Article 3.

The U.S. did not pay Spain for Florida, but instead agreed to pay the legal claims of American citizens against Spain, to a maximum of $5 million, under Article 11.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The U.S. commission established to adjudicate claims considered some 1,800 claims and agreed that they were collectively worth $5,454,545.13. Since the treaty limited the payment of claims to $5 million, the commission reduced the amount paid out proportionately by 8⅓ percent.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 12, [[Pinckney's Treaty]] of 1795 between the U.S. and Spain was to remain in force. Under Article 15, Spanish goods received exclusive [[Most favoured nation|most-favored-nation]] privileges in the ports at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] for twelve years.

Under Article 2, the U.S. received ownership of Spanish Florida (British East Florida and West Florida 1763–1783). Under Article 3, the U.S. relinquished its own claims on parts of Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas.

==Border==
{{GeoGroup|section=Border}}
Article 3 of the treaty states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Boundary Line between the two Countries, West of the Mississippi, shall begin on the [[Gulf of Mexico]], at the [[Sabine Pass|mouth]] of the River Sabine in the Sea ({{coord|29.67822|-93.83430|format=dms|name=Sabine Pass}}), continuing North, along the Western Bank of that River, to the [[32nd parallel north|32d degree of Latitude]] ({{coord|32|-94.04574|format=dms|name=Sabine River at 32°N}}); thence by a Line due North to the degree of Latitude, where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Nachitoches, or Red-River ({{coord|33.55112|-94.04574|format=dms|name=Red River at 94°2′45"W}}), then following the course of the Rio-Roxo Westward to the degree of Longitude, [[100th meridian west|100 West from London]] and 23 from Washington ({{coord|34.56038|-100|format=dms|name=Red River at 100°W}}), then crossing the said Red-River, and running thence by a Line due North to the River Arkansas ({{coord|37.74375|-100|format=dms|name=Arkansas River at 100°W}}), thence, following the Course of the Southern bank of the Arkansas to its source in Latitude, 42. North and thence by that parallel of Latitude to the South-Sea [Pacific Ocean]. The whole being as laid down in Melishe's Map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January 1818. But if the Source of the Arkansas River shall be found to fall North or South of Latitude 42, then the Line shall run from the said Source ({{coord|39.2583225|-106.3439141|format=dms|name=Arkansas River source}}) due South or North, as the case may be, till it meets the said [[42nd parallel north|Parallel of Latitude 42]] ({{coord|42|-106.3439141|format=dms|name=42°N 106°20′38″W}}), and thence along the said Parallel to the South Sea ({{coord|42|-124.21266|format=dms|name=Pacific Coast at 42°N}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the time the treaty was signed, the course of the Sabine River, Red River, and Arkansas River had only been partially charted.  Furthermore, the rivers changed course periodically.  It would take many years before the location of the border would be fully determined.

South of the 32nd parallel north, the Spanish Empire and the United States settled for the U.S. claim along the Sabine River.  Between the meridians 94°2′45" and 100° west, the parties settled on the Spanish claim along the Red River.  West of the 100th meridian west, the parties settled on the Spanish claim along the Arkansas River.  From the source of the Arkansas River in the [[Rocky Mountains]], the parties settled on a border due north along that meridian (106°20′37″W) to the [[42nd parallel north]], thence west along the 42nd parallel to the Pacific Ocean.

Spain won substantial buffer zones around its provinces of Tejas, [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]], and Alta California in New Spain. While the United States relinquished substantial territory east of Continental Divide, the newly defined border allowed settlement of the southwestern part of the [[Louisiana|State of Louisiana]], the [[Arkansas Territory|Territory of Arkansaw]], and the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]].

Spain relinquished all claims in the Americas north of the 42nd parallel north.  This was a historic retreat in its 327-year pursuit of lands in the Americas.  The previous [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] meant that both the United States and the British Empire could settle land north of the 42nd parallel and west of the Continental Divide.  The United States now had a firm foothold on the Pacific Coast and could commence settlement of the jointly occupied Oregon Country (known as the [[Columbia District]] to the rival United Kingdom).  The Russian Empire also claimed this entire region as part of Russian America.

For the United States, this Treaty (and the [[Treaty of 1818]] with Britain agreeing to joint occupancy of the Pacific Northwest) meant that its claimed territory now extended far west from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. For Spain, it meant that it kept its colony of Texas and also kept a buffer zone between its colonies in California and New Mexico and the U.S. territories.  Many historians consider the Treaty to be a great achievement for the U.S., as time validated Adams's vision that it would allow the U.S. to open trade with the Orient across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Jones |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913 |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |page=112 |isbn=978-0-7425-6453-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally this new border has been called the "Step Boundary," although the step-like shape of the boundary was not apparent for several decades—the source of the Arkansas, believed to be near the 42nd parallel north, was not known until [[John C. Frémont]] located it in the 1840s, hundreds of miles south of the 42nd parallel.

==Implementation==
Washington set up a commission, 1821 to 1824, that handled American claims against Spain. Many notable lawyers, including [[Daniel Webster]] and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], represented claimants before the commission. During its term, the commission examined 1,859 claims arising from over 720 spoliation incidents, and distributed the $5 million in a basically fair manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cash |first=Peter Arnold |title=The Adams–Onís Treaty Claims Commission: Spoliation and Diplomacy, 1795–1824 |publisher=PhD dissertation U. of Memphis 1998 |work=DAI |year=1999 |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=3611-A. DA9905078 }} Fulltext: [[ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses]].&lt;/ref&gt;
The treaty reduced tensions with Spain (and after 1821 Mexico), and allowed budget cutters in Congress to reduce the army budget and reject the plans to modernize and expand the army proposed by Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]].

The treaty was honored by both sides, although inaccurate maps from the treaty meant that the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma remained unclear for most of the 19th century. The American boundary was expanded in 1848 by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] with Mexico.

==Later developments==
[[File:1833 Eagle Map of the U.S..JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|An 1833 map of the United States in the shape of an eagle]]
The treaty was ratified by Spain in 1820, and by the United States in 1821 (during the time that Spain and Mexico were engaged in the prolonged [[Mexican War of Independence]]). Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. While Mexico was not initially a party to the Adams–Onís Treaty, in 1831 Mexico ratified the treaty by agreeing to the 1828 [[Treaty of Limits (Mexico–United States)|Treaty of Limits]] with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kpbs/theborder/history/timeline/2.html The Border: Adams–Onís Treaty], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Russo-American Treaty of 1824]], the Russian Empire ceded its claims south of [[parallel 54°40′ north]] to the United States.  With the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]] in 1825, Russia set the southern border of Alaska on the same parallel in exchange for the Russian right to trade south of that border and the British right to navigate north of that border.  This set the absolute limits of the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the 42nd parallel north and the parallel 54°40′ north west of the Continental Divide.

By the mid-1830s, a controversy developed regarding the border with Texas, during which the United States demonstrated that the Sabine and [[Neches River|Neches]] rivers had been switched on maps, moving the frontier in favor of Mexico. As a consequence, the eastern boundary of Texas was not firmly established until the independence of the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1836. It was not agreed upon by the United States and Mexico until the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, which concluded the [[Mexican–American War]]. That treaty also formalized the cession by Mexico of Alta California and today's [[American Southwest]], except for the territory of the later [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (1939) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dispute occurred after Texas joined the Union. The treaty stated that the boundary between the French claims on the north and the Spanish claims on the south was Rio Roxo de Natchitoches (Red River) until it reached the 100th meridian, as noted on the [[John Melish]] map of 1818. But, the 100th meridian on the Melish map was marked some {{convert|90|mi|km}} east of the true 100th meridian, and the Red River forked about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of the 100th meridian. Texas claimed the land south of the North Fork, and the United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (later called the [[Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River]]).  In 1860 Texas organized the area as [[Greer County, Texas|Greer County]]. The matter was not settled until a [[Wikisource:United States v. Texas (162 U.S. 1)|United States Supreme Court ruling]] in 1896 upheld federal claims to the territory, after which it was added to the [[Oklahoma Territory]].&lt;ref name="Meadows2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meadows|first=William C.|title=Kiowa Ethnogeography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7pYhyIW2dMC&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=February 21, 2017|date=January 1, 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292778443|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty gave rise to a later border dispute between the states of Oregon and California, which remains unresolved. Upon statehood in 1850, California established the 42nd parallel as its constitutional de jure border as it had existed since 1819 when the territory was part of Spanish Mexico. In an 1868–1870 border survey following the admission of Oregon as a state, errors were made in demarcating and marking the Oregon-California border, creating a dispute that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-19/news/mn-9232_1_border-dispute| title=California–Oregon Dispute : Border Fight Has Townfolk on Edge|date=May 19, 1985|first=Jeff|last=Barnard|work= Los Angeles Times|publisher= Associated Press |quote=Preliminary studies indicate that, as the result of an 1870 surveying error, Oregon has about 31,000 acres of California, while California has about 20,000 acres of Oregon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/24/us/sea-riches-spur-feud-on-border.html|title=SEA RICHES SPUR FEUD ON BORDER| first=Wallace|last=Turner|work= New York Times|date= March 24, 1985|quote=The border should follow the 42d parallel straight west from the 120th meridian to the Pacific.

'''''Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd''''', commonly known as the '''''Engineers case''''',&lt;ref name="Engineers case"&gt;{{citation|ref=CITEREFEngineers_case |title=''Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (Engineers case)''}} {{Cite AustLII|HCA|54|1920|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/54.pdf (1920) 28 CLR 129]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark decision by the [[High Court of Australia]] on 31 August 1920.  The immediate issue concerned the Commonwealth's power under [[Section 51(xxxv) of the Australian Constitution|s51(xxxv)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] but the Court did not confine itself to that question, using the opportunity to roam broadly over constitutional interpretation.&lt;ref name=BGW&gt;{{cite book |title=Federal Constitutional Law: An Introduction |last=Booker |first=Keven |last2=Glass |first2=Arthur |last3=Watt |first3=Rob |year=1998 |edition=2nd |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |chapter=3 at paras [3.25]-[3.36] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely regarded as one of the most important cases ever decided by the [[High Court of Australia]], it swept away the earlier doctrines of [[Intergovernmental immunity (Australia)|implied intergovernmental immunities]] and [[reserved State powers]], thus paving the way for fundamental changes in the nature of [[federalism in Australia]].

==Background==

===Facts===

The ''Engineers case'' arose out of a claim lodged by a union of engineers in the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] for an award relating to 844 employers across Australia.&lt;ref name="Engineers case"/&gt; In [[Western Australia]], the employers included three governmental employers. The question was whether a Commonwealth law made under the "conciliation and arbitration" power regarding industrial disputes, section 51(xxxv), could authorise the making of an award binding the three employers. The case came before the Full Court on a case stated under the ''Judiciary Act''.&lt;ref name="Judiciary Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ja1903112|Judiciary Act 1903|18}} Reference to Full Court.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Previous approach to constitutional interpretation===
The three original judges of the High Court, [[Samuel Griffith|Griffith]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]], [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] and [[Richard O'Connor (politician)|O'Connor]] [[Justices|JJ]], and the two new judges appointed in 1906, [[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]] and [[H. B. Higgins|Higgins]] JJ, had all been leading participants in the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Conventions]] and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=The WorkChoices case |link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (2006) |year=2006 |court=HCA |num=52 |parallelcite=(2006) 229 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}} at [48]-[49] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court described the Constitution as "framed in Australia by Australians, and for the use of the Australian people",&lt;ref name="Petersweld"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Peterswald v Bartley]] |year=1904 |court=HCA |num=21 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/21.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 497]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus when the Court spoke of what was framers of the Constitution knew, intended or expected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=[[D'Emden v Pedder]] |year=1904 |court=HCA |num=1 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 91] at p. 113}}; {{cite AustLII |litigants=Railway Servants' case |link=Federated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association |year=1904 |court=HCA |num=1 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 91] at p. 536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they were referring to their personal experience in that process, and not to the intention or knowledge of the Imperial Parliament in passing the ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' 1900.&lt;ref name="Imp Act"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins J noted in {{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW)]] |year=1907 |court=HCA |num=76 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/76.pdf (1907) 4 CLR 1087]}} at p. 1169-70 that in relation to [[section 74 of the Constitution of Australia|section 74 of the Constitution]] the question of intention may be a reference to the intention of the Conventions, the Australian voters who approved the draft constitution, the Australian delegates in London who negotiated the passage of the constitution, the British law officers who redrafted section 74 or to the Houses of the British Parliament who passed the ''Constitution Act'' 1900 (Imp).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Webb v Outtrim]]'',&lt;ref name="Webb v Outrim"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Webb v Outtrim]] |year=1906 |court=UKPC |num=75 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1907]&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}}&amp;nbsp;81}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|4|1906|parallelcite=(1906)&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]]&amp;nbsp;356 |courtname=auto |juris=Vic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] criticised the High Court's approach to the interpretation of the constitution, holding that the relevant question was not the intention of the Australians who framed the Constitution, but rather what the British Parliament had in mind when it passed the ''Constitution Act''.&lt;ref name="Imp Act"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' 1900 (Imp) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1900/12/pdfs/ukpga_19000012_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the criticism, and the challenge by the new appointments to the Court from 1906, the original members of the High Court maintained and continued their approach to constitutional interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|43|1908|litigants=[[R v Barger]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/43.pdf (1908) 6 CLR 41] at p. 69-7 per Grifith CJ, Barton &amp; O'Connor JJ}}.&lt;br&gt;''[[Attorney-General for NSW v Brewery Employees Union of NSW|Union label case]]'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/94.pdf (1908) 6 CLR 469] at p. 514 per Griffith CJ.&lt;br&gt;''[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]]'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909) 8 CLR 330] at p. 563 per Barton J.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implied intergovernmental immunities===
{{main|Intergovernmental immunity (Australia)}}

The original High Court tended to employ the US jurisprudence governing [[intergovernmental immunity]], expressing it as an implied immunity of instrumentalities, where neither the Commonwealth nor State governments could be affected by the laws of the other.&lt;ref name="Tomoey 2008"&gt;{{cite web |author= A Twomey  |title=Federal limitations on the legislative power of the States and the Commonwealth to bind one another |url=http://flr.law.anu.edu.au/sites/flr.anulaw.anu.edu.au/files/flr/Twomey_1.pdf}} (2003) 31 [[Federal Law Review]] 507 at p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt; This was first expressed in ''[[D'Emden v Pedder]]'',&lt;ref name="D'Emden"&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=[[D'Emden v Pedder]] |year=1904 |court=HCA |num=1 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 91]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deakin v Webb]]'',&lt;ref name="Deakin v Webb"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1904|litigants=[[Deakin v Webb]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/57.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 585]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association|''Railway Servants' case'']].&lt;ref name="Railway servants"&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Federated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association (Railway Servants' case) |link=Federated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association |year=1904 |court=HCA |num=1 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 CLR 91]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Samuel Griffith|Griffith CJ]] declared in the first case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In considering the respective powers of the Commonwealth and of the States it is essential to bear in mind that each is, within the ambit of its authority, a sovereign State, subject only to the restrictions imposed by the Imperial connection and to the provisions of the Constitution, either expressed or necessarily implied... a right of sovereignty subject to extrinsic control is a contradiction in terms.&lt;ref name="D'Emden"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reserved State powers===
{{main|reserved State powers}}

The reserved powers doctrine was a principle used in the interpretation of the Constitution that emphasised the context of the Constitution, drawing on principles of federalism, what the Court saw as the compact between the newly formed Commonwealth and the former colonies, particularly the compromises that informed the text of the constitution. The doctrine involved a restrictive approach to the interpretation of the specific powers of the Federal Parliament to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the States.

===Changes to the composition of the Court===

The appointment or departure of a judge from the High Court can change the dynamics within the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book Launch |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/current-justices/frenchcj/frenchcj13feb2015.pdf |author=French, R |author-link1=Robert French |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1906 to 1913 there had been 5 appointments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]], [[H.B. Higgins|Higgins]], [[Frank Gavan Duffy|Gavan Duffy]] [[Charles Powers|Powers]] and [[George Rich|Rich]]. [[Albert Piddington|Piddington]] was appointed in 1913 but never sat as a judge.&lt;/ref&gt; and the death of O'Connor J in 1912. These changes did not however generally change the approach of the High Court. The first sign of significant change was in the 1919 [[Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation|''Municipalities Case'']] where it was held that municipal corporations responsible for the making, maintenance, control and lighting of public streets were not State instrumentalities.&lt;ref name=Municipalities&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|73|1919|litigants=[[Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/73.pdf (1919) 26 CLR 508]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More dramatic consequences flowed, however, from the retirement of Griffith CJ in 1919, the death of Barton J in 1920 and their replacement by [[Adrian Knox|Knox CJ]] and [[Hayden Starke|Starke J]]. The change was described as the departure of statesmen, who interpreted the Constitution as a political compact and their replacement by legalists and nationalists, who interpreted it as a legal document.&lt;ref name="Knox Court"/&gt;

===Argument===
The Engineers were represented by [[Robert Menzies]], then a junior barrister.  His account of the hearing in Melbourne on 24 May 1920 before the High Court is that he argued that the Government sawmills in Western Australia were not State instrumentalities as they were trading rather than Government enterprises. Menzies records Starke J as describing the argument as nonsense and says
&lt;blockquote&gt;I, in what I later realized to be an inspired moment, replied: 'Sir, I quite agree.' 'Well', intervened the Chief Justice, Chief Justice Knox, never the most genial of interrogators, 'why are you putting an argument which you admit is nonsense?' 'Because' ... 'I am compelled by the earlier decisions of this Court. If your Honours will permit me to question all or any of these earlier decisions, I will undertake to advance a sensible argument.' I waited for the heavens to fall. Instead, the Chief Justice said: 'The Court will retire for a few minutes.' And when they came back, he said, 'This case will be adjourned for argument at Sydney. Each government will be notified so that it may apply to intervene. Counsel will be at liberty to challenge any earlier decision of this Court!' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Menzies, R.G. |author-link1=Robert Menzies |title=Central Power of the Australian Commonwealth |year=1967 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Writing in 1995, [[Gerard Brennan|Brennan CJ]] had access to the notebooks of both Knox CJ and Isaacs J, from which he concluded that "It seems quite clear that Menzies lit the fuse in Melbourne, though the main charge for exploding the notion of reciprocal supremacy seems to have been prepared by Isaacs and Rich JJ. in the ''Municipalities Case''.&lt;ref name=Municipalities/&gt;{{rp|533}} Yet it was Leverrier's,&lt;ref&gt;Leverrier {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KC}}, counsel for the Commonwealth&lt;/ref&gt; rather than Menzies' advocacy which seems to have had the greatest impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/brennanj/brennanj_engineer.htm |title=Three cheers for Engineers: 75th Anniversary of the Engineers Case |author=The Hon. [[Gerard Brennan|Sir Gerard Brennan]] |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The joint majority judgment of [[Adrian Knox|Knox]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]], [[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]], [[George Rich|Rich]] &amp; [[Hayden Starke|Starke]] [[Justices|JJ]] was delivered by Isaacs J and its authorship is commonly attributed to him based on its style which was long, rhetorical and [[polemic]].&lt;ref name="Knox Court"&gt;{{Cite book |author=A Twomey |chapter=Ch 6 the Knox Court |title=The High Court, the Constitution and Australian Politics |editor1=Dixon, R |editor2=Williams, G |editor-link2=George Williams (lawyer) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9781107043664 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqewBgAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. B. Higgins|Higgins]] J wrote a separate opinion but came to a similar conclusion. [[Frank Gavan Duffy|Gavan Duffy]] J dissented.

The joint majority opinion of the Court reviewed the jurisprudence of the Griffith Court and declared:&lt;ref name=CLR129-141&gt;''{{harvnb|Engineers case}}'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/54.pdf (1920) 28 CLR 129] at pp. 141–2 per Knox CJ, Isaacs, Rich &amp; Starke JJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The more the decisions are examined, and compared with each other and with the Constitution itself, the more evident it becomes that no clear principle can account for them. They are sometimes at variance with the natural meaning of the text of the Constitution; some are irreconcilable with others, and some are individually rested on reasons not founded on the words of the Constitution or on any recognized principle of the common law underlying the expressed terms of the Constitution, but on implication drawn from what is called the principle of 'necessity', that being itself referable to no more definite standard than the personal opinion of the Judge who declares it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judgment then returned to first principles on how the Constitution is to be interpreted. The use of American precedent was rejected in favour of applying the settled rules of construction that gave primacy to the text of the Constitution and anchored its interpretation to its express words.

Some "reservations" were made about State prerogatives and special Commonwealth powers (like over taxation); the reservations eventually became subsumed within some general intergovernmental immunity rules to emerge as the ''[[Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth|Melbourne Corporation]]'' doctrine.

The Court considered its earlier decision in ''[[D'Emden v Pedder]]'',&lt;ref name=CLR91&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|1|1904|litigants=[[D'Emden v Pedder]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 CLR  91]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been the foundation case for the original intergovernmental immunities doctrine. It has been said that the ''Engineers case'' attacks the reasoning in D'Emden, but rationalises the conclusion. A later case (''Attorney-General for Queensland v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|39|1915|litigants=Attorney-General for Queensland v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/39.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 148]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that applied ''D'Emden'' was attacked as resting on opinions "as to hopes and expectations respecting vague external conditions".

The joint majority judgment then went on to establish that the Crown in its various capacities is bound by the Constitution. The power of the Commonwealth to bind the States was seen as an aspect of the general conclusion. Its reasoning invoked the notion of the one and indivisible Crown, which is no longer part of Australian jurisprudence, but that conclusion is capable of being reached without such a notion.

Passages of the joint majority judgment discuss the paramountcy of Commonwealth law, which foreshadow the later expansion of Constitution s109 inconsistency doctrine in ''[[Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn]]'':&lt;ref name=CLR466&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|6|1926|litigants=[[Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1926/6.pdf (1926) 37 CLR 466]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the ''D'Emden v Pedder'' non-interference principle lives on in the second ("rights impairment") test of inconsistency.&lt;ref name=BGW/&gt;

==Significance==
Former Chief Justice of Australia Sir [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] has written:&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite web |author=Anthony Mason |author-link=Anthony Mason (judge) |title=High Court of Australia: A Personal Impression of its first 100 years |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2003/33.html}} (2003) 27 [[Melbourne University Law Review]] 864.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The combination of literal interpretation and a broad construction of Commonwealth powers led to the Commonwealth assuming a dominant position in the Australian federation vis-a-vis the states. The ''Engineers case'' ushered in a period of literal interpretation of the Constitution. Literal interpretation and legalism (of which Sir John Latham was the chief exponent) were characteristic of the Court's constitutional interpretation for the greater part of the 20th century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The decision has had its critics. In 1937, R.T.E. Latham wrote:&lt;ref name=WLGT&gt;quoted in Winterton, Lee, Glass and Thomson, ''Australian Federal Constitutional Law: Commentary and Materials'' (Law Book Co. 1999) at 757&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It cut off Australian constitutional law from American precedents, a copious source of thoroughly relevant learning, in favour of crabbed English rules of statutory interpretation, which are one of the sorriest features of English law, and are... particularly unsuited to the interpretation of a rigid Constitution.... The fundamental criticism of the decision is that its real ground is nowhere stated in the majority judgment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the question of the use of American and other foreign precedents, Mason wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the ''Engineers case'', the Court made considerable use of United States authorities. Following the ''Engineers case'', references to United States authority were much less frequent. The majority remarked: "American authorities... are not a secure basis on which to build fundamentally with respect to our own Constitution [but] in secondary... matters they may... afford considerable light and assistance."&lt;ref name=CLR129-146&gt;''{{harvnb|Engineers case}}'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/54.pdf (1920) 28 CLR 129] at p. 146 per Knox CJ, Isaacs, Rich &amp; Starke JJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Much later, in the 1980s and the 1990s, the Court made extensive use of foreign authorities and comparative law. This use of foreign precedents was associated with the demise of the Privy Council appeal and the Court's recognition of its responsibility to declare the law for Australia.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the case, doctrine can be based on an implication from the text or structure of the Constitution. Sir [[Owen Dixon]], in particular, was critical of any such overblown reading of the ''Engineers case'' in this oft-quoted passage: "The prima-facie rule is that a power to legislate with respect to a given subject enables the Parliament to make laws which, upon that subject, affect the operations of the States and their agencies. That, as I have pointed out more than once, is the effect of the Engineers case stripped of embellishment and reduced to the form of a legal proposition."&lt;ref name=CLR31&gt;
{{Cite AustLII|HCA|26|1947|litigants=Melbourne Corporation case |link=Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1947/26.pdf (1947) 74 CLR 31]}} at p. 78 per Dixon J.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, he had written: "We should avoid pedantic and narrow constructions in dealing with an instrument of government and I do not see why we should be fearful about making implications."&lt;ref name=CLR29&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|41|1945|litigants=Airlines Nationalisation case |link=Australian National Airways Pty Ltd v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/41.pdf (1945) 71 CLR 29]}} at p. 85 per Dixon J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1971, [[Victor Windeyer|Windeyer]] J made the following assessment of the ''Engineers case'':&lt;ref name=CLR353&gt;{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Payroll Tax case |link=Victoria v Commonwealth (1971) |year=1971 |court=HCA |num=16 |parallelcite=122 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353}} at p. 396-7 per Windeyer J.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Colonies which in 1901 became States in the new Commonwealth were not before then sovereign bodies in any strict legal sense; and certainly the Constitution did not make them so. They were self-governing colonies which, when the Commonwealth came into existence as a new Dominion of the Crown, lost some of their former powers and gained no new powers. They became components of a federation, the Commonwealth of Australia. It became a nation. Its nationhood was in the course of time to be consolidated in war, by economic and commercial integration, by the unifying influence of federal law, by the decline of dependence upon British naval and military power and by a recognition and acceptance of external interests and obligations. With these developments the position of the Commonwealth, the federal government, has waxed; and that of the States has waned. In law that is a result of the paramount position of the Commonwealth Parliament in matters of concurrent power. And this legal supremacy has been reinforced in fact by financial dominance. That the Commonwealth would, as time went on, enter progressively, directly or indirectly, into fields that had formerly been occupied by the States, was from an early date seen as likely to occur. This was greatly aided after the decision in the ''Engineers case'',&lt;ref name="Engineers case"/&gt; which diverted the flow of constitutional law into new channels. I have never thought it right to regard the discarding of the doctrine of the implied immunity of the States and other results of the ''Engineers case''&lt;ref name="Engineers case"/&gt; as the correction of antecedent errors or as the uprooting of heresy. To return today to the discarded theories would indeed be an error and the adoption of a heresy. But that is because in 1920 the Constitution was read in a new light, a light reflected from events that had, over twenty years, led to a growing realization that Australians were now one people and Australia one country and that national laws might meet national needs. For lawyers the abandonment of old interpretations of the limits of constitutional powers was readily acceptable. It meant only insistence on rules of statutory interpretation to which they were well accustomed. But reading the instrument in this light does not to my mind mean that the original judges of the High Court were wrong in their understanding of what at the time of federation was believed to be the effect of the Constitution and in reading it accordingly. As I see it the Engineers case, looked at as an event in legal and constitutional history, was a consequence of developments that had occurred outside the law courts as well as a cause of further developments there. That is not surprising for the Constitution is not an ordinary statute: it is a fundamental law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3219">{{wiktionary|amendment}}An '''amendment''' is a formal or official change made to a [[law]], [[contract]], [[constitution]], or other [[legal instrument|legal document]].  It is based on the [[verb]] '''to amend''', which means to change for better.  Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements.  They are often used when it is better to change the document than to write a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment|title=Definition of AMENDMENT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contracts ==
{{see also|Contract}}

Contracts are often amended when the market changes.  For example, a contract to deliver something to a customer once a month can be amended if the customer wants it delivered once a week.  Usually
Contracts also are categorized for their promotion in a nation, such as the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/RuleAmendments/enumeratedagcommodities&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutions ==
{{main|Constitutional amendment}}

Constitutions are often amended when people change their minds about what the government should do.  Some of the most famous constitutional amendments are the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which added the [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of assembly|protest]], the third Amendment to the [[Constitution of Ireland]], which let [[Ireland]] join the [[European Union]], and the amendment of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] as part of the [[German reunification]] process in 1990. Constitutional amendments in some countries{{where|date=February 2014}} must be approved by both the [[parliament]] or [[legislature]] and a [[referendum]], a vote by all citizens in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendments.html|title=U.S. Constitutional Amendments - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=Findlaw|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/cons/germany.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion==
{{main|Amend (motion)}}
In [[parliamentary procedure]], a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] is a proposal to do something. The wording of such a proposal could be changed using the [[Amend (motion)|motion to amend]]. Amendments can remove words, add words, or change words in motions. All [[main motion]]s and some [[secondary motion]]s can be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last=Robert|first=Henry M.|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-306-82020-5|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=132|edition=11th|ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment can [[Second-degree amendment|be amended]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an amendment to an amendment of an amendment is not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">In [[tax law]], '''amortization''' refers to the cost recovery system for [[intangible property]]. Although the theory behind cost recovery deductions of amortization is to deduct from [[cost basis|basis]] in a systematic manner over an asset's estimated useful economic life so as to reflect its consumption, expiration, obsolescence or other decline in value as a result of use or the passage of time, many times a perfect match of income and deductions does not occur for policy reasons. 

==Depreciation==
A corresponding concept for [[tangible asset]]s is [[depreciation]]. Methodologies for allocating amortization to each tax period are generally the same as for depreciation. However, many [[intangible asset]]s such as goodwill or certain brands may be deemed to have an indefinite useful life, or “self-created” and are therefore not subject to amortization.&lt;ref&gt;House Report No. 103-111, 103rd Congress, 25 May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States of America==
The [[United States Congress]] gives taxpayers larger deductions in the early years of an asset’s useful life.
===Intangible property===
Intangible property which is subject to amortization is described in 26 [[U.S.C.]] §§ 197(c)(1) and 197(d) and must be property held either for use in a trade, business, or for the production of income. Before 1993, the [[Internal Revenue Code| United States Tax Code]] did not contain provisions for cost recovery of intangible assets; rather, the intangible assets were depreciated under the current provisions for depreciation of tangible assets, 26 U.S.C. §§ 167 and 168. However, the problem before 1993 was that many intangible assets did not meet the burdensome requirements of §§ 167 and 168 because intangible assets can not necessarily be subject to “wear and tear”. This led to taxpayers having the incentive to ignore any basis in the intangible asset until it was sold.

Under §197 most acquired intangible assets are to be amortized ratably over a fifteen-year period.&lt;ref&gt;House Report No. 103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the best treatment of an intangible whose actual life is much shorter than fifteen years. Furthermore, if an intangible is not eligible for amortization under § 197, the taxpayer can depreciate the asset if there is a showing of the assets useful life.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Regulation § 1.167(a)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startup expenditure===
Startup expenditures are defined as investigatory expenses incurred prior to commencing a trade or business activity which would have been deducted had they been paid or incurred when the taxpayer was already engaged in the trade or business activity. 

Unlike other sections in the tax code which do not allow current deductions for most startup expenses, section 195 allows a taxpayer to amortize start-up expenditures over a 180-month period.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy behind this provision is to encourage taxpayers to explore new business ventures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5064">The '''Assembly of Estates''' ({{lang-fr|Assemblée des États}}, {{lang-de|Ständeversammlung}}) was the legislature of Luxembourg from 1841 to 1848, and again from 1856 to 1868. 

==Background and role==
The [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to the King of the Netherlands in [[personal union]], as his private property, though it also became part of the [[German Confederation]]. King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] therefore became [[King-Grand Duke]]. He, however, administered Luxembourg essentially as part of the Netherlands, and Luxembourg was represented in the Dutch Estates-General from 1816. In the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830, the southern provinces of the Netherlands split off to become the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]; many Luxembourgers wished to become part of this new Belgian state as well. In the 1839 [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]], however, a compromise was found: the large French-speaking part of Luxembourg became part of Belgium, as the province of Luxembourg. The remaining, German-speaking part of Luxembourg became the Grand-Duchy of today, and remained under the Dutch King. The Treaty affirmed Luxembourg as an independent and sovereign state, and the "rump" Luxembourg was, in any case, geographically separated from the Netherlands. Luxembourg was therefore to receive its own government institutions.  

The Grand-Ducal decree of 12 October 1841 on a "Constitution of the Estates" created an Assembly of Estates, consisting of 34 Deputies. Its powers were highly restricted: it could not take decisions and exercised a purely consultative role alongside the sovereign. Very few matters required its approval, and only the Grand Duke could propose laws. The Assembly only sat for 15 days a year, and these sessions were held in secret.&lt;ref name="Chamber"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public/HistoireParlementaire "Histoire parlementaire".] Chambre des Députés du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, 2009. Retrieved 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Assembly was composed of Deputies who were elected in the cantons by Electors in electoral colleges. These Electors in turn were chosen by those with the right to vote. To be able to vote, one had to be a Luxembourgish citizen, over 25 years of age, and to pay 10 guilders in taxes. Becoming an Elector was subject to similar conditions, but was open only to those paying more than 20 guilders in taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}, {{de icon}} [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1841/0051/a051.pdf#page=1 "Mémorial A, 1841, No. 51."] Service central de législation. Retrieved 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that only 3% of the population was entitled to vote, and around 30 notables per canton then chose the Deputies. The Assembly therefore consisted mostly of large-scale landowners. Deputies were elected for renewable terms of 6 years, and every 3 years, half of the Assembly was up for (re-)election.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public/!ut/p/b1/04_SjzS0NLcwNjM1MbTUj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOJdjFzCgjxNjAzczQNNDIy8XL3MQ4P9jN2DzIEKIoEKjCwsgoPcHX1dLS1DnQw8DZwNg10DnYwMPI2I02-AAzgaENLv55Gfm6qfG5XjZuGoqAgAiTrsFQ!!/dl4/d5/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SmtFL1o2X0QyRFZSSTQyMEc3UTQwMkpFSjdVU04zRzcx/ "Histoire: Les élections".] Chambre des Députés du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, 2009. Retrieved on 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Under the influence of the revolutionary democratic movements in France and the rest of Europe in 1848, the [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]] wrote a new Constitution for Luxembourg. This introduced a constitutional monarchy, and gave the legislature, now called the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]], enhanced powers. It was now able to propose and amend laws, vote on the budget, and launch inquiries. The government became accountable to the legislature, whose sessions were now held publicly.&lt;ref name=Chamber /&gt; 

==Return and abolition==
The period of 1856-1868 was an interlude, and saw a brief return to authoritarianism. In the [[Luxembourg Coup of 1856]], the King-Grand Duke [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] replaced the liberal constitution of 1848 with a new one: the legislature was renamed the "Assembly of Estates", retaining its legislative powers, but the Grand Duke was not required to approve and promulgate its laws within a specific timeframe. Taxes no longer required annual approval, and the permanent budget was re-introduced.&lt;ref name=Chamber /&gt; 

This state of affairs lasted until 1868. After Luxembourg had been declared independent and neutral in the [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London of 1867]], a compromise was found between the liberal constitution of 1848 and the authoritarian charter of 1856. The legislature was renamed the Chamber of Deputies, and recovered most of its powers lost in 1856.&lt;ref name=Chamber /&gt;

The '''Bankruptcy Act of 1898''' ("'''Nelson Act'''", July 1, 1898, ch. 541, {{USStat|30|544}}) was the first [[United States]] [[Act of Congress]] involving [[bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] to give companies an option of being protected from creditors. Previous attempts at federal bankruptcy laws had lasted, at most, a few years.&lt;ref&gt;See Debt's Dominion: A History of Bankruptcy Law in America,
David A. Skeel, Jr., Princeton University Press 2001 (sample online at [http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/s7159.html]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its popular name is a homage to the role of Senator [[Knute Nelson]] in its composition.

It was significantly amended by the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1938]] and was superseded by the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1978]].

In [[mathematical sociology]], and especially [[game theory]], the '''bankruptcy problem''' is  a distribution or [[entitlement (fair division)|entitlement]] problem involving the allocation of a given amount of a [[Infinite divisibility#In economics|perfectly divisible]] [[good (economics)|good]] among a group of agents.  The focus is on the case where the amount is insufficient to satisfy all their demands.

Problems of the [[bankruptcy]] type arise in many real life situations.  The [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] example would be that of a bankrupt [[business|firm]] that is to be [[liquidation|liquidated]]. Another  example would be the division of an estate amongst several [[heir]]s, particularly when the estate cannot meet all the deceased’s commitments.

There are at least three simple methods for solving bankruptcy problems in practice, but each is deficient in one or more ways.  The methods are:

# The proportional rule: divide the estate proportionally to each agent's claim.
# The constrained equal-awards rule: divide the estate equally among the agents, ensuring that nobody gets more than their claim.
# The constrained equal-losses rule: divide equally the difference between the aggregate claim and the estate, ensuring that no agent ends up with a negative transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9626">The '''Barcelona Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of International Concern''' is a [[multilateral treaty]] that was concluded at Barcelona on 20 April 1921. Its purpose is to ensure freedom of navigation in waterways (i.e. ports, rivers and artificial canals) which bear international significance. It was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on 8 October 1921.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/treaties/LNTSer/1921/94.html vol. 7, pp. 36-63.]&lt;/ref&gt; It went into effect on 31 October 1922. The convention is still in force.

==Terms of the convention==
The convention merely reaffirmed the statute adopted the day before at a [[League of Nations]] conference held in [[Barcelona]]. Article 1 of the statute defined the term "navigable waterways of international concern" as any waterway that is connected to the sea and traversing through one or more sovereign states. Article 2 stated the convention shall also apply to waterways for which international commissions have been established. Article 3 obligated governments to allow free movement for in its waterways to vessels of any state whose government signed the convention. Article 4 required equal treatment for all nationalities in applying the freedom of navigation. Article 5 allowed some exceptions to the principles of freedom of navigation if a government chose to give priority to its own nationals in certain cases, conditional on the absence of any agreements to the contrary. Article 6 allowed governments to apply their rule of law in waterways under their control. Article 7 prohibited governments to levy any dues for passage in international waterways under their control, except for minimal dues necessary for the maintenance of the said above waterways. Article 8 prohibited governments from levying customs for goods passing through their territories, and stated that the principles of the [[Barcelona Convention and Statute on Freedom of Transit]] shall also apply to maritime navigation. Article 9 obligated governments to grant equal treatment to all foreign nationals in using their ports, with some exceptions. Article 10 obligated the governments controlling waterways to maintain them regularly to allow smooth navigation.

Article 11 dealt with states non signatory of the convention and their rights of use of the waterways. Article 12 stated that in case a waterway is divided between two or more states, the responsibility for the rule of law shall be divided according to territorial division of the waterway itself. Article 13 stated that previously signed agreements on navigation shall remain in force, but requested the governments involved not to implement provisions of such treaties if they conflicted with the convention. Article 14 regulated the work of international navigation commissions. Article 15 allowed exceptions in time of war. Article 16 stated that none of the statute's provisions shall conflict with obligations under the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]].

The '''Boundary Treaty of 1874 between [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]]''', also called the '''Treaty of Sucre''', was signed in [[Sucre]] on August 6, 1874 by the Bolivian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Mariano Baptista]] and the Chilean plenipotentiary minister [[Carlos Walker Martínez]]. It superseded the [[Boundary Treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia]] and it kept the border between both countries at the 24° South parallel from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern border of Chile.

The Treaty abolished the zone of bipartite tax collection on the export dues on minerals found between parallel 23°S and 25°S, and Bolivia promised explicitly in article 4 of the Treaty not to augment the existing taxes for twenty-five years on Chilean capital and industry.

To realize its [[Peruvian Saltpeter Monopoly|Saltpeter Monopoly]], Peru tried fruitless to prevent the signing of the treaty.

In February 1878, Bolivia imposed a new tax upon saltpeter and one year later began the [[War of the Pacific]].

The Treaty of 1874 is of capital importance in the understanding of the causes of the War, because it established the legal position that existed between both countries when that war broke
out.

==Background==

===The 1866 Boundary Treaty===

The 1866 treaty, the first boundary treaty between Bolivia and Chile, stipulated in seven articles:

* The international boundary will, in future, be drawn at the 24th parallel, and will be marked out on the ground "by means of visible and permanent signals — from the Pacific ''to the eastern boundary of Chile''" by experts nominated by both countries.
* Notwithstanding the previous declaration, Chile and Bolivia shall divide between them the export duties paid on Guano and minerals in the zone included between the 23rd and 25th parallels, the ''Mutual Benefits Zone'' (MBZ).
* For the carrying out of this, Bolivia shall set up a custom-house in Mejillones which will be the only one authorized to receive these duties on the exportation of guano and metals from the aforesaid zone. Chile will have the right to nominate fiscal employees -who shall intervene in the counting house department of this aduana with full right of inspection. Bolivia will be conceded an equal right in the event of Chile establishing a custom-house in parallel 24°.
* All exports from the territory situated between the parallels of latitude 23° to 25° (MBZ), with the exception of guano and minerals, to be free from taxation, as will also be the natural production of Chile which may enter the country through Mejillones.
* By common accord between the two governments system will be adopted in the exploitation and sale of guano, and a similar agreement must he come to, to determine the duties on the exportation of minerals.
* Chile and Bolivia bind themselves to mutual preference in the event of the renting of the territories forming the subject matter of the present agreement, and to abstain from ceding them to any nation or individual.
* Eighty thousand pesos, withdrawn from ten percent, of the production of Mejillones will be granted to Bolivian concessionaires in guano exploitation whose, workings were suspended by act of the Chilean Government.

Nevertheless, both countries were dissatisfied with the treaty and looked for a solution.

=== The Lindsey-Corral agreement ===

On 5 December 1872, after difficult talks, Bolivian and Chilean negotiators Corral and Lindsay agreed to a clarification of the treaty of 1866. The Lindsay-Corral Protocol gave Chile the right to appoint customs officers to work alongside their Bolivian counterparts in the condominium zone, stipulated that tax rates could not be modified unilaterally, confirmed Bolivian acceptance of nitrates and borax as products included in the terms of the 1866 treaty, agreed that Bolivia would make a separate account of the amount to be received for taxes not derived from the common zone, and stated that the eastern limits of the common zone would be fixed by experts of both countries, and in case of disagreement, by a third nominated by the Emperor of Brazil. This Protocol was approved by Chile in January 1873.

A new grievance arose in August 1872 as Quintin Quevedo, a Bolivian diplomat, follower of [[Mariano Melgarejo]] who had been toppled as president in 1871, embarked on an expedition from Valparaiso against the Bolivian government, without any effective action of the Chilean authority, despite a warning by the Peruvian and Bolivian consulates about weapons and men on board the ships ''Maria Luisa'' and ''Paquete de Los Vilos''.

Peru, which at that time enjoyed naval supremacy in South Pacific, responded with a naval demonstration in Mejillones, sending there the warships ''[[Huascar (ship)|Huascar]]'' and the ''Chalaco''. Peru's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jose de la Riva Agüero, told the Chilean Government that Peru would not view with indifference the occupation of Bolivian territory by foreign forces.

The Peruvian government saw the Lindsay-Corral Protocol as an increase in the regional influence of Chile and urged Bolivia to reject it, and in fact on May 19, 1873 the Bolivian Assembly postponed approval to 1874. The Bolivian Assembly neither approved nor refused the treaty.

===The increasing tensions between Peru and Chile ===

{{see also|Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|Peruvian Saltpeter Monopoly}}

[[File:Saltpeter fields in 1876.svg|thumb|250px|right|Saltpeter fields (in amber color) of Iquique (Peru), Toco and Carmen (Bolivia) and Aguas Blancas (Chile). "Aguas Blancas" were at that time economically irrelevant. The border Peru-Bolivia was not officially determined, and different maps show different boundary lines.]]

Because of the increasing tensions with Argentina and Peru, the Government of Chile ordered 1871 the purchase of two armored vessels, the ''[[Chilean ironclad Almirante Cochrane|Cochrane]]'' and the ''[[Chilean ironclad Blanco Encalada|Blanco Encalada]]'', which would shift the naval balance in the South Pacific in favor of Chile, but at the end of 1874.

On February 6, 1873, Peru and Bolivia signed the [[Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia]]; the parliamentary proceedings have disappeared since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basadre|1964|p=2278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peru, which had large overseas debts, the economic situation deteriorated and the government imposed in 1873 a state control over production and sales of saltpeter. But there were also nitrate deposits in Bolivia and Chile. While the latter were not economically material, the exports from Bolivia by the Chilean ''Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarriles de Antofagasta'' (CSFA) made Peruvian price controls impossible.

The ''Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarriles de Antofagasta'' (CSFA) was a Chilean company, based in [[Valparaiso]]; a 29% minority share was held by the British [[Anthony Gibbs and Sons]]. From the 1860s the company had exploited the nitrate fields in Antofagasta, with a [[tax exemption]] license of the Bolivian government.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Crozier|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–100}} The CSFA was the only competitor of Peruvian saltpeter in the international markets, and the urgent necessity to maintain the prices of saltpeter and guano brought the Peruvian government to intervene actively in the Bolivian saltpeter policy.

Peruvian historian [[Jorge Basadre]] asserts that the secret treaty and the ''Estanco'' were unrelated to each other, but Hugo Pereira Plascencia has contributed several items of evidences to the contrary: in 1873 the Italian author Pietro Perolari–Malmignati cited the Peruvian interest in defending its saltpeter monopoly against the Chilean production in Bolivia as the main cause of the secret treaty, and also said that the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[José de la Riva-Agüero y Looz Corswaren|José de la Riva-Agüero]] informed the Chilean Minister in Lima, Joaquín Godoy, about negotiations with Bolivia to expand the ''estanco'' in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Pereira Plascencia, [http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/hpereyra/2014/12/31/la-pol-tica-salitrera-del-presidente-manuel-pardo-el-tratado-chileno-boliviano-de-1874-su-violaci-n-y-el-comienzo-de-la-guerra-del-pac-fico/ La política salitrera del presidente Manuel Pardo]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Later, in 1875 the government expropriated the saltpeter industry and a full state monopoly on production and exports of saltpeter was imposed and in 1876 Peru bought Bolivian licences for nitrate fields in El Toco, Bolivia)

As the Peruvian Government knew from the rapprochement of Bolivia and Chile, its Chancellery took action to find some means of provoking the rupture and preventing the Chilean ships from leaving European waters, qualifying the conciliatory attitude of Walker Martinez as a blind and advising to Bolivia break the existing Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basadre|1964|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2281}} Peruvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Riva Agüero wrote in August 1873 to La Torre (Peruvian Plenipotentiary in Bolivia) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulnes|1920|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71–72}}
:''So, then, what Bolivia, ought to do is to waste no more time in time-killing discussions that conduce to nothing save to permit the arming of Chile. If the Government of Bolivia understands its own interests, if it does not want to lost part or the whole of its coast-line, it should utter its last word as regards the Treaty of 1866 and the Lindsay-Corral Convention: and it should definitely break these compacts whether by causing the extraordinary Assembly'to disapprove the one and resolve to substitute the other by reason of the insuperable difficulties which it has met with in practice, or by adopting some other measure conducive to the same end: always however so arranging matters that it is not Bolivia that breaks off relations but Chile that is obliged to do so.''
:''Relations once broken off and a state of war declared, Chile could not obtain possession of her ironclads, and lacking force with which of to attack, advantageously, would find herself in the necessity of accepting the mediation of Peru, which could in case of necessity — be converted into an armed mediation — if the forces of that republic sought to occupy Mejillones und Caracoles.''
:''To the foregoing consideration you may add other which will doubtless determine the decision of the Bolivian Government to adopt the line of conduct indicated. I refer to the practical certainty we have of the adhesion to the alliance of the Argentine Republic.''

In 1874, Peruvian Navy officer [[Miguel Grau]] (Commander of the Navy during the war) advised to the diplomacy of his country the internationalization of the Bolivian province of Antofagasta&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Basadre, "La guerra con Chile", version pdf of the UNJBG/UTI (Universidad Jorge Basadre), Capítulo Primero, page 37. This passage doesn't appeared in the book edition 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the treaty==
{{further information|:wikisource:Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile of 1874}}

In August 1874, Bolivia and Chile substituted the Treaty of 1866 with a new Treaty that kept the 24th degree parallel as the boundary between both countries but ended the Mutual Benefits Zone defined in 1866 between the 23°S and 25°S. Further, Chile relinquished its share of export taxes on minerals shipped from Bolivia, and Bolivia agreed not to raise taxes on Chilean enterprises in Bolivia for 25 years.

Article 4 of the treaty is worded:

{{quote|''The duties of exportation that may be levied on minerals exploited in the zone referred to in the preceding articles shall not exceed those now in force, and Chilean citizens, industry, and capital shall not be subjected to any other contributions what ever except those now existing. The stipulations in this article shall last for twenty-five years.''|Article 4|[[:wikisource:1874 Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile|Chile-Bolivia Boundary Treaty of 1874]]}}

The Treaty of 1874 suffered formidable opposition in Bolivia. The suggestions of Peru had raised the aspirations of the country to such heights that mere peace would not suffice to satisfy them. The Legislative Assembly received the Treaty with violent hostility. There was a moment in which the Government found himself impotent to dominate the current of opposition, especially with reference to Article 4. which wounded the financial policy of Peru, which aimed to monopolize the nitrate production, and among the opposing bands in Congress attempts were made to make an arrangement on the basis of the deletion of this article.

===The complementary protocol===

On June 1875 a complementary protocol to the 1874 treaty was signed in order to amend articles 3 and 10 and incorporate an arbitration clause.

==The breach of the treaty==

In 1876 the Peruvian government bought the saltpeter licenses for "El Toco" fields in Bolivia through an intermediary, [[Henry Meiggs]], the builder of the Peruvian railroads, but also with the involvement of Anthony Gibbs and Sons, the company that would owe Bolivia for the licenses. The picturesque agreement, as Crozier called it, about property would have long standing consequences; it was called "Caso Squire" in the Chilean courts after the war.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In 1876 President Pardo urged Gibbs to ensure the success of the monopoly by limiting the production of the CSFA, and in 1878, Anthony Gibbs and Sons warned the management board of the CSFA that they would get trouble with a "neighbouring Government" [sic] if they insisted on swamping the market with their nitrate.&lt;ref name="Ravest"&gt;Manuel Ravest Mora, ''[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0717-71942008000100003 La Casa Gibbs y el Monopolio Salitrero Peruano, 1876-1878]'', Historia N°41, vol. I, enero-junio 2008: 63-77, ISSN 0073-2435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}

Bolivian historian Querejazu cited George Hicks, manager of the Chilean CSFA, who knew that the highest bidder for the confiscated property of the CSFA on 14 February 1879 would be the Peruvian consul in Antofagasta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Querejazu Calvo|1979|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having surrendered its claim to the disputed territories in return for a Bolivian promise not to increase tax,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sater|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile responded that the treaty did not allow for such a tax hike.&lt;ref name="Collier1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Collier|title=A History of Chile, 1808-1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx8iIxafDVYC|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56827-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia suspended the tax in April 1878. In November Chile proposed a mediation and cautioned that Daza's refusal to cancel the tax would force Chile to declare null the 1874 Treaty. In December 1878 Bolivia, counting in its military alliance with Peru, challenged Chile and said the tax was unrelated to the treaty and that the claim of the CSFA should be addressed in Bolivian courts, and revived the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sater|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the company refused to pay the tax, Bolivia confiscated its property on 11 February and threatened to sell it on 14 February in order to liquidate the tax's debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sater|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces occupied Antofagasta.

Peru, bound with Bolivia by their secret treaty, tried to mediate, but on 1 March 1879 Bolivia declared war on Chile and called on Peru to activate their alliance, while Chile demanded that Peru declare its neutrality. On April 5, after Peru refused this, Chile declared war on both nations. The following day, Peru responded by acknowledging the ''[[casus foederis]]''.

'''''Bączkowski and Others v Poland''''' was a [[European Court of Human Rights]] case which ruled unanimously that the banning of an LGBT pride parade in Warsaw, locally known as the [[Parada Równości]] (equality parade), in 2005 was in violation of Articles [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|11]], [[Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights|13]] and [[Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights|14]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Delivered on May 3, 2007, the ruling was the first which affirmed that banning LGBT [[pride parade]]s goes against the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association.

==Background==
In 2005, the [[President of Warsaw|Mayor of Warsaw]], [[Lech Kaczyński]] (later [[President of Poland]]), refused to allow a gay pride parade to take place through the city, justifying his decision by the fact that the organisers had not submitted a traffic organisation plan, that such a parade would promote a "homosexual lifestyle" in Warsaw, and that he is against "propagating gay orientation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?date=2005/05/20/4&amp;navpath=/channels/pride/ Polish capital bans Pride again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313155353/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?date=2005%2F05%2F20%2F4&amp;navpath=%2Fchannels%2Fpride%2F |date=2007-03-13 }}, [[Gay.com]], 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, on 11 June 2005, approximately 2500 people marched, in defiance of the ban.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4084324.stm Gay marchers ignore ban in Warsaw], ''[[BBC]]'', 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the parade, on 10 June 2005, the organisers appealed to the Governor of the [[Mazowsze Voivodship]], arguing that the city's decision had breached their right to peaceful assembly. The Governor ruled that the city's requirement of a traffic organisation plan had been unlawful and that the parade was unlawfully restricted. Despite this, further proceedings were discontinued considering that the parade had taken place on 11 June 2005.

On 16 December 2005, the organisers of the parade, headed by [[Tomasz Bączkowski]], began a court case against the Republic of Poland at the European Court of Human Rights, alleging that their right to peaceful assembly had been breached and that they had been treated in a discriminatory manner, considering that other marches were allowed to take place on June 11. The ECHR accepted the case on 5 December 2006.

==Judgment==
The European Court of Human Rights ruled that, even though the march still took place, the fact that it was banned by the city authorities represents an infringement of freedom of assembly under [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. Additionally, the ruling affirmed that:

{{quote|The positive obligation of a State to secure genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly was of particular importance to those with unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they were more vulnerable to victimization.}}

The court also stated that Poland had violated Article 14 of the Convention, because other marches which had taken place on the same day were not subject to the same conditions as the gay rights march and were allowed to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-05/03/content_865422.htm European court: Polish ban on gay rights march violates human rights], ''[[China Daily]]'', 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the court ruled that Article 13 of the Convention, relating to the right to an effective remedy, had been violated in that the organisers did not have any legal procedure at their disposal which would have enabled them to appeal the decision before the date on which the march was set to be held.

==Reactions==

The ruling was hailed by LGBT rights groups as a landmark decision for the rights of LGBT people to freedom of assembly. According to [[Robert Biedroń]], the leader of [[Campaign Against Homophobia]], a Polish LGBT rights organisation, the ruling represented a "very important step towards equality for gay and lesbian people in Poland and... also in several other countries in central and eastern Europe."&lt;ref name="queerty"&gt;[http://www.queerty.com/queer/news/poland-gay-march-ban-violates-human-rights-20070504.php Poland Gay March Ban Violates Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061031/http://www.queerty.com/queer/news/poland-gay-march-ban-violates-human-rights-20070504.php |date=September 28, 2007 }}, ''[[Queerty.com]]'', 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Parada_Równości_2006.jpg|thumb|right|Parada Równości 2006]]
[[Michael Cashman]], the head of the [[European Parliament]]'s Intergroup on Gay and Lesbian Rights, stated that:

{{quote|I am extremely pleased by this ruling. It is a vindication of everything that we have been saying about the actions of the Government of Poland against the fundamental freedoms of Polish LGBT men and women.&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4308.html MEPs welcome Pride ban ruling], Pink News, 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sarah Ludford]], a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MEP from the United Kingdom, declared that, "this judgement is extremely important as it is the first time that the European Court of Human Rights has ruled specifically on the question of banning Equality and Gay Pride marches. Its clarification that freedom of assembly applies fully to these events is, while fully expected, nonetheless welcome."&lt;ref name="pinknews" /&gt;

No official reaction has yet been released by the Polish authorities. However, the Secretary of State, Maciej Lopinski, stated that "the president [Lech Kaczynski] may take further action", &lt;ref name="queerty" /&gt; and in 2007 there have been some speculation that the president of Poland may appeal against the verdict (which did not happen).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120206141723/http://www.poland.pl/news/article%2CPolish_gay_activists_win_human_rights_case%2Cid%2C273489.htm Polish gay activists win human rights case], Poland.pl, 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California Redemption Value''' ('''CRV'''), also known as '''California Refund Value''', is a regulatory fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/programinfo/FAQ.htm/|title=Beverage Container Recycling|work=California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery|accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid on [[recyclable]] beverage containers in [[California]]. The fee was established by the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act of 1986 (AB 2020, Margolin), and since 2010 the program is administered by the [[Cal/EPA]] [[California Integrated Waste Management Board|California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)]] (previously administered by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Recycling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/|title=Beverage Container Recycling|work=California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery|accessdate=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bottler pays CRV for beverages with [[aluminum]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[bimetal]] containers and anyone can receive the same amount in exchange for the container by bringing it to a recycling center. The symbol on beverage containers eligible for reimbursement is "CA CRV". Currently, CRV is 5 cents for containers less than {{convert|24|usoz}} and 10 cents for containers {{convert|24|usoz}} or larger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/BevContainer/Retailers/CRVReceipts.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The state also allows recyclers to pay by weight, for which the state also sets a separate minimum price per pound (kg). When redeeming in quantities up to 50 containers, the consumer has the right to be paid by count on request. In larger quantities, the recycler has discretion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/consumers/FAQ.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recyclers have the right to refuse or offer a reduced price for contaminated materials. It is illegal to bring in out of state cans or bottles to California to recoup the CRV and violators can be charged with fraud, a felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California laws on recycling bottles from Nevada|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/california-laws-recycling-bottles-nevada-79351.html|publisher=SFGate.com|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge for California Redemption Value is similar to bottle bill deposits used in other states, but is technically a fee imposed on the distributor of the beverage. The fee tends to be passed along to the retailer and to the consumer via normal market forces. Distributors and retailers usually break out the CRV as a distinct part of the purchase price in [[advertising]] and on receipts (for example the charge for a 50-cent bottle of soda may appear on the receipt as "45 cents plus 5 cents CRV"). 

One way the difference between CRV and a system in which the consumer pays a deposit or tax shows up is that sales tax applies to the CRV amount, if the item is subject to sales tax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boe.ca.gov/pdf/pub53a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  If it were not part of the basic price of the product, sales tax would not apply to it.  Accordingly, when the State of California raised the CRV from $.04 on 2&amp;nbsp;L bottles / $.02 cans to $.08 and $.04, respectively, then again to $.10 and $.05, respectively, it was also raising California's sales tax revenue gained on the imposed fee.

[[Container deposit legislation in the United States|Other states have similar bottle bills/deposit laws]], including Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/|title=Bottle Bill Resource Guide|work=Container Recycling Institute|accessdate=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of beverages==
CRV is paid on the following types of beverages:

* [[Carbonated water|Carbonated]] and noncarbonated [[water]]
* Carbonated and noncarbonated [[soft drink]]s, [[energy drinks]], and [[sport drink]]s
* [[Coffee]] and [[tea]] drinks
* [[Beer]] and other [[malt beverage]]s
* 100% [[fruit juice]] in containers smaller than {{convert|46|usoz}}.&lt;ref name=CRVinOutList&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dor/Documents/CRVinOutList.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010182430/http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dor/Documents/CRVinOutList.pdf# |archive-date=October 10, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Distilled Spirits Coolers (not distilled spirits)
* 100% fruit juice in containers {{convert|46|usoz}} or more&lt;ref name=CRVinOutList/&gt;

The '''Center for Transnational Legal Studies''' (CTLS) is a global educational center for the study of transnational law.&lt;ref name="law.utoronto.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itemPath%3D2%2F2%2F11%2F0%2F0%26contentId%3D1756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610205621/http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itemPath=2%2F2%2F11%2F0%2F0&amp;contentId=1756 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center was founded in London in October 2008 as an initiative by Georgetown University Law Center, providing educational services and student resources. It was constituted as a joint venture between ten leading law schools from around the world, each contributing faculty and students to the center.&lt;ref name="law.utoronto.ca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esade.edu/carreras_universitarias/eng/ged/internacionalidad/ctls&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center's founding institutions are [[Georgetown University Law Center]], [[University of Toronto]],  [[King's College London]],  [[National University of Singapore]], [[ESADE]],  [[Fribourg University]],  [[Free University of Berlin]],  [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[University of Turin, Faculty of Law|University of Torino]],  [[Melbourne Law School]],  and the [[University of São Paulo]].  The Center also has several affiliate institutions, including [[Bucerius Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctls.georgetown.edu/info/index.html#Newctrtranslegal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616153620/http://ctls.georgetown.edu/info/index.html |archivedate=2009-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">'''Citizenship in North Korea''' is a status given to individuals recognized as North Korean by the government of the country. It is a source of shared national identity, but can also be one of contention or conflict.

[[File:DPRK Passport Photo.jpeg|thumb|alt=A photo of a passport belonging to a North Korean.]]

==Nationality law of the DPRK==

{{main article|Nationality law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea}}
[[North Korea]] adopted a nationality law in 1963: 15 years after being founded on September 9, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chin. ''Law of Marriage and Divorce in North Korea'' The International Lawyer (1973): 906–917&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been revised in 1995 and 1999. The nationality law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) governs who is a citizen of the DPRK, and how one may gain or lose such citizenship. It prescribes citizenship qualifications, citizen rights, and citizen protections. While containing just 16 articles, it covers most of the basic features which can be found across modern citizenship legislation in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Chin|title=North Korean Nationality Law|journal=International Lawyer|year=1972|volume=6|issue=2|pages=324|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/intlyr6&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, North Korean nationality law incorporates anyone who resided in the country since the foundation of the DPRK. This includes varied groups due to the DPRK's annexation by Japan and the United States, occupation by the [[Soviet Union]] and final surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945. The law assumes that people registered in North Korea became nationals of North Korea.

===Types of citizenship&lt;ref name="Multiple Citizenship"&gt;{{cite web|last=US Department of State|first=Office of Citizen Consular Services|title=Multiple Citizenship: North Korea|url=http://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_NORTH_KOREA.html|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

====By descent====
''Jus sanguinis'', or the "right of blood," means determining citizenship through the status of a child's parents. Any child born to two North Korean nationals becomes a North Korean citizen. However, if a child is born abroad to one North Korean national and one parent of a different nationality, the citizenship is to be determined by the parents.

====Birthright====
''Jus soli'', or the "right of the soil," is better known as [[birthright citizenship]]. This type of citizenship or nationality is awarded to citizens who are born within the jurisdiction of a given state. In North Korea, birth within the country's borders does not automatically grant a child citizenship, with the exception of a child born in North Korea with "unknown or stateless parents."

====Naturalization====
The process of naturalization involves formal proceedings for acquiring citizenship of a country. It is not guaranteed and can involve a wide variety of stipulations. In North Korea, the status of naturalization is unclear. It can only be granted by the [[Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]], and further specific requirements are unknown.

====Dual citizenship====

The government of North Korea does not recognize dual nationality. However, North Korean citizens who flee to South Korea automatically become [[South Korean citizen]]s. Also, North Korean citizens who defect to South Korea and become South Korean citizens are not allowed to return to North Korea without special permission and approval from the South Korean government.

{{Communalism}}
{{Libertarian socialism|models}}
&lt;!-- This article not linked within: {{Green politics sidebar}}. --&gt;
'''Communalism''' usually refers to a system that integrates communal ownership and [[federation]]s of highly localized independent communities. A prominent [[libertarian socialist]], [[Murray Bookchin]], defines the Communalism political philosophy that he developed as "a theory of government or a system of government in which independent communes participate in a  federation", as well as "the principles and practice of communal ownership". The term 'government' in this case does not imply an acceptance of a State or top-down hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition,1998, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/cmmnl2.mcw.html|title=What is Communalism? The Democratic Dimension of Anarchism |first=Murray |last=Bookchin |authorlink=Murray Bookchin |date=2006-08-27 |website=dwardmac.pitzer.edu|accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This usage of communalism appears to have emerged during the late 20th century to distinguish [[commune (socialism)|commune]]-based systems from other political movements and/or governments espousing (if not actually practicing) similar ideas. In particular, earlier communities and movements advocating such practices were often described as "[[anarchist]]", "[[socialist]]" and/or "[[communist]]".&lt;ref&gt;See for example the following entries in the 1911 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04179a.htm Ryan, J.A. (1908); "Communism"] and [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14069a.htm Ryan, J.A. (1912). "Socialistic Communities"] (Access date: 12 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical communities practicing [[utopian socialism]] or [[anarcho-communism]] did implement internal rules of communalist property ownership in the context of federated communalism. It is at least theoretically possible for a federation of communes to include communes which do not practice communalist rules of property, which is to say, that the overall national government may be a federation of communes, but that [[private property]] rather than communalist property is the order within each such commune. [[Karl Marx]], often viewed as the founder of modern communism, criticized older forms, including [[primitive communism]] and/or utopian socialism, as poorly conceived and/or prone to disintegration in practice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Karl Marx'', Moscow, {{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communalism in the form described above is distinct from the predominant usage in [[South Asia]]n forms of English: allegiance to a particular ethnic and/or religious group rather than to a broader society.&lt;ref&gt;RH Webster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/communalism.htm|title=Communalism|website=www.countercurrents.org|accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this usage is synonymous with [[sectarianism]] and associated with [[communal violence]].

== History ==

=== Communalism in Christianity ===
{{see also|Christian communism#Communism or communalism}}
In this primarily religious-based community, the communist-like principle of ''[[Koinonia]]'' used by the [[Early Christianity|early Christian Church]] as described in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' (4:32–35), which expressed the broad, general principle of "all things in common" (or, in some translations, "everything in common").

Communalistic tendencies were often present in radical [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era [[Christianity|Christian]] movements in Europe. (This was later argued most famously by the Marxian theorist [[Karl Kautsky]]: see, for example, ''Communism in Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1897/europe/index.htm |title=Karl Kautsky: Communism in Central Europe (1897) |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2003-12-23 |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Some features of [[Waldensian]] movement and associated communes in northern Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries followed certain aspects of communal ownership.

Famously, Czech [[Taborites]] (radical section of the [[Hussite]] movement) in the 15th century attempted to build a society of shared property in the city of [[Tábor]] in south [[Bohemia]].

Certain aspects and streams within the [[German Peasants' War]] in German areas of the 16th century, particularly [[Thomas Müntzer]] and the so-called [[Zwickau prophets]] had a strong social egalitarian spirit.

European [[Radical Reformation]] of [[Anabaptist]] and different groups of [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] started processes which later led to communal movements of [[Shakers]] ,  [[Hutterites]] and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eberhardarnold.com/biography.html|title=Biography of Eberhard Arnold|website=www.eberhardarnold.com|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Anabaptist [[Münster Rebellion]] of 1534–1535 attempted to establish a society based on community of goods.

All of these post-Reformation attempts were led by [[biblical literalism]] in which they referred to previously mentioned passages from the Book of Acts. Radicalism of their social experiments was further heightened by [[chiliasm]] and ardent expectation of [[theocracy]].

The [[Plymouth Colony]] was established by Separatist Pilgrims who had travelled from Europe in order to flee religious persecution and establish a religious community separate from the Church of England. The social and legal systems of the colony were tied to their religious beliefs as well as English Common Law. The presence of secular planters ("The Strangers") hired by the London merchant investors who funded their venture led to tension and factionalization in the fledgling settlement, especially because of the policies of land use and profit-sharing, but also in the way each group viewed workdays and holidays. This form of common [[ownership]] was the basis for the contract agreed upon by the venture and its investors. It was more akin to what we now think of as a privately held corporation, as the common ownership of property and profits was insured by the issuing of stock to the settlers and investors. It was also temporary, with a division of the common property and profits scheduled to take place after seven years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n 1620. July 1.
#The adventurers &amp; planters doe agree, that every person that goeth being aged 16. years &amp; upward, be rated at 10li., and ten pounds to be accounted a single share.
#That he that goeth in person, and furnisheth him selfe out with 10li. either in money or other provissions, be accounted as haveing 20li. in stock, and in [th]e devission shall receive a double share.
#The persons transported &amp; [th]e adventurers shall continue their joynt stock &amp; partnership togeather, [th]e space of 7. years, (excepte some unexpected impedimente doe cause [th]e whole company to agree otherwise,) during which time, all profits &amp; benefits that are gott by trade, traffick, trucking, working, fishing, or any other means of any person or persons, remaine still in ye comone stock until [th]e division.
#That at their coming ther, they chose out such a number of fitt persons, as may furnish their ships and boats for fishing upon [th]e sea; imploying the rest in their severall faculties upon ye land; as building houses, tilling, and planting ye ground, &amp; making shuch comodities as shall be most use full for [th]e collonie.
#That at [th]e end of [th]e 7. years, [th]e capitall &amp; profits, viz. the houses, lands, goods and chatles, be equally divided betwixte ye adventurers, and planters; wch done, every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detrimente concerning this adventure.
#Whosoever cometh to [th]e colonie herafter, or putteth any into [th]e stock, shall at the ende of [th]e 7. years be alowed proportionably to [th]e time of his so doing.
#He that shall carie his wife &amp; children, or servants, shall be alowed for everie person now aged 16. years &amp; upward, a single share in [th]e division, or if he provid them necessaries, a duble share, or if they be between 10. year old and 16., then 2. of them to be reconed for a person, both in transportation and division.
#That such children as now goe, &amp; are under ye age of ten years, have noe other shar in [th]e division, but 50. acers of unmanured land.
#That such persons as die before [th]e 7. years be expired, their executors to have their parte or shaff at [th]e division, proportionably to [th]e time of their life in [th]e collonie.
#That all such persons as are of this collonie, are to have their meate, drink, apparell, and all provissions out of [th]e comon stock &amp; goods of [th]e said collonie.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, William, Of Plymouth Plantation, Chapter 6, pp.56–58&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although each family controlled their own home and possessions, corn was farmed on a communal plot of land with the harvest divided equally amongst the settlers.  The secular planters resented having to share their harvest with families whose religious beliefs so sharply conflicted with their own and as a result shirked work and resorted to thievery, whilst the Pilgrims resented the secular planters taking days off for holidays (especially Christmas) and their frequent carousing and revelry which often left them unfit for work. This conflict resulted in a corn production which was insufficient for the needs of the settlement. Because further supplies from their investors were withheld due to a dispute of the agreed upon payments from the settlement, starvation became imminent. As a result, for the planting of 1623, each family was temporarily assigned their own plot of land to tend with the right to keep all that was harvested from that plot, whether it be sufficient or not and all other production responsibilities and the goods produced therefrom would continue to remain as was originally agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, William, Of Plymouth Plantation, Book 2, 1620–1623, pp. 110–186&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-17th century the [[Diggers|True Levellers]], followers of [[Gerrard Winstanley]], believed in the concept of "levelling men's estates" in order to create equality. They also took over [[common land]] for what they believed to be the common good.

==== The Latter Day Saint movement ====

{{Main|Law of Consecration|United Order}}

In the 19th century the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]&lt;ref&gt;This organization was called the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" at this time; other official names were Church of Christ (1829-1834), Church of the Latter Day Saints (1834-1838), then the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" in 1838. Today, multiple groups claim to be the continuation or successor of Smith's original church, the largest of which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Salt Lake City, Utah; see [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to live a form of Christian communalism called the [[Law of Consecration]], using organizations described as the [[United Order]]. This was established under [[Joseph Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first practiced in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] in the early 1830s. This originally helped [[Latter Day Saints]] with settling in Ohio and was to have helped with building and sustaining entire communities in Missouri, including [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], and [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]]. Subsequent events, including the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]], made it impossible for these communities to thrive.

===== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints =====

{{see also|Bishop's storehouse|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism|ZCMI|l2=Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism}}

After the followers of Brigham Young settled in the [[Utah Territory]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) began to establish a series of community [[cooperative]]s, which were collectively called the [[United Order#The United Order as practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|United Order of Enoch]]. This program was used in at least 200 LDS communities, most of them in outlying rural areas, away from the central Mormon settlements.  Most of the cooperatives lasted for only two or three years before returning to a more standard economic system. One of the last United Order cooperatives was located in [[Orderville, Utah|Orderville]], which continued until an 1885 anti-[[polygamy]] law enforcement action under the [[Edmunds Act]] effectively ended it by jailing many of its leaders.

The [[Law of Consecration]] (as expressed via the LDS Church) was an attempt to base income on a families' actual needs and wants, not on their ability to produce. This was to be done through a strictly voluntary [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]]; it was not deemed acceptable to establish economic equality through force (see also [[Agency (LDS Church)]]). The LDS church has never called this practice communism, instead it has formally stated that, due to matters of spirituality, the United Order and communism are materially opposite in purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Communism and all other similar isms bear no relationship whatever to the United Order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits which Satan always devises of the Gospel plan [...]. The United Order leaves every man free to choose his own religion as his conscience directs. Communism destroys man's God-given free agency; the United Order glorifies it. Latter-day Saints cannot be true to their faith and lend aid, encouragement, or sympathy to any of these false philosophies [...]." (Message of the First Presidency, read by [[J. Reuben Clark]] Jr., 112th Annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]], April 6, 1942.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) =====

[[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], also known as the Cutlerites, are a [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|church]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by Alpheus Cutler and headquartered in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri.  It has operated a functioning United Order since 1913.

=== Secular communalist movements ===

Communalist experiments throughout history have often developed bitter animosities as the parties disputed about the exact issues underlying the confusion over definitions discussed above. The [[Paris Commune]] was one such case.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo J. Sánchez, ''Organizing independence: the artists federation of the Paris Commune and its ...'' {{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libertarian communalism" is a severe and historically justified attempt to organize the political sphere fundamentally and democratically and to give it an ethical content. This is more than a political strategy. This is the desire to move from hidden or emerging democratic opportunities to a radical transformation of society, to a communitarian society focused on human needs, satisfying environmental requirements and developing a new ethic based on solidarity. This means a new definition of politics, a return to the primordial Greek meaning - the management of the community or the polis through the general meeting, on which the principal policy directions are formed, relying on reciprocity and solidarity.

Communalism as a political philosophy was first coined by the well-known [[libertarian socialist]] author and activist Murray Bookchin as a political system to complement his environmental philosophy of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of [[left anarchism]], [[Marxism]], [[syndicalism]], and radical ecology. Politically, Communalists advocate a stateless, classless, decentralized society consisting of a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion.

This primary method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed in principle to taking part in electoral politics &amp;ndash; specifically municipal elections &amp;ndash; as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and anti-statist in policy.

== Politics ==

=== Libertarian municipalism ===
{{main|Libertarian municipalism}}
Starting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the [[Municipality|municipal]] level. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power. The best arena to do that is the municipality — the city, town, and village — where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1980 Bookchin used the term "libertarian municipalism", to describe a system in which [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]] institutions of directly [[democracy|democratic]] assemblies would oppose and replace the [[State (polity)|state]] with a confederation of free municipalities. Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers — the municipal confederations and the nation-state — cannot coexist. Communalists hold that this is a method to achieve a liberated society.

Libertarian municipalism is not seen merely as an effort to "take over" city and municipal councils to construct a more "environmentally friendly" government, but also an effort to transform and democratize these structures, to root them in popular assemblies, and to knit them together along confederal lines to appropriate a regional economy. Bookchin summarized this process in the saying "democratize the republic, then radicalize the democracy".

It is a [[dual power]] that contests the legitimacy of the existing state power. Communalists hold that such a movement should be expected to begin slowly, perhaps sporadically, in communities here and there that initially may demand only the ability to alter the structuring of society before enough interlinked confederations exist to demand the outright institutional power to replace the centralized state. The growing tension created by the emergence of municipal confederations would represent a confrontation between the state and the political realms. It is believed this confrontation can be resolved only after Communalism forms the new politics of a popular movement and ultimately captures the imagination of society at large.

=== Confederalism ===

Communalists see as equally important the need for [[confederation]] – the interlining of communities with one another through recallable [[delegates]] mandated by municipal citizens’ assemblies and whose sole functions are coordinative and administrative. This is similar to the system of "nested councils" found in [[participatory politics]].

According to Bookchin, "[[Confederation]] has a long history of its own that dates back to antiquity and that surfaced as a major alternative to the [[nation-state]]. From the American Revolution through the French Revolution and the Spanish Revolution of 1936, confederalism constituted a major challenge to state centralism". Communalism is seen to add a radically democratic dimension to the contemporary discussions of confederation (e.g. [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]) by calling for confederations not of nation-states but of municipalities and of the neighborhoods of large cities as well as towns and villages.

=== Policy and administration ===
Communalists make a clear distinction between the concepts of ''policy'' and ''administration''. This distinction is seen as fundamental to Communalist principles.

[[Policy]] is defined by being made by a community or neighborhood assembly of free citizens; [[administration (government)|administration]] on the other hand, is performed by confederal councils a level up from the local assemblies which are composed of mandated, recallable [[delegates]] of wards, towns, and villages. If particular communities or neighborhoods –or a minority grouping of them– choose to go their own way to a point where human rights are violated or where ecological destruction is permitted, the majority in a local or regional confederation would have the right to prevent such practices through its confederal council. This is explained not as a denial of democracy but the assertion of a shared agreement by all to recognize [[civil rights]] and maintain the ecological integrity of a region.

Policy-making remains local, but its administration is vested in the confederal network as a whole. The [[confederation]] is intended to be a community of communities based on distinct [[human rights]] and ecological imperatives.

=== Participation in currently existing political systems ===
One of the core distinctions between [[left anarchism]] and Communalism is that Communalists are not opposed in principle to taking part in currently existing political institutions until such a time as it is deemed unnecessary. Communalists see no issues with supporting candidates or political parties in local electoral politics—especially municipal elections—as long as prospective candidates are [[libertarian socialist]] and [[anti-statist]] in policy. The particular goal of this process is to elevate Communalists (or those sympathetic to Communalism) to a position of power so as to construct face-to-face municipal assemblies to maximize [[direct democracy]] and make existing forms of [[representative democracy]] increasingly irrelevant.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Economics ==
{{See also|Criticism of capitalism}}
Communalists are heavily critical of the market economy and capitalism. Believing that these systems destroy the environment by creating a 'grow or die' mentality and creating a large population of [[Social alienation|alienated]] citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communalismpamphlet.net|title=Communalism: A Liberatory Alternative|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They propose abolition of the market economy and money and replaces it with a [[Decentralized planned economy|decentralised planned economy]] controlled by local municipalities and [[Cooperative|cooperatives]].

In such a municipal economy – confederal, interdependent, and rational by ecological, not only technological, standards – Communalists hold that the special interests that divide people today into workers, professionals, managers, capitalist owners and so on would be melded into a general interest (a ''social'' interest) in which people see themselves as citizens guided strictly by the needs of their community and region rather than by personal proclivities and vocational concerns.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;Brown, L. Susan. '[[The Politics of Individualism]],' Black Rose Books (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="work"&gt;Brown, L. Susan.  [http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/brown/sp001735.html Does Work Really Work? ]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, it is hoped, [[citizenship]] would come into its own, and rational as well as ecological interpretations of the public good would supplant [[Class (social)|class]] and hierarchical interests.

== Views on cities ==
Communalists are heavily critical of modern cities, citing urban sprawl, suburbanisation, car culture, traffic congestion, [[noise pollution]] and other negative externalities as having severe effects on the local environment and society as a whole. Communalists propose to run cities democratically and confederally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The '''Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene Publications''' is a 1923 [[League of Nations]] anti-[[pornography]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] that was initially negotiated and concluded in [[Geneva]]. It was amended by a 1947 Protocol and as of 2013 has 56 state parties.

The treaty was concluded on 12 September 1923 as the '''International Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene Publications''' and entered into force on 7 August 1924. It was intended to supplement the 1910 [[Agreement for the Suppression of the Circulation of Obscene Publications]]. By the 1923 Convention, states agreed to criminalise the production, possession, importation, exportation, trade, advertisement, or display of "obscene writings, drawings, prints, paintings, printed matter, pictures, posters, emblems, photographs, cinematograph films or any other obscene objects".

On 20 October 1947, a Protocol to the Convention was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] as [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] 126 (II)2. On 12 November 1947, a [[United Nations]] conference at [[Lake Success, New York]] approved the Protocol and opened it for signature. One amendment that the Protocol made was dropping the word "International" from the name of the Convention.

As of 2013, the amended Convention has 56 state parties. The unamended Convention remains in force for one state, [[Zimbabwe]]. [[Denmark]] (1968), [[Germany]] (1974), and the [[Netherlands]] (1986, solely for the Kingdom in Europe) have denounced the Convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105833">'''Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals''' (DACA) is an [[Immigration to the United States|American immigration policy]] that allows some individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to receive a renewable two-year period of [[deferred action]] from [[deportation]] and become eligible for a [[work permit]] in the U.S. To be eligible for the program, recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. Unlike the proposed [[DREAM Act]], DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients, known as Dreamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youngro|first1=Lee|title=To Dream or Not to Dream: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act|journal=Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy|date=Fall 2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=8, 9|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&amp;context=cjlpp|accessdate=12 February 2018|ref=CornJournal|quote=The DREAM Act is a bipartisan Congressional effort to allow certain illegal alien students who were brought into the U.S. as a child the opportunity to attend college and eventually to become permanent residents and citizens of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the DREAM Act and who are DREAMers?|url=https://www.lawlogix.com/what-is-the-dream-act-and-who-are-dreamers/|website=LawLogix|publisher=Hyland|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, an [[Presidential memorandum|executive branch memorandum]], was announced by President [[Barack Obama]] on June 15, 2012. [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012.

In November 2014, President Obama announced his intention to [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans|expand DACA to cover additional illegal immigrants]]. Multiple states immediately sued to prevent the expansion which was ultimately [[United States v. Texas|blocked by an evenly divided Supreme Court]]. Under President Trump the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] rescinded the expansion on June 16, 2017, while continuing to review the existence of the DACA program as a whole. Plans to phase out DACA were announced by the [[Trump Administration]] on September 5, 2017; implementation was put on hold for six months to allow Congress time to pass the Dream Act or some other legislative protection for Dreamers. Congress failed to act and the time extension expired on March 5, 2018, but the phase-out of DACA has been put on hold by several courts.

Research has shown that DACA increased the wages and employment status of DACA-eligible immigrants, and improved the mental health outcomes for DACA participants and their children. It also reduced the number of illegal immigrant households living in poverty. DACA has not been shown to have any major adverse impacts on the employment of native-born workers. Most economists say that DACA is a net benefit to the U.S. economy.

In August 2018, USCIS estimated there were 699,350 active DACA recipients residing in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/DACA_Population_Data_August_31_2018.pdf|title=Approximate Active DACA Recipients: Country of Birth As of August 31, 2018|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2018|website=United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immigration researchers estimate the population to be between 690,000 and 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/|title=Key facts about unauthorized immigrants enrolled in DACA|last=Lopez|first=Gustavo|date=September 25, 2017|website=Pew Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/the-facts-on-daca/|title=The Facts on DACA|last=Robertson|first=Lori|date=January 22, 2018|website=FactCheck.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2018, District Court Judge [[Andrew Hanen]] ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional. However, he let the program remain in place as litigation proceeds.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/31/643814735/texas-judge-says-daca-is-probably-illegal-but-leaves-it-in-place|title=Texas Judge Says DACA Is Probably Illegal, But Leaves It In Place|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068-0.pdf|title=Texas v.

==Background==
The policy was created after acknowledgment that "Dreamer" students had been largely raised in the United States, and this was seen as a way to remove immigration enforcement attention from "low priority" individuals with good behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stottlemyre|first=Scott|year=2015|title=Strict Scrutiny for Illegal Childhood Arrivals|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3680406481/strict-scrutiny-for-undocumented-childhood-arrivals|journal=The Journal of Gender, Race, and Justice|volume=18|issue=1|pages=289+|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Some databases give 'illegal' in the title, others 'undocumented'.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2017-09-05/trump-ends-daca-program/print/|title=Trump Ends DACA Program|last=Tuma|first=Mary|date=September 5, 2017|work=Austin Chronicle|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dreamers" get their name from the [[DREAM Act]], a bill that aimed to grant legal status to young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. The illegal immigrant student population was rapidly increasing; approximately 65,000 illegal immigrant students graduate from U.S. high schools on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Angela Adams &amp; Kerry S.

The DREAM Act bill, which would have provided a pathway to permanent residency for illegal immigrants brought to the United States upon meeting certain qualifications, was considered by Congress in 2007. It failed to overcome a bipartisan filibuster in the Senate.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/dream-act-daca-trump-congress-dreamers.html|title=After 16 Futile Years, Congress Will Try Again to Legalize 'Dreamers'|last=Alcindor|first=Yamiche|date=September 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 6, 2017|last2=Stolberg|first2=Sheryl Gay|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered again in 2011.

President [[Barack Obama]] announced this policy with a speech in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] on June 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-immigration|title=Remarks by the President on Immigration|date=June 15, 2012|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date was chosen as the 30th anniversary of ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision barring public schools from charging illegal immigrant children tuition. The policy was officially established by a memorandum from the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] titled "Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf|title=Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children|last=Napolitano|first=Janet|date=June 15, 2012|work=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and obtain work permits for a period of two years—renewable upon good behavior. To apply, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, must have come to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, and must have lived in the U.S. since 2007. In August 2012, the [[Pew Research Center]] estimated that up to 1.7 million people were eligible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/08/14/up-to-1-7-million-illegal-immigrant-youth-may-benefit-from-new-deportation-rules/|title = Up to 1.7 million illegal immigrants may benefit from new deportation rules|date = August 14, 2012|accessdate = November 21, 2014|website = |publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]|last = Jeffrey S.

[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{As of|2016|June}}, USCIS had received 844,931 initial applications for DACA status, of which 741,546 (88%) were approved, 60,269 (7%) were denied, and 43,121 (5%) were pending.

===Reaction===
[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leaders denounced the DACA program as an abuse of executive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/us/us-to-stop-deporting-some-illegal-immigrants.html|title = Obama to permit young migrants to remain in U.S.|last = Preston|first = Julia|date = June 15, 2012|work = [[The New York Times]]|accessdate = November 21, 2014|last2 = Cushman, Jr.|first2 = John H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all Republicans in the House of Representatives (along with three Democrats) voted 224–201 to defund DACA in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fusion.net/justice/story/immigration-reform-hopeful-cringe-house-gop-votes-defund-15334# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224000722/http://fusion.net/justice/story/immigration-reform-hopeful-cringe-house-gop-votes-defund-15334# |archive-date=2014-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead author of the amendment Rep.

DACA was formally initiated by a policy memorandum sent from [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Janet Napolitano]] to the heads of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE). The memo formally directed them to exercise their [[enforcement discretion]] on behalf of individuals who met the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf|title = Exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals who came to the United States as children|date = June 15, 2012|accessdate = November 21, 2014|website = |publisher = [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]|last = Napolitano|first = Janet|authorlink = Janet Napolitano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To apply for DACA, eligible individuals must pay a $495 application fee, submit several forms, and produce documents showing they meet the requirements. They do not need [[legal representation]].

===Eligibility===
To be eligible, recipients must have entered the United States before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007, be currently in school, a high school graduate or be honorably discharged from the military, be under the age of 31 {{as of|2012|June|15|lc=y|df=US}}, and not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three other misdemeanors, or otherwise pose a threat to national security. The program does not currently provide permanent lawful status or a path to [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]],&lt;ref name="uscis" /&gt; nor does it provide eligibility for federal welfare or student aid.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In August 2012, the [[Migration Policy Institute]] estimated that as many as 1.76 million people could be eligible for DACA. Of those, 28% were under 15 and would have to wait until reaching that age to apply. In addition, roughly 20% did not meet any of the education criteria, but could become eligible by enrolling in a program before submitting their application. 74% of the eligible population was born in [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]]. Smaller proportions came from [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]] (11%), [[Asia]] (9%), and the rest of the world (6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/DACA-deferred-action-DREAMers | title=Relief from Deportation: Demographic Profile of the DREAMers Potentially Eligible under the Deferred Action Policy | publisher=[[Migration Policy Institute]] | date=August 2012 | accessdate=November 21, 2014 | author=Jeanne Batalova and Michelle Mittelstadt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uscis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca|title=Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate=December 2, 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for DACA, applicants must meet the following major requirements, although meeting them does not guarantee approval:
* Came to the United States before their 16th birthday
* Have lived continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007
* Were under age 31 on June 15, 2012 (born on June 16, 1981 or after)
* Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making their request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS
* Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012
* Have completed [[high school]] or a [[General Educational Development|GED]], have been [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]], or are enrolled in school
* Have not been convicted of a [[felony]] or serious [[misdemeanor]]s, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety

To show proof of qualification (verify these requirements), applicants must submit three forms; I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; and I-765WS Worksheet, as well as supporting documentation.&lt;ref name="uscis"/&gt;

{{quote|text=}}

=== Travel eligibility ===
In addition to the $495 application fee, if a DACA qualifying immigrant wants to travel abroad there is an additional fee and application requirement.

Form I-131 Application Type D*, with a fee of $575 needs to be submitted to USCIS.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-131|title=Application for Travel Document|newspaper=USCIS|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form I-131 must also be submitted by anyone that applies for a [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]] or other residency option regardless of how they arrived upon U.S. soil.

To receive [[advance parole]] one must travel abroad for an educational, employment, or humanitarian purpose. This must be indicated on the Form I-131 as described below:
* Educational purposes, such as studying abroad;
* Employment purposes, such as overseas positions, interviews, training, or meetings with clients; or
* Humanitarian purposes, such as travel for medical reasons, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit a sick relative.
Travel for leisure is not a valid purpose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Renewals ===
USCIS released the process for DACA renewals in June 2014 and directed applicants to file their documents during a 30-day window starting 150 days before the expiration of their previous DACA status. Renewing requires an additional $495 fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/07/08-daca-renewals-ramp-up-svajlenka-singer|title=DACA renewals ramp up|last=Nicole Prchal Svajlenka and Audrey Singer|date=July 8, 2014|website=|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2016|June|}}, there had been 606,264 renewal cases, with 526,288 approved, 4,703 denied and 75,205 renewals pending.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Expansion ===
In November 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced [[Immigration reform#Obama's executive actions of November 2014|changes to DACA]] which would expand it to include illegal immigrants who entered the country prior to 2010, eliminate the requirement that applicants be younger than 31 years old, and lengthen the renewable deferral period to two years. The Pew Research Center estimated that this would increase the number of eligible people by about 330,000.&lt;ref name="pewresearch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/20/those-from-mexico-will-benefit-most-from-obamas-executive-action/|title=Those from Mexico will benefit most from Obama's executive action|last=Jens Manuel Krogstad and Jeffrey S.

However, in December 2014, Texas and 25 other states, all with Republican governors, sued in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] asking the court to enjoin implementation of both the DACA expansion and [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans]] (a similar program).&lt;ref name="zargham1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zargham|first=Mohammad|title=Obama's immigration action blocked again; Supreme Court only option left|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/10/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKCN0SZ04W20151110|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/us/executive-action-on-immigration-prompts-texas-to-sue.html|title = 17 states suing on immigration|date = December 3, 2014|accessdate = February 27, 2015|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|publisher = |last = David Montgomery and Julia Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="texasattorneygeneral1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/files/20141203Multi-stateImmigrationOrderLawsuit%281%29.pdf |title=Texas et. al. v.

Hanen]] issued a preliminary [[injunction]] blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, ''[[Texas v. United States]]'', proceeded.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uclalawreview58"/&gt;  After progressing through the court system, the appeals court ruled 2–1 in favor of enjoining the DACA expansion.  When the Obama administration appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], Justice Antonin Scalia's untimely death left an 8 justice court, which then ruled equally divided (4–4) for and against the injunction.  Procedural rules of the Court in the case of a tie would mean that no opinion would be written, no precedent would be set by the Supreme Court in the case, and that the appellate court's ruling would stand.&lt;ref name="NYTJune24"/&gt;

The court's temporary injunction does not affect the existing DACA. Individuals may continue to come forward and request an initial grant of DACA or renewal of DACA under the guidelines established in 2012.&lt;ref name="uscis" /&gt;

=== Crime ===
According to FactCheck.org, "there is no evidence that DACA holders are more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens."

Fact-checkers note that, on a large scale or in the long run, there is no reason to believe that DACA recipients have a major deleterious effect on American workers' employment chances; to the contrary, some economists say that DACA benefits the overall U.S. economy.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/sep/10/louise-slaughter/would-trumps-decision-daca-hurt-new-yorks-economy/|title=What's the economic impact of ending DACA?|work=@politifact|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/09/08/dacas-end-would-hurt-economy-hiring/638835001/|title=DACA's end would hurt economy, hiring|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have warned that ending DACA could adversely affect the U.S. economy, and that "most economists see immigration generally as an ''economic boon''."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Almost all economists reject [[Jeff Sessions]]' claim that DACA "denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Sessions' claim is rooted in what economists call the "[[Lump of labour fallacy|lump of labor fallacy]]" (i.e., the idea that there is a limit to amount of work force available in any economy).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Tracy Jan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/06/white-house-claims-dreamers-take-jobs-away-from-blacks-and-hispanics-heres-the-truth/|title=Analysis: White House claims 'dreamers' take jobs away from blacks and Hispanics.

A 2016 study in the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'' found that DACA increased [[labor force participation]] and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of illegal immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to [[University of California, Davis]] economist [[Giovanni Peri]], DACA consequently "increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend.

According to one survey, 91 percent of DACA registrants are employed, and 5 percent have launched their own businesses, compared to 3.1 percent of all Americans.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20170908/281814284019119|title=Analysts Say Ending DACA would Hurt Economy, Hiring|last=Davidson|first=Paul|date=September 8, 2017|work=USA Today|publisher=PressReader|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Giovanni Peri]], ending DACA would bring a net loss in [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], given that, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, the U.S. economy is close to [[full employment]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/daca-dreamers/|title=What is Daca and who are the Dreamers?|work=The Telegraph|access-date=September 6, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ike Brannon and Logan Albright of the [[CATO Institute]] wrote in a 2017 that ending DACA would have an adverse economic and fiscal impact, estimating that the cost of immediately eliminating DACA and deporting those who received deferred action would be $283 billion over a decade (representing an economic loss of $215 billion, a fiscal loss of $60 billion (from lower net tax revenue), and $7.5 billion in deportation costs).&lt;ref name="Cato"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ike Brannon and Logan Albright|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-daca|title=The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA|publisher=Cato Institute|date=January 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brannon and Albright wrote that their projections were "a conservative estimate due to the fact that many DACA immigrants are young and still acquiring education credentials that will boost wages later."&lt;ref name="Cato"/&gt; The Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated that deporting DACA-eligible individuals would reduce Social Security and Medicare tax revenue by $24.6 billion over a decade.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Peri argues that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they be deported is economically counterproductive.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A 2017 study by the [[Center for American Progress]] estimated that the loss of all DACA-eligible workers would reduce U.S. [[GDP]] by $433 billion over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/05/daca-deportations-could-cost-us-economy-more-than-400-billion.html|title=DACA deportations could cost US economy more than $400 billion|last=Schoen|first=John W.|date=September 5, 2017|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Silva Mathema|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/01/09/296125/ending-daca-will-cost-states-billions-of-dollars/|title=Ending DACA Will Cost States Billions of Dollars|publisher=Center for American Progress|date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economist Pia Orrenius, due to their risk of deportation, it is likely that previously DACA-protected individuals would slip into the shadow economy or take low-profile jobs that pay less.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that DACA likely led to greater productivity by increasing the college attendance and employment of DACA-eligible individuals.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuka|first=Elira|last2=Shenhav|first2=Na'ama|last3=Shih|first3=Kevin|date=February 2018|title=Do Human Capital Decisions Respond to the Returns to Education? Evidence from DACA|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 24315 |doi=10.3386/w24315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Research has shown mixed findings for DACA on education outcomes. A 2016 study in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' found that DACA had no significant effect on the likelihood of attending school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The study only found "suggestive evidence that DACA pushed over 25,000 DACA-eligible individuals into obtaining their GED certificate in order to be eligible for DACA."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, research by Roberto G. Gonzales, professor of education at Harvard University, showed that DACA led to increased educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/9/2/16244380/daca-benefits-trump-undocumented-immigrants-jobs|title=DACA's beneficiaries landed good jobs, enrolled in college, and contributed to society|work=Vox|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] paper found that DACA led to greater high school attainment and college attendance for DACA-eligible individuals.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

A 2016 study in the ''[[Journal of Population Economics]]'' found that DACA "reduced the probability of school enrollment of eligible higher-educated individuals, as well as some evidence that it increased the employment likelihood of men, in particular. Together, these findings suggest that a lack of authorization may lead individuals to enroll in school when working is not a viable option."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amuedo-Dorantes|first=Catalina|last2=Antman|first2=Francisca|date=2017-01-01|title=Schooling and labor market effects of temporary authorization: evidence from DACA|journal=Journal of Population Economics|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=339–73|doi=10.1007/s00148-016-0606-z|pmid=28690364|pmc=5497855|issn=0933-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the rescinding and subsequent reimplementation of DACA has affected college students dramatically. The primary effects are psychological and educational in nature. The first way it does so is the general stress that comes along with having an uncertain legal status, in fact 70.9% of DACA recipients strongly agree that they worry about the future of the program&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Enriquez, Laura E., et al. "Deconstructing Immigrant Illegality: A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Stress and Health Among Undocumented College Students." ''Race &amp; Social Problems'', vol. 10, no. 3, Sept. 2018, p. 193. {{doi|10.1007/s12552-018-9242-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many recipients have spoken about how their DACA status gives them anxiety because of fear for the unknown&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. This can then affect their education because individuals take that uncertainty and apply it to how much effort they should be putting into their school work. Thus, without knowing if they will be deported at any moment many DACA students reduce the amount of time they spend doing coursework, and some even drop out in favor of earning money at a job. A recent study shows the compound effect of being at a four-year university vs. a community college with 7.3% increase in dropout rates&lt;ref&gt;Hsin, Amy and Francesc Ortega. “The Effects of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on the Educational Outcomes of Undocumented Students.” ''Demography'', vol. 55, no. 4, Aug. 2018, pp. 1487–1506. ''EBSCOhost'', {{doi|10.1007/s13524-018-0691-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only does this status make individuals less likely to finish their undergraduate degree, but it can even stop students from pursuing a graduate degree, especially in terms of funding&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, Susana M., and Darsella Vigil. “Interrogating Racist Nativist Microaggressions and Campus Climate: How Undocumented and DACA College Students Experience Institutional Legal Violence in Colorado.” ''Journal of Diversity in Higher Education'', May 2018. ''EBSCOhost'', {{doi|10.1037/dhe0000078}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The psychological effects of this status also becomes a barrier for DACA students in their college experience, largely because of the uncertainty that the status carries. Many reported high rates of extreme stress and anxiety as compared to their documented counterparts&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Also, the internalizing of the label "illegal" made it so that these individuals saw themselves as less human. In certain cases this meant more instances of self-harm and even suicide in some cases&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, R. G. "No Place to Belong: Contextualizing Concepts of Mental Health among Undocumented Immigrant Youth in the United States." ''American behavioral scientist (Beverly Hills)'' 57.8 (2013): 1174-99. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Health ===
A 2017 study published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' found that DACA led to improved mental health outcomes for the children of DACA-eligible mothers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainmueller|first=Jens|last2=Lawrence|first2=Duncan|last3=Martén|first3=Linna|last4=Black|first4=Bernard|last5=Figueroa|first5=Lucila|last6=Hotard|first6=Michael|last7=Jiménez|first7=Tomás R.|last8=Mendoza|first8=Fernando|last9=Rodriguez|first9=Maria I.|date=August 31, 2017|title=Protecting unauthorized immigrant mothers improves their children's mental health|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/08/30/science.aan5893|journal=Science|volume=357|issue=6355|language=en|pages=1041–44|doi=10.1126/science.aan5893|issn=0036-8075|pmid=28860206|pmc=5990252|bibcode=2017Sci...357.1041H}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[The Lancet|''Lancet Public Health'']] study found that DACA-eligible individuals had better mental health outcomes as a result of their DACA eligibility.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataramani|first=Atheendar S|last2=Shah|first2=Sachin J|last3=O'Brien|first3=Rourke|last4=Kawachi|first4=Ichiro|last5=Tsai|first5=Alexander C|title=Health consequences of the US Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration programme: a quasi-experimental study|journal=The Lancet Public Health|volume=2|issue=4|pages=e175–81|doi=10.1016/s2468-2667(17)30047-6|pmid=29253449|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in the journal ''[[Social Science &amp; Medicine|Social Sciences &amp; Medicine]]'' found that DACA-eligible individuals who transitioned from illegal to legal status had improved psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', summarizing the findings of past research, wrote that "the threat of deportation alone would likely have a negative impact on families. Immigration-related stress and anxiety have been shown to have negative health effects... Generally, researchers believe the stress that stems from the fear of having a parent deported has far-reaching, negative effects on the health of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-end-of-daca-will-ripple-through-families-and-communities|title=The End Of DACA Will Ripple Through Families And Communities|last=Barry-Jester|first=Anna Maria|date=2017-09-06|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial for the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'', Atheendar S. Venkataramani, professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Alexander C. Tsai, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, wrote, "The evidence clearly indicates that rescinding DACA will have profound adverse population-level effects on mental health... DACA was never intended to be a public health program, but its population-level consequences for mental health have been significant and rival those of any large-scale health or social policies in recent history. Rescinding DACA therefore represents a threat to public mental health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataramani|first=Atheendar S.|last2=Tsai|first2=Alexander C.|date=2017-09-13|title=Dreams Deferred – The Public Health Consequences of Rescinding DACA|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=0|issue=18|pages=1707–09|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1711416|issn=0028-4793|pmid=28902574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

21 percent of DACA-protected immigrants work in education and health services.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The American Medical Association has estimated that under DACA or similar legislation, 5,400 additional physicians would work in the United States in coming decades, alleviating a projected shortage of primary care physicians.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Migration flows ===
A 2016 study published in the journal ''International Migration'' found that DACA did not significantly impact the number of apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from Central America.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amuedo-Dorantes|first=Catalina|last2=Puttitanun|first2=Thitima|date=August 1, 2016|title=DACA and the Surge in Unaccompanied Minors at the US–Mexico Border|journal=International Migration|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=102–17|doi=10.1111/imig.12250|issn=1468-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report assessing the reasons behind the surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America did not mention DACA, and cited crime and lack of economic opportunity as the main reasons behind the surge.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

=== Safety and privacy ===
After The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was repealed, a concern for safety became prominent in illegal alien families. In a study from PRI's The World, Caitlin Patler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=jcl_jccc&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A515326535&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=DACA recipients saw their mental health improve.

They think about the personal information they have given the government and worry that they will be deported or unable to work or study, she says. "These young people cannot count on the promise of the future." Many DACA recipients believe safety to be a prominent issue since the repeal of the act. In another journal by US Official News,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=jcl_jccc&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A503854818&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=How DACA affected the mental health of undocumented young adults|last=|first=|date=September 9, 2017|work=US Official News|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is revealed that "almost 800,000 youth trusted the government with their "fingerprints" and other personal information when they applied for DACA. In return, the two-year reprieve from deportation lifted the constant, everyday fear of existence that characterized their lives. These mental health gains, in addition to the fruits of all of their hard work over the past five years, are now threatened."

==Legal challenges to DACA==
{{see also|United States v. Texas}}
The legality of DACA and its proposed expansions were challenged in court. But only the expansions were halted under a preliminary injunction. Legal experts are divided as to the constitutionality of DACA, but no court has yet to rule it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/11/eric-schneiderman/has-daca-been-ruled-unconstitutional/|title=Have courts ruled on DACA's constitutionality?|work=@politifact|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of challenges against DACA was filed in August 2012 by ten agents from the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/08/23/159926481/immigration-employees-file-suit-against-obamas-new-immigration-policy |title=Immigration Employees File Suit Against Obama's New Immigration Policy |first=Corey |last=Dade |date=August 23, 2012 |newspaper=[[NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that following the new lenient deportation policies established by DACA required them to violate the law. Almost a year later, Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] from the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide on what essentially was a dispute between federal employees and their employer, the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="llorente-fn-2012"&gt;{{cite new |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/01/judge-dismisses-immigration-agents-lawsuit-against-obama-program-to-suspend.html |title=Judge Dismisses ICE Agents' Lawsuit Challenging Obama's Deferred Action |publisher=[[Fox News]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Llorente |date=August 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in his decision to dismiss the case, the judge reiterated his view that DACA was inherently unlawful.&lt;ref name="llorente-fn-2012" /&gt; The plaintiffs then filed an appeal but the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] upheld the dismissal on procedural grounds.

The first challenge against the DACA expansions was filed by Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], in November 2014. In the lawsuit, Arpaio claimed that DACA and its expansions were "unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, and invalid under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] as, in effect, regulations that have been promulgated without the requisite opportunity for public notice and comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/16/sherriff-arpaio-lacks-standing-to-challenge-obama-immigration-initiatives/|title=Sheriff Arpaio lacks standing to challenge Obama immigration initiatives |first=Jonathan |last=Adler |date=August 16, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] promptly dismissed the lawsuit ruling that Arpaio did not have [[standing (law)|standing]]. That decision was upheld unanimously by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] on August 14, 2015. Arpaio then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but on January 19, 2016, the court denied that request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/legal-challenges-executive-action-on-immigration |title=Understanding the Legal Challenges to Executive Action |publisher=[[American Immigration Council]] |date=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge that was granted a preliminary injunction was filed on December 2014 by Texas and 25 other states—all with Republican governors.

At the time, individuals were allowed to continue to come forward and request an initial grant of DACA or renewal of DACA under the guidelines established in 2012.&lt;ref name="uscis" /&gt;

Regardless of the outcome of the preliminary injunction, legal opinions on the lawfulness of DACA are divided. In ''[[United States v. Texas]]'', for instance, the Obama administration argued that the policy was a lawful exercise of the enforcement discretion that Congress delegated to the executive branch in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]], which charges the executive with the administration and enforcement of the country's immigration laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/road-citizenship/are-states-coordinating-trump-administration-take-down-daca |title=Are States Coordinating With the Trump Administration to Take Down DACA? We Aim to Find Out. |first=Michael |last=Tan |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |date=August 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Jay Sekulow]], Chief Counsel of the [[American Center for Law and Justice]], opined that DACA was unlawful by asserting that it unconstitutionally usurped Congress' role over immigration by illegally allowing certain classes of illegal aliens to violate U.S. immigration law with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://aclj.org/immigration/end-of-an-error-dealing-with-daca-from-the-proper-perspective |title=End of an Error: Dealing With DACA From the Proper Perspective |first=Jay |last=Sekulow |date=September 6, 2017 |publisher=[[American Center for Law and Justice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2018, a coalition of 7 States, led by [[Texas]], filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the program, after originally promising to challenge the program if the administration didn't rescind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/05/01/texas-and-six-other-states-sue-end-daca/|title=Texas and 6 other states sue to end DACA|last=Platoff|first=Emma|date=May 1, 2018|work=Texas Tribune|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2018, District Court Judge [[Andrew Hanen]] ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional, however he let the program remain in place as litigation proceeds.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==State and city responses==
{{missing information|section|the quantitative and qualitative differences between the states that support DACA and those that oppose it|date=September 2017}}
State-level government officials are also divided on the issue. Those that support DACA claim that the government does not have the resources to target all illegal immigrants and that the policy thus helps federal agencies in exerting prosecutorial discretion—that is, [[selective enforcement|in enforcing the law selectively]] by focusing limited resources on criminal immigrants rather than on non-criminal ones such as those eligible for DACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/27/us/politics/dreamers-trump-lawsuit.html |title='Dreamer' Plan That Aided 800,000 Immigrants Is Threatened |first=Miriam |last=Jordan |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theweek.com/articles/723056/obamas-original-sin-daca |title=Obama's original sin on DACA |first=Edward |last=Morrissey |date=September 7, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that oppose the policy, however, claim that states would be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on health care, education, law enforcement, and other public benefits associated with the immigrants receiving relief.&lt;ref name="masters-cfr-2016" /&gt; For instance, DACA opponents claim that Texas could assume up to $500 million in administrative costs for issuing new driver's licenses.&lt;ref name="masters-cfr-2016" /&gt;

Arizona became the first state to oppose President Obama's order for DACA when Governor [[Jan Brewer]] issued an order blocking those with deferred status from receiving any state benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=David|title=Jan Brewer Signs Executive Order Denying State Benefits to Children of illegal immigrants|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/jan-brewer-executive-order_n_1785482.html|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shoichet|first=Catherine E.|title=Driver's license rules fuel new immigration debate|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/us/states-immigration-policy/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as eligible and approved applicants would still be unable to obtain a driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eng|first=James|title=Arizona Gov.

[[Mayor of Chicago]] [[Rahm Emanuel]] stated that he wants to make [[Demographics of Chicago|Chicago]] the "most immigrant-friendly city in the country".&lt;ref name="most friendly" /&gt; In addition to offering in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, he has also made plans for a city ordinance that would prevent illegal immigrants with no criminal background from being turned over to immigration enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="most friendly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=Julia|title=Obama Policy on Immigrants Is Challenged by Chicago|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/us/obama-policy-on-illegal-immigrants-is-challenged-by-chicago.html|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iowa===

In 2012, the then-director of the Iowa Department of Transportation, [[Paul Trombino III]] (now nominee for Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration), announced a policy to deny driver's licenses to Iowa residents who were part of the DACA program. The policy was reversed several weeks later.&lt;ref name="ag171008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Director of the Federal Highway Administration: Who Is Paul Trombino?|url=http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/director-of-the-federal-highway-administration-who-is-paul-trombino-171008?news=860327|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=AllGov|date=Oct 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usat121227"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petroski|first1=William|title=Iowa stance on immigrant driver's licenses criticized|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2012/12/27/iowa-immigrant-drivers-licenses/1795427/|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=USA Today|date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland===
In 2016, [[List of mayors of Baltimore|Mayor of Baltimore (2010-2016)]] [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] stated that [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore police]] would not check the citizenship status of people with whom they interact.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger, Yvonne.

Maryland residents are eligible for in-state public tuition rates regardless of immigration status under certain conditions. A Maryland resident is eligible if they attended Maryland high schools for at least three of the previous twelve years and they graduated from a Maryland high school or received a Maryland [[General Educational Development|GED]] within the previous ten years.

===Michigan===

In October 2012, the Michigan Secretary of State, [[Ruth Johnson]], announced that Michigan would not issue driver's licenses or state identification of any kind to beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oosting|first1=Jonathan|title=Federal program allows some illegal immigrants to work, but they won't be able to drive in Michigan|url=http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/10/federal_program_allows_some_il.html|website=mlive.com|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making this decision, it was clear that the Secretary of State erroneously conflated the notion of "lawful presence," which is required under Michigan Law to issue a driver's license, and "lawful status," a different legal concept entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1UQnwyWpg02cDFJTGdUNEVsTXc/edit?pli=1 |title=Issue-Brief-SOS-DACA-licenses.pdf – Google Drive |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; USCIS has made it clear that DACA beneficiaries do not possess legal status, but does ''not'' state that DACA beneficiaries are unlawfully present; in fact, it states that DACA beneficiaries will not accrue unlawful presence time here while they are in this deferred action status.&lt;ref name="uscis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD |title=Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Process |publisher=United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)|date= |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Secretary of State relied upon USCIS' own explanation, which discusses legal status, not lawful presence.&lt;ref name="uscis1" /&gt; In response to this policy, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Johnson, alleging that the policy violated both Michigan law and the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/one-michigan-v-ruth-johnson |title=One Michigan v.

===Nebraska===
[[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Dave Heineman]] opposed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and in 2012 directed the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles to not issue driver's licenses to people who received deferred action under DACA. Heineman said that providing any benefit, including a driver's license, to an illegal immigrant would be a violation of Nebraska state law.&lt;ref name="Duggan"&gt;Duggan, Joe (May 30, 2015). "[http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/nebraska-begins-issuing-driver-s-licenses-to-children-of-illegal/article_efd9dd5e-064e-11e5-b1db-e36469ae3b08.html Nebraska begins issuing driver's licenses to children of illegal immigrants]". ''Omaha World-Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, however, the [[Nebraska Legislature]] determined that Section 202(c)(B)(viii) of the [[REAL ID Act|REAL ID Act of 2015]] required states to allow people to present documentation of deferred-action status when registering for a driver's license, and the Nebraska Legislature voted to change state law to allow qualified individuals with DACA to receive licenses by using documentation of their status of deferred action.&lt;ref name="Duggan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/real-id-act-text.pdf REAL ID Act – Title II]".

The Legislature further finds and declares that it was the intent of the Legislature in 2011 to adopt the enumerated categories by the passage of Laws 2011, LB 215. The Legislature declares that the passage of this legislative bill is for the limited purpose of reaffirming the original legislative intent of Laws 2011, LB 215."&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Pete Ricketts]] vetoed the bill; the legislature voted 34–10 to override the veto.&lt;ref name="Duggan"/&gt; Nebraska became the last of the 50 states to allow deferred-action recipients to obtain licenses.&lt;ref name="Duggan"/&gt;

===North Carolina===

North Carolina briefly suspended giving driver's licenses to DACA grantees while awaiting the state attorney general's opinion. The attorney general decided that even without formal immigration status, DACA grantees were to be granted legal presence. Subsequently, the state once again continued to give driver's licenses and allowed DACA grantees to become legal members of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Individuals Granted Deferred Action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Policy Eligible for State Driver's Licenses?|url=http://www.nilc.org/dacadriverslicenses.html|publisher=Immigration Law Center|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===

Although in-state tuition was still offered, Governor [[Rick Perry]] announced his opposition to DACA by distributing a letter to all state agencies, meant "to ensure that all Texas agencies understand that Secretary Napolitano's guidelines confer absolutely no legal status whatsoever to any illegal immigrant who qualifies for the federal 'deferred action' designation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aguilar|first=Julian|title=Perry: "Deferred Action" Doesn't Change State Policies|url=http://www.texastribune.org/immigration-in-texas/immigration/perrydeferred-action-does-not-change-state-policie/|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=Texas Tribune|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Virginia Attorney General]] [[Mark Herring]] sent a letter to the director of the [[State Council of Higher Education for Virginia]] (SCHEV), the presidents of Virginia public colleges and universities, and the chancellor of the [[Virginia Community College System]] in response to inquiries from public institutions of higher education on whether DACA students were eligible for in-state tuition.

According to the ''New York Times'', "Democrats and some Republicans, business executives, college presidents and immigration activists condemned the repeal as a coldhearted and shortsighted effort that was unfair to the young immigrants and could harm the economy."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Former President Obama condemned the repeal as "cruel" and wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/05/read-barack-obamas-response-to-trumps-decision-to-end-daca.html|title=Read Barack Obama's response to Trump's decision to end DACA|last=Kimball|first=Spencer|date=September 5, 2017|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they're undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver's license ... Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us ... Kicking them out won't lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone's taxes, or raise anybody's wages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reaction was mixed among Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/congress-reaction-daca-end-jeff-sessions-donald-trump/index.html|title=Democrats, some in GOP slam the end of DACA|authors=Daniella Diaz and Lauren Fox|publisher=CNN|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several senior Republicans praised Trump's action, such as House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]], Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] and Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/reacts-trump-move-scrap-daca-programme-170905201759665.html|title=US reacts to Trump's move to scrap the DACA programme|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Republicans, including Senators [[John McCain]] and [[Jeff Flake]], and Representative [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], condemned the Trump Administration's choice to rescind the executive order.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  In a released statement Senator McCain said:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/9/statement-by-senator-john-mccain-on-president-trump-s-decision-to-end-daca|title=Statement by Senator John McCain on Trump's Decision to End DACA|last=McCain|first=United States Senator John|website=www.mccain.senate.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I strongly believe that children who were illegally brought into this country through no fault of their own should not be forced to return to a country they do not know. The 800,000 innocent young people granted deferred action under DACA over the last several years are pursuing degrees, starting careers, and contributing to our communities in important ways. While I disagreed with President Obama's unilateral action on this issue, I believe that rescinding DACA at this time is an unacceptable reversal of the promises and opportunities that have been conferred to these individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] condemned the repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-organizations-speak-trumps-decision-end-daca/story?id=49626892|title=Lawmakers, organizations speak out after Trump's decision to end DACA|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2017|website=ABC News|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of religious organizations condemned the repeal, with the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] describing it as "reprehensible". The Catholic [[University of Notre Dame]] also urged the president to not rescind DACA and announced it would stand by those affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Report|first1=South Bend Tribune|title=Notre Dame, other schools back DACA program|url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/notre-dame-other-schools-back-daca-program/article_06dda28c-e759-5ecd-ac32-967aafc9ff3b.html|website=South Bend Tribune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Methodist Church]] said it was "not only unconscionable, but contrary to moral work and witness," and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] called on its members to "pray today for those that will suffer undue repercussions due to the end of this program."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/09/05/reprehensible-unconscionable-christian-leaders-react-to-trumps-decision-to-overturn-daca/|title='Reprehensible,' 'unconscionable': Christian leaders react to Trump's decision to overturn DACA|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about Trump's decision to rescind DACA, Pope Francis said if Trump is truly [[pro-life]], "he will understand that the family is the cradle of life and that it must be defended as a unit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/09/11/pope-francis-if-trump-is-pro-life-he-should-extend-daca/|title=Pope Francis: If Trump is 'pro-life,' he should extend DACA|last=Zauzmer|first=Julie|date=2017-09-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Reed]], chairman of the [[Faith and Freedom Coalition]], endorsed Trump's repeal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The September 2017 announcement sparked protests in many cities including [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], and [[Los Angeles]]. At a September 5 protest in New York outside of [[Trump Tower]], more than 30 protesters were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/arrests-made-daca-protest-york/story?id=49625957|title=DACA announcement sparks protests nationwide, dozens arrested at Trump Tower|last=Keneally|first=Meghan|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, more protesters were arrested outside Trump Tower, including Democratic congressmen [[Raúl Grijalva]] of Arizona, [[Luis Gutiérrez]] of Illinois, and [[Adriano Espaillat]] of New York.&lt;ref name="guardian-19sep2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Democratic congressmen arrested at Trump tower Daca protests|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/19/trump-tower-daca-protest-congress-democrats-arrests|accessdate=September 19, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal challenges to recission===
{{see also|New York v. Trump|Regents of University of California v. United States Department of Homeland Security}}

The rescission was challenged in court by different entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrington |first1=Ben |title=DACA Rescission: Legal Issues and Litigation Status |date=May 23, 2018 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, DC |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/LSB10136.pdf |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2017, fifteen states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit, titled ''[[New York v.

Becerra stated that, as a quarter of the people in the DACA program live in California, he thinks that "everyone recognizes the scope and breadth of the Trump decision to terminate DACA hits hardest here."&lt;ref name="latimes-11sep2017"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=California politics updates: California to sue Trump administration for DACA decision|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-sues-trump-administration-1505150334-htmlstory.html|accessdate=September 11, 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only have state governments filed suit, but also six DREAMERs have filed suit against Trump in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-usa-immigration-lawsuit/six-dreamers-sue-trump-administration-over-daca-decision-idUSKCN1BT18H|title=Six Dreamers sue Trump administration over DACA decision|date=September 18, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of California, which currently has approximately 4,000 undocumented students, has also filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security which was filed in the Northern District of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-sues-trump-administration-unlawful-repeal-daca-program|title=University of California sues Trump administration on unlawful repeal of DACA program|date=2017-09-11|work=University of California|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet Napolitano, president of the UC system, called the rescission of DACA, "unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful".  In a released statement Napolitano said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am deeply troubled by President Trump's decision to effectively end the DACA program and uproot the lives of an estimated 800,000 Dreamers across the nation. This backward-thinking, far-reaching move threatens to separate families and derail the futures of some of this country's brightest young minds, thousands of whom currently attend or have graduated from the University of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-statement-decision-end-daca-program|title=UC President Napolitano denounces decision to end DACA program, calls on Congress to make protections permanent|date=2017-09-07|work=University of California|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 20, 2017, the Supreme Court remanded five DACA cases originally filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] back to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].

On January 9, 2018, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] temporarily [[Regents of University of California v.

On February 13, 2018, Judge [[Nicholas Garaufis]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] granted a preliminary injunction ordering the federal government to fully restore the DACA program, including accepting brand new applicants as well as renewals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/13/court-orders-full-restoration-daca-program/ |title=Court orders full restoration of DACA program |first=Stephen |last=Dinan |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as a rationale for his ruling, Garaufis said that DACA was neither unconstitutional nor in violation of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) nor the [[Immigration and Naturalization Act]] (INA).&lt;ref&gt;Case 1:16-cv-04756-NGG-JO [https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/389/21170/123113980550.pdf Document 255]. ''United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York''. February 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2018, the Supreme Court declined to hear the Trump administration's request for it to review the lower court order that the administration must continue to accept DACA applications, so the Supreme Court will allow the Ninth Circuit to review the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-daca-dreamers.html|title= Justices Turn Down Trump's Appeal in 'Dreamers' Case|last=|date=2018-02-26|work=The New York Times| access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this ruling was to delay implementation of the rescission until at least October 2018.&lt;ref name = SCOTUS/&gt;

On April 24, 2018, [[John D. Bates]], a Senior United States District Judge of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], ruled that the Trump administration must resume accepting new applications for DACA but stayed his decision for 90 days to allow the Department of Homeland Security to explain why the program was being canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/daca-dreamers-trump.html | title=U.S. Must Keep DACA and Accept New Applications, Federal Judge Rules| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-04-24| last1=Jordan| first1=Miriam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2018, Judge Bates said the Trump administration has failed to justify its proposal to end DACA; however, he stayed the ruling for 20 days to allow the Trump administration time to respond and appeal, if it chooses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/politics/daca-ruling/index.html |title=Judge upholds ruling that DACA must be restored |date=August 3, 2018 |publisher=[[CNN|Cable News network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/08/03/opinion.daca.pdf|title=Memorandum opinion|date=August 3, 2018|work=United States District Court for the District of Columbia|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals included:
* ''[[DREAM Act]]:'' Proposed by [[Lindsey Graham|Sens.

{{Disability}}
The '''Disability Discrimination Act 1995''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents c 50]) (informally, and hereafter, the '''DDA''') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which has now been repealed and replaced by the [[Equality Act 2010]], except in [[Northern Ireland]] where the Act still applies. Formerly, it made it unlawful to discriminate against people in respect of their [[disabilities]] in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport.

The DDA is a [[civil rights]] law. Other countries use [[constitutional]], [[social rights]] or [[Criminal Law|criminal law]] to make similar provisions.  The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] combats discrimination. Equivalent legislation exists in Northern Ireland, which is enforced by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission.

==History==
The Act was the culmination of a public campaign, and at least 100,000 people in demonstrations, to force the government to end state and business discrimination against disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;See Scope, 'The Disability Discrimination Act 1995: The campaign for civil rights' (2 November 2015) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwP1xuZZFuY youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Race Relations Act 1976]] and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] guaranteed minimum standards for equality on grounds of race and gender, there had been very little concerning disabled people. Prior to the DDA, the first attempt to deal with the issue of disability was the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944. This made it a legal requirement for companies with over 250 employees to employ a quota of disabled persons. This failed as there was not now appointed to monitor these rights and as such was toothless.  

{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}

==Service providers==
In addition to imposing obligations on employers, the Act placed duties on service providers and required "reasonable adjustments" to be made when providing access to goods, facilities, services and premises.

The duties on service providers have been introduced in three stages:

* Since 2 December 1994 – It has been unlawful for service providers to treat disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability;
* Since 1 October 2002 – Service providers have had to make 'reasonable adjustments' for disabled people, such as providing extra help or making changes to the way they provide their services.
* Since 1 October 2004 – Service providers may have to make other 'reasonable adjustments' in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.

==Amending legislation==
The Act was amended by the following legislation in Great Britain (but not [[Northern Ireland]], where different amendments apply):

* The [[Disability Rights Commission Act 1999]], which replaced the National Disability Council with the [[Disability Rights Commission]] (DRC);
* The [[Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001]] inserted new provisions in Part 4 of the DDA 1995 in connection with disability discrimination in schools and other educational establishments;
* The Private Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc) Act 2002, which prevented operators of such vehicles refusing to take assistance dogs, or making additional charges for such dogs.
* The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Pensions) Regulations 2003 which amended the DDA in line with the EU employment directive.
* The [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]], which completed the implementation of the Disability Rights Task Force recommendations, including the extension of the DDA 1995 to cover public transport, and the introduction of a duty on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people.
*The [[Equality Act 2006]] which transferred the role of the [[Disability Rights Commission]] to the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC). The EHRC took on this role from 1 October 2007, and has powers to issue guidance on and enforce all the equality enactments (covering race, sex, disability, religion and belief, sexual orientation and age).

==Principles==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
{{Original research section|date=February 2018}}

The DDA 1995 departed from the fundamental principles of older UK discrimination law (the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] and the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]). These Acts, also repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010, made [[Discrimination|direct discrimination]] and [[Discrimination|indirect discrimination]] unlawful.  However, these concepts are insufficient to deal with the issues of disability discrimination.

The core concepts in the DDA 1995 are, instead:
*  less favourable treatment for a reason related to a disabled person's disability; and
*  failure to make a "reasonable adjustment".

"Reasonable adjustment" or, as it is known in some other jurisdictions, 'reasonable accommodation', is the radical concept that makes the DDA 1995 so different from the older legislation.  Instead of the rather passive approach of indirect discrimination (where someone can take action if they have been disadvantaged by a policy, practice or criterion that a body with duties under the law has adopted), reasonable adjustment is an active approach that requires employers, service providers etc. to take steps to remove barriers from disabled people's participation.  For example:

*  employers are likely to find it reasonable to provide accessible IT equipment;
*  many shops are likely to find it reasonable to make their premises accessible to wheelchair users;
*  councils are likely to find it reasonable to provide information in alternative formats (such as large print) as well as normal written form.

The Disability Rights Commission's Codes of Practice give more information to bodies with duties on assessing whether a particular adjustment is reasonable.  In general, the factors to consider would include:
*  whether the proposed adjustment would meet the needs of the disabled person;
*  whether the adjustment is affordable;
*  whether the adjustment would have a serious effect on other people.

Sometimes there may be no reasonable adjustment, and the outcome is that a disabled person is treated less favourably.  For example, if a person was not able to understand the implications of entering into a mortgage or loan agreement, and they did not have anyone authorised to act for them, it would not make sense to require a bank or building society to enter into that agreement.  The Act therefore permits employers and service providers to justify less favourable treatment (and in some instances failure to make a reasonable adjustment) in certain circumstances.

An example would be a medieval castle open for public tours that didn't have modifications made for wheelchairs. To do so would destroy the castle's historical aspects such as the restrictive nature of the original circular staircases.

The system of protection of disabled people, especially those with mental health problems to keep their homes, has been greatly enhanced by certain recent rulings in the  UK Court of Appeal—City of Manchester v Romano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/834.html|work=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]|title=England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Decisions - Manchester v Romano &amp; Anor [2004]|date=29 June 2004|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the act it is unlawful to discriminate against a disabled person by evicting them or subjecting them to other detriment unless justified under the limited number of justifications set out in the act.

In practice the only relevant justification is that the landlord believes and also that it is objectively necessary for the protection of the health or safety of the disabled person or someone else.

Where the cause of the taking of proceedings is e.g. rent arrears which was caused by the disability e.g. by Housing Benefit being cancelled through non response to correspondence and the non response was caused by the disability, then not only is it discrimination, but it is discrimination which cannot be justified on the grounds allowed in the act.

This applies whether or not the landlord knew of the disability.

This applies even if 
:the landlord has a mandatory ground for possession, e.g.
::two months rent arrears or
::two months notice no reason in cases of assured shorthold tenancy where the actual reason is rent arrears
:the tenancy is one where there is no statutory system of protection, e.g.
::where in LA temporary accommodation under the homelessness duty
::the tenancy is a business tenancy

The tenant may counter-claim and seek an injunction restraining the landlord from continuing the possession proceedings.

The judges were very worried about the extent of the law and urged Parliament to change it. However, there has since been a new act of Parliament and there was no weakening of this protection.

The '''Electronic Municipal Market Access''' ('''EMMA''') system, operated by the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB), serves as the official source for [[municipal securities]] disclosures and related [[market data]] in the United States.  EMMA provides free on-line access to centralized new issue municipal securities disclosure documents (known as official statements),&lt;ref name=recentcd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentOS.aspx|title=About the Information Available on EMMA|publisher=Emma.msrb.org|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on-going continuing disclosures for all municipal securities,&lt;ref name=recentcd&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; escrow deposit agreements for advance refundings (i.e., refinancings) of outstanding bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentAR.aspx |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212000843/http://emma.msrb.org/marketactivity/recentar.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - Refunding Information |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }} &lt;/ref&gt; real-time municipal bond trade price information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentTrades.aspx |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212000915/http://emma.msrb.org/marketactivity/recenttrades.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - Recent Trades |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; interest rates and auction results for municipal auction rate securities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentARS.aspx |accessdate=October 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131132647/http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentARS.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - ARS data |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }} &lt;/ref&gt; (the first free source for this kind of information on the [[auction rate securities]] market{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}) and interest rate reset information for variable rate demand obligations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentVRDO.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729053017/http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/RecentVRDO.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - About the information available |date=July 29, 2009 |archive-date=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with daily statistics on trading activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/ViewStatistics.aspx |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228003309/http://emma.msrb.org/MarketActivity/ViewStatistics.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - Market Statistics |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and investor education materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.msrb.org/EducationCenter/EducationCenter.aspx |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211041240/http://emma.msrb.org/EducationCenter/EducationCenter.aspx |title=EMMA Electronic Municipal Market Access - Overview |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

EMMA's disclosure collection operates in coordination with the MSRB's investor protection rules mandating that securities firms and banks selling municipal securities to customers provide them with complete disclosure of all important information about the investment.&lt;ref name="MSRB Notice 2009-42"&gt;[http://www.msrb.org/msrb1/archive/2009/2009-42.asp MSRB Notice 2009-42] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMMA also is the central information utility through which municipal securities disclosures mandated by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) through its Rule 15c2-12 are made freely available to the general public.&lt;ref name="SEC Press Release on Improved Transparency in the Municipal Securities Market, December 8, 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-286.htm|title=SEC, MSRB: New Measures to Provide More Transparency Than Ever Before for Municipal Bond Investors|work=Sec.gov|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EMMA continuing disclosure service provides access to audited financial statements, default notices, taxability notices, notices of rating changes, and approximately 30 additional categories of financial and other updates relating to municipal securities.&lt;ref name=recentcd/&gt;  The MSRB and SEC continue to work toward expanding the types and timeliness of disclosures available through EMMA.&lt;ref name="SEC Votes to Propose Rules Enhancing Municipal Securities Disclosure, July 15, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-161.htm|title=Press Release: SEC Votes to Propose Rules Enhancing Municipal Securities Disclosure; 2009-161; July 15, 2009|date=15 July 2009|work=sec.gov|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSRB Seeks to Provide Investors With Additional Disclosure Information, July 15, 2009"&gt;[http://www.msrb.org/msrb1/press/Release/MSRBSeeksToProvideInvestorsWithAdditionalDisclosureInformation.asp MSRB Seeks to Provide Investors With Additional Disclosure Information, July 15, 2009] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public access to the integrated collection of primary market and secondary market disclosure provided through EMMA parallels the centralized disclosure currently available for securities offerings by public companies through the SEC's [[EDGAR]] system, although EMMA provides additional items of information beyond the base disclosures provided by EDGAR, such as trade prices, interest rates, market statistics and educational materials.  The collection of disclosure documents available through EMMA for municipal securities is not identical to what is available through EDGAR for registered offerings of corporate or other securities since municipal securities and their state &amp; local governmental issuers are afforded broad exemptions from most provisions of the federal securities laws (such as the [[Securities Act of 1933]], the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] and the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]) otherwise applicable to private-sector issuers of corporate and other types of securities.

{{Merge from |The Estates|date=September 2017}}

[[Image:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|thumb|250px|A 13th century French representation of the tripartite social order of the [[middle ages]] – Oratores: "those who pray", Bellatores: "those who fight", and Laboratores: "those who work".]]
The '''estates of the realm''', or '''three estates''', were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in [[Christendom]] (Christian Europe) from the [[medieval period]] to [[early modern Europe]]. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.

The best known system is the French ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of [[clergy]] (the First Estate), [[nobles]] (the Second Estate), and [[peasant]]s and [[bourgeoisie]] (the Third Estate). In some [[region]]s, notably [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, [[Grand Burgher|burgher]]s (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate with "commons" as the second estate. This system produced the two [[houses of parliament]], the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ''[[ritter]]s'' (knights), and burghers was used.

Today the terms ''three estates'' and ''estates of the realm'' may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern [[separation of powers]] in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. Additionally the term ''[[fourth estate]]'' usually refers to forces outside the established power structure (evoking medieval three-estate systems), most commonly in reference to the independent press or media. Historically, in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners.

==Social Mobility==
During the [[Middle Ages]], advancing to different social classes was uncommon and very difficult.

The medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely up to a certain level (generally to that of [[vicar general]] or [[abbot]]/[[abbess]] for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. [[Nepotism]] was common in this period.

Another possible way to rise in social position was due to exceptional military or commercial success. Such families were rare and their rise to nobility required royal patronage at some point. However, because noble lines went extinct naturally, some ennoblements were necessary.

==Dynamics==

"Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders," [[Johan Huizinga]] observes.&lt;ref name=huiz&gt;Huizinga ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, 1924:47).&lt;/ref&gt; The virtually synonymous terms ''estate'' and ''order'' designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.

{{quote|There are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders. Finally there are the different orders of chivalry.&lt;ref name=huiz/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

This static view of society was predicated on inherited positions.&lt;!--where? While several of the various realms inverted the relative prominence of the first two orders--&gt; Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into [[bourgeoisie|burghers]] (also known as [[bourgeoisie]]) of the realm's cities and towns, and the [[peasant]]s and [[serfdom|serf]]s of the realm's surrounding lands and villages. A person's estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a [[caste]] within [[Caste system|that system]]. In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.

[[Legislature|Legislative]] bodies or advisory bodies to a [[monarchy|monarch]] were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial [[parliament]]s. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against [[false titles of nobility]]; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.

One of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called "[[What Is the Third Estate?]]" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-état?) It was written by [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.

==Background==
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the [[Catholic Church]] and its [[Papacy]] affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.

The new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.

In his book ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'', the French [[medievalism|medievalist]] [[Georges Duby]] has shown that in the period 1023-1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was [[Gerard of Florennes]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|bishop of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Duby]], ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'', Part 1&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Investiture Controversy]] of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.&lt;ref name="EB tp2tm"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe "History of Europe – Middle Ages – From territorial principalities to territorial monarchies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the [[Reformation|religious reformations]] of the 16th century. The very general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe "History of Europe – Middle Ages – From territorial principalities to territorial monarchies – The three orders"]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the [[Judaism|ancient Hebrews]] and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.&lt;ref name="EB tp2tm"/&gt;

==Kingdom of France==
{{Main|Ancien Régime}}
France under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (before the [[French Revolution]]) divided society into three estates: the '''First Estate''' ([[clergy]]); the '''Second Estate''' ([[French nobility|nobility]]); and the '''Third Estate''' ([[commoner]]s). The king was considered part of no estate.

[[File:Ständeordnung.jpg|250px|thumb|The First Estate (Fr. ''premier état'') was the [[clergy]].]]

===First Estate===
The First Estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into "higher" and "lower" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the Second Estate. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 1961, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other extreme, the "lower clergy" (about equally divided between parish priests, monks, and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population). {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Second Estate===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ancien Régime]] --&gt;
The Second Estate (Fr. ''deuxieme état'') was the [[French nobility]] and (technically, though not in common use) [[Royal family|royalty]], other than the [[monarch]] himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.

The Second Estate is traditionally divided into ''[[noblesse d'épée]]'' ("nobility of the sword"), and ''[[noblesse de robe]]'' ("nobility of the robe"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.

The Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France's population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Under the ''ancien régime'' ("old rule/old government"), the Second Estate were exempt from the ''[[corvée]] royale'' (forced labour on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the ''[[gabelle]]'' (salt tax) and most important, the ''[[taille]]'' (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.

===Third Estate===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ancien Régime]] --&gt;
{{Ancien Régime}}

The Third Estate comprised all of those who were not members of the above and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up 98% of France's population.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land) who could be prosperous and [[Villein (feudal)|villeins]] (serfs, or peasants working on a noble's land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring.

There were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.

They had the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Most were born within this group and died as a part of it, too. It was extremely rare for people of this [[ascribed status]] to make it out into another estate. Those who did so managed as a result of either being recognized for their extraordinary bravery in a battle or entering religious life.&lt;ref name=estatehem/&gt; A few commoners were able to marry into the second estate, but this was a rare occurrence.&lt;ref name=estatehem&gt;{{cite book|last=Henslin|first=James M.|title=Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach|year=2004|publisher=[[Allyn &amp; Bacon]]|isbn=0205407358|page=225|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estates General===
{{main|French Estates General|Estates General of 1789}}
The first Estates General (not to be confused with a "class of citizen") was actually a general citizen assembly that was called by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1302.

In the period leading up to the [[Estates General of 1789]], France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt (nearly 3.56 million livres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section1.html|title=France's Financial Crisis: 1783–1788|accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1776, finance minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, [[Jacques Necker]], a foreigner, was appointed [[Comptroller]]-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.&lt;ref name="Hib35"&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35, 36&lt;/ref&gt;), terrible inflation and widespread food scarcity (a huge famine in the winter of 1788-89). This led to widespread popular discontent and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of Finance Minister [[Jacques Necker]], but very much against the wishes of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s court and many of the hereditary nobles forming his Second Estate allies (at least allies against taking more taxes upon themselves and keeping the unequal taxation on the commoners).

When he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the Estate-General meeting was an invitation to revolution.

By June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates-General was reconstituted first as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] (June 17, 1789) seeking a solution for the realm independent of the King's management of the meetings of the Estates General which occasionally continued to meet. These self-organized meetings are today defined as the [[epoch event]] beginning the historical epoch (era) of the [[French Revolution]], during which – after several more weeks of civil unrest – the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] (July 9, 1789).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Terror, Reign of"; ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

This unitary body composed of the former representatives of the three estates stepping up to govern along with an emergency committee in the power vacuum existing after the [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon monarchy]] fled Paris. Among the Assembly was [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], an influential member of the [[Jacobin]]s who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the [[Reign of Terror]] (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{details|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
Whilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was long based along the classic estate lines being composed on the "Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons". The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of [[Edward III]] in the 14th century.

Notwithstanding the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility (Lords Temporal) in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the [[Lords Spiritual]].

===Scotland===
{{Main|Parliament of Scotland}}
The members of the Parliament of [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as the '''Three Estates''' ([[Older Scots]]: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:
*the '''first estate''' of [[prelate]]s ([[bishop]]s and [[abbot]]s)
*the '''second estate''' of [[laird]]s ([[duke]]s, [[earl]]s, [[parliamentary peers]] (after 1437) and [[Laity|lay]] [[tenants-in-chief]])
*the '''third estate''' of [[burgh commissioners]] (representatives chosen by the [[royal burghs]])

The First Estate was overthrown during the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the accession of [[William III of England|William III]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Colin ''Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689–1830'' Cambridge University Press (2003) pp133&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.

A ''[[Shire Commissioner]]'' was the closest equivalent of the [[England|English]] office of ''[[Member of Parliament]]'', namely a [[commoner]] or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]], as opposed to the separate English [[House of Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

The Parliament also had [[University constituency|University constituencies]] (see [[Ancient universities of Scotland]]). The system was also adopted by the [[Parliament of England]] when [[James I of England|James VI]] ascended to the [[English throne]]. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] after [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Alastair, "A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament", ''Scottish Parliamentary Review'', Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden and Finland==
The Estates in [[Sweden]] (including [[Finland]]) and later also Russia's [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] were the two higher estates, [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], and the two lower estates, [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] and land-owning [[peasants]]. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]. The Riksdag, and later the [[Diet of Finland]] was [[Tetracameralism|tetracameral]]: at the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.

After Russia's conquest of Finland in 1809, the estates in Finland swore an oath to the Emperor in the [[Diet of Porvoo]]. A [[Finnish House of Nobility]] was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However, after the Diet of Porvoo, the [[Diet of Finland]] was reconvened only in 1863. In the meantime, for a period of 54 years, the country was governed only administratively.

There was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no "default" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:
*Nobility (see [[Finnish nobility]] and [[Swedish nobility]]) was exempt from tax, had an inherited [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and the right to keep a [[fief]], and had a tradition of military service and government. Nobility was codified in 1280 with the Swedish king granting exemption from taxation (''frälse'') to land-owners that could equip a cavalryman (or be one themselves) for the king's army. Around 1400, [[letters patent]] were introduced, in 1561 the ranks of [[Count]] and [[Friherre|Baron]] were added, and in 1625 the House of Nobility was codified as the First Estate of the land. Following [[Axel Oxenstierna]]'s reform, higher government offices were open only to nobles. However, the nobility still owned only their own property, not the peasants or their land [[serfdom|as in much of Europe]]. Heads of the noble houses were hereditary members of the assembly of nobles. The Nobility is divided into [[titled nobility]] ([[count]]s and [[baron]]s) and lower nobility. Until the 18th century the lower nobility was in turn was divided into [[Knight]]s and [[Esquire]]s such that each of the three classes would first vote internally, giving one vote per class in the assembly. This resulted in great political influence for the higher nobility.
*Clergy, or priests, were exempt from tax, and collected [[tithe]]s for the church. After the [[Swedish Reformation]], the church became [[Lutheran]]. In later centuries, the estate included teachers of universities and certain state schools. The estate was governed by the [[state church]] which consecrated its ministers and appointed them to positions with a vote in choosing diet representatives.
*Burghers were city-dwellers, tradesmen and craftsmen. Trade was allowed only in the cities when the [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]] ideology had got the upper hand, and the burghers had the exclusive right to conduct commerce within the framework of [[guild]]s. Entry to this Estate was controlled by the autonomy of the towns themselves. Peasants were allowed to sell their produce within the city limits, but any further trade, particularly foreign trade, was allowed only for burghers. In order for a settlement to become a city, a royal charter granting [[market right]] was required, and foreign trade required royally chartered [[staple port]] rights. After the annexation of Finland into Imperial Russia in 1809, mill-owners and other proto-industrialists would gradually be included in this estate.
*Peasants were land-owners of land-taxed farms and their families, which represented the majority in medieval times. Since most of the population were independent farmer families until the 19th century, not serfs nor villeins, there is a remarkable difference in tradition compared to other European countries. Entry was controlled by ownership of farmland, which was not generally for sale but a hereditary property. After 1809, Swedish tenants renting a large enough farm (ten times larger than what was required of peasants owning their own farm) were included as well as non-nobility owning tax-exempt land. Their representatives to the Diet were elected indirectly: each municipality sent electors to elect the representative of an electoral district.
*To no estate belonged propertyless [[Serfdom|cottagers]], [[villein]]s, [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] of farms owned by others, farmhands, servants, some lower administrative workers, rural craftsmen, travelling salesmen, vagrants, and propertyless and unemployed people (who sometimes lived in strangers' houses). To reflect how the people belonging to the estates saw them, the Finnish word for "obscene", ''säädytön'', has the literal meaning "estateless". They had no political rights and could not vote. Their mobility was severely limited by the policy of "legal protection" (Finnish: ''laillinen suojelu''): every estateless person had to be employed by a taxed citizen from the estates, or they could be charged with [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and sentenced to forced labor. In Finland, this policy lasted until 1883.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.narc.fi/portti/index.php/Teema:_Irtolaisuus&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last [[ennoblement]] of explorer [[Sven Hedin]] taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Sweden|Constitution]] January 1, 1975, while the status of the [[Swedish House of Nobility|House of Nobility]] continued to be regulated in law until 2003.

In Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or [[serf]]s.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.

The political system was reformed as a result of the [[Finnish general strike of 1905]], with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the [[Eduskunta|modern parliamentary system]], ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1995/19950971 Original Act 971/1995]&lt;/ref&gt; although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the [[Finnish House of Nobility]].

In Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku § 1/Strafflagen 18 kap. § 1).

==Low Countries==
The [[Low Countries]], which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]], had no States General until 1464, when [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Duke Philip of Burgundy]] assembled the first States General in [[Bruges]]. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries [[Brussels]] became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.

As a consequence of the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed [[King Philip II of Spain]], who was also [[Lord|overlord]] of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the [[southern Netherlands]] (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in [[Middelburg]], and in [[The Hague]] from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the United Netherlands]].

During that time the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a [[plurale tantum]]) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in [[Friesland]] the peasants were indirectly represented by the ''[[Grietman]]nen'').

In the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the [[Estates General of 1600]] and the [[Estates General of 1632]].

As a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called ''Nationale Vergadering'' (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] (1810:'' La Hollande est reunie à l'Empire'').

After regaining independence in November 1813, the name "States General" was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the [[States-Provincial]]. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the [[Belgian Revolution]], The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]].

From 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.

Occasionally the First and Second Chamber meet in a ''Verenigde Vergadering'' (Joint Session), for instance on [[Prinsjesdag]], the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is [[Inauguration|inaugurated]].

==Holy Roman Empire==
The [[Holy Roman Empire]] had the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''Reichstag''). The clergy was represented by the independent [[prince-bishop]]s, prince-archbishops and [[prince-abbot]]s of the many [[monastery|monasteries]]. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular [[prince-elector]]s, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent [[Free imperial city|imperial cities]]. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the [[Imperial Knight]]s and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.

Large realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.

The [[Swabian League]], a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.

==Russian Empire==
{{Main|Social estates in the Russian Empire}}
In the late [[Russian Empire]] the estates were called ''[[sosloviye]]s''. The four major estates were: nobility (''[[dvoryanstvo]]''), [[clergy]], rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in [[Duma]] was carried out by estates. [[Russian Empire Census]] recorded the reported estate of a person.

==Catalonia==
{{Main|Catalan Courts}}
The [[Catalan Parliament|Parliament of Catalonia]] was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (''Corts Catalanes''), according to American historian [[Thomas Bisson]], and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval [[parliament]]. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism [[Charles Howard McIlwain]] wrote that the General Courts of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joaquim Albareda]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040103005104/http://www.uvic.es/central/campus/gabinet/aulass/ca/albareda.html "Estat i nació a l'Europa moderna"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Sanctuary and Truce Assemblies (''assemblees de pau i treva'') that started in the 11th century.
The members of the parliament of Catalonia were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: ''Tres Estats''):
*the "military estate" (''polígons militars'') with representatives of the feudal nobility
*the "ecclesiastical estate" (''eclesiàstica arrels'') with representatives of the religious hierarchy
*the "royal estate" (''real estate'') with representatives of the free municipalities under royal privilege
The parliament institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of Catalonia, after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">'''Nigeria''' is held by treaty to cooperate in [[extradition]] of criminals with several nations.

==United States==
The extradition Treaty signed between the United States and other countries allows the United States to request from countries that have signed the [[List of United States extradition treaties|Extradition Treaty]] to extradite persons who are wanted by the United States Security Authorities for criminal offences. [[Nigeria]] signed the Extradition Treaty with the United State in December 22, 1931 and entered into force in June 24, 1935.

Since then Nigeria has extradited several persons to the United States for various reasons ranging from drug, [[advance fee fraud]], and terrorism related offenses. In August 28, 2013 a court in Nigeria on the request of the U.S. Embassy ordered the extradition to the US one Lawal Olaniyi Babafemi's on a federal indictment charging him for providing support to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula by recruiting members to train in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2013/alleged-international-terrorist-arraigned-today-in-brooklyn-federal-court-following-extradition-from-nigeria |title=FBI — Alleged International Terrorist Arraigned Today in Brooklyn Federal Court Following Extradition from Nigeria |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130828/nigerian-court-orders-al-qaeda-suspects-extradition-us |title=Nigerian court orders Al-Qaeda suspect's extradition to US |publisher=GlobalPost |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2015-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630171916/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130828/nigerian-court-orders-al-qaeda-suspects-extradition-us |archivedate=2015-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent incidence involving Senator-elect Buruji Kashamu, 56, who was on Monday, 25, May 2015, refused to attend a court hearing on his extradition to the United States on 20-year-old drug charges related to the TV hit "Orange is the New Black.” After years of inaction, the United States has requested his extradition, according to Nigeria's drug agency. A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press that the department does not comment on law enforcement matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=APMay 25, 2015, 7:38 AM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nigeria-senator-buruji-kashamu-us-extradition-chicago-orange-is-the-new-black/ |title=Nigeria senator-elect Buruji Kashamu fights US extradition on Chicago "Orange is the New Black" drug charges |publisher=CBS News |date=2015-05-25 |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-14/news/ct-met-orange-new-black-20131114_1_piper-kerman-piper-chapman-drug-case |title="Orange is the New Black" drug case still open - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no public record showing the extradition of United States citizens to Nigeria since the treaty became effective in 1935. Despite being the party benefit ting more from the treaty, the State Department in a 2009 report described Nigeria’s extradition practices and procedures as an obstacle to anti-crime efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The report states that the US has several extradition requests pending in Nigeria for years.

==United Kingdom==
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in May 4 requested the Federal High Court in Abuja, May 4, May 2015 ordered that Emmanuel Okoyomon, former Managing Director Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company (NSPM) be extradition to the United Kingdom (UK) for trial for alleged corruption and money laundering. The court gave the Federal Government 30 days within which to extradite Okoyomon to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/05/04/court-orders-extradition-uk-ex-mint-boss-emmanuel-okoyomon |title=Court Orders Extradition To UK Of Ex-MINT Boss, Emmanuel Okoyomon |publisher=Sahara Reporters |date=2015-05-04 |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Master |first=Web |url=http://africanspotlight.com/2015/06/26/extradition-court-of-appeal-refuses-ex-mint-boss-emmanuel-okoyomons-bail/ |title=Extradition: Court of Appeal refuses Ex-MINT boss, Emmanuel Okoyomon’s bail |publisher=African Spotlight |date= |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelandnewsng.com/other-news/court-appeal-delays-extradition-fmr-mint-boss-emmanuel-okoyomon |title=Court of Appeal delays extradition of fmr MINT boss, Emmanuel Okoyomon &amp;#124; Homeland News |publisher=Homelandnewsng.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11770">'''Gilles Cistac''' (November 11, 1961 − March 3, 2015) was a Franco-Mozambican lawyer specialised in [[constitutional law]]. He was shot and killed and political motives were suspected. The [[RENAMO]] party organised protests.

== Biography ==
Gilles Cistac was born in 1961 in the French city of [[Toulouse]]. He studied [[public law]] in Toulouse and graduated there in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/03/05/2060795-gilles-cistac-un-homme-de-dialogue-qui-aimait-la-vie.html |title=Gilles Cistac, «un homme de dialogue qui aimait la vie» |author=Daniel Hourquebie |work=La Depêche |date=2015-03-05 |language=fr |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Move to Mozambique ===
In 1993 Cistac came as an advisor to Mozambique working for the French embassy providing assistance to the Mozambican state in creating a new electoral law. After a short stay back in France, he moved to Mozambique in 1995. Since then he worked as a law professor at [[Eduardo Mondlane University]]. Until his death, he was the vice-chair of the investigation department of the law faculty of the university.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uem.mz/index.php/noticias-recentes/461-uem-exalta-feitos-do-professor-gilles-cistac-em-velorio |title=UEM exalta feitos do Professor Gilles Cistac em velório |publisher=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane |date=2015-03-11 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his efforts that led to the creation of the ''Centro de Estudos sobre a Integração Regional'' (CEDIR), a small investigation unit working on the harmonisation of the law in the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] member states.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 2009, Cistac received the French order of merit [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] in the rank of a knight (''Chevalier'') for his work on decentralisation in Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ambafrance-mz.org/Professeur-Gilles-Cistac-Chevalier |title=Professeur Gilles Cistac Chevalier de l’Ordre des Palmes Académiques |publisher=Ambassade de France au Maputo |date=2010-01-27 |language=fr |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Ordre des Palmes Académiques" is the highest French order of merit in the science area. In 2010 Cistac acquired the Mozambican citizenship additionally to his French citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/03/05/2060792-mozambique-avocat-toulousain-gilles-cistac-tue-balles-pleine-rue.html |title=Mozambique : l'avocat toulousain Gilles Cistac tué par balles en pleine rue |author=Elodie Lanfroy |work=La Depêche |date=2015-03-05 |language=fr |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
In the morning of the March 3, 2015 Gilles Cistac wanted to enter a taxi in front of a café in the [[Polana, Maputo|Polana]] neighbourhood, when a car passed by and hit Cistac intentionally by three shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2015/03/04/un-avocat-critique-du-pouvoir-assassine-a-maputo_4587220_3212.html |title=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2015/03/04/un-avocat-critique-du-pouvoir-assassine-a-maputo_4587220_3212.html |author=Adrien Barbier |work=Le Monde Afrique |date=2015-03-03 |language=fr |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, Cistac died in [[Central Hospital, Maputo|Maputo's central hospital]]. The main opposition party, [[RENAMO]], as well as certain oppositional and international media houses blamed radical forces of the ruling [[FRELIMO]] party for Cistac's death, while the FRELIMO denied having any relation to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dw.de/afonso-dhlakama-promete-vingar-assassinato-de-gilles-cistac/a-18294153 |title=Afonso Dhlakama promete vingar assassinato de Gilles Cistac |author=Nelson Carvalho |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2015-03-04 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, several marches in several Mozambican cities honoured Cistac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dw.de/mo%C3%A7ambicanos-de-luto-pela-morte-de-gilles-cistac/a-18300652 |title=Moçambicanos de luto pela morte de Gilles Cistac |author=Guilherme Correia da Silva |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2015-03-06 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embassies of different states, as of France, the European Union and the United States, condemned the homicide and demanded a fast and effective investigation of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/mozambique/press_corner/all_news/news/2015/20150304_en.htm |title=Local statement following the assassination of Professor Gilles Cistac in Maputo on 3 March 2015 (03/03/2015) |publisher=Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Mozambique |date=2015-03-03 |language=en |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ambafrance-mz.org/Declarations-du-porte-parole |title=Déclarations du porte-parole : Assassinat de M.

Cistac's homicide was seen as a further step in increasing Mozambique's political crisis since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menas.co.uk/politics_and_security/mozambique/news/article/3772/murder-of-prominent-lawyer-presents-double-threat-to-mozambique%27s-new-president/ |title=Murder of prominent lawyer presents double threat to Mozambique's new president |work=Menas.co.uk |date=2015-03-11 |language=en |access-date=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123116/http://www.menas.co.uk/politics_and_security/mozambique/news/article/3772/murder-of-prominent-lawyer-presents-double-threat-to-mozambique%27s-new-president/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chr.up.ac.za/index.php/centre-news-a-events-2015/1439-press-release-centre-calls-for-immediate-and-independent-investigation-into-the-tragic-assassination-and-untimely-death-of-prof-gilles-cistac-esteemed-human-rights-educator-and-activist.html |title=Press release: Centre calls for immediate and independent investigation into the tragic assassination and untimely death of Prof Gilles Cistac, esteemed human rights educator and activist |author=Norman Taku |publisher=Centre for Human Rights / University of Pretoria |date=2015-03-03 |language=en |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/mozambique/11455866/Prominent-Mozambique-rights-lawyer-gunned-down-in-Maputo.html|title = Prominent Mozambique rights lawyer gunned down in Maputo|date = 2015-03-06|accessdate = 2015-03-15|website = The Telegraph|publisher = |last = Thornycroft|first = Peta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public activities ==
Gilles Cistac was known as a sharp critic of the ruling FRELIMO party, he published his opinion in several oppositional media, despite the fact that he claimed to be independent and not affiliated to any political party. He criticised the constant violation of [[human rights]] in Mozambique, the appropriation of the state bureaucracy by the FRELIMO, the concentration of the state's executive power and the weak public prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://delagoabayword.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/sobre-os-poderes-na-ditosa-patria-amada/ |title=Sobre os poderes na ditosa Pátria amada |author=Raul Senda |work=The Delagoa Bay Review |date=2011-09-20 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://opais.sapo.mz/index.php/politica/63-politica/17202-projecto-da-frelimo-e-pouco-substancial.html |title=Gilles Cistac: “Projecto da Frelimo é pouco substancial” |work=O País |date=2011-10-14 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mozambican general election, 2014|general elections in 2014]] the main opposition party, RENAMO, protested heavily against the results. Especially, the RENAMO claimed to govern the provinces, in which the party won the majority of votes. At the moment, the central government nominates the governors of the provinces. RENAMO leader [[Afonso Dhlakama]] demanded the creation of so-called "Autonomous Provinces" and a subsequent constitutional devolution. The FRELIMO party, especially Mozambique's president [[Filipe Nyusi]], denied these requests and called them "unconstitutional". Gilles Cistac contradicted Nyusi and said that, according to Mozambique's constitution, it was possible to create subaltern hierarchies. Cistac prepared a legislative proposal for the RENAMO, which is going to be discussed in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Mozambique)|national Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.verdade.co.mz/tema-de-fundo/35-themadefundo/51593-gilles-cistac-preve-gestao-autonoma-das-provincias-onde-a-renamo-reclama-vitoria |title=Gilles Cistac prevê gestão autónoma das províncias onde a Renamo reclama vitória |author=Emildo Sambo |work=A Verdade |date=2015-01-30 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After publishing his opinion about the possibility of creating "Autonomous Provinces" several media close to the FRELIMO party criticised him for his opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index.php/analise/31077-bagsvd |title=Os equívocos do Prof. Gilles Cistac |author=Télio Chamuço |work=Jornal de Notícias |date=2015-02-05 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rm.co.mz/index.php/home-2/item/10023-dhlakama-tenta-explicar-provincias-autonomas.html |title=Dhlakama tenta explicar “províncias autónomas” |author=Paul Fauvet |publisher=Rádio Moçambique |date=2015-02-18 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson of the FRELIMO, Damião José, called Cistac a "liar" and being "dishonest", as well as blaming him not being thankful to the Mozambican people who accepted him "friendly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index.php/politica/31768-ainda-os-pronunciamentos-de-cistac-porta-voz-da-frelimo-deplora |title=AINDA OS PRONUNCIAMENTOS DE CISTAC: Porta-voz da Frelimo deplora |work=Jornal de Notícias |date=2015-02-19 |language=pt |access-date=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke's Bay Motor Co Ltd v Russell [1972] NZLR 542 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability in negligence, and the legal concept of [[res ipsa loquitur]] &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A bus owned by Hawkes Bay Motor Company was struck on a bend in a road by a car driven on the wrong side of the road by Russell. They later sued Russell for the cost of the damage, to which Russell successfully defended on the basis that he had blacked out due to a medical condition.

HBMC appealed that under [[res ipsa loquitur]], that due to the facts here, the onus of proof should be of Russell to prove the medical condition.

==Held==
The court ruled that this doctrine did not apply here.

The data is shown true because the supposed rapist is later exonerated. However, the actual number of falsely accused is thought to be much higher (Demsey, Forst, Carter, 2018). 

==History==
The #HimToo movement came as part of the backlash to the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]]. A US mother tweeted about her son with this hashtag. She claimed that her son, Pieter Hanson, is afraid to go on dates because of false rape allegations. Hanson himself disavowed his mother’s tweet, saying that he does not avoid dating for fear of being falsely accused of sexual misconduct, and that he supports the #MeToo movement.&lt;ref name=USMom&gt;{{cite news |title=How a US mom's Him Too tweet about her son backfired hilariously |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/him-too-memes-metoo-pieter-hanson-1360186-2018-10-10 |newspaper=[[India Today]]|publisher=[[Living Media]]|location=Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India|date=10 October 2018 |accessdate=15 October 2018|ref=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Since the hash tag #HimToo went viral on Twitter, there has been widespread discussion about the movement and allegations worldwide caused by the [[Me Too movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sandra| last1=E.

The '''Judicial Council of California''' is the rule-making arm of the [[Judiciary of California|California court system]].&lt;ref&gt;''NASD Dispute Resolution, Inc. v. Judicial Council'', 232 F. Supp. 2d 1055 (N.D. Cal. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the California Constitution and under the leadership of the Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of California]], the council is responsible for "ensuring the consistent, independent, impartial, and accessible administration of justice." It was created by an amendment to article VI of the [[California Constitution]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/jc/about.htm | title= About the Judicial Council | publisher= Judicial Council of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 15, Chapter 48, [[California Statutes|Statutes of California 1925]], pp. 1369-1370; Proposition 27, November 2, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The [[California Rules of Court]] are rules adopted by the Judicial Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[California Rules of Court]], rules 1.1 and 1.3&lt;/ref&gt; Every court may also make local rules for its own government and the government of its officers not inconsistent with law or with the rules adopted and prescribed by the Judicial Council.&lt;ref name=GovCode68070/&gt;

[[law of California|California law]] encourages the Judicial Council to provide for uniformity in rules and procedures throughout all courts on the form of papers, limitations on the filing of papers, rules relating to law and motion, and requirements concerning documents to be filed at or prior to trial.&lt;ref name=GovCode68070&gt;[[California Government Code]] § 68070&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Judicial Council's most well-known functions is promulgating a huge number of standard court forms for use in California judicial proceedings, such as Form TR-130, the standard "Notice to Appear" form used by practically all California law enforcement agencies to write traffic citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/documents/tr130.pdf | title= Form TR-130, Traffic/Nontraffic Notice To Appear | publisher= Judicial Council of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The Judicial Council is composed of 21 voting members:

* The [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California|Chief Justice]]
* 14 judicial officers appointed by the Chief Justice (1 associate justice of the Supreme Court, 3 justices of the [[California Courts of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]], 10 [[Superior Courts of California|trial court]] judges)
* 4 attorney members appointed by the [[State Bar of California|State Bar]] [[California State Bar Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]]
* 1 member from each house of the [[California Legislature|Legislature]]

The California Constitution requires that the council also have two non-voting members who are court administrators. The Administrative Director is a non-voting member who serves as Secretary, and the Chief Justice can also appoint further advisory (non-voting) members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/jc-20140627-circulating.pdf | title= Judicial Council: Nonvoting Council Position | publisher= Judicial Council of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''law enforcement officer''' ('''LEO'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/about-tsa/law-enforcement-officers-flying-armed|title=Law Enforcement Officers Flying Armed|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|date=9 May 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''peace officer''' in North American English, is a [[Public sector|public-sector]] [[employee]] whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of [[laws]]. The phrase can include [[police officer]]s, [[municipal law enforcement officer]]s, [[special police]] officers, [[customs]] officers, [[state trooper]]s, [[special agent]]s, [[secret agent]]s, [[special investigator]]s, [[border guard|border patrol]] officers, [[immigration officer]]s, [[bailiff|court officers]], [[probation officer]]s, [[parole officer]]s, [[arson investigator]]s, [[Auxiliary Police|auxiliary officers]], [[game wardens]], [[sheriff]]s, [[constables]], [[corrections]], [[Marshal#Law enforcement|marshal]]s, [[deputy sheriff|deputies]], detention officers, [[correction officer]]s, and public safety officers (at public institutions). [[Security guards]] are [[civilian]]s and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a [[community safety accreditation scheme]]. Although typically the term "law enforcement officer" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers.

Modern legal codes use the term ''peace officer'' (or in some jurisdictions, ''law enforcement officer'') to include every person vested by the legislating state with law enforcement authority—&lt;wbr&gt;traditionally, anyone "sworn, badged, and armable" who can arrest, or refer such arrest for a criminal [[prosecution]]. Hence, city police officers, county sheriffs' deputies, and [[State police|state troopers]] are usually vested with the same authority within a given jurisdiction. Contract security officers may enforce certain laws and administrative regulations, which may include detainment or apprehension authority, including arresting. Peace officers may also be able to perform all duties that a law enforcement officer is tasked with, but may or may not be armed with a weapon.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Criminal Code (R.S., c. C-34, s. 2.) defines a ''peace officer'' as:

{{quote|Peace officer" includes
*(a) a mayor, [[Reeve (Canada)#Canada|warden]], [[Reeve (Canada)#Canada|reeve]], [[sheriff]], deputy sheriff, sheriff's officer, and [[justice of the peace]],
*(b) a member of the [[Correctional Service of Canada]] who is designated as a peace officer pursuant to Part I of the ''Corrections and Conditional Release Act'', and a warden, deputy warden, instructor, keeper, jailer, guard and any other officer or permanent employee of a prison other than a penitentiary as defined in Part I of the ''Corrections and Conditional Release Act'',
*(c) a police officer, police constable, [[bailiff]], [[constable]], or other person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace or for the service or execution of civil process,
*(d) an [[Canada Border Services Agency#Border Services Officer|officer]] within the meaning of the ''Customs Act'', the ''Excise Act'' or the ''Excise Act, 2001'', or a person having the powers of such an officer, when performing any duty in the administration of any of those Acts,
*(d.1) an officer authorized under subsection 138(1) of the ''[[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]]'',
*(e) a person designated as a [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada#Enforcement|fishery guardian]] under the ''Fisheries Act'' when performing any duties or functions under that Act and a person designated as a [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada#Enforcement|fishery officer]] under the ''Fisheries Act'' when performing any duties or functions under that Act or the ''Coastal Fisheries Protection Act'',
*(f) the pilot in command of an aircraft
**(i) registered in Canada under regulations made under the ''Aeronautics Act'', or
**(ii) leased without crew and operated by a person who is qualified under regulations made under the'' Aeronautics Act'' to be registered as owner of an aircraft registered in Canada under those regulations, while the aircraft is in flight, and
*(g) officers and non-commissioned members of the [[Canadian Forces]] who are
**(i) appointed for the purposes of section 156 of the ''[[National Defence Act]]'', ([[Canadian Forces Military Police|Military Police]]) or
**(ii) employed on duties that the Governor in Council, in regulations made under the ''National Defence Act'' for the purposes of this paragraph, has prescribed to be of such a kind as to necessitate that the officers and non-commissioned members performing them have the powers of peace officers;}}

Section (b) allows for designation as a peace officer for a member of the Correctional Service of Canada under the following via the ''Corrections and Conditional Release Act'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44.6/index.html 
|title=Corrections and Conditional Release Act (S.C. 1992, c. 20) 
|work=Department of Justice Canada 
|date=2012-01-24 
|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|*10. The Commissioner may in writing designate any staff member, either by name or by class, to be a peace officer, and a staff member so designated has all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law in respect of
*(a) an offender subject to a warrant or to an order for long-term supervision; and
*(b) any person, while the person is in a penitentiary.}}

In addition, provincial legislatures can designate a class of officers (i.e. Conservation Officers, Park Rangers and Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement) to be peace officers.

==Sri Lanka==
Under the ''Code Of Criminal Procedure'' a '''peace officer''' includes all [[Sri Lanka Police|police officer]]s, a [[Divisional Secretariats of Sri Lanka|Divisional Assistant Government Agent]] and a [[Grama Niladhari]]s appointed by a [[Government Agent (Sri Lanka)|Government Agent]] (GA) in writing to perform police duties or keep the peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawnet.gov.lk/criminal-procedure-code/ Code Of Criminal Procedure]&lt;/ref&gt; A peace officer has the power to arrest a person without a warrant or an order from a [[magistrate]] under certain circumstances such as;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceylontoday.lk/print20170401CT20170630.php?id=19433 LAW OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE]&lt;/ref&gt;

# who in his presence commits any breach of the peace,
# who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned,
# having in his possession without lawful excuse any implement of house-breaking,
# who has been proclaimed as an offender,
# in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be property stolen or fraudulently obtained and who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to such thing
# who obstructs a peace officer while in the execution of his duty or who has escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody,
# suspected of being a military deserter,
# suspected of conceal his presence under circumstances which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions with a view to committing a cognizable offence,
# who has been concerned in or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been concerned in any act committed at any place out of Sri Lanka

During the [[British Ceylon|British colonial administration of Ceylon]], when uniformed policing by the [[Ceylon Police Force]] in rural areas of the island was limited, the local government agent would appoint individuals from wealthy influential families deemed loyal to the crown as a Peace Officers with police powers to keep the peace. This  was an influential post, the holder had much control over the people of the area. Commonly a [[Native headmen of Ceylon|Native Headman]] (Muladaniya) was appointed as the Peace Officer to maintain law and order in rural villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Village notables in colonial Ceylon - The Village Headman was the uncrowned king of the village. He was appointed by the Government Agent from a traditional leading family in the area, in order to ensure that the he received customary respect from villagers |url= http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=177002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the formation of the [[State Council of Ceylon]] in 1931, one of its members, [[H. W. Amarasuriya]], called for an inquiry into the headman system. A commission was formed made up of retired civil servants and lawyers headed by H.M. Wedderburn. The commission reported on reforming the headman system or replacing it with transferable District Revenue Officers. The headman system was abolished as an administrative system, with the titles of [[Sri Lankan Mudaliyars|Mudaliyar]] (Mudali - මුදලි) and [[Muhandiram]] retained by government to be awarded as honors. This practice remained until suspension of Celonese honors in 1956. The minor headman positions where retained, surviving well into the 1970s when the post of [[Vidane]] was replaced with the transferable post of [[Grama Niladhari]] (Village Officer).

Peace Officers: independent institutions of higher education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most peace officers have jurisdiction throughout the state, but many have limited powers outside their political subdivision. Some peace officers require special permission to carry firearms. Powers are often limited to performance of peace officers' primary duties (usually, enforcement of specific laws within their political subdivision); however, most have [[power of arrest]] anywhere in the state for any [[crime|public offense]]&lt;ref&gt;
Public offenses in California include [[infraction]]s, [[misdemeanor]]s, and [[felony|felonies]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
that poses immediate danger to person or property.

A private person (i.e., ordinary citizen) [[Citizen's arrest|may arrest another person]] for an offense committed in the arresting person's presence, or if the other person has committed a [[felony]] whether or not in the arresting person's presence (Penal Code §&amp;nbsp;837),&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code, Part 2, Title 3, [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=837. Chapter 5, Arrest and by Whom Made], §&amp;nbsp;837.&lt;/ref&gt; though such an arrest when an offense has not actually occurred leaves a private person open to criminal prosecution and civil liability for [[false arrest]]. A peace officer may:
* without an [[arrest warrant]], arrest a person on [[probable cause]] that the person has committed an offense in the officer's presence, or if there is probable cause that a felony has been committed and the officer has probable cause to believe the person to be arrested committed the felony. (Penal Code §&amp;nbsp;836).&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code, Part 2, Title 3, [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=836. Chapter 5, Arrest and by Whom Made], §&amp;nbsp;836.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Is immune from civil liability for false arrest if, at the time of arrest, the officer had probable cause to believe the arrest was lawful.

Persons are required to comply with certain instructions given by a peace officer, and certain acts (e.g., battery) committed against a peace officer carry more severe penalties than the same acts against a private person. It is unlawful to resist, delay, or obstruct a peace officer in the course of the officer's duties (Penal Code §&amp;nbsp;148&lt;nowiki&gt;[a][1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code, Part 1, Title 7, [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=148. Chapter 7, Other Offenses Against Public Justice], §148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York State===
{{Main|Law enforcement in New York#Peace officers}}
New York State grants peace officers very specific powers under NYS [[Criminal Procedure Law]], that they may make [[Warrant (law)|warrantless]] arrests, use physical and deadly force, and issue [[summons]]es under section 2.20 of that law.&lt;ref name="nys"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$$CPL2.20$$@TXCPL02.20+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=45238433+&amp;TARGET=VIEW |title=Section 2.20 Powers of peace officers |work=New York State Assembly |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a full list of peace officers under Section 2.10 of that law.&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt;  Below are some examples.

# That state has law enforcement agencies contained within existing [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] departments that employ sworn peace officers to investigate and enforce laws specifically related to the department.  Most often, these departments employ sworn Investigators (separate from the New York State Police) that have statewide investigative authority pursuant to the departments mission.
# The New York State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) is a state investigative agency housed under the State Department of Health.  Narcotic Investigators with the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement are sworn peace officers who carry firearms, make arrests, and enforce the New York State Controlled Substances Act, [[New York State Penal Law]], and [[New York State Public Health Law]].
# The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance employs sworn peace officers as Excise Tax Investigators and Revenue Crimes Investigators.  These State Investigators carry firearms, make arrests, and enforce New York State Penal Law related to tax evasion and other crimes.  Excise Tax Investigators may execute Search Warrants.
# The [[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) [[New York State DMV Division of Field Investigations|Division of Field Investigation]] also employ sworn peace officers as State Investigators.  All DMV Investigators carry [[Glock 23]] firearms and enforce New York State Penal Law and [[New York Vehicle and Traffic Law]]. The DMV Division of Field Investigation investigates auto theft, odometer tampering, fraudulent documents and identity theft crimes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003''' (c 28) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which regulates the [[legal deposit]] of publications in the [[United Kingdom]]. The bill for this Act was a [[private member's bill]]. This Act was passed to update the legislation on legal deposit to reflect the digital age.

The previous provisions covering legal deposit in the United Kingdom were under the [[Copyright Act 1911]]. They covered published paper products of almost all types, excluding only [[ephemera]] such as diaries and bus timetables. By the beginning of the 21st century many publications appeared in electronic form, either exclusively or in addition to their print form. A voluntary set of rules for deposit had been drawn up a few years earlier but it was felt that the additional force of statute was required to ensure the British national published record remained complete.

As under the previous legislation there are six libraries entitled to printed works. The [[British Library]] is entitled to a copy of every printed work published in the United Kingdom. A publisher must send a copy to the British Library within a month of the work being published. The copy sent to the British Library must be of the same quality as the best copies published in the UK at the time.

The other five libraries, the [[Bodleian Library]], the [[Cambridge University Library]], the [[Library of Trinity College, Dublin]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and the [[National Library of Scotland]] are not automatically entitled to be sent a copy of the printed works. However, the five libraries have the right to send a publisher a request for a printed work within twelve months of the publication of the work. The publisher must deliver a copy within a month of receipt of the request. The quality of works sent to any of the five libraries must be of the same quality as the largest number of copies of the work published in the UK at the time of the request. Trinity College Dublin is included in the Act despite it being outside the UK's jurisdiction, as the Act continued the more ancient right bestowed on the college in 1801, when [[Ireland]] was part of [[Acts of Union 1800|the Union]].

Each of these five libraries sends requests via the [[Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries]], who receives copies of the works and distributes them to the individual libraries. Publishers may also send copies to the Agency in advance of a request being submitted to them. 

The 2003 Act includes provisions for the deposit of non-print publications such as [[CD-ROM]]s and copies of [[website]]s. The Secretary of State is given powers to make regulations governing the deposit of non-print publications. The regulations are permitted to include such things as provisions determining how and when a non-print publication must be deposited; when an online work is considered to be published in the UK and therefore subject to the 2003 Act; the quality and means of delivery of the copy of the work; the format that the deposited copy must be presented in where different formats of the work exist; an obligation to give the deposit library information to make the work accessible and the timing when deposit must be made. There are also restrictions put in place as to the activities that may be undertaken with the non-print publications, unless those activities are authorised by regulations made by the Secretary of State. Those restrictions include copying the material, adapting a computer program or database, lending the material, transferring the material to a third party or disposing of the material. Even the using of the material is prohibited subject to regulations stating otherwise. The power to make regulations restricting various matters, including when non-print publications may be used, which readers may use the material and how many people may use a non-print publication at once is also provided for. The 2003 Act also contains provisions that prevent regulations meaning publishers must deposit non-print publications at Trinity College, Dublin unless Irish law on copyright and related rights contains equivalent protections to British copyright law, that the restrictions on the acts that may be done with non-print publications are equivalent to British law and that the liability exceptions in Irish law are equivalent to those in British law.

The 2003 Act also inserted various exceptions to copyright and database right into the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] and the [[Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997]] to prevent the use of non-print publications by deposit libraries infringing copyright and/or [[Sui generis database right#United Kingdom|database rights]]. However, the 2003 Act enabled regulations to be made restricting the exceptions to copyright for non-print publications so that deposited works may not be copied more freely than an equivalent work available at an ordinary library. Various exemptions from liability against breach of contract; infringement of copyright, database right or [[publication right]]; criminal liability or damages for defamation were also enacted by the 2003 Act to protect deposit libraries using works and publishers sending works to deposit libraries from actions for breach of those liabilities that could otherwise occur.

Section 16 of the 2003 Act and the power to make regulations came into force upon [[Royal Assent]] of the 2003 Act. The rest of the Act was brought into force on 1 February 2004 by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/130/article/2/made article 2] of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/130/contents/made Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2004] (SI 2004/130) (C 5). The 2003 Act extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.

This '''list of confidence tricks and scams''' should not be considered complete, but covers the most common examples. [[Confidence tricks]] and scams are difficult to classify, because they change often and often contain elements of more than one type. Throughout this list, the perpetrator of the confidence trick is called the "con artist" or simply "artist", and the intended victim is the "mark". Particular scams are mainly directed toward elderly people, as they may be [[Credulity|credulous]] and sometimes inexperienced and/or insecure, especially when the scam involves modern technology such as computers and the internet.

==Get-rich-quick schemes==
[[Get-rich-quick scheme]]s are extremely varied; these include fake [[franchising|franchises]], [[real estate]] "sure things", get-rich-quick books, wealth-building seminars, [[self-help]] gurus, sure-fire inventions, useless products, [[chain letter]]s, [[fortune-telling|fortune tellers]], [[quackery|quack]] doctors, miracle [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[foreign exchange fraud]], [[#Spanish Prisoner|Nigerian money scams]], and [[amulet|charms and talismans]]. Variations include the [[pyramid scheme]], the [[Ponzi scheme]], and the [[matrix scheme]].

[[Salting (confidence trick)|Salting]] or "salting the mine" are terms for a scam in which [[gemstone]]s or [[gold|gold ore]] are planted in a [[mining|mine]] or on the landscape, duping the mark into purchasing shares in a worthless or non-existent mining company.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Plazak ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-87480-840-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[gold rush]]es, scammers would load [[shotgun]]s with gold dust and shoot into the sides of the mine to give the appearance of a rich ore, thus "salting the mine". Examples include the [[diamond hoax of 1872]] and the [[Bre-X]] gold fraud of the mid-1990s. This trick was featured in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', when [[Al Swearengen]] and [[E. B. Farnum]] trick Brom Garret into believing gold is to be found on the claim Swearengen intends to sell him. This con was also featured in "[[Sneaky Pete]]".

===Spanish Prisoner{{anchor|Spanish Prisoner|Advance fee fraud|Nigerian scam}}===
The [[Spanish Prisoner]] scam – and its modern variant, the [[advance-fee scam]] or "[[419 scams|Nigerian letter scam]]". The basic premise involves enlisting the mark to aid in retrieving some stolen money from its hiding place. The victim sometimes believes he can cheat the con artists out of their money, but anyone trying this has already fallen for the essential con by believing that the money is there to steal (see also [[Black money scam]]). Note that the classic Spanish Prisoner trick also contains an element of the romance scam (see below).

Many con men employ extra tricks to keep the victim from going to the [[police]]. A common ploy of investment scammers is to encourage a mark to use money concealed from tax authorities. The mark cannot go to the authorities without revealing that he has committed [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax fraud]]. Many swindles involve a minor element of crime or some other misdeed. The mark is made to think that he will gain money by helping fraudsters get huge sums out of a country (the classic advance-fee fraud/Nigerian scam); hence a mark cannot go to the police without revealing that he planned to commit a crime himself.

In a twist on the Nigerian fraud scheme, the mark is told he is helping someone overseas collect debts from corporate clients. Large [[cheque]]s stolen from businesses are mailed to the mark. These cheques are altered to reflect the mark's name, and the mark is then asked to cash them and transfer all but a percentage of the funds (his [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]) to the con artist. The cheques are often completely genuine, except that the "pay to" information has been expertly changed. This exposes the mark not only to enormous debt when the bank reclaims the money from his account, but also to criminal charges for [[money laundering]]. A more modern variation is to use [[laser printer|laser-printed]] counterfeit cheques with the proper bank account numbers and payer information.

==Persuasion tricks==
Persuasion fraud, when fraudsters persuade people only to target their money, is an old-fashioned type of fraud.

===Grandparent scam===
A grandparent gets a call or e-mail from someone claiming to be their grandchild, saying that they are in trouble abroad. For instance, the scammer may claim to have been arrested and require money to be wired for bail, and asks the victim not to tell the grandchild's parents, as they would "only get upset". The call is fraudulent impersonation, the name of the grandchild typically obtained from [[social media]] postings, and any money [[wire transfer|wired]] out of the country is gone forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-grandparent-scam|title=Don't Let Grandparent Scam Happen to You|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romance scam===
The traditional [[romance scam]] has now moved into [[online dating service|Internet dating]] sites. The con actively cultivates a [[romantic love|romantic relationship]] which often involves promises of marriage. However, after some time, it becomes evident that this Internet "sweetheart" is stuck in his or her home country or a third country, lacking the money to leave and thus unable to be united with the mark. The scam then becomes an [[advance-fee fraud]] or a [[check fraud]]. A wide variety of reasons can be offered for the trickster's lack of cash, but rather than just borrow the money from the victim (advance fee fraud), the con-man normally declares that he has checks which the victim can cash on his behalf and remit the money via a non-reversible transfer service to help facilitate the trip ([[check kiting|check fraud]]). Of course, the checks are forged or stolen and the con-man never makes the trip: the hapless victim ends up with a large debt and an [[Broken heart|aching heart]]. This scam can be seen in the movie ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]''.

In some cases, an online dating site [[online dating service#Misleading advertising|is itself engaged in fraud]], posting profiles of fictional persons or persons which the operator knows are not currently looking for a date in the advertised locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/facebook-info-sharing-created-zoosk-com-dating-profile-for-married-woman-1.2844953|title=Facebook info sharing created Zoosk.com dating profile for married woman|date=24 November 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortune-telling fraud===
One traditional swindle involves [[fortune telling]]. In this scam, a fortune teller uses [[cold reading]] skills to detect that a client is genuinely troubled rather than merely seeking entertainment; or is a gambler complaining of bad [[luck]]. The fortune teller informs the mark that he is the victim of a [[curse]], and that for a fee a spell can be cast to remove the curse. In [[Romany language|Romany]], this trick is called ''bujo'' ("bag") after one traditional format: the mark is told that the curse is in his money; he brings money in a bag to have the spell cast over it, and leaves with a bag of worthless paper.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Zellner, William M. Kephart, ''Extraordinary groups: an examination of unconventional lifestyles'' (Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|1-57259-953-7}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=izrSSWrKu8cC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=bujo+gypsy+scam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oktYov9_dK&amp;sig=psavI5uf3jd-pQZnvWudOs2R7dA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ci7jTNT1O8ainQeM6IDoDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 121–22]&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of this scam has been one justification for legislation that makes fortune telling a crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritual Psychic Science Church v. City of Azusa'' (1985) 39 Cal.3d 501, 217 Cal.Rptr. 225; 703 P.2d 1119&lt;/ref&gt; See the "Blessing Scam" below.

This scam got a new lease on life in the electronic age with the [[virus hoax]]. [[Rogue security software|Fake anti-virus software]] falsely claims that a computer is infected with viruses, and renders the machine inoperable with bogus warnings unless blackmail is paid. In the Datalink Computer Services incident, a mark was fleeced of several millions of dollars by a firm that claimed that his computer was infected with viruses, and that the infection indicated an elaborate conspiracy against him on the Internet.&lt;ref name="WCDA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westchesterda.net/pressreleases/001108mkarraign.htm|title=Heir to Schlumberger OILfield services fortune fleeced of at least six million dollars|date=November 8, 2010 |work=Press Release|publisher=Westchester County District Attorney|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EL-GHOBASHY"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703957804575602993406810012|title=Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam |last=El-Ghobashy|first=Tamer|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/nyregion/09fraud.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Man Held in Defrauding Roger Davidson, Musician|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=9 November 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged scam lasted from August 2004 through October 2010 and is estimated to have cost the victim $6–20 million.&lt;ref name="WCDA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zetter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/pianist-composer-bilked|title=Computer Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam Targeting Pianist Composer |last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=November 9, 2010 |work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold brick scams==
Gold brick scams involve selling a tangible item for more than it is worth; they are named after selling the victim an allegedly golden ingot which turns out to be gold-coated lead.

===Green goods===
The [[green goods scam]], also known as the "green goods game", was a scheme popular in the 19th-century United States in which people were duped into paying for worthless [[counterfeit]] money. It is a variation on the [[pig-in-a-poke]] scam using money instead of other goods like a pig. The mark, or victim, would respond to flyers circulated throughout the country by the scammers ("green goods men") which claimed to offer "genuine" counterfeit currency for sale. This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed to travel to the location of the green goods men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a "[[accomplice|steerer]]" to be shown large amounts of genuine currency – represented to be counterfeit – which was then placed in a bag or [[satchel]]. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the "ringer") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim accordingly risked [[arrest]].

===Pig in a poke (cat in a bag)===
[[Pig in a poke]] originated in the late [[Middle Ages]]. The con entails a sale of what is claimed to be a small pig, in a poke (bag). The bag actually contains a cat (not particularly prized as a source of meat). If one buys the bag without looking inside it, the person has bought something of less value than was assumed, and has learned first-hand the lesson ''[[caveat emptor]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} "Buying a pig in a poke" has become a [[colloquialism|colloquial expression]] in many European languages, including English, for when someone buys something without examining it beforehand.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In some regions the "pig" in the phrase is replaced by "cat", referring to the bag's actual content, but the saying is otherwise identical.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This is also said to be where the phrase "[[letting the cat out of the bag]]" comes from, although there may be other explanations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In Portuguese or Spanish speaking countries, the "pig" in the phrase is replaced by a hare or jackrabbit. A victim thinks he is buying a hare, when in reality he is buying a cat, hence the expression "gato por lebre" (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) or "gato por liebre" (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Thai gems===
The Thai [[gem scam]] involves layers of con men and helpers who tell a tourist in [[Bangkok]] of an opportunity to earn money by buying [[duty (economics)|duty-free]] jewelry and having it shipped back to the tourist's home country. The mark is driven around the city in a [[tuk-tuk]] operated by one of the con men, who ensures that the mark meets one helper after another, until the mark is persuaded to buy the jewelry from a store also operated by the swindlers. The gems are real but significantly overpriced. This scam has been operating for twenty years in Bangkok, and is said to be protected by Thai police and politicians. A similar scam usually runs in parallel for custom-made suits. Many tourists are hit by con men touting both goods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===White-van speakers===
In the [[white van speaker scam]], low-quality [[loudspeaker]]s are sold—stereotypically from a white van—as expensive units that have been greatly discounted. The salesmen explain the ultra-low price in a number of ways; for instance, that their employer is unaware of having ordered too many speakers, so they are sneakily selling the excess behind the boss's back. The "speakermen" are ready to be haggled down to a seemingly minuscule price, because the speakers they are selling, while usually functional, actually cost only a tiny fraction of their "list price" to manufacture. The scam may extend to the creation of Web sites for the bogus brand, which usually sounds similar to that of a respected loudspeaker company. They will often place an ad for the speakers in the "For sale" Classifieds of the local newspaper, at the exorbitant price, and then show the mark a copy of this ad to "verify" their worth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

People shopping for [[copyright infringement of software|bootleg software]], illegal pornographic images, bootleg music, drugs, firearms or other forbidden or controlled goods may be legally hindered from reporting swindles to the police. An example is the "big screen TV in the back of the truck": the TV is touted as "hot" (stolen), so it will be sold for a very low price. The TV is in fact defective or broken; it may in fact not even be a television at all, since some scammers have discovered that a suitably decorated oven door will suffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Iraqi Dinar===
[[Iraqi dinar#Speculation|Iraqi currency]] is sold to would-be investors with the belief that economic/financial circumstances will drastically increase the value of their investment. In fact there is no credible rationale or information to indicate that those circumstances will materialize or, if they do materialize, that they will have significant effect on the value of the currency.  Moreover, the dealers sell currency to these investors at substantial mark-up such that a significant appreciation of the currency would be required just to make their investment break even.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Investopedia.com_December_28_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/081314/iraqi-dinar-investment-wise-investment.asp |title=Is the Iraqi Dinar Investment a Wise Investment? |newspaper=Investopedia.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Amltf.com_December_28_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |title=Warning: Iraqi Dinar scam on the rise...again! |publisher=AMLTF Consulting Agency of Canada |website=Amltf.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205054812/http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |archivedate=February 5, 2016 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Cnbc.com_December_28_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/inside-a-24-million-investment-scam-buy-the-iraqi-dinar.html |title=Inside a $24 million investment scam: Buy the Iraqi dinar |newspaper=Cnbc.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extortion or false-injury tricks==

===Badger game===
The [[badger game]] extortion was perpetrated largely upon married men. The mark is deliberately coerced into a compromising position, a supposed affair for example, then threatened with public exposure of his acts unless blackmail money is paid.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Bogus dry-cleaning bill scam===
A [[mail fraud]] that is typically perpetrated on restaurateurs, this scheme takes a receipt from a legitimate [[dry cleaner]] in the target city, duplicates it thousands of times, and sends it to every upscale eatery in town. An attached note claims a server in the victim's restaurant spilled food, coffee, wine or salad dressing on a diner's expensive suit of clothes, and demands reimbursement for dry cleaning costs. As the amount fraudulently claimed from each victim is relatively low, some will give the scammers the benefit of the doubt, or simply seek to avoid the nuisance of further action, and pay the claim.

The scam's return address is a drop box; the rest of the contact information is fictional or belongs to an innocent third party. The original dry cleaning shop, which has nothing to do with the scheme, receives multiple irate enquiries from victimised restaurateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-08-13/news/9908130225_1_restaurant-association-maryland-restaurants-restaurants-statewide|title=Restaurants statewide receive fraudulent claims for damages|work=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/11/dry-cleaning-scam-targets-restaurants/|title=Dry-cleaning scam targets restaurants|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Walesonline.co.uk_December_28_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/restaurant-owners-wales-warned-dry-cleaning-2129538 |title=Restaurant owners in Wales warned about dry-cleaning bill scam  |newspaper=Walesonline.co.uk |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clip joint===
A [[clip joint]] or "fleshpot" is an establishment, usually a [[strip club]] or entertainment [[bar]], typically one claiming to offer [[striptease|adult entertainment]] or [[bottle service]], in which customers are tricked into paying money and receive poor, or no, goods or services in return. Typically, clip joints suggest the possibility of sex, charge excessively high prices for watered-down drinks, then eject customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money. The product or service may be illicit, offering the victim no recourse through official or legal channels.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Coin-matching game===
Also called a [[coin-matching game|coin smack or smack game]], two operators trick a victim during a game where coins are matched. One operator begins the game with the victim, then the second joins in. When the second operator leaves briefly, the first colludes with the victim to cheat the second operator. After rejoining the game, the second operator, angry at "losing," threatens to call the police. The first operator convinces the victim to pitch in [[hush money]], which the two operators later split.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Fraudulent collection agencies===
A consumer inquires about a payday loan or short-term credit online and is asked for a long list of personal information. The lender is a shell firm; the loan might never be made, but the victim's personal information is now in the hands of scammers who sells it to a fraudulent collection agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraud.org/news/61-phantom-debt-collectors|title=Don't get spooked by phantom debt collectors|publisher=Fraud.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022014532/http://fraud.org/news/61-phantom-debt-collectors|archivedate=2014-10-22|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0258-fake-debt-collectors|title=Fake Debt Collectors|publisher=US [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; That agency then launches into a series of harassing phone calls at all hours (often to the victim's workplace), attempts to obtain bank account numbers (allowing the account to be drained through direct withdrawal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scambusters.org/debt.html|title=The Newest Debt Collection Scams.html|publisher=ScamBusters}}&lt;/ref&gt; or impersonates police (sometimes with [[caller ID spoofing]]) to threaten the victim with arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.news10.net/news/article/245844/2/Yuba-City-woman-targeted-in-elaborate-debt-collection-scam|title=Fake debt collector, phony officer part of terrifying phone scam|work=news10.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112062912/http://archive.news10.net/news/article/245844/2/Yuba-City-woman-targeted-in-elaborate-debt-collection-scam|archivedate=2014-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/10/us-defendants-who-allegedly-abetted-fake-debt-collector-calls|title=U.S. Defendants Who Allegedly Abetted Fake Debt Collector Calls from India Agree to Settle FTC Charges|publisher=US FTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/blog/2013/03/beware-debt-collection-phone-scams/|title=Beware debt collection phone scams!|work=BBB Consumer News and Opinion Blog|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102062852/http://www.bbb.org/blog/2013/03/beware-debt-collection-phone-scams/|archivedate=2014-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fake debt collectors often refuse to provide a legally-required written "validation notice" of the debt, provide no evidence a debt is actually owed and demand payment using a money transfer service like Moneygram or Western Union with poor traceability and no chargeback protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/10/26/money-scams-debt-collection-how-to-spot-con-fake/|title=Money Scams: How to Spot a Fake Debt Collector|author=Matt Brownell|work=DailyFinance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying debt either doesn't exist, is not valid due to a [[statute of limitations]] or does not lawfully belong to the entity making the calls; in some cases, the victim is a target of [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0280-identity-theft-and-debt-collection|title=Identity Theft and Debt Collection|publisher=US FTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bogus or fraudulent law firms===
A bogus or dishonest law firm is a valuable tool to a scammer in various ways. It can send requests for upfront payments in relation to inheritances coming from unknown relatives, a form of [[advance fee fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globallegalpost.com/global-view/bogus-law-firm-alerts-up-by-20-pc-79482770/|title=Bogus law firm alerts up by 20 pc|publisher=Global Legal Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes an effective fraudulent collection agency, as victims fear having to pay their own counsel hundreds of dollars per hour to defend against frivolous, vexatious or completely unfounded claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/25/wonga-compensation-bill-unfair-misleading-practices|title=Wonga to pay £2.6m compensation for fake debt firm letters|author=Rupert Jones|work=Guardian UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the dishonest lawyer is merely part of a larger fraudulent scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/30/business/personal-finance-when-a-lawyer-steals-your-money.html|title=Personal Finance: When a Lawyer Steals Your Money|date=30 April 1989|publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real estate fraud may involve taking deposits for a project under construction where,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/manhattan-u.s.-attorney-and-fbi-assistant-director-in-charge-announce-arrests-of-real-estate-investment-company-owner-and-new-york-attorney-in-connection-with-4.7-million-real-estate-fraud-scheme|title=Manhattan U.S. Attorney and FBI Assistant Director in Charge Announce Arrests of Real Estate Investment Company Owner and New York Attorney in Connection with $4.7 Million Real Estate Fraud Scheme|work=US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in theory, the lawyer is holding the money in [[escrow]], guarding [[down payment]]s as [[trust fund]] assets until a [[real estate]] deal closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/June13/AdamsEdwardPleaPR.php|title=New York Attorney Pleads Guilty To Participating In Multi-Million Dollar Real Estate Fraud Scheme|publisher=US Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the project is never completed, investors seek their money back but find the supposed trust fund is empty as both lawyer and real estate developer are fraudulent.

===Insurance fraud===
[[Insurance fraud]] includes a wide variety of schemes in which insureds attempt to defraud their own insurance carriers, but when the victim is a private individual, the con artist tricks the mark into damaging, for example, the con artist's car, or injuring the con artist, in a manner that the con artist can later exaggerate. One relatively common scheme involves two cars, one for the con artist, and the other for the [[shill]]. The con artist will pull in front of the victim, and the shill will pull in front of the con artist before slowing down. The con artist will then slam on his brakes to "avoid" the shill, causing the victim to rear-end the con artist. The shill will accelerate away, leaving the scene. The con artist will then claim various exaggerated injuries in an attempt to collect from the victim's insurance carrier despite having intentionally caused the accident. Insurance carriers, who must spend money to fight even those claims they believe are fraudulent, frequently pay out thousands of dollars—a tiny amount to the carrier despite being a significant amount to an individual—to settle these claims instead of going to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What factors impact auto insurance rates? |url=http://www.ifaauto.com/faq/rate.asp |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this scam occurs in countries where insurance premiums are generally tied to a [[bonus-malus]] rating: the con artist will offer to avoid an insurance claim, settling instead for a cash compensation. Thus, the con artist is able to evade a professional damage assessment, and get an untraceable payment in exchange for sparing the mark the expenses of a lowered merit class.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Gambling tricks==

===Fiddle game===
The fiddle game uses the [[pigeon drop]] technique. A pair of con men work together, one going into an expensive restaurant in shabby clothes, eating, and claiming to have left his wallet at home, which is nearby. As collateral, the con man leaves his only worldly possession, the [[violin]] that provides his livelihood. After he leaves, the second con man swoops in, offers an outrageously large amount (for example $50,000) for what he calls a rare instrument, then looks at his watch and runs off to an appointment, leaving his card for the mark to call him when the fiddle-owner returns. The "poor man" comes back, having gotten the money to pay for his meal and redeem his violin. The mark, thinking he has an offer on the table from the second conspirator, then buys the violin from the [[violin|fiddle player]] who "reluctantly" agrees to sell it for a certain amount that still allows the mark to make a "profit" from the valuable violin. The result is the two con men are richer (less the cost of the violin), and the mark is left with a cheap instrument.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The fiddle game may be played with any sufficiently valuable-seeming piece of property; a common variation known as the pedigreed-dog swindle uses a [[Mongrel|mongrel dog]] upsold as a rare breed but is otherwise identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53464289|title=Low life: lures and snares of old New York|last=Sante|first=Luc|date=2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus Giroux|year=|isbn=0374528993|edition=1st Farrar, Straus Giroux pbk.|location=New York|pages=170|oclc=53464289}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode of the television series ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'', "Cops and Robbers", employs this variation of the fiddle game,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} as does [[The Streets]]' song "Can't Con an Honest John".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

As a well-known scam, the fiddle game and its variants have formed the basis for a number of fictional interpretations,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} sometimes with unusual variations on the valuable item. In the 1981 ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' episode "[[Cash and Curry]]", the main character, Del Boy, is tricked into paying £2000 for a statue worth £17, believing it to be worth £4000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/onlyfools/series1/cashandcurry.shtml |title=Cash and Curry, episode synopsis, www.bbc.co.uk, accessed 1 August 2010 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=1981-09-22 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiddle game scam was also described in the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[American Gods]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} where the perpetrator ironically specifies that he "personally made it a point of honor never to pay more than five dollars for any" of the violins he used in his scams.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The traditional version of this trick is used in episodes of the British sitcom ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' and its US incarnation as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' (episode 36, "[[List of Sanford and Son episodes#Season 2: 1972-1973|Pot Luck]]").{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

An episode of the American TV series ''[[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]]'' titled "The Studio Job" featured a version of a fiddle game where the "fiddle" was the rights to a country music recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/295118|title=Christian Kane is singing a totally different tune on 'Leverage' (Includes interview and first-hand account)|date=2010-07-25|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' episode [[Marco (Better Call Saul)|''Marco'']], the protagonist and a friend execute a number of short cons together, including both a traditional fiddle game and a variation using a common [[Kennedy half-dollar]] sold for a high price as a supposedly valuable mis-print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/04/06/better-call-saul-finale-recap-can-you-keep-a-secret/|title=‘Better Call Saul’ finale recap: Can you keep a secret?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near-identical examples of the fiddle game are seen in ''[[Lovejoy]]''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and ''[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]'', where it is combined with art counterfeiting.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In "The Real Thing", the seventh episode of the first series of ''Lovejoy'', Jimmy shows Lovejoy a 'genuine George Vincent' painting he has bought for £550 from a reluctant seller who asked him to mind it. Lovejoy immediately recognises the scam and asks Jimmy whether a dealer had come in before Jimmy bought it and offered a few thousand pounds for it. Lovejoy then tells Jimmy: "The most valuable thing you've got there is the frame, and that's worth about ten quid." In the first episode of the fifth series of ''Monarch of the Glen'', Molly arranges for an arts dealer to repair an item of furniture. The dealer claims the repairs cost more than had been arranged and that he would need to keep the piece to cover his costs as Molly cannot afford to pay his invoice. Later, Andrew uses his painting skills to create a counterfeit painting, which Golly leaves with the dealer to appraise. Andrew then offers substantially more for it, promising to return with the cash. Golly then exchanges the painting for Molly's furniture, which he and Andrew return to her.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

This scam was recently pulled off, nearly by the book, in the TV show ''Imposters'' in Season 2, Episode 2, "Trouble Maybe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7316554/reference|title="Imposters" Trouble Maybe (TV Episode 2018)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glim-dropper===
The glim-dropper scam is a variation of the fiddle game. It requires several accomplices, one of whom must be a one-eyed man. One grifter goes into a store and pretends he has lost his glass eye. Everyone looks around, but the eye cannot be found. He declares that he will pay a thousand-dollar reward for the return of his eye, leaving contact information. The next day, an accomplice enters the store and pretends to find the eye. The storekeeper (the intended griftee), thinking of the reward, offers to take it and return it to its owner. The finder insists he will return it himself, and demands the owner's address. Thinking he will lose all chance of the reward, the storekeeper offers a hundred dollars for the eye. The finder bargains him up to $250, and departs. The one-eyed man, of course, cannot be found and does not return.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} (Described in ''[[A Cool Million|A Cool Million, or, The Dismantling of Lemuel Pitkin]]'' (1934) by [[Nathanael West]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}). Variants of this con have been used in movies such as ''[[The Flim-Flam Man]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Traveller (1997 film)|The Traveller (1997)]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Shade (film)|Shade (2003)]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and ''[[Zombieland|Zombieland (2009)]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and also in books such as ''[[American Gods]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Lottery fraud by proxy===
Lottery fraud by proxy is a scam in which the scammer buys a lottery ticket with old winning numbers. He or she then alters the date on the ticket so that it appears to be from the day before, and therefore a winning ticket. He or she then sells the ticket to the mark, claiming it is a winning ticket, but for some reason, he or she is unable to collect the prize (not eligible, etc.). The particular cruelty in this scam is that if the mark attempts to collect the prize, the fraudulently altered ticket will be discovered and the mark held criminally liable.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This con was featured in the movie [[Matchstick Men (film)|''Matchstick Men'']], where [[Nicolas Cage]] teaches it to his daughter.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A twist on the con was shown in ''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]'', where the more-than-gullible Onizuka was tricked into getting a "winning ticket". The ticket wasn't altered, but the [[newspaper|daily newspaper]] reporting the day's winning numbers was altered with a black pen.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Three-card Monte===

[[Three-card Monte]], "find the queen", the "three-card trick", or "follow the lady" is essentially the same as the centuries-older '''[[shell game]]''' or ''thimblerig'' (except for the [[theatrical property|props]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tom Ogden ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Magic Tricks'', p. 123, Alpha Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-02-862707-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trickster shows three [[playing card]]s to the audience, one of which is a queen (the "lady"), then places the cards face-down, shuffles them around, and invites the audience to bet on which one is the queen. At first the audience is skeptical, so the [[shill]] places a bet, and the scammer allows him to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/12/26/three-card-monte-scam-artists-return-to-midtown/|work=[[New York Post]]|title=Three-card monte scam artists return to midtown|quote=Is this Christmas 2014 – or 1974?|author1=Philip Messing|author2=Steve Cuozzo|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one variation of the game, the shill will (apparently surreptitiously) peek at the lady, ensuring that the mark also sees the card. This is sometimes enough to entice the audience to place bets, but the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to ensure that he always loses, unless the con man decides to let him win, hoping to lure him into betting much more. The mark loses whenever the dealer chooses to make him lose. 

This con appears in the Eric Garcia novel ''[[Matchstick Men (novel)|Matchstick Men]]''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and is featured in the movie ''[[Edmond (film)|Edmond]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The scam is central to the Pulitzer prize-winning play ''[[Topdog/Underdog]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It also appears in episodes of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', [[Now You See Me 2 (movie)|Now You See Me 2]],{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Newsradio]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''[[The Simpsons]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'' (Season 3 Ep 2).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It is seen in foreign films an example of which is "Şark Bülbülü" wıth Kemal Sunal; in Turkish the term "Üç Kağıtçı" meaning 'a three carder' i.e. the dealer of a three-card monte scam; a general term for any fraudster.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A variation on this scam exists in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], but with the addition of a pickpocket.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The dealer and shill behave in an overtly obvious manner, attracting a larger audience. When the pickpocket succeeds in stealing from a member of the audience, he signals the dealer. The dealer then shouts the word "aguas" – colloquial for "Watch Out!" – and the three split up. The audience is left believing that the police are coming, and that the performance was a failed scam.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A variant of this scam exists in Mumbai, India.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The shill says loudly to the dealer that his cards are fake and that he wants to see them. He takes the card and folds a corner and says in a hushed voice to the audience that he has marked the card. He places a bet and wins. Then he asks the others to place bets as well. When one of the audience bets a large sum of money, the cards are switched.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Spurious qualifications or endorsements==

===Diploma mill===
Governmental bodies maintain a list of entities which [[educational accreditation|accredit educational institutions]]. The US Department of Education, for instance, oversees [[higher education accreditation in the United States]].

Most [[diploma mill]]s are not accredited by such an entity, although many obtain accreditation from other organizations (such as [[accreditation mill]]s or corrupt foreign officials) to appear legitimate. Graduates of these institutions risk that the qualifications gained at these institutions may not be sufficient for further study, lawful employment or professional licensure as their issuers do not hold locally-valid accreditation to grant the degrees.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Some diploma mills perform no instruction or examination, instead issuing credentials based on payment and "life experience".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A few have unknowingly issued degrees and credentials to companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Feehan and [http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070228/NEWS03/702280424 "Police dog's bachelor's degree prods legal howling about chief"], ''Toledo Blade'', February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doctor of Divinity]] title is particularly prone to misuse.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} In the [[United Kingdom]] it is an earned postdoctoral credential which requires a string of publications, but in the [[United States]] any church may confer it as an honorary title; [[ordination mill]]s readily grant this doctorate for a moderate fee and token amount of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/23633416/online-ministerial-ordnation-available|title=You, too, can become a minister – online|first=Kimberly|last=Wright|publisher=KPTV|date=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vanity publications and awards===
A [[vanity press]] is a pay-to-publish scheme where a publishing house, typically an [[author mill]], obtains the bulk of its revenues from authors who pay to have their books published&lt;ref name="Glatthorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glatthorn|first=Alan A.|title=Publish or Perish – The Educator's Imperative: Strategies for Writing Effectively for Your Profession and Your School|date=June 15, 2002|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn= 9780761978671|page=84|chapter=9. Publishing (Vanity Press)}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of from readers purchasing the finished books. As the author bears the entire financial risk, the vanity press profits even if the books are not promoted (or badly promoted) and do not sell. The growth of [[print on demand]], which allows small quantities of books to be printed cheaply, has accelerated this trend.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Vanity publishing is not the same as [[self-publishing]], in that self-published authors own their finished books and control their distribution, relying on a [[printer (publishing)|print shop]] solely to turn camera-ready content into printed volumes. In a vanity press, the author takes the financial risk while the publisher owns the printed volumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A [[vanity award]] is an award which the recipient purchases, giving the false appearance of a legitimate honour.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greatermd.bbb.org/vanity-awards-value-money-over-honor/ |title=Vanity Awards Value Money over Honor |work=[[Better Business Bureau]] |date=2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller C.

''Taylor &amp; Francis''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are closely related to the [[Who's Who scam]], where a biographic subject pays for a vanity listing in a printed directory.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Who's Who scam====
Operators of fraudulent "[[Who's Who scam|Who's Who]]"-type directories would offer listings or "membership" to purchasers who are often unaware of the low rates the directories in question are consulted.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====World Luxury Association====
The [[World Luxury Association]] is a self-proclaimed international organisation{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} based in [[China]] that offers "official registration" for luxury brands, and inclusion in an "official list" of luxury brands, in return for a fee.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Online scams==
{{Ref section|date=January 2018}}
{{Main article|Internet fraud}}

===Fake antivirus===
Computer users unwittingly download and install [[rogue security software]], [[malware]] disguised as [[antivirus software]], by following the messages which appear on their screen. The software then pretends to find multiple viruses on the victim's computer, "removes" a few, and asks for payment in order to take care of the rest. They are then linked to con artists' websites, professionally designed to make their bogus software appear legitimate, where they must pay a fee to download the "full version" of their "antivirus software".

===[[Phishing]]===
A modern scam in which the artist communicates with the mark, masquerading as a representative of an official organization with which the mark is doing business, in order to extract personal information which can then be used, for example, to steal money. In a typical instance, the artist sends the mark an email pretending to be from a company, such as [[eBay]]. It is formatted exactly like email from that business, and will ask the mark to "verify" some personal information at the website, to which a link is provided, in order to "reactivate" his blocked account. The website is fake but designed to look exactly like the business' website. The site contains a [[form (web)|form]] asking for personal information such as [[credit card number]]s, which the mark feels compelled to give or lose all access to the service. When the mark submits the form (without double-checking the [[Uniform Resource Locator|website address]]), the information is sent to the swindler.

A similar [[caller ID spoofing]] scheme exists with misleading telephone calls ("vishing") facilitated by [[voice over IP|Internet telephony]]. A fraudster can make calls through an Internet-[[PSTN]] gateway to impersonate banks, police, schools or other trusted entities. A random dialer computer or auto-dialer can impersonate healthcare providers to get Social Security numbers and birthdates from elderly patients recently released from the hospital. The auto-dialer call states it is from a reputable hospital or a pharmacy and the message explains the need to "update records" to be from the hospital or a pharmacy.

Other online scams include [[advance-fee fraud]], [[bidding fee auction]]s ("penny auctions"), [[click fraud]], [[domain slamming]], various [[spoofing attack]]s, [[web-cramming]], and online versions of [[employment scams]], [[romance scam]]s, and [[#fake reward|fake rewards]].

===Fake support call===
{{main article|Technical support scam}}
Unsuspecting computer owners and users are being targeted by people claiming to be from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], i.e., [[Microsoft]] or from their [[internet provider]] and then telling them that their computer/machine is creating errors and they need to correct the faults on their computers. They can even get people to go to one site or another to show them these so-called errors, at which point they are required to give their credit card details in order to purchase some form of support, after which they are asked to allow remote connection to the "error-laden" computer so that the problem(s) may be fixed. At this point the victim's computer is infected with [[malware]] or [[spyware]] or remote connection software such as '''Virtualpcsecure'''. Microsoft has denied any tie to such schemes, but the scams continue regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx |title=Avoid Phone Scams &amp;#124; Cybercriminal Tech Support Scam &amp;#124; Security Threats |publisher=Microsoft |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122200113/http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx |archivedate=2014-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other confidence tricks and scams==

===Art student===
The [[art student scam]] is common{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} in major Chinese cities. A small group of 'students' will start a conversation, citing a wish to practice their English. In short order they will maneuver the conversation over to education and will claim to be art students wishing to take the mark to a free art exhibition, which will usually be in a small, well-hidden rented office. Once there the students will show the mark some art pieces which they claim to be their own work and will try to sell them at a high price, despite the pieces usually being nothing more than a worthless printout. They will often resort to 'guilt tricks' (e.g., introducing their "starving child") to overcome resistance or to discourage price negotiation on the part of the mark.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Bar bill scam===
The bar bill scam is common in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Tourist Scams and Rip-Offs in Europe|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/tourist-scams|website=Rick Steves' Europe|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Budapest, Hungary]].&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourist Advisory for Hungary|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|website=Embassy of the United States|accessdate=10 June 2016|language=English|date=January 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326024226/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|archivedate=26 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budapest Bar Scam|url=http://www.budapestagent.com/budapest-bar-scam.html|website=Budapest Agent|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sylvester|first1=Phil|title=Bar scams: How to enjoy your Sör in peace!|url=https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/eastern-europe/hungary/budapest-bar-scams|website=World Nomads|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=11 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mark, usually a man who is a tourist, is approached by an attractive woman or pair of women who start a conversation, such as asking for directions (pretending to have mistaken the tourist for a local). After a bit of conversation, the women will suggest that they go to a bar that they know of. While there, they order many entrées and drinks and encourage the mark to do the same. Either the menu does not have prices on it or the menu is later switched with one that has higher prices.

When the bill comes, it is many times larger than expected. The women have only a small amount of cash on them, and ask the mark to pay for the bill. The mark is forced to pay before leaving (sometimes with threats of violence), and directed to an ATM on the premises where they can withdraw cash. The women apologize profusely for the situation and arrange to meet the next day to pay them back, but they do not show. In truth, the women are working with the bar and receive a cut of the payment.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy" /&gt;

The con can also be performed with a well-dressed man or a gregarious local rather than an attractive woman. A variation on this is to have a taxi driver recommend the bar to the passenger, who enters alone and orders, not realizing that they will be charged an exorbitant bill. The taxi driver receives a cut of the payment.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy" /&gt;

===Beijing tea===

The Beijing tea scam is a famous variation of the [[Clip Joint]] scam practiced in and around [[Beijing]] and some other large Chinese cities. The artists (usually female and working in pairs) will approach tourists and try to make friends. After chatting, they will suggest a trip to see a [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], claiming that they have never been to one before. The tourist is never shown a menu, but assumes that this is how things are done in China. After the ceremony, the bill is presented to the tourist, charging upwards of $100 per head. The artists will then hand over their bills, and the tourists are obliged to follow suit. Similar scams involving restaurants, coffee shops and bars also take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Big Store===
The Big Store is a technique for selling the legitimacy of a scam and typically involves a large team of con artists and elaborate sets. Often a building is rented and furnished as a legitimate and substantial business.&lt;ref name="The Big Con"&gt;{{Cite book

In 2014, a rural co-operative in [[Nanjing]], [[China]] constructed an entire brick-and-mortar fake bank with uniformed clerks behind counters; the unlicensed bank operated for a little over a year, then defaulted on its obligations, swindling Chinese savers out of 200 million [[Chinese yuan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-30932424 China: Fake bank swindles customers out of $32m] (in English) citing [https://web.archive.org/web/20150123161719/http://paper.nandu.com/nis/201501/23/320735.html 南京惊现“假银行” 装修正规非法吸储2亿元] (Chinese-Simplified)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change raising===
{{Anchor|quick-change artist}}
Change raising, also known as a '''quick-change artist''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aisner |first=Art |url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/saline/saline-police-say-quick-change-artist-scammed-cashier-out-of-100/ |title=Saline police say quick-change artist scammed cashier out of $100 |publisher=AnnArbor.com |date=2010-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a common short con and involves an offer to change an amount of money with someone, while at the same time taking change or bills back and forth to confuse the person as to how much money is actually being changed. The most common form, "the Short Count", has been featured prominently in several movies about grifting, notably ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Criminal (2004 film)|Criminal]]'', ''[[Nine Queens]]'', and ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]''. For example, a con artist shopping at a [[filling station|gas station]] pays for a cheap item (under a dollar) and gives the clerk a ten dollar bill. The con gets back nine ones and the change and then tells the clerk he has a one and will exchange ten ones for a ten. This is what the scam artist is doing: getting the clerk to hand over the $10 '''before''' handing over the $1 bills. Then the scam artist hands over nine ones and the $10. The clerk will assume there has been a mistake and offer to swap the ten for a one. Then the con will probably just say: "Here's another one, give me a $20 and we're even." Notice that the scam artist just swapped $10 for $20. The $10 was the store's money, not the con's. To avoid this con, clerks should keep each transaction separate and never permit the customer to handle the original ten before handing over the ten ones. Another variation is to flash a $20 bill to the clerk, then ask for something behind the counter. When the clerk turns away, the con artist can swap the bill he is holding to a lesser bill. The clerk might then make change for the larger bill, without noticing it has been swapped. The technique may work better when bills are the same color at a glance like, for instance, [[Federal Reserve Note|U.S. dollar bills]].

A similar technique exists when a con comes to a gas station with a young clerk, buying something cheap, showing him an uncommonly huge bill while not giving it and telling the clerk to prepare the change. While he's busy counting the change, the con would ask many questions in order to distract the young clerk. When change is counted and ready the con is acting as if he had given the huge bill. If the clerk does not remember having received the bill, the con will say he gave him the money. If the clerk is weak or distracted enough, he could let the con go away with the change.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Sometimes cab drivers in India try a similar con, when customers require some change back. For example, they may pay $100 for a $60 ride and expect a return of $40. But the con would say that he only received $10 and in fact needs $50 more. The mark is baffled, trying to remember and of course, the con has swiftly switched the $100 bill with a $10 one, waving it to show that this was really what the mark gave to him. Since the con has now made the mark look suspicious, the mark feels guilty and pays up. This scenario can also be created in markets, when vendors sometimes team up and support each other's cons, if the mark tries to resist.

Another variant is to use confusing or misdirected language.  See [[Tens and a Five]].

===Fake casting agent scam===
In this scam, the confidence artist poses as a [[casting agent]] for a [[modeling agency]] searching for new talent. The aspiring model is told that he will need a portfolio or [[comp card]]. The mark will pay an upfront fee to have photos and create his portfolio, after which he will be sent on his way in the hope that his agent will find him work in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.associationofmodelagents.org/become-a-model/beware-rogues.html |title=Beware Rogues &amp;#124; Become A Model |publisher=Association of Model Agents |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, he never hears back from the confidence artist.

In a variation on this scam, the confidence artist is a casting agent involved with the [[adult entertainment industry]]. The mark is taken to the artist's office for an interview, in which she is told that she will have to pose for nude photos or shoot a casting video, usually involving sexual acts. Upon her agreement, the mark is sent on her way, as before. She may not have to pay upfront for a portfolio, but any material generated during her "interview" may be used and sold by the confidence artist without any payment to the mark.

The fake-agent scam is often targeted against industry newcomers, since they will often lack the experience required to spot such tricks.  Legitimate talent agencies advise that a genuine talent agent will ''never'' ask for money up-front, as they make their entire living from commissions on their clients' earnings.

===Phony job offer scam===

Very similar to the casting agent scam is the "job offer" scam in which a victim receives an unsolicited e-mail claiming that they are in consideration for hiring to a new job.  The confidence artist will usually obtain the victim's name from social networking sites, such as [[LinkedIn]] and [[Monster.com]].  In many cases, those running the scams will create fake websites listing jobs which the victim is seeking, then contact the victim to offer them one of the positions.

If the victim responds to the initial e-mail, the scammer will send additional messages to build up the victim's assurance that they are in the running, or have already been selected, for a legitimate job.  This will include asking for the victim's resume as well as assurances that a phone interview will be the "next step in the hiring process".

The goal of the job offer scam is to convince the victim to release funds or bank account information to the scammer of which there are two common methods.  The first is to advise the victim that they must take a test to qualify for the job and then send links to training sites which sell testing material and [[e-books]] for a fee.  The victim may also be provided with an actual on-line test which is usually a fake website created by copying questions from actual certification examinations, such as the [[Professional in Human Resources]] (PHR) certification or the [[Project manager]]'s exam.  if the victim pays for the study material, that will usually be the end of the scam and the scammer will break off further contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/DHR-Search/Austin-Texas/Douglas-Hurley-Reynolds-DHR-Search-Tom-Thomas-Palmer-DHR-Search-Tom-Palmer-Scam-1101165|title=Ripoff Report - DHR Search Complaint Review Austin, Texas: 1101165|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, more sinister variation, is when the scammer will advise the victim they have been hired for a job and request access to bank accounts and routing numbers in order to enter the "new hire" into the company's payroll system.  This may also involve e-mails containing fake tax forms attempting to gain the victim's social security number and other [[personally identifiable information]].  If the victim complies, their bank account will be emptied and their personal information used to commit identity theft.

===Fraudulent directory solicitations===
{{OR section|date=January 2018}}
In this scam, tens of thousands of solicitations in the guise of an invoice are mailed to businesses nationwide. They may contain a disclaimer such as "This is a solicitation for the order of goods or services, or both, and not a bill, invoice, or statement of account due. You are under no obligation to make any payments on account of this offer unless you accept this offer." (from {{USCSub|39|3001|d|2|A}}) or 'THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS OFFER.' (from USPS Domestic Mail Manual §CO31, Part 1.2) but are otherwise designed to appear to be invoices or renewals of existing [[display advertising]] in a trade directory or publication. The correspondence is formatted like an invoice, often with a sequential identification number, date, personalized description of the information to be published, payment details and total amount due which includes a token discount if paid within a specified time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/judicial/admin-decisions/1999/for-98421.htm|title=P. S. Docket No. FOR 98-421|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the company's current advertisement clipped from an existing publication (such as [[Thomas Register]], Hotel and Travel Index or Official Meeting Facilities Guide) is attached to a solicitation for advertising in an unaffiliated, rival publication&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2006/10/ftc-puts-brakes-international-bogus-billing-scam US Federal Trade Commission vs. Michael Robert Petreikis, Gerhard Mintz, 1522838 Ontario Inc.] doing business as International Industrial Trade Directory, American Register of Manufacturers, National Register, Official Register of Commerce and Industry, Traders International Trade Directory, Hotel &amp; Conventions International, Hotel &amp; Resorts International, Hotel Index, International Hotel &amp; Accommodations Directory, International Hotel Index, Official Hotel &amp; Resort Guide, Bradley Siddons &amp; Associates and Foremost Business Supplies.

One variant sends a "Final Notice of Domain Listing" from an entity calling itself "Domain Services", which claims "Failure to complete your Domain name search engine registration by the expiration date may result in cancellation of this offer making it difficult for your customers to locate you on the web." The list of prospective victims is obtained from Internet domain [[whois]] listings and the solicitations look like a renewal of an existing domain name registration or listing. The "registration" actually offers nothing beyond a vague claim that the entity sending the solicitation will submit the victim's domain name to existing search engines for an inflated fee. It does not obligate the vendor to publish a directory, renew the underlying domain in any ICANN-based registry or deliver any tangible product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suespammers.net/domain-services-spam/|title=DOMAIN SERVICES SPAM 212-913-9860|publisher=SueSpammers.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar scheme uses solicitations which appear to be invoices for local [[yellow pages]] listings or advertisements. As anyone can publish a yellow page directory, the promoted book is not the [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]'s local printed directory but a rival, which may have limited distribution if it appears at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/main/cfb28f1ad880960585256cc9006a3a8c!OpenDocument How to Protect Yourself: Yellow Pages Invoice Scam], Florida Attorney General's Office&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of clearly stating [[International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations|audited circulation]], the solicitations will confusingly claim to "offer 50000 copies" or claim "thousands of readers" without indicating whether the inferred quantity of directories was actually printed, let alone sold.

Public records listing legal owners of new [[registered trademark]]s are also mined as a source of addresses for fraudulent directory solicitations.

The intent is that a small fractional percentage of businesses either mistake the solicitations for invoices (paying them) or mistake them for a request for corrections and updates to an existing listing (a tactic to obtain a businessperson's signature on the document, which serves as a pretext to bill the victim).

One such vendor, World Trade Register (aka European Trade Register, World Company Register, World Business Directory, all related to EU Business Services Ltd), claims "To update your company profile, please print, complete and return this form. Updating is free of charge. Only sign if you want to place an insertion." Only later does it become clear that signing the form incurs a nearly €1000/year fee for an advertisement of questionable value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Scam-World-Trade-Register-Business-Registration-Is-Free-but-it-Costs-a-Lot-280317.shtml|title=Scam: World Trade Register Business Registration Is "Free", but It Costs a Lot|author=Eduard Kovacs|date=10 July 2012|work=softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jam Auction===
In this scam, the confidence artist poses as a retail sales promoter, representing a manufacturer, distributor, or set of stores. The scam requires assistants to manage the purchases and money exchanges while the pitchman keeps the energy level up. Passersby are enticed to gather and listen to a pitchman standing near a mass of appealing products. The trickster entices by referring to the high-end products, but claims to be following rules that he must start with smaller items. The small items are described, and 'sold' for a token dollar amount – with as many audience participants as are interested each receiving an item. The pitchman makes an emotional appeal such as saying "Raise your hand if you're happy with your purchase", and when hands are raised, directs his associates to return everyone's money (they keep the product). This exchange is repeated with items of increasing value to establish the expectation of a pattern. Eventually, the pattern terminates by ending the 'auction' without reaching the high-value items, and stopping midway through a phase where the trickster retains the collected money from that round of purchases. Marks feel vaguely dissatisfied, but have goods in their possession, and the uplifting feeling of having demonstrated their own happiness several times. The marks do not realize that the total value of goods received is significantly less than the price paid in the final round. Auction/refund rounds may be interspersed with sales rounds that are not refunded, keeping marks off-balance and hopeful that the next round will refund. The Jam Auction has its roots in [[carny]] culture.

===Money exchange===
This scam occurs when exchanging foreign currency. If a large amount of cash is exchanged the victim will be told to hide the money away quickly before counting it ("You can't trust the locals"). A substantial amount will be missing.

In some cases, insisting on counting to make sure the money is all there is the basis for a clever scam. The scam is sometimes called the Santo Domingo Sting, after an incident that took place there, reported by a journalist, Joe Harkins, who reported his involvement, in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelthenet.com/columns/clips/sting.htm |title=The Santo Domingo Sting |publisher=Travelthenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works in countries where only banks and other designated parties are allowed to hold and exchange the local currency for US dollars at an "official" rate that is significantly lower than the "street" rate. It also requires a greedy tourist who wants to beat the official rate by dealing with illegal money changers. A person posing as an illegal money changer will approach the tourist with an offer to buy dollars at an illegal rate that may be even higher than the street rate. The changer offers to buy only large US currency, typically, a 100 dollar bill. As soon as the victim (the "mark") shows his $100 bill, the changer will actually count out and clearly show the promised amount of local currency. He then will push the local currency into the hands of the "mark" and urge they be counted as he takes the $100. "See, you've got the money. I'll wait while you make sure. Count it out loud so there is no mistake." And as the mark's careful count exceeds "street" rate, the changer pretends to realise he has overpaid the mark, and he becomes irrationally agitated and angry, accusing the mark of cheating. He grabs his money back, pushes the mark's bill back into his hands and takes back the pesos. The scam has been completed. The tourist has just lost $99. The mark has been handed back a prefolded $1 bill that has been swapped for the mark's $100 bill while he was distracted counting the local currency. (Until recently, US currency was largely uniform in size and color, meaning that when folded, a $1 and a $100 bill were almost indistinguishable. Even in 2014, careful folding of a US$100 bill easily conceals the switch).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The money changer's pretended, but very credible, anger is a ruse to confuse the mark and delay his unfolding of the single bill until the scammer has departed.

===Mystery shopping===
There is a fraudulent [[confidence trick]] (a form of [[advance-fee scam]]) perpetrated on people in several countries who wish to be [[mystery shopping|mystery shoppers]]. A person is sent a [[money order]], often from [[Western Union]],&lt;ref name=spotscams/&gt; or cheque for a larger sum than a mystery purchase he is required to make, with a request to deposit it into his [[bank account]], use a portion for a mystery purchase and fee, and wire the remainder through a [[wire transfer]] company such as Western Union or MoneyGram; the money is to be wired immediately as response time is being evaluated. The cheque is fraudulent, and is returned unpaid by the victim's bank, after the money has been wired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Related Items |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre40.shtm |title=Giving the Bounce to Counterfeit Cheque Scams |publisher=US Federal Trade Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scam involved fraudulent [[website]]s using a misspelled [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] to advertise online and in newspapers under a legitimate company's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |title=Residents warned of job ad scam |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322232916/http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be remembered that this is not the only type of mystery shopping scam taking place which involves money being paid, as it has been widely reported in the UK that shoppers should "Watch out for some online mystery shopping scams which will cost you money for either training or for signing up without the promise of any work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysteryshopperjobs.co.uk/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Is Mystery Shopping A Scam? |publisher=Mystery Shopper Jobs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valid mystery shopping companies do not normally send their clients cheques prior to work being completed, and their [[advertisement]]s usually include a contact person and phone number. Some fraudulent cheques can be identified by a financial professional. On February 3, 2009, The [[Internet Crime Complaint Center]] issued a warning on this scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2009/090203.aspx |title=Internet Crime Complaint Center warning |publisher=Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legitimate company that occasionally sends prepayment for large transactions says "We do occasionally fund upfront for very large spend purchases but we use cheques or direct bank transfers which should mean you can see when they are cleared and so can be sure you really do have the money."&lt;ref name=spotscams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mystery-shoppers.co.uk/mystery_shopper_scams.htm |title=Mystery Shopper Scams – How to spot a scam |publisher=Mystery-shoppers.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is standard practice for mystery shopping providers evaluating services such as airlines to arrange for the airfare to be issued beforehand at their own expenses (usually by means of a [[frequent flyer]] reward ticket). In any case, it is unlikely that any bona-fide provider would allocate a high-value assignment to a new shopper or proactively recruit new ones for that purpose, preferring instead to work with a pool of existing pre-vetted experienced shoppers.

===Pigeon drop===
The [[pigeon drop]], which is depicted early in the film ''[[The Sting]]'', involves the mark or pigeon assisting an elderly, weak or infirm stranger to keep a large sum of money safe for him. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money in an envelope or briefcase, with which the mark is then to be entrusted. The container is first switched for an identical one which contains no money, and a situation is engineered giving the mark the opportunity to escape, with the money, from a perceived threat (e.g., local police or rowdies). If the mark does so, he is fleeing from his own money, which the con artist will have kept or handed off to an accomplice.

===Predatory journals===
A number of [[predatory journal]]s target academics to solicit manuscripts for publication. The journals charge high publication fees but do not perform the functions of legitimate academic journals—editorial oversight and peer review—they simply publish the work for cash. In this case, the mark's need for publications is the incentive for them to pay the fees. In some cases, predatory journals will use fictional editorial boards or use respected academics' names without permission to lend a veneer of credibility to the journal. A curated database of predatory journals can be found at "Scholarly Open Access".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422234744/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |archivedate=2014-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotional cheque===
The victim is sent a document which looks, on its face, to be a [[coupon]] or a [[cheque]] for some small amount as "prize winnings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/1-800-charges-linked-to-company-accused-of-targeting-seniors-1.2854371 | title=1-800 charges linked to company accused of targeting seniors | work=CBC | date=December 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 12, 2016 | first=Rosa | last=Marchitelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buried in the fine print is something entirely different; an authorisation to [[telephone slamming|slam]] the victim to an alternative telephony provider or even an authorisation for monthly direct withdrawals from the victim's bank account for "services" which were neither used nor desired.

===Psychic surgery===
[[Psychic surgery]] is a con game in which the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to apparently remove malignant growths from the mark's body. A common form of medical fraud in [[developing country|underdeveloped countries]], it imperils victims who may fail to seek competent medical attention. The movie ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' depicts comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] undergoing psychic surgery. It can also be seen in an episode of ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''.

===Rain making===
[[Rainmaking]] is a simple scam in which the trickster promises to use their power or influence over a complex system to make it do something favourable for the mark.

Classically this was promising to make it rain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/pay_the_rainmaker.htm|title=Nebraska State Historical Society – Should We Pay The Rainmaker?}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more modern examples include getting someone's app 'featured' on an [[app store]], obtaining pass marks in a university entrance exam, obtaining a job, or a politician implying that they can use their influence to get a contract awarded to the mark.

The trickster has no actual influence on the outcome, but if the favourable outcome happens anyway they will then claim credit. 
If the event doesn't happen of course then the trickster may be able to claim that they need more money until it finally does.

===Recovery room===
{{see also|Reloading scam}}
A recovery room scam is a form of [[advance-fee fraud]] where the scammer (sometimes posing as a law enforcement officer or attorney) calls investors who have been sold worthless shares (for example in a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler-room scam]]), and offers to buy them, to allow the investors to recover their investments.&lt;ref name=WWang06&gt;{{cite book |author=Wang, Wallace |title=Steal This Computer Book 4.0 : What They Won't Tell You About the Internet |publisher=No Starch Press |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-59327-105-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nigerian [[419 scam]] victim might receive a solicitation claiming to be from the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or another government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scam-detector.com/financial-scams/fraud-recovery-fund|title=Fraud recovery fund – Financial Scams |work=Scam Detector}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scam involves requiring an advance fee before the payment can take place, for example a "court fee".&lt;ref name="isbn0-7407-5708-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weinberg, Michael C. |title=Careers in Crime: An Applicant's Guide |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |location=Kansas City, MO |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7407-5708-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red flag in the 'recovery scam' is that the supposed investigative agency, unsolicited, approaches the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams|title=Refund and Recovery Scams|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legitimate law enforcement agency would normally allow the victim to make the first contact, and will not solicit an advance fee. The recovery scam has the victim's number only because it is operated by an accomplice of the original scammer, using a "sucker list" from the earlier fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Crimes/Telemarketing/Outbound/Major/Sweepstakes/recovery.htm|title=Scams Offering To Recover Losses From Boiler Room Sweepstake Scams which are themselves Frauds|publisher=Crimes-of-Persuasion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rental scams===
An apartment is listed for rent, often on an online forum such as [[Craigslist]] or [[Kijiji]], at or just below market value. The vendor asks for first and last month's rent up front, sometimes also asking for references or personal information from the prospective tenants. The rent payment clears the bank, the new tenants arrive with a truckload of worldly possessions on moving day to find that the same unit has been rented to multiple other new tenants and that the supposed "landlord" is not the owner of the property and is nowhere to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/craigslist-luxury-rental-scam-leaves-vancouver-tenants-on-the-sidewalk-1.2896233|title=Luxury rental scam leaves would-be renters on the sidewalk|publisher=|first=Natalie|last=Clancy|work=CBC|date=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of scam is often performed online on students planning to study abroad and seeking accommodation, as their means of checking the property are limited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Rip deal===
The Rip Deal is a swindle very popular in [[Europe]] and is essentially a [[pigeon drop]] confidence trick. In a typical variation scammers will target, say, a jeweler, and offer to buy some substantial amount of his wares at a large markup ''provided'' he perform some type of under-the-table cash deal, originally exchanging Swiss francs for euros. This exchange goes through flawlessly, at considerable profit for the mark. Some time later the scammers approach the mark with a similar proposition, but for a larger amount of money (and thus a larger return for the mark). His confidence and greed inspired by the previous deal, the merchant agrees—only to have his money and goods taken, by sleight-of-hand or violence, at the point of exchange.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This scam was depicted in the movie ''[[Matchstick Men (film)|Matchstick Men]]''.

The same term is used to describe a crime where a vendor (especially a drug dealer) is killed to avoid paying for goods.&lt;ref name="isbn1-84310-384-2"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Florence Bruce |author2=Hagell, Ann |author3=Renuka Yeyarajah-dent |title=Children Who Commit Acts of Serious Interpersonal Violence: Messages for Best Practice |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |location=London |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-84310-384-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsolicited goods===
Various schemes exist to bill victims for unsolicited goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocp.ga.gov/news/press-releases/view/fraudulent-invoices-on-the-rise|title=Fraudulent Invoices on the Rise|publisher=ocp.ga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scam targeting businesses is the '''toner bandit''' swindle; an unsolicited caller attempts to trick front-office personnel into providing manufacturer/model or serial numbers for office equipment and/or the name of the employee answering the call. Often, the call will be misrepresented as a "survey" or a "prize" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/is-that-invoice-a-scam/28068176|title=Is that invoice a scam?|author=WJXT|work=News4Jax}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business then receives inflated invoices for unsolicited copy paper, copy machine toner, cleaning supplies, light bulbs, trash bags or other supplies, using the name of the person who answered the call to falsely claim this person ordered the items. When the business objects, the workers are threatened with lawsuits or harassed by bogus collection agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1996/07/small-businesses-churches-nursing-homes-are-targets-bogus|title=Small Businesses, Churches, Nursing Homes Are Targets of Bogus Business Supply Companies|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, targeting the elderly, claims a '''free medical alert device''' has been ordered for a patient by a family member or medical doctor. An automated message says "that someone has ordered a free medical alert system for you, and this call is to confirm shipping instructions" before the call is transferred to a live operator who requests the elderly patient's credit card and identity card numbers. The device is not free; there is a high monthly charge for "monitoring". The family didn't buy or order it, nor did a practitioner; the call is fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/06/09/scam-medical-alert/2397189/|title=Seniors get a warning on medical alert scam|author=Susan Tompor, USA TODAY|date=9 June 2013|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-07-2013/free-medical-alert-device-offers-hurt-more-than-help.html|title=Free Medical Alert Device Scam Targets Seniors|date=July 1, 2013|author=Sid Kirchheimer|work=AARP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedding planner scam===
Wedding planner scams prey on the vulnerability of young couples, during a time when they are most distracted and trusting, to embezzle funds for the planner's personal use. In the first type of fraud, the wedding planner company may offer a free wedding in a tie-up with a media station for a couple in need of charity, and collect the donations from the public that were meant for the wedding. In a second type of fraud, the planner asks couples to write checks to vendors (tents, food, cakes) but leave the name field empty, which the planner promises to fill in. As most vendors were never hired nor paid, the scam would then be exposed on the day of the wedding. A real life example is a Kansas TV station story of a wedding planner, Caitlin Hershberger Theis, who scammed three couples through her wedding planner consultancy, ''Live, Love and be Married'' using these two schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Wedding Planner Scams{{cite news|title=Newlyweds Say Wedding Planner Scammed Them|url=http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|date=June 30, 2011|work=KAKE.com|accessdate=July 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175444/http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|archivedate=January 18, 2012|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Blessing scam===
The [[blessing scam]] targets elderly Chinese immigrant women, convincing them that an evil spirit threatens their family and that this threat can be removed by a blessing ceremony involving a bag filled with their savings, jewelry or other valuables. During the ceremony, the con artists switch the bag of valuables with an identical bag with valueless contents and make off with the victim's cash or jewelry.

===Pay up or be arrested scam===
This scam is perpetrated through the phone where the caller threatens the victim with a fictitious arrest warrant. To make this threat seem real, the [[caller ID spoofing|caller ID]] identifies the caller as that of the local [[sheriff]]. Victims are told they must pay a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] to avoid arrest. Fines are in the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. The payment is requested through [[Western Union]], [[Green Dot Corporation|Green Dot]] [[Prepaid debit card|prepaid card]], or similar form of untraceable currency exchange.

Cases have been reported in [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steph Solis |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/08/arrest-warrant-scams/2619187/ |title=Scam: Caller threatens arrest if you don't pay |publisher=USA Today |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public transport ticket control scam ===

In this scam, the artists pose as ticket control staff on public transport connections. They tend to look for tourists as easy marks, and therefore target train connections from the airport. They will ask to see the passenger's tickets, and once they have found a suitable mark, will claim that something is wrong with the ticket they hold. They will then claim that an instant payment is required to avoid further legal troubles. In some cases, this scam is even committed by actual public transport staff seeking to rip off tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20160623/how-german-train-conductors-exploit-unwitting-tourists-deutsche-bahn-db|title='German ticket collectors saw I was a tourist and milked me'|publisher=The Local Germany|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dropped wallet scam===
The dropped wallet scam usually targets tourists. The con artist pretends to accidentally drop his wallet in a public place. After an unsuspecting victim picks up the wallet and offers it to the con artist, the scam begins. The artist accuses the victim of stealing money from the wallet and threatens to call the police, scaring the victim into returning the allegedly stolen money. Cases have been reported in eastern Europe and major cities or railway stations in China.

'''''Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield''''', 490 U.S. 30 (1989), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]] governed adoptions of Indian children, and a tribal court had jurisdiction over a state court regardless of the location of birth of the child if the child or the natural parents resided on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield'', {{ussc|490|30|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===History of removal===
From 1850 to about 1960, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] children were forcibly taken from their families and their tribes to go to Indian boarding schools, in what has been described as both efforts at [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]] and [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Terri Libesman}}, {{smallcaps|Decolonising Indigenous Child Welfare: Comparative Perspectives}} 108 (2013); {{smallcaps|Ronald Niezen}}, {{smallcaps|Spirit Wars: Native North American Religions in the Age of Nation Building}} 68 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; At the schools, Indian children were expected to speak English and practice Christianity; they were punished for speaking their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Libesman}}, at 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers wanted the Indians to choose "assimilation over extinction."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|David Wallace Adams}}, {{smallcaps|Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875-1928}}, 16 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 approximately 12,000 Indian children were attending [[American Indian boarding schools|Indian boarding schools]],&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Walter L. Hixson}}, {{smallcaps|American Settler Colonialism}} 141 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general purpose of the Government is the preparation of Indian youth for assimilation into the national life by such a course in training as will prepare them for the duties and privileges of American citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Adams}}, at 24.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Many Indians would not become American citizens until Congress passed the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924, although by that time, many were citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Citizenship Act]], June 2, 1924, {{USPL|68|175}}, {{USStat|43|253}}; 4 {{smallcaps|Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties}} 1165 (Charles J. Kappler ed., 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1928 assimilation through the boarding schools was no longer popular with the public, and the [[Meriam Report]] condemned the practice of forcibly removing Indian children from their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Margaret D. Jacobs}}, {{smallcaps|White Mother to a Dark Race: Settler Colonialism, Maternalism, and the Removal of Indigenous Children in the American West and Australia, 1880-1940}}, 407 (2009); {{smallcaps|Niezen}}, at 68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The team that created the Meriam Report was headed by [[Lewis Meriam]], who had a Bachelor's degree in economics and a Master's degree in government from [[Harvard University]], and law degrees from [[National University School of Law]] and [[George Washington University Law School|George Washington University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Institute for Gov't Research}}, {{smallcaps|The Problem of Indian Administration}} 79 (Lewis Meriam et al. eds. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;}} This type of removal ended during the 1930s.

After [[World War II]], the intervention of social welfare workers into overseeing Indian families resulted in another type of removal, by which Indian children were removed from their families because of what were judged poor situations and placed in foster care or for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Boarding School Blues: Revisiting American Indian Educational Experiences}} 205-05 (Clifford E. Trafzer, Jean A. Keller, &amp; Lorene Sisquoc eds., 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the dominant non-Indian culture justified the removal in order to protect or rescue the children from barbarism on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Trafzer, at 206-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian children were placed outside the home at a rate five times greater than for non-Indian children.&lt;ref&gt;3 {{smallcaps|Handbook of Child Psychology: Social, Emotional, and Personality Development}} 481 (William Damon, Richard M. Lerner, &amp; Nancy Eisenberg eds., 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Up to 25-35% of Indian children were placed in foster care at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Billy Joe Jones, Mark Tilden, &amp; Kelly Gaines-Stoner}}, {{smallcaps|The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook: A Legal Guide to the Custody and Adoption of Native American Children}} 2 (2d ed. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Indian Child Welfare Act===
{{See also|Indian Child Welfare Act}}
In 1978, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]] (ICWA).&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Child Welfare Act]], Nov. 8, 1978, {{USPL|95|608}}, {{USStat|92|3069}} (codified at {{usc|25|1901|1963}}).&lt;/ref&gt; This law was enacted to protect tribes and their children; due to the high rate of Indian children who were being removed from their families and placed with non-Indian families, the children's Indian identities were lost and tribe survival was being threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Jones}}, at 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the children were removed from families who resided on [[Indian reservation]]s, where the state government did not have legal [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Jones}}, at 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Many parents and children were denied [[due process]], either by the state agency or the state court, leading to a finding by Congress that the states had failed to recognize tribal culture, relations, and standards.&lt;ref&gt;25 U.S.C. § 1901(5); {{smallcaps|Jones}}, at 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress set up both procedural and substantive provisions in the ICWA that are designed to 1) eliminate the need to remove Indian children due to cultural bias; 2) try to ensure that Indian children are placed in foster and adoptive homes that reflect Indian culture; and 3) to promote the use of tribal, rather than state, courts to adjudicate Indian child custody proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Jones}}, at 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICWA gives the tribal court [[exclusive jurisdiction]] for children who are born or who live on tribal land, and [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with state courts in all other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|25|1911}}; ''Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield'', {{ussc|490|30|1989|pin=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower courts===
In 1985, a set of Indian twins were born in [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]], [[Mississippi]], 200 miles from the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]].  The mother had moved to Harrison County for the sole purpose of giving birth off the reservation and for placing the children with the Holyfields.&lt;ref&gt;Solangel Maldonaldo, "Race, Culture, and Adoption: Lessons from Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield," 17 {{smallcaps|Colum. J. of Gender &amp; L.}} 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural parents were not married, and both parents executed a consent for adoption in the Harrison County [[Mississippi Chancery Courts|Chancery Court]]. The Holyfields, a non-Indian couple, adopted the twins. The state court signed a final decree of adoption in early 1986.  Two months later, the tribe moved to vacate the adoption, stating that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction. The state trial court denied their motion, noting that the children had never lived on the reservation and were not born there.  The tribe appealed to the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]], which affirmed the trial court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___; ''In the matter of B.B. and G.B., Minors'', {{West|S|511|2|918|Miss.|1987|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribe appealed.  The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] granted [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice [[William J. Brennan]] delivered the opinion of the court.  Brennan reviewed the intent of Congress and noted that one in eight Indian children were adopted out and that 90% of those children went to non-Indian homes.  He noted that for children born or residing on a reservation, the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction.  In other cases, the tribal courts have concurrent jurisdiction.  In those cases, on the motion of a parent or the tribe, the matter is to be transferred to the tribal court with three exceptions - for "good cause," objection to the transfer by either parent, or the declination of jurisdiction in the matter by the tribal court.&lt;ref&gt;25 U.S.C. § 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ruled that the emphasis the Mississippi Supreme Court placed on the non-reservation birth of the children and the fact that they never lived on the reservation, and the voluntary relinquishment by the natural parents was error.&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the natural parents resided on the reservation.  A child's domicile follows that of the parent.  The fact that the parents traveled 200 miles to avoid giving birth on the reservation does not serve to eliminate the tribal court's exclusive jurisdiction.  Since the tribal court had such jurisdiction, the state court did not, and had no authority to enter an order of adoption.  Reversed and remanded.&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Justice [[John P. Stevens]], joined by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] and Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] dissented from the majority opinion.  Stevens felt that since the parents consented to the adoption and wanted to use the state court, they should be allowed to do so.  Stevens believed that the ICWA was primarily intended to apply to the involuntary removal of Indian children from their families and the tribe, and a voluntary action by parents does not have the same characteristics.  Stevens would have affirmed the decision of the state courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
After the remand from the Supreme Court, the tribal court allowed the children to remain with their adoptive family, because “it would have been cruel to take them from the only mother they knew.” The court ordered that the children stay in contact with their natural extended family and tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/us/american-indian-adoption-case-comes-to-supreme-court.html?_r=0 "Case Pits Adoptive Parents Against Tribal Rights"], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Dec. 25, 2012, at A12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has had a large effect on [[family law]] involving Indian children, having been cited in more than 1,000 cases since the decision.  It has also been extensively referenced in books&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|N. Bruce Duthu}}, {{smallcaps|American Indians and the Law}} ___ (2008); {{smallcaps|Jones}}, at ___; {{smallcaps|Lynn D. Wardle}}, {{smallcaps|Fundamental Principles of Family Law}} ___ (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and journals on Native American law.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Allbaugh, ''Tribal Jurisdiction over Indian Children:'' Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 16 {{smallcaps|Am. Indian L. Rev.}} 533 (1991); Maldonaldo, 17 {{smallcaps|Colum. J. of Gender &amp; L.}} at 1; Stan Watts, ''Voluntary Adoptions Under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978: Balancing the Interests of Children, Families, and Tribes'', 63 {{smallcaps|S. Cal. L. Rev.}} 213 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Supreme Court was clear that the ICWA was to be applied to adoption cases based on the statute and the accompanying House Report, "by making sure that Indian child welfare determinations are not based on "a white, middle-class standard..."",&lt;ref&gt;''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at ___&lt;/ref&gt; state courts created an "existing Indian family"&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of the Adoption of Baby Boy L.'', {{West|P|643|2|168|Kan.|1982|}} ("the Act is concerned with the removal of Indian children from an '''existing Indian family''' unit and the resultant breakup of the Indian family") (emphasis added), ''overruled by In re A.J.S.'', {{West|P|204|3|543|Kan.|2010|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it allows exceptions to the application of the ICWA.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lewerenz &amp; Padraic McCoy, ''
The End of the "Existing Indian Family" Jurisprudence: ''Holyfield'' at 20,'' In the Matter of A.J.S. ''and the Last Gasps of a Dying Doctrine'', 36 {{smallcaps|Wm. Mitchell L. Rev.}} 684 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In those cases, courts had held that if the child was not part of an existing Indian family, a term that was not defined anywhere in the law, then the ICWA did not apply.  At one point, nearly half of the states used the exception.&lt;ref&gt;Lewerenz, 36 {{smallcaps|Wm. Mitchell L. Rev.}} at ___.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, only six states use the exception.  The courts now appear to be viewing tribal interests as importantly as the child's interests in these cases, and also that they have begun to consider tribal cultures, in the sense of the extended family being integral to a child's support. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lewerenz, 36 {{smallcaps|Wm. Mitchell L. Rev.}} at ___.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Court Reporters Association''', or '''NCRA''', is a US organization for the advancement of the profession of the [[court reporter]], [[closed captioner]], and realtime writer. The association holds annual [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[seminars]] and forums, speed and real-time [[competition|contests]], and [[teacher]]s' [[workshops]] to assist court reporters.

Reporters can join NCRA for a [[fee]] that varies depending on whether the applicant is a [[student]], [[teacher]], or reporter.
[[wiktionary:Membership|Membership]] allows a reporter to take the certifications, get discounts on conventions, attend [[Business conference|conferences]], and have access to a [[Business network|network]] of other [[professionals]] in the [[Field of study|field]].

==History==
NCRA was established in 1899 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, as the National Shorthand Reporters Association (NSRA).
They created standardization of [[ethical codes]], [[transcript (law)|transcript]] rates, and information for all [[shorthand]] reporters.
They published "The Shorthand Writer" and started the National Speed Contest, which is still held today. NCRA developed the first [[standardized test]] for court reporters to gauge their [[Expertise|proficiency]]. Called the Certificate of Proficiency, it was replaced by the Registered Professional Reporter.

==Membership with NCRA==
NCRA supports individuals through education and certification, promotion of the stenographic profession throughout the legal industry, and defense of the industry in government. NCRA provides news and information to its members through email newsletters and its JCR magazine, as well as on its website. Industry professionals benefit from membership with NCRA by broadening their network, bringing them new business, personal and career enhancements, and receiving access to information and education.

==Standardized tests==
NCRA offers three main certifications:&lt;ref name="certifications"&gt;[http://www.ncra.org/Certifications/content.cfm?ItemNumber=8657&amp;navItemNumber=516 NCRA Certifications], National Court Reporters Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
* RPR, Registered Professional Reporter
* RMR, Registered Merit Reporter
* RDR, Registered Diplomate Reporter, the highest certification designated by NCRA

They have established seven other certification programs:
* CRR, Certified Realtime Reporter
* CBC, Certified Broadcast Captioner
* CCP, Certified CART Provider
* CRC, Certified Realtime Captioner
* CLVS, Certified Legal Video Specialist
* CRI, Certified Reporting Instructor
* MCRI, Master Certified Reporting Instructor
* CMRS, Certified Manager of Reporting Services
* CPE, Certified Program Evaluator
* RSA, Realtime Systems Administrator &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncra.org/Certifications/content.cfm?ItemNumber=8796&lt;/ref&gt;

The written knowledge portion of the exams is offered four times a year at Pearson VUE Professional Centers, and the skills portion of the exams is offered twice a year at NCRA-sponsored testing sites.

==Steno Contests==
Steno contests are held annually at the NCRA Annual Convention and Exhibition in two categories: Speed and Realtime.

* '''2010 Speed Contest'''
Mark Tod Kislingbury of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], won the 2010 speed contest with an accuracy of 99.228% topping a field of 36 [[competitors]].

Coca-Cola Co.| vol= 12-761 |reporter=slip opinion | opinion= | pinpoint= | court=SCOTUS | date=June 12, 2014 | url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-761_6k47.pdf |  author=SCOTUS slip opinion | format=17 pg. PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[United States Supreme Court]] case that held that a statutory private [[right of action]] under the [[Lanham Act]] is not precluded by regulatory provisions of the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].

==Background==

===Regulation of food and drug labeling===
In 1938, the [[United States Congress]] passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in order to regulate the safety of food, drugs, and cosmetics. Under the Act, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has issued regulations governing food and beverage labeling, including the labeling of mixes of different types of juice into one juice blend. In particular, if a juice blend does not name all the juices it contains and mentions only juices that are not predominant in the blend, then it must either declare the percentage content of the named juice or "[i]ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or flavoring."&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|21|102|33|d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private parties are not allowed to bring enforcement actions under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|21|337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Congress amended it in order to provide for [[Federal preemption|preemption]] of certain State laws dealing with product misbranding.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|21|343-1|a|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lanham Act claims===
In 1946, Congress enacted the Lanham Act in order to govern the use of [[trademark]]s. Among its stated aims was the regulation of "commerce within the control of Congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce,"&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provision was made for civil enforcement actions to be available for private parties in the federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1125|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The case at hand===
[[POM Wonderful]] was a grower of [[pomegranate]]s and a distributor of pomegranate juices, including a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend. [[The Coca-Cola Company]], through its [[Minute Maid]] division, created a pomegranate-blueberry juice product that in reality was 99.4% apple and grape juices. The front label of its package carried the words "pomegranate blueberry" in [[capital letter]]s, below which the phrase "flavored blend of 5 juices" appeared in much smaller type, followed in still smaller type by "from concentrate with added ingredients and other natural flavors" (presented over two lines).

POM brought suit under the Lanham Act in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]], alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of Coca-Cola's juice blend misled consumers as to its actual content, thereby causing POM to lose sales.

==Lower courts==
The District Court granted partial [[summary judgment]] to Coca-Cola, ruling that the FDCA and its regulations preclude challenges to the name and the label of Coca-Cola's juice blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.|vol= 727|reporter= F. Supp. 2d|opinion= 849|pinpoint= |court= C.D.

==Supreme Court decision==
The Ninth Circuit ruling was reversed and remanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Adam Liptak|title = Coke Can Be Sued by Rival Over Juice Claim, Court Says|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/business/supreme-court-says-coca-cola-can-be-sued-by-Pom-Wonderful.html|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Brent Kendall|title = Supreme Court Allows False-Advertising Suit Against Coca-Cola|url = https://online.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-allows-false-advertising-suit-against-coca-cola-1402582954|newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]]|date = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a unanimous decision written by Justice Kennedy, the Court held:

:* The case was one not of preemption but of preclusion and so any "presumption against pre-emption" has no force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council|vol= 530|reporter= U.S.|opinion= 363|pinpoint= 565|court= |date= 2000|url= http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=363|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Although the Court's pre-emption precedent does not govern preclusion analysis in this case, its principles are instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws that bear on the same subject."
:* As this is a statutory interpretation case, the Court relies on traditional rules of statutory interpretation. That does not change because the case involves multiple federal statutes, nor does it change because an agency is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Food and Drug Administration v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation|vol= 529|reporter= U.S.|opinion= 120|pinpoint= 137{{endash}}139|court= |date= 2000|url= http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=98-1152|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* "When two statutes complement each other, it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Congress nonetheless intended one federal statute to preclude the operation of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=  J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc., dba Farm Advantage, Inc. v.

:* "A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels would not only ignore the distinct functional aspects of the FDCA and the Lanham Act but also would lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend."
:* "Even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.|vol= 529|reporter= U.S.|opinion= 861|pinpoint= 874|court= |date= 2000|url= http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=98-1811|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Wyeth v.

An agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization."

==Subsequent jury trial==
The case went back to the California federal district court and eventually proceeded to jury trial, where it was established that Coca Cola Co.'s [[Minute Maid]] "Enhanced Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored 100% Juice Blend" was 99.4% apple and grape juices and only 0.3% pomegranate juice, 0.2% blueberry juice, and 0.1% raspberry juice.&lt;ref name="APKS2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumeradvertisinglawblog.com/2016/03/coca-cola-defeats-pom-wonderfuls-misleading-labeling-claims-a-key-takeaway-for-food-and-beverage-man.html#page=1|title= Coca-Cola Defeats POM Wonderful’s Misleading Labeling Claims:  A Key Takeaway For Food and Beverage Manufacturers|last= Ikeda|first= Tiffany|last2= Blackburn|first2= James|date= March 25, 2016|website= consumeradvertisinglawblog.com|publisher= Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2016, POM made its closing arguments, and the case went to the jury. with POM claiming losses of $10 million per year from 2007 to 2014 (totaling more than $77 million) caused by Coca-Cola's Minute Maid pomegranate and blueberry juice drink misleading labeling and advertising.&lt;ref name="APKS2016"/&gt; On March 21, 2016, the California jury unanimously rejected POM's claim that the labeling of Minute Maid's pomegranate-blueberry juice blend (which did comply with FDA labeling requirements) was either misleading or unfair competition and found that the labeling did not mislead a substantial portion of consumers, in favor of Coca-Cola, ending eight years of litigation.&lt;ref name="APKS2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Esterl|first= Mike|date= March 21, 2016|title= Jury Sides With Coca-Cola in False-Advertising Suit by Pom |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/jury-sides-with-coca-cola-in-false-advertising-suit-by-pom-1458605039|work= [[Wall Street Journal]]|location= |access-date= }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partial agreement''' is a term used within the [[Council of Europe]] to refer to a major activity of European cooperation that is organised by the Council of Europe but does not include all of its member states. This form of activity dates from a resolution adopted by the Council of Europe's [[Committee of Ministers]] on 2 August 1951.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The resolution allowed for the adoption of agreements by a limited number of member states, without the participation of the remainder. Any expenditure would be made by the participating states alone. This form of variable geometry in intergovernmental cooperation has not been imitated by other [[international organisations]]. This form of cooperation also allows some activities to include non-European states as full-fledged participants.

In 1993 the ground-rules were revised by the Committee of Ministers to take into account new developments. Statutory Resolution (93) 28 of the Committee of Ministers replaced the 1951 resolution.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} It defines three types of agreement:

- A partial agreement: some member States of the Council of Europe;

- An enlarged partial agreement: some member States with one or more non-member states;

- An enlarged agreement: all member States with one or more non-member states. 

The Council of Europe currently lists its agreements{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} as the following:

- The [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] (1956)

- Partial Agreement in the Social and Public Health Field (1959)
 
- The [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] (1964)

- The [[Pompidou Group]] - Cooperation Group to Combat Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Drugs (1980) 

- [[EUR-OPA Major Hazards Agreement|EUR-OPA - The European and Mediterranean Major Hazards Agreement]] (1987)

- The [[North-South Centre]] (1989)

- [[Eurimages]] - The European Support Fund for the co-production and distribution of films (1988)

- The [[Venice Commission]]) - The European Commission for Democracy through Law (1990)

- The Youth Card (1991)

- The [[European Audiovisual Observatory]] (1992)

- The Centre for Modern Languages in Graz

- GRECO - The [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (1998)

- The Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport (2007)

Partial agreements are traditionally set up with a resolution of the Committee of Ministers. The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, which is usually listed as a Partial Agreement, falls outside of this definition, being the result of a treaty, and is thus technically a treaty body, such as the [[European Social Charter]] organs. 

There is one agreement, the European Card for Substantially Handicapped Persons, dating from 1977, which was still-born, having never attracted sufficient interest from member states and so was never implemented.

Each agreement has its own form of supervision and management. A number of the agreements are supervised by the Committee of Ministers, others have their own executive boards.

In 2007, the activities of the  [[public health]] partial agreement were transferred to the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, despite the fact that the member states were not the same.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

The latest agreement, on sport, heralds a new development, deals with an activity that had always been a mainstream intergovernmental activity but was relegated to a partial agreement to avoid it being axed altogether.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

The Venice Commission is unique as being the one agreement which began life as a partial agreement and, being of its success, had to drop the qualifier 'Partial', when the last remaining member state decided to join up.

The Council of Europe treaty office issues regularly updated information on all partial and enlarged agreements, listing all member states, observers, dates of accession and reference texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/ Council of Europe treaty office web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote= Which brings me to the best book of them all — and the only one of the four worth remembering — and that is Labunski's unheralded "James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights" (Oxford 2006). The University of Kentucky journalism professor offers in mind-numbing detail Madison's efforts first to prevent a bill of rights from being incorporated into the text of the Constitution, and then his real politic realization that the Constitution itself only would be accepted by his fellow Founders if in the end it did include a bill of particularized rights and freedoms. To absorb the Madison book is to understand that the Constitution is neither the Ark of the Covenant (as Thomas Jefferson once famously said) nor a mere legal guidepost along the American way that ought to be dispensed with in difficult times.

In [[Hong Kong]], some poor people are unable to afford traditional apartments, and they are forced to wait years for affordable public housing. They are forced to seek alternatives, like living in illegal huts on top of buildings.&lt;ref name=DeWolf&gt;{{ cite news | author=Christopher DeWolf | date=27 September 2011 | title=Slums in the sky: Hong Kong rooftop squatters. | publisher=CNN | url=http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/visit/rooftop-housing-740690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hong Kong Population Census, there were about 3,982 rooftop dwellers in 2006,&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{ cite web |  publisher=Population By-Census Office &amp; Census and Statistics Department | year=2006 | title=2006 Population By-Census Summary results | url=http://www.census2011.gov.hk/pdf/summary-results.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are now estimated in the 10's of thousands,&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt; most of whom were found in the old [[Kowloon]] districts of [[Sham Shui Po]], [[Kwun Tong]], and [[Tai Kok Tsui]].&lt;ref name=Shadbolt&gt;{{cite news | author=Peter Shadbolt | date=2 November 2011 | title=Slums with penthouse views highlight Hong Kong's wealth divide | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/01/world/asia/hongkong-rooftop-slums/ | publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A housing crisis developed in the 1950s and 1960s when a large number of refugees left mainland [[China]] and moved to Hong Kong, creating a large, unmet demand for affordable housing options.&lt;ref name=Cusp /&gt;

Blockhouse (Chinese: 木屋) and rooftop slums, which are low cost and offer poor living environments, became more prevalent in Hong Kong beginning in the early 1970s. In the 1970s to 1980s, there was significant economic development which also brought increased housing costs. The government continued to be unaware of the need for affordable housing for its citizens, creating greater pressure for people to find low rent options, like rooftop slums.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cusp&gt;{{ cite web | title=石七刀 (9 June 012). 讓歷史重光 | url=http://cusp.hk/?p=2771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rising rental costs, the lack of affordable housing, and length of time to get into public housing means that people continue to live in rooftop slums.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=Aris Teon | date=4 May 2013 | title=Skyscrapers and skyslums-Hong Kong’s rooftop houses | url=http://my-new-life-in-asia.blogspot.hk/2013/05/hong-kong-rooftop-slums-skyscrapers-skyslums.html | publisher=My new life in Asia - Blogspot }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rooftop neighborhoods==
The cubicle dwellings, generally built atop [[tenement]] buildings of the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt; range from {{convert|9|to|28|sqm|sqft}} may be built with concrete and brick walls, while others are built like shanties out of wood and tin. Between the shanties are narrow passageways. Some may have an area for growing plants or vegetables. There may be a common area to dry laundry. The sturdier buildings may have air conditioning units. The  Hoi On Building in Tai Kok Tsui had 100 people living on the rooftop before it was leveled for new development, part of [[Old Industrial Buildings Revitalization in Hong Kong|redevelopment projects]] made easier through a new policy that allows new construction of apartment buildings or shopping centers on the sites of old buildings. People that are removed from the rooftop neighborhood may end up having to live in an industrial building in a cage or cubicle.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt;

"Legal" apartments sell for more than HK$ million, while the rooftop slum dwellings generally sell on a [[grey market]] for less than HK$50,000.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt; The shanty homes are contrasted against legal apartments of Hong Kong, the "world's most expensive luxury city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/23/worlds-most-expensive-luxury-city/?iref=allsearch | title=World's most expensive luxury city is... | publisher=CNN | date=23 September 2011 | accessdate=13 December 2013 | author=Saga MacFarland | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105103634/http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/23/worlds-most-expensive-luxury-city/?iref=allsearch | archivedate=5 November 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have lived in rooftop dwelling for 30 years. Newer residents are from other Asian countries, like Nepal or Pakistan, or from mainland China.&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt;

==Repercussions==

===Hygiene and health===

One of the repercussions of rooftop slums is poor hygiene due to water leakage:&lt;ref name=Wendler&gt;{{citation | author=Sybil Wendler | date=27 February 2012 | title=Public Broadcasting System (PBS) Once Upon a Rooftop | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioT6pdX6o18 | publisher=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt; the dwellings are generally made of non-water resistant materials, like wood, and there are no drainage systems for rainwater. Further complicating hygiene is the presence of rats, cockroaches, flies, and mosquitoes on the crowded, dirty rooftops, that spread diseases and contaminate food.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The slums become a breeding place for viruses and bacteria and dwellers are susceptible to infectious and respiratory illnesses. Temperature of slums is higher than the exterior due to poor ventilation system and energy-absorbing metal.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

As there is no elevator, dwellers need to walk the stairs to their high-up home, which is difficult for elderly, particularly if they have joint problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Safety===
Because the dwellings are made of lightweight materials, they are not designed to withstand heavy storms and typhoons. Fire is also a danger, especially for buildings with a single exit versus a double exit. Buildings with single fire exits are tagged for top priority demolition due to the danger.&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wendler /&gt;

Escaping the rooftop in a hurry is further challenged by narrow passageways encumbered by possessions. Another safety risk is the weight that the rooftop dweller place on the building that was not designed to accommodate the rooftop slums.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Also, metal easily becomes rusty under high temperature and humidity, staining walls and furniture.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Crowded conditions===
Rooftop slums are a series of tightly placed dwellings. There can be more than one hundred people&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt; living on one rooftop in dwellings that can only accommodate a few pieces of furniture and electrical appliances. The crowded conditions, with limited facilities, makes for a poor living environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Mental health===
Rooftop slum dwellers usually have a low self-esteem and quality of life. Complaints include feeling as if people look down on them for where they live&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt; and feeling unhappy to have no choice but to live in the old, dilapidated houses.&lt;ref name=Wendler /&gt;

As the rooftop slums are unauthorized buildings, dwellers constantly worry about demolition of their home. Some claim that they’d rather be dead if they have to live in a new place.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt;

==Status==
The plight of several thousands&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt; or tens of thousands of people living in rooftop slums is gaining media attention, but there are still not enough safe, affordable housing options for Hong Kong's citizens. Because there is an inadequate supply of housing, removing people from their rooftop dwellings isn't a viable option. So, the Hong Kong government has few options in the short term.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt; Social worker Sze Lai-Shan, who works for the Society for Community Organization and has urged the government to provide more public rental housing, said: 
{{Quotation|The government doesn't know much about this and they don’t bother to know because they don’t have a rehousing policy for these people... They don’t want to make them (the rooftop dwellers) homeless, so they let them stay. |Sze Lai-Shan&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt;}}

There is insufficient public housing to meet the demand. There are about 15,000 new apartment units built every year, but there are more than 300,000 people on the waiting list for public housing. The available housing may be out on the outlying islands surrounding Hong Kong. Even if rooftops’ families are assigned a regular apartment, the cost of transportation to work or their children's school, such as a school in Kowloon that have a "program designed to help ethnic minorities and new immigrants learn Cantonese," may prevent them from being able to leave the slums.&lt;ref name=DeWolf /&gt; Some wish to stay in their illegal dwelling because of the easy access to the city and beautiful views.&lt;ref name=Shadbolt /&gt;

'''''Rowe v Vale of White Horse DC''''' [2003] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/388.html EWHC 388 (Admin)] is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning the nature of an enrichment.

==Facts==
Mr Rowe did not get charged for sewerage from 1982 to 1995 because of administrative error and till 2001 because the [[Vale of White Horse|Vale of White Horse District Council]] was unsure whether it had legal power to operate the local sewerage station. In 2001 the District Council found it did have the power, and in March it wrote demanding payment since 1995. Mr Rowe said he had no idea there would be a charge beyond his [[Council fees|council]] and [[water rates]], and applied for [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;See A Burrows, E McKendrick and J Edelman, ''Cases and Materials on Restitution (OUP 2006) 76 and 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Lightman J, treating the case as a [[private law]] question of whether the Council was entitled to payment, held that there was enrichment through an incontrovertible benefit, but was no right because there was no unjust factor. It was common ground that a benefit was received and there was no defence of change of position. There is enrichment if services are either freely accepted or there is an incontrovertible benefit. Although the Council argued that Mr Rowe freely accepted the services, there was no acquiescence in their supply for a [[Consideration in English law|consideration]].  The council could not suggest an unjust factor, e.g. mistake on the part of the council. He cited G&amp;J para 1-019 to say that if a [[reasonable person]] ought to have known that someone would have expected payment, but did not take a reasonable opportunity to reject them, then he will be considered enriched. And normally a [[ratepayer]] will think he must pay for services, but this case was different.

{{Cquote|12. ... In absence of proof of such acquiescence, the principle of free acceptance cannot be invoked to satisfy the second condition. But it is common ground that the receipt of the services constituted an incontrovertible benefit and that the second condition is to be deemed to be satisfied for this reason.’

14. ... ‘But the facts of this case are far removed from the ordinary case. Most particularly in the circumstances of this case and by reason of the administrative oversight of the Council over the period 1982 to 1995 and what can only be described as the extraordinary error of judgement by the Council between 1995 and 2001, the Council created and perpetuated the totally reasonable belief on the part of consumers of its services (and most particularly its former tenants) that there was no payment to be paid (beyond what was already paid to the Council and the TWA) in respect of the sewerage services and there arose no occasion for Mr. Rowe to reject the services.}}

{{italic title}}
'''''Saleh v. Bush''''' was a [[class action]] lawsuit filed in 2013 against [[Cabinet of George W. Bush|high-ranking members]] of the [[George W. Bush administration]] (including [[George W. Bush]], [[Dick Cheney]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Condi Rice]], [[Colin Powell]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]]) for their alleged involvement in [[Nuremberg principles#Principle VI|premeditating and carrying out]] the [[Iraq War]].  In December 2014, the [[United States District Court|district court]] hearing the case ordered it dismissed with prejudice.  The dismissal was affirmed by the  [[United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit]].

==Proceedings in district court and dismissal==
The lawsuit was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] by lawyer Inder Comar,&lt;ref name="huffpo" /&gt; and the lead plaintiff is Sundus Shaker Saleh, an Iraqi [[expatriate]]. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired to wage a [[war of aggression]] against the Iraqi people, a violation of the [[Nuremberg Principles]]. Plaintiffs specially claimed the primary purpose of the [[Iraq War]] was to enact [[regime change]] in Iraq, as distinct from national [[self defense]].  In pursuit of this goal, the defendants are alleged to have:  planned the war as early as 1998; capitalized on the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 to ramp up support for the invasion; utilized fear tactics and intentional [[misinformation]]; entered Iraq without fully proper [[UN Security Council]] authorization.{{efn|name="complaint"}}{{efn|name=saleh}}&lt;!--{{efn|name=hearingpressrelease}}--&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) represented the defendants, who are all former government officials. 

The government moved the dismiss the suit, and in December 2014, the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] dismissed the suit with prejudice. The court substituted the  United States as the sole defendant in place of the individual government officials, citing the Westfall Act, which provides that "the exclusive remedy for [[torts]] committed by Government employees in the scope of their employment" in an action against the government itself under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]].&lt;ref name="NDCal2014"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5694415025827447851 Saleh v. Bush]'', Case No. 13-cv-01124-JST (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court noted that the Attorney General had formally certified that the individual defendants "were acting within the scope of their federal employment when performing the acts at issue." The court then dismissed the lawsuit because the plaintiffs had failed to [[Exhaustion of remedies|exhaust administrative remedies]] as required under the FTCA for claims against the government, a [[jurisdiction]]al requirement.&lt;ref name="NDCal2014" /&gt;

==Appeal==
Plaintiffs filed an appeal in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. A group of international lawyers (including former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]]) filed an [[amicus brief]] in support of the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=dailykos20150615/&gt;{{efn|name=truthout20150615}}

A financial process is said to be '''tax efficient''' if it is [[tax]]ed at a lower rate than an alternative financial process that achieves the same end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/4893/tax_efficient.html Investor Words definition of "tax efficient"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11230">The '''three-tier system''' of alcohol distribution is the system for distributing alcoholic beverages set up in the [[United States]] after the repeal of [[Prohibition]].&lt;ref name=WiredBottled&gt;Mayfield, Kendra, [https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/03/62831 Web Wine Sales Still Bottled Up], ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'', 31 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three tiers are importer or producers, distributors, and retailers. The basic structure of the system is that producers can sell their products only to wholesale distributors who then sell to retailers, and only retailers may sell to consumers. Producers include brewers, wine makers, distillers and importers.

Some states chose to become [[alcoholic beverage control state|alcoholic beverage control jurisdictions]] after Prohibition. In these states, part or all of the distribution tier, and sometimes also the retailing tier, are operated by the state government itself (or by contractors operating under its authority) rather than by independent private entities.

The only state with a privately operated retailing and distribution system that does not require any form of three-tier system is the [[Washington (state)|State of Washington]]. In Washington, retailers may purchase alcoholic beverages directly from producers, may negotiate volume discounts, and may warehouse their inventory themselves. However, the three-tier system largely remains in fact a reality in Washington despite the lack of a law requiring it.&lt;ref name=WaPrices&gt;Nakamura, Motoya, [http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/12/privatizing_liquor_sales_in_wa.html Privatizing liquor sales in Washington hasn't brought price down], ''[[Oregon Live]]'', December 31, 2012, accessed 25 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and legal justification==
In 1933 the [[18th Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] was repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. (Previously, the 18th Amendment had outlawed alcohol in the US in 1919 and led to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1920.) Section 2 of the 21st Amendment specifies that the power to control alcohol resides with the states, leaving each state to decide when and how to repeal Prohibition.

After Prohibition, the states began to seek methods to regulate and control the alcohol industry. The states were also eager to devise a method to levy and collect taxes on alcohol producers. Both of these concerns led to the states individually creating environments in which single ownership of all three tiers (production, distribution and retail) was entirely or partly prohibited. As states were left by the 21st Amendment to regulate themselves, alcohol laws and the nature of the three tier system can vary significantly from state to state.

==Exceptions and regulations==
States have various exceptions to this rule, the most prevalent one being the case of a [[brewpub]], which is simultaneously a producer and retailer, and has no requirement to sell to a distributor.  Some states allow an entity to have a part in two of the tiers, letting small breweries act as their own distributor, for example.  Many states permit [[winery|wineries]] to sell bottles of wine on-site to customers.

Usually producers will give a distributor exclusive rights to market their product within a geographical area, so that there will not, for example, be two distributors of [[Anheuser-Busch]] products competing against each other.

Rules also vary according to what kind of relationships each of the tiers can enter into with the other two tiers. For example, a producer may not be allowed to give promotional items or services to a retailer. Another example is that a beer distributor might be responsible for setting up and maintaining draft lines in a restaurant, or may be legally prohibited from doing so, depending on the state.

Also, several states are [[alcoholic beverage control state]]s - in any of these jurisdictions state governments maintain a [[monopoly]] on the distribution tier of the system (at least for distilled beverages).  Some (such as [[Utah]] and [[Pennsylvania]]) monopolize the distribution ''and'' retail tiers.  Those that maintain monopolies over the distribution system only (such as [[Michigan]]) could still be said to have a three-tier system – in such states producers sell to the distributor (in these cases, the state as opposed to a private operator) who in turn sells to private retail outlets.

A substantial exception to the three-tier system is the State of Washington. In November 2011, voters in Washington approved Initiative 1183, which dismantled the state-operated retailing system and removed the legal requirement for a three-tier distribution system for alcoholic beverage sales.&lt;ref name=SeaTimes1&gt;Allison, Melissa, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2016724230_liquor10.html Liquor board, retailers gear up to implement I-1183], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', Nov. 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APW&gt;Baker, Mike, [https://news.yahoo.com/washington-state-approves-liquor-law-042942917.html Washington state approves liquor law], [[Associated Press]], Nov. 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the modified law, the prior state-operated liquor retailing system was eliminated in favor of heavily taxed private retailing. By a substantial margin, Washington has the highest liquor tax rate in the nation.&lt;ref name=DUIdecrease/&gt; With a liquor tax rate around $35 per gallon, its liquor tax is about 50% higher than in Oregon, which has the next highest rate.&lt;ref name=DUIdecrease&gt;Thomas, Linda, [http://mynorthwest.com/646/2315370/DUI-arrests-decrease-after-state-monopoly-on-liquor-sales-ends DUI Arrests Decrease After State Monopoly on Liquor Sales Ends], MyNorthwest.com, July 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In Washington, retailers may bypass distributors by purchasing directly from producers, may negotiate volume discounts, and may warehouse their inventory themselves. Private retailing began on June 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018331473_liquor02.html The day liquor went private and prices stumped the public], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', June 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although private retailing should increase competition in principle, in many cases producers have entered into exclusive marketing agreements with distributors for the market region, to the extent that each brand is often only available from a single distributor in the state (although large retailers such as [[Costco]] have been able to take some advantage of the law and in some cases have introduced their own [[house brand]]s).&lt;ref name=WaPrices /&gt; Contrary to the fears of some in the political process, the number of [[Driving under the influence|drunk-driving]] arrests and alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents actually dropped in the year after the conversion to the new system.&lt;ref name=DUIdecrease/&gt;

A different type of exception to the three-tier system is in Oklahoma, whose laws have historically mandated a ''four-tier'' system for package sales of beer of greater than 3.2% alcohol by weight (4.0% by volume). Brewers in that state have historically been prohibited from selling to distributors; they instead must sell to brokers, who in turn sell to distributors. Following the passage of a voter referendum in 2016, the broker and distributor levels will be effectively merged effective on October 1, 2018, resulting in the three-tier system common to the rest of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newsok.com/article/5580164/big-changes-for-oklahoma-businesses-consumers-when-alcohol-law-takes-effect-oct.-1 |title=Big changes for Oklahoma businesses, consumers when alcohol law takes effect Oct. 1 |first=David |last=Dishman |newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=January 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America]] (WSWA), an influential [[trade organization]] and [[lobby group]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=ws-bco&gt;{{cite web|last= Marcus |first= Kim, ''Wine Spectator'' |title= Bizarre Coalition Opposes Direct Shipment of Wine |url= http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Bizarre-Coalition-Opposes-Direct-Shipment-of-Wine_2398 |date= February 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; that works to oppose initiatives to alter the three-tier model, contends that wholesalers not only sell alcohol but also perform state functions and are in the business of encouraging social responsibility concerning alcohol.&lt;ref name=ws-ttds&gt;{{cite web|last= Nigro |first= Dana, ''Wine Spectator'' |title= Tide Turns in Direct Shipping Battle  |url= http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Tide-Turns-in-Direct-Shipping-Battle_1465 |date= October 21, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.nawr.org National Association of Wine Retailers] (NAWR) is a group which represents the wine retail industry, advocating the free movement of wine across state lines.

==Use in other markets==
A similar use of a three-tier system is enforced for [[tobacco]] products in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=BostonPot/&gt; In June 2017, tobacco wholesalers proposed that the three-tier system also be imposed for [[recreational marijuana]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=BostonPot&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Adams |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/06/tobacco-wholesalers-want-recreational-marijuana/KZrEJTW3lTaYr0Uw0tef7N/story.html |title=Tobacco wholesalers want in on recreational marijuana |website=[[Boston Globe]] |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that this would improve tax collection enforcement.&lt;ref name=BostonPot/&gt;

The '''University and State Library Düsseldorf''' ({{lang-de|Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Düsseldorf}}, abbreviated '''ULB Düsseldorf''') is a central service institution of [[Heinrich Heine University]]. Along with Bonn and Münster, it is also one of the three State Libraries of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

== Tradition and Modernity ==
From 1965 to 1969, the University and Library Düsseldorf gradually developed out of the Medical Academy in Düsseldorf. There is no real founding year of the ULB, but the foundation stone for an integrated library system was laid when the former State and City Library of Düsseldorf was taken over by the university in 1970 and merged with the Central Library of the former Medical Academy.

== Structure and Holdings==
The ULB consists of one central library and four decentralized locations. Management and media processing are organized centrally. Catalogues, databases, e-books and e-journals are accessible throughout the whole university as well as at home via the library network.

The ULB houses one of the largest collections of works by and about Thomas Mann. It was established by the Germanist and bookseller Hans-Otto Mayer and not only comprises editions of complete works, rare first publications, manuscripts and translations into more than 40 languages but also secondary literature including an extensive archive of excerpts. Special catalogues have been written for detailed research in these large holdings. The collection is extended constantly.

=== Manuscripts ===
The scripts that are kept in the ULB reach back to the 8th century. They largely come from holdings of Rhenish or Westphalian convents and preserve mainly liturgical and theological texts. Thus, one can find sources of inestimable value for numerous academic disciplines.

=== Incunabula ===
Nearly 1000 incunabula can be found in the holdings of the ULB. These valuable specimens, among them unica and fragments of seldomly preserved "consume literature", show the beginnings of the art of printing. They originate predominantly from workshops of Rhenish or Dutch printers and offer a rich panorama of the regional book production at the beginning of the modern era.

=== Special Collections ===
In other collections, the ULB unites rare, valuable and unique parts of holdings that are installed as an ensemble. Deposita, unpublished works, donations, acquisition of rare books etc. were and are an important source for the constant growth of the library. These treasures and specialties - beyond their academic value - also contribute substantially to the profile of the ULB.

{{Tort law}}
'''''Volenti non fit iniuria''''' (or '''''injuria''''') ([[Latin]]: "to a willing person, injury is not done") is a [[common law]] doctrine which states that if someone willingly places themselves in a position where harm might result, knowing that some degree of harm might result, they are not able to bring a claim against the other party in tort or delict.  ''Volenti'' applies only to the risk which a reasonable person would consider them as having assumed by their actions; thus a [[Boxing|boxer]] consents to being hit, and to the injuries that might be expected from being hit, but does not consent to (for example) his opponent striking him with an iron bar, or punching him outside the usual terms of boxing.  ''Volenti'' is also known as a "'''voluntary assumption of risk'''."

''Volenti'' is sometimes described as the plaintiff "consenting to run a risk." In this context, ''volenti'' can be distinguished from legal [[consent]] in that the latter can prevent some [[tort]]s arising in the first place.  For example, consent to a medical procedure prevents the procedure from being a [[trespass to the person]], or consenting to a person visiting one's land prevents them from being a [[trespass]]er.

==History==
Volenti non fit injuria is an often-quoted form of the [[legal maxim]] formulated by the Roman [[jurist]] [[Ulpian]] which reads in original: ''Nulla iniuria est, quæ in volentem fiat.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], Book 47, title 10, section 1 § 5, quoting Ulpian, On the Edict, Bk. 56. Literally translated as "No injury is committed against one who consents"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Law==
In [[English tort law]], ''volenti'' is a [[full defence]], i.e. it fully exonerates the defendant who succeeds in proving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chitty on Contracts (29th Edition)|year=2004|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|isbn=0-421-84280-6|pages=61, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The defence has two main elements:

*The claimant was fully aware of all the risks involved, including both the nature and the extent of the risk; and
*The claimant expressly (by statement) or implicitly (by actions) consented to waive all claims for damages. Knowledge of the risk is not sufficient: ''sciens non est volens'' ("knowing is not volunteering"). [[Consent]] must be free and voluntary, i.e. not brought about by duress. If the relationship between the claimant and defendant is such that there is doubt as to whether the consent was truly voluntary, such as the relationship between workers and employers, the courts are unlikely to find ''volenti''.

It is not easy for a defendant to show both elements and therefore [[comparative negligence]] usually constitutes a better defence in many cases. Note however that comparative negligence is a partial defence, i.e. it usually leads to a reduction of payable damages rather than a full exclusion of liability. Also, the person consenting to an act may not always be negligent: a bungee jumper may take the greatest possible care not to be injured, and if he is, the defence available to the organiser of the event will be ''volenti'', not comparative negligence.

Consent to medical treatment&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital'' [1985] A.C. 871 which deals with the difficult issue of "informed consent"&lt;/ref&gt;  or consent to risky sports&lt;ref&gt;See ''Condon v Basi'' [1985] 1 W.L.R. 866&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the claimant excludes liability in tort where that consent is '''informed consent'''.

==United States==
The similar principle in US law is known as [[assumption of risk]].

==Canada==
In Canada, the "''volenti''" principles applies in much the same way as under English law.  The leading Canadian cases on point are ''[[Dube v. Labar]]'', [1986] 1 SCR 649 and ''[[Hall v. Hebert]]'', [1993] 2 SCR 159.&lt;ref name="Duhaime"&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/V/VolentiNonFitInjuria.aspx Volenti]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==

===Trespassers===
The [[Occupiers' Liability Act 1984]] requires all owners of property to take reasonable steps to make their premises safe for anyone who enters them, even those who enter as trespassers, if they are aware of a risk on the premises.  However, the doctrine of ''volenti'' has been applied to cases where a trespasser exposed themselves deliberately to risk:
* ''[[Titchener v British Railways Board]]'' [1983] 1 WLR 1427
* ''[[Ratcliff v McConnell]]'' [1997] EWCA Civ 2679
* ''[[Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council]]'' [2003] UKHL 47
In the first case (decided before the Occupier's Liability Act was passed), a girl who had trespassed on the railway was hit by a train.  The House of Lords ruled that the fencing around the railway was adequate, and the girl had voluntarily accepted the risk by breaking through it.  In the second case, a student who had broken into a closed swimming-pool and injured himself by diving into the shallow end was similarly held responsible for his own injuries.  The third case involved a man who dived into a shallow lake, despite the presence of "No Swimming" signs; the signs were held to be an adequate warning.

===Drunk drivers===
The defence of ''volenti'' is now excluded by statute where a passenger was injured as a result of agreeing to take a lift from a drunk car driver. However, in a well-known case of ''Morris v Murray'' [1990] 3 All ER 801 ([[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]), ''volenti'' was held to apply to a drunk passenger, who accepted a lift from a drunk pilot. The pilot died in the resulting crash and the passenger who was injured, sued his estate.  Although he drove the pilot to the airfield (which was closed at the time) and helped him start the engine and tune the radio, he argued that he did not freely and voluntarily consent to the risk involved in flying. The Court of Appeal held that there was consent: the passenger was not so drunk as to fail to realise the risks of taking a lift from a drunk pilot, and his actions leading up to the flight demonstrated that he voluntarily accepted those risks.

===Rescuers===
For reasons of policy, the courts are reluctant to criticise the behaviour of rescuers.  A rescuer would not be considered ''[[volens]]'' if:

#He was acting to rescue persons or property endangered by the defendant’s negligence;
#He was acting under a compelling legal, social or moral duty; and
#His conduct in all circumstances was reasonable and a natural consequence of the defendant’s negligence.

An example of such a case is ''[[Haynes v. Harwood]]'' [1935] 1 KB 146, in which a policeman was able to recover damages after being injured restraining a bolting horse: he had a legal and moral duty to protect life and property and as such was not held to have been acting as a volunteer or giving willing consent to the action - it was his contractual obligation as an employee and police officer and moral necessity as a human being to do so, and not a wish to volunteer, which caused him to act. In this case the court of appeal affirmed a judgement in favor of a policeman who had been injured in stopping some runaway horses with a van in  a crowded street. The policeman who was on duty, not in the street, but in a police station, darted out and was crushed by one of the horses which fell upon him while he was stopping it. It was also held that the rescuer's act need not be instinctive in order to be reasonable, for one who deliberately encounters peril after reflection may often be acting more reasonably than one who acts upon impulse.

By contrast, in ''[[Cutler v. United Dairies]]'' [1933] 2 KB 297 a man who was injured trying to restrain a horse was held to be ''volens'' because in that case no human life was in immediate danger and he was not under any compelling duty to act.

Also, although to be a "neighbour" within Lord Atkin's dictum, a claimant must be "so closely and directly affected by one's act that one ought reasonably to have them in contemplation", rescuers are invariably deemed to be neighbours, even if their presence would objectively seem to be somewhat unlikely - ''[[Baker v T E Hopkins &amp; Son Ltd|Baker v Hopkins]]'' [1959] 3 All ER 225 (CA).

===Unsuccessful attempts to rely on ''volenti''===
Examples of cases where a reliance on ''volenti'' was unsuccessful include:
* ''[[Nettleship v. Weston]]'' [1971] 3 All ER 581 (Court of Appeal)
* ''[[Baker v T E Hopkins &amp; Son Ltd]]'' [1959] 3 All ER 225 (Court of Appeal).
:
In the first case, the [[plaintiff]] was an instructor who was injured while teaching the defendant to drive. The defence of ''volenti'' failed: that is, because the plaintiff specifically inquired if the defendant's insurance covered him before agreeing to teach. In the second case, a doctor went in to try to rescue workmen who were caught in a well after having succumbed to noxious fumes. He did so despite being warned of the danger and told to wait until the fire brigade arrived. The doctor and the workmen all died. The court held that it would be "unseemly" to hold the doctor to have consented to the risk simply because he acted promptly and bravely in an attempt to save lives.

Generally courts are reluctant to recognise voluntary assumption of risk. An example of a court reluctant to find a voluntary assumption of risk includes Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council [2007] NSWCA 4. Instead the conduct amounted to [[contributory negligence]], which is not a complete defence.

{{War}}
A '''war of aggression''', sometimes also '''war of conquest'''&lt;!-- redirected here---&gt;, is a [[military conflict]] waged without the justification of [[self-defense]], usually for territorial gain and subjugation. The phrase is distinctly modern and diametrically opposed to the prior legal international standard of "[[might makes right]]", under the medieval and pre-historic beliefs of [[right of conquest]]. Since the [[Korean War]] of the early 1950s, waging such a [[war]] of aggression is a crime under the [[customary international law]]. Possibly the first trial for waging aggressive war is that of the Sicilian king [[Conradin]] in 1268.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer (et al)|first=Robert|title=An introduction to international criminal law and procedure|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [UK]|isbn=978-0-521-13581-8|pages=312|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wars without international legality (i.e. not out of self-defense nor sanctioned by the [[United Nations Security Council]]) can be considered wars of aggression; however, this alone usually does not constitute the definition of a war of aggression&lt;!-- IMHO, the next phrase cancels this by justifying the modern viewpoint: {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In the judgment of the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]], which followed [[World War II]], "War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."&lt;ref name="judgment"&gt;{{citation | title=Judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Trial of German Major War Criminals: The Nazi Regime in Germany |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judnazi.asp#common |author=The International Military Tribunal for Germany |date=1946-09-30 |publisher=The Avalon Project, Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broomhall|first=Bruce |title=International justice and the International Criminal Court |publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2|pages=46|isbn= 978-0-19-925600-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ni6Qy2E9KwC&amp;pg=PA46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] provides that the UN Security Council shall determine the existence of any act of aggression and "shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security".

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] refers to the [[crime of aggression]] as one of the "most serious crimes of concern to the international community", and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). However, the Rome Statute stipulates that the ICC may not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted. At the Review Conference on June 11, 2010 a total of 111 State Parties to the Court agreed by [[consensus]] to adopt a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] accepting the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of [[jurisdiction]] over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|title=Resolution RC/Res.6 !|accessdate=14 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072358/http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant amendments to the Statute, however has not been entered into force yet as of May 14, 2012.

The origin of the concept, Maguire argues, emerged from the debate on [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919: "Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen C.

{{quote|Originally President Wilson resisted the effort to brand Germany with war guilt, but French and British leaders forced him to compromise.

===The Convention for the Definition of Aggression===
Two '''Conventions for the Definition of Aggression''' were signed in [[London]] on 3 and 4 July 1933. The first was signed by [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and came into effect on 17 February 1934, when it was ratified by all of them but Turkey. The second was signed by [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (ratified 20 October 1933), [[Estonia]] (4 December), [[Latvia]] (4 December), [[Persia]] (16 November), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (16 October), Romania (16 October), the Soviet Union (16 October) and Turkey, which ratified both treaties on 23 March 1934. [[Finland]] acceded to the second convention on 31 January 1934. The second convention was the first to be registered with the [[League of Nations Treaty Series]] on 29 March 1934, while the first was registered on 26 April. As [[Lithuania]] refused to sign any treaty including Poland,&lt;ref&gt;Lithuanian authorities regarded Polish rule over the [[Vilnius Region]] as a military occupation of its constitutional capital.&lt;/ref&gt; she signed the definition of aggression in a separate pact with the Soviet Union on 5 July 1933, also in London, and exchanged ratifications on 14 December. It was registered in the Treaty Series on 16 April 1934.

The signatories of both treaties were also signatories of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]] prohibiting aggression, and were seeking an agreed definition of the latter. Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia were members of the [[Little Entente]], and their signatures alarmed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], since the definition of aggression clearly covered its support of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;S. A. H., "Bulgaria and the Balkan Entente", ''Bulletin of International News'', 15, 16 (1938), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both treaties base their definition on the "Politis Report" of the Committee of Security Questions made 24 March 1933 to the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, in answer to a proposal of the Soviet delegation. The Greek politician [[Nikolaos Politis]] was behind the inclusion of "support for armed bands" as a form of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Romaniecki, "The Soviet Union and International Terrorism", ''Soviet Studies'', 26, 3 (1974), 420.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratifications for both treaties were deposited in [[Moscow]], as the convention was primarily the work of [[Maxim Litvinov]], the Soviet signatory.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zadeikis, "An Aspect of the Lithuanian Record of Independence", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', 232 (1944), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention defined an act of aggression as follows:
* Declaration of war upon another State.
* Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another State.
* Attack by its land, naval or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another State.
* Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State.
* Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to take, in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.

The League prerogative under that convention to expel a League member found guilty of aggression was used by the League Assembly only once, against the Soviet government itself, on December 14, 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histdoc.net/history/league1.html League of Nations Assembly resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet government]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histdoc.net/history/league2.html League of Nations Council resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet government]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nuremberg Principles===

In 1945, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] defined three categories of crimes, including ''[[crimes against peace]]''. This definition was first used by [[Finland]] to prosecute the political leadership in the [[war-responsibility trials in Finland]]. The principles were later known as the [[Nuremberg Principles]].

In 1950, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] defined [[Crimes against peace|Crimes against Peace]], in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle VI|Principle VI]], specifically Principle VI(a), submitted to the [[United Nations General Assembly]], as:&lt;ref name="emlyn"&gt;[http://www.emlyn.org.uk/stopwar/rmanson/review/digest.shtml "Skeleton Argument for High Court Judicial Review"]. Emlyn.org.uk, 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702012835/http://www.emlyn.org.uk/stopwar/rmanson/review/digest.shtml |date=2008-07-02 }}.

See: ''[[Nuremberg Trials]]:'' "The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939."

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting [[World War II]]. One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or – it seems – the enforcement of the [[criminal law]] of ''[[jus cogens]]''. It has made formal [[declaration of war]] uncommon after 1945.

Reading the Tribunal's final judgment in court, British alternate judge [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Norman Birkett]] said:

{{quote|The charges in the Indictment that the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars are charges of the utmost gravity. War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world.

To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&lt;ref name="judgment"/&gt;}}

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg. "I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled," he wrote. "[[ex post facto law|Law was created ex post facto]] to suit the passion and clamor of the time."&lt;ref&gt;''Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal'', H. K. Thompson, Jr. and Henry Strutz, (Torrance, Calif.: 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Nations Charter===
The relevant provisions of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] mentioned in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|RSICC]] article 5.2 were framed to include the Nuremberg Principles. The specific principle is ''[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle VI|Principle VI]].a'' "[[Crimes against peace]]", which was based on the provisions of the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] that was issued in 1945 and formed the basis for the post [[World War II]] war crime trials. The Charters provisions based on the Nuremberg Principle VI.a are:

{{quote|
* '''Article 1''':
**The Purposes of the [[United Nations]] are:

===The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)===
The [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]], signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 2, 1947, included a clear definition of aggression. Article 9 stated:

| Unprovoked armed attack by a State against the territory, the people, or the land, sea or air forces of another State;
| Invasion, by the armed forces of a State, of the territory of an American State, through the trespassing of boundaries demarcated in accordance with a treaty, judicial decision, or arbitral award, or, in the absence of frontiers thus demarcated, invasion affecting a region which is under the effective jurisdiction of another State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/Treaties/b-29.html The Rio Pact]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Further discussions on defining aggression===
The discussions on definition of aggression under the UN began in 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. As the western governments, headed by Washington, were in favor of defining the governments of North Korea and the People's Republic of China as aggressor states, the Soviet government proposed to formulate a new UN resolution defining aggression and based on the 1933 convention. As a result, on November 17, 1950, the General Assembly passed resolution 378, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b00f1ed5c.html UN General Assembly Resolution 378 (V) on the Duties of States in the Event of the Outbreak of Hostilities]&lt;/ref&gt; which referred the issue to be defined by the [[International Law Commission]]. The commission deliberated over this issue in its 1951 session and due to large disagreements among its members, decided "that the only practical course was to aim at a general and abstract definition (of aggression)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/english/ilc_1951_v2.pdf ''Yearbook of the ILC 1951'', vol. 2], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a tentative definition of aggression was adopted by the commission on June 4, 1951, which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggression is the use of force by a State or Government against another State or Government, in any manner, whatever the weapons used and whether openly or otherwise, for any reason or for any purpose other than individual or collective self-defence or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation by a competent organ of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;UN Doc. A/CN.4/L.13, in [http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/english/ilc_1951_v1.pdf ''Yearbook of the ILC 1951'', vol. 1], p. 116, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===General Assembly Resolution 3314===
On December 14, 1974, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[Resolution 3314]], which defined the crime of aggression. This definition is not binding as such under international law, though it may reflect [[customary international law]].

This definition makes a distinction between ''aggression'' (which "gives rise to international responsibility") and ''war of aggression'' (which is "a crime against international peace"). Acts of aggression are defined as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an ''act'' of aggression and a ''war'' of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are notably vague, as it is unclear what level of "involvement" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]], were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Detter Delupis, ''The Law of War'', pp. 69–70. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Damrosch, "Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures", p. 202. ''Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses'', Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

While this Definition of Aggression has often been cited by opponents of conflicts such as the 1999 [[Kosovo War]] and the 2003 [[Iraq War]], it has no binding force in [[international law]]. The doctrine of ''[[Nulla poena sine lege]]'' means that, in the absence of binding international law on the subject of aggression, no penalty exists for committing acts in contravention of the definition. It is only recently that heads of state have been indicted over acts committed in wartime, in the cases of [[Slobodan Milošević]] of [[Serbia]] and [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]] of [[Liberia]]. However, both were charged with [[war crimes]], i.e. violations of the [[laws of war]], rather than with the broader offence of "a crime against international peace" as envisaged by the Definition of Aggression.

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The [[United Nations Charter]] empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it "in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'', p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argue that the Definition of Aggression has had "no visible impact" on the deliberations of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Bassiouni and B. B. Ferencz, "The Crime against Peace", ''International Criminal Law'', I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court===
{{Main|Crime of aggression}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] lists the crime of aggression as one of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). However, Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute states that "The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm#art.5  Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law.

A '''wolfdog''' is a [[Canis|canine]] produced by the [[canine reproduction|mating]] of a [[dog|domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') with a [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[Eastern wolf|eastern timber wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), or [[ethiopian wolf]] (''Canis simensis'') to produce a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]].

==Description==
There are a range of experts who believe that they can distinguish a wolf, a wolfdog, and dog apart but have been proven to be incorrect when providing their evidence before courts of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Pierotti|first1=R.|last2=Fogg|first2=B.|title=The First Domestication: How Wolves and Humans Coevolved|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|pages=225–237|isbn=978-0-300-22616-4|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=aq88DwAAQBAJ}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic admixture|Admixture]] between domestic dogs and [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|other subspecies of gray wolves]] are the most common wolfdogs since dogs and gray wolves are considered the same species, are genetically very close, and have shared vast portions of their ranges for millennia. Such admixture in the wild have been detected in many populations scattered throughout Europe and North America, usually occurring in areas where wolf populations have declined from human impacts and persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0086409 |title= Multilocus Detection of Wolf x Dog Hybridization in Italy, and Guidelines for Marker Selection|date= |accessdate=2016-04-06 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0086409 |volume=9 |journal=PLOS One |page=e86409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.97425.x/abstract;jsessionid=3701E88446C129A3898F1E177A56284E.f02t04 |title=Hybridization between Wolves and Dogs |date=2001-12-24 |accessdate=2016-04-06 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.97425.x |volume=13 |journal=Conservation Biology |pages=195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, wolfdogs are also often bred in captivity for various purposes. Admixture of dogs and two other North American wolf species have also occurred historically in the wild, although it is often difficult for biologists to discriminate the dog genes in the eastern timber and red wolves from the gray wolf genes also present in these wolf species due to their historical overlaps with North American gray wolves as well as with coyotes, both of which have introgressed into the eastern timber and red wolf gene pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wolf.nrdpfc.ca/greatlakeswolf.htm |title=Great Lakes-Boreal Wolf |website=Wolf.nrdpfc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, because many isolated populations of the three wolf species in North America have also mixed with coyotes in the wild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003333 |title=Hybridization among Three Native North American Canis Species in a Region of Natural Sympatry |publisher=PLOS One |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been speculated by some biologists that some of the [[coywolf|coywolf hybrids]] in the northeastern third of the continent may also have both [[coydog]]s and wolfdogs in their gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/science/28coyotes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Mysteries That Howl and Hunt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrids between dogs and Ethiopian wolves discovered in the Ethiopian Highlands likely originated from past interactions between free-roaming feral dogs and Ethiopian wolves living in isolated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular genetics of the most endangered canid: the Ethiopian wolf Canis simensis. |date=2015-09-28 |pmid=7921357 | volume=3 |journal=Mol.

The term "wolfdog" is preferred by most of the animals' proponents and breeders{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} because the domestic dog was taxonomically recategorized in 1993 as a [[subspecies]] of ''Canis lupus''. Recognized wolfdog breeds by [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] are the [[Czechoslovakian Wolfdog]] and the [[Saarloos Wolfdog]].

==Varieties==
One of the issues that many researchers and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and gray wolf subspecies. The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is phenotyping, a method that involves observing the animal's physical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texx-wolf-tails.com/contentandphenotyping.htm |title=Content and Phenotyping - Wolf-dog Education |website=Texx-wolf-tails.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is often favoured for many in determining the degree of wolf and northern spitz-type dog that is in a wolfdog. However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that phenotyping cannot always determine the wolf-contents accurately. Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture due to the fact that dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in [[subspecies of Canis lupus|various subspecies with many different regional ecotypes]] hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Teotihuacan wolfdogs===
In 2010, archeologists announced that they had found the remains of wolf-dogs that had been kept by the warrior class of the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization in Mexico's central valley about two thousand years ago, and that, in light of this finding, certain animals commonly depicted in the art of that culture, which had been thought to be strange dogs or coyotes, are being re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2010/12/16/experts_ancient_mexicans_crossbred_wolf_dogs/|title=Experts: Ancient Mexicans crossbred wolf-dogs|accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World black wolves===
[[File:Blacklupus.jpg|thumb|Genetic research has shown that [[Black wolf (animal)|wolves with black pelts]] owe their coloration to a mutation that first arose in domestic dogs]]
Genetic research from the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] revealed that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation that entered the wolf population through admixture with the dog.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/science/06wolves.html?ref=todayspaper|title=New World Wolves and Coyotes Owe Debt to Dogs|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Adolph Murie]] was among the first wolf biologists to speculate that the wide color variation in wolves was due to interbreeding with dogs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retrieverman.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/adolph-murie-speculated-on-dog-wolf-hybridization-as-the-source-of-unusual-color/ |title=Adolph Murie speculated on dog-wolf hybridization as the source of unusual color |publisher=Retrieverman.wordpress.com |date=2013-08-27 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"I suppose that some of the variability exhibited in these wolves could have resulted from crossings in the wild with dogs. Such crosses in the wild have been reported and the wolf in captivity crosses readily with dogs. Some years ago at Circle, Alaska, a wolf hung around the settlement for some time and some of the dogs were seen with it. The people thought that the wolf was a female attracted to the dogs during the breeding period. However, considerable variability is probably inherent in the species, enough perhaps to account for the variations noted in the park and in skins examined. The amount of crossing with dogs has probably not been sufficient to alter much the genetic composition of the wolf population."|''The Wolves of Mount McKinley'' by Adolph Murie, 1944, {{ISBN|0-295-96203-8}}, 978-0-295-96203-0, 238 pages}}

In 2008, Dr. Gregory S. Barsh, a professor of genetics and pediatrics at the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] used molecular genetic techniques to analyze [[DNA]] sequences from 150 wolves, half of them black, in [[Yellowstone National Park]], which covers parts of [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]]. It was discovered that a gene [[mutation]] responsible for the [[protein]] [[beta-defensin 3]]  is responsible for the black coat color in dogs.&lt;ref name="solved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1635213/black_wolf_mystery_solved/index.html |title=Black Wolf Mystery Solved |publisher=Redorbit.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding that the same mutation was responsible for black wolves in North America and the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Apennines]], he set out to discover the origin of the mutation. Barsh and his colleagues concluded that the mutation arose in dogs 13,000 to 120,000 years ago, with a preferred date of 47,000 years ago after comparing large sections of wolf, dog, and [[coyote]] [[genome]]s.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; At the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], Robert K. Wayne, a canine evolutionary biologist, stated that he believed that dogs were the first to have the mutation. He further stated that even if it originally arose in Eurasian wolves, it was passed on to dogs who, soon after their arrival, brought it to the New World and then passed it to wolves and coyotes.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas H.

===North American gray wolf-domestic dog admixture===
In the United States, over 100,000 wolf-dogs exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199903)21:3&lt;247::AID-BIES9&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z|title=Origin, genetic diversity, and genome structure of the domestic dog|journal=BioEssays|volume=21|issue=3|pages=247|year=1999|last1=Wayne|first1=Robert K|last2=Ostrander|first2=Elaine A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In first-generation wolfdogs, [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] are most often crossed with wolf-like dogs (such as [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Siberian Husky|Siberian Huskies]], and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s) for an appearance most appealing to owners desiring an [[exotic pet]].&lt;ref name="DEFRA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/pdf/protection/dwa-wolfdogs.pdf |format=PDF| title = The Keeping of Wolf-Hybrids in Great Britain | work = | publisher = [[RSPCA]] | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hierran Wolfdog===
The [[Hierran Wolfdog]] originated in the Island of [[El Hierro]], in the [[Canary Islands]] ([[Spain]]). Although its origin is still uncertain, in the 15th century dogs similar to [[wolf|wolves]] already existed in the [[Canary Islands]], called cancha by [[Guanches|Aboriginals]]. At the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the chaplains accompanying the Conquistadors wrote about the presence of "wild dogs like wolves, but they are small".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordercolliemuseum.org/BCCousins/EuropeWestern/Spain.html |title=BC Museum: Herding Dogs of Western Europe: Spain |website=Bordercolliemuseum.org |date=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the Hierran Wolfdog has been present in the last two centuries and could have probably come up with the first settlers of the island. This dog has achieved its preference among the shepherds of the island.

==Documented breeding==
[[File:Menagerieclupus.jpg|thumb|British wolfdogs, as illustrated in ''The Menageries: Quadrupeds Described and Drawn from Living Subjects'' by [[William Ogilby]], 1829]]

The first record of wolfdog breeding in [[Great Britain]] comes from the year 1766 when what is thought was a male wolf mated with a dog identified in the language of the day as a "Pomeranian", although it may have differed from the modern [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] breed.  The union resulted in a litter of nine pups. Wolfdogs were occasionally purchased by English noblemen, who viewed them as a scientific curiosity. Wolfdogs were popular exhibits in British menageries and zoos.&lt;ref name="DEFRA" /&gt;

Six breeds of dog exist that acknowledge a significant amount of recent wolf-dog admixture in their creation. One breed is the "wolamute", aka "malawolf", a cross between an [[Alaskan Malamute]] and a [[Gray wolf|timber wolf]]. Four breeds were the result of intentional crosses with German Shepherds (one of the original intentionally bred wolf-dog [[crossbreeds]]), and have distinguishing characteristics of appearance that may reflect the varying subspecies of wolf that contributed to their foundation stock. Other, more unusual crosses have occurred; recent experiments in Germany were conducted in the crossing of wolves and [[Poodles]].&lt;ref name="Doris Feddersen-Petersen 2004"/&gt;  The intent behind creating the breeds has ranged widely from simply the desire for a recognizable companion high-content wolfdog to professional military working dogs. Typical examples include:

=== The Saarloos wolfdog ===
[[File:Saarloos.jpg|thumb|left|A Saarloos Wolfdog]]

In 1932, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] breeder [[Leendert Saarloos]] crossed a male [[German Shepherd]] dog with a female [[European wolf]]. He then bred the female offspring back with the male German Shepherd, creating the [[Saarloos wolfdog]]. The breed was created to be a hardy, self reliant companion and housedog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/saarloosewolfdog|title=United Kennel Club Breed Standard: Saarloosewolfdog |website=Ukcdogs.com |date=2006-07-01 |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honor its creator they changed the name to "Saarloos Wolfdog". In 1981 the breed was recognized by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (FCI). Some Saarloos Wolfdogs have been trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog ===
[[File:Czechoslovakian-wolfdog-profile big.jpg|thumb|A [[Czechoslovakian Wolfdog]]]]
In the 1950s, the [[Czechoslovakian Wolfdog]] was also created to work on border patrol in the countries now known as [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. It is recognized by the [[Foundation Stock Service]] of the [[American Kennel Club]], the [[United Kennel Club]], and the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]], and today is used in agility, obedience, search and rescue, police work, therapy work, and herding in Europe and the United States.

===German Shepherds===
[[File:German Shepherd Dog with disc.jpg|thumb|right|The breeding program that created the German Shepherd included wolfdogs]]

Among the dogs used in the development of the [[German Shepherd]], at least four were either wolfdogs or partly descended from wolfdogs.
In 1899, [[Max von Stephanitz]], an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein, who was allegedly one-quarter wolf. Renamed [[Horand von Grafrath]], the dog and his progeny were used to create the German Shepherd. Horand became the centre-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits. Although fathering many pups, Horand's most successful was Hektor von Schwaben.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Hektor was line bred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Beowulf, who later fathered a total of eighty-four pups, mostly through being line bred with Hektor's other offspring. In the original German Shepherd studbook, Zuchtbuch für Deutsche Schäferhunde (SZ), within the two pages of entries from SZ No. 41 to SZ No. 76, there are four wolf crosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/gsd/progeny/1183.html|title=Progency list for V Beowulf|publisher=Pedigree Database|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first documented use of pure wolf genes to create a domestic dog breed, the German Shepherd, which is historically thought to be the first documented intentionally-bred wolfdog.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====The Lupo Italiano====
[[File:LupoItaliano.jpg|thumb|left|A Lupo Italiano]]

The [[Lupo Italiano]] is claimed to have been created in 1966 by crossing a German Shepherd with a wild wolf from northern [[Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menandpets.com/cani/en_lupo_italiano.htm |title=Photos and characteristics of the "Lupo italiano" |publisher=Menandpets.com |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maternal genetics and gestation was from the wild wolf.&lt;ref name="orig reference2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italia-online.co.uk/article.php/HappybirthdayLupoItaliano |title=Lupo italiano|publisher=Italia-online.co.uk|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the breed is claimed to be a hybrid of the German shepherd with an [[Italian wolf]], a genetic study conducted in 2018 could find no connection between this dog and the Italian wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ece3.3842|title=Studies of modern Italian dog populations reveal multiple patterns for domestic breed evolution|journal=Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|last1=Talenti|first1=Andrea|last2=Dreger|first2=Dayna L|last3=Frattini|first3=Stefano|last4=Polli|first4=Michele|last5=Marelli|first5=Stefano|last6=Harris|first6=Alexander C|last7=Liotta|first7=Luigi|last8=Cocco|first8=Raffaella|last9=Hogan|first9=Andrew N|last10=Bigi|first10=Daniele|last11=Caniglia|first11=Romolo|last12=Parker|first12=Heidi G|last13=Pagnacco|first13=Giulio|last14=Ostrander|first14=Elaine A|last15=Crepaldi|first15=Paola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the breed is protected by presidential decree stipulating that this 'State' dog can not be commercialized nor bred outside the officially recognized agency, the Etli, Ente Tutela del Lupo Italiano (Agency for the protection of the Lupo Italiano).&lt;ref name= "Dog Breeds of the World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogbreeds.bulldoginformation.com/lupo-italiano.html |title=Lupo Italiano (Italian Lupo)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Kunming wolfdog====
[[File:Kunming Dog.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kunming wolfdog|Kunming dog]]]]

The [[Kunming wolfdog]], also commonly known as the Kunming dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabaike.com/article/316/328/2007/20070717142273.html |title=昆明犬 - 动物百科 |publisher=Chinabaike.com |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an established breed of wolfdog originated in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snowdog-northerninuit.webs.com/wolfdogs.htm |title=Wolfdogs - Snowdog |publisher=Snowdog-northerninuit.webs.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other wolfdog crosses, Kunming dogs are suitable as guard dogs and working dogs due to their German Shepherd ancestry. They have been trained as military assistant dogs to perform a variety of tasks such as detecting mines. Some are also trained to be fire dogs and rescue dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armydog.com.cn/newsdisp.asp?id=132 |title=昆明犬（图片）保留了早期工作德国牧羊犬基因但退化已令人担忧-军犬网—军犬德国牧羊犬 |publisher=Armydog.com.cn |date=2009-02-01 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are commonly kept as family companions by many pet owners in China.

==Livestock guardian dogs==
A 2014 study found that 20% of wolves and 37% of dogs shared the same [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[haplotype]]s in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. More than 13% of the studied wolves had detectable dog ancestry and more than 10% of the dogs had detectable wolf ancestry. The results of the study suggest that admixture between wolves and dogs is a common event in the areas where large [[livestock guardian dog]]s are held in a traditional way, and that gene flow between dogs and gray wolves was an important force influencing gene pool of dogs for millennia since early domestication events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopaliani |first1=Natia |last2=Shakarashvili |first2=Maia |last3=Gurielidze |first3=Zurab |last4=Qurkhuli |first4=Tamar |last5=Tarkhnishvili |first5=David |date=12 March 2014 |title=Gene Flow between Wolf and Shepherd Dog Populations in Georgia (Caucasus) |journal=Heredity |doi=10.1093/jhered/esu014 |pmid=24622972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Random-bred wolfdogs==
Cases of accidental breeding of wolfdogs are known (though this is very rare), where a domestic dog female in [[oestrus]] strays and is mated by a male wild wolf.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Wolfdogs in the wild==
Admixture in the wild usually occurs near human habitations where wolf density is low and dogs are common.&lt;ref name="WOLVES"&gt;{{cite book | author1= L. David Mech |author2=Luigi Boitani | url =  | title=Wolves: Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation | year=2001 | page= 448 | isbn= 0-226-51696-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were several reported cases of wolfdogs in areas with normal wolf densities in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Der Wolf; Prof. Dr. Dmitrij Iwanowitsch Bibikow, Moskau, 2. Auflage; A. Ziemsen Verlag, Wittenberg Lutherstadt, 1990, {{ISBN|3-7403-0155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild wolfdogs were occasionally hunted by European aristocracy, and were termed ''lycisca'' to distinguish them from common wolves.&lt;ref name="anthologie"&gt;{{cite book | author= Rousseau, Élise | url =  | title=Anthologie du Loup | year=2006 | page= 319 | isbn= 2-603-01335-1 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted historic cases (such as the [[Beast of Gévaudan]]) of large wolves that were abnormally aggressive toward humans, may be attributable to wolf-dog mating.&lt;ref name="Controversy"&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |title=The Wolf-Dog Hybrid: An Overview of a Controversial Animal |publisher=Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter |url= http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/newsletters/v5n4/5n4wille.htm|accessdate=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Europe, unintentional mating of dogs and wild wolves have been confirmed in some populations through genetic testing. As the survival of some Continental European wolf packs is severely threatened, scientists fear that the creation of wolfdog populations in the wild is a threat to the continued existence of European wolf populations.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3602741.stm | title = Claws reveal wolf survival threat | work = Paul Rincon | publisher = BBC online | accessdate = 2007-05-11 | date=2004-04-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, extensive admixture between wolf and dog is not supported by morphological evidence, and analyses of [[mtDNA]] sequences have revealed that such mating are rare.&lt;ref name="WOLVES" /&gt; In 1997, during the [[Wolf reintroduction#In Arizona|Mexican Wolf Arizona Reintroduction]], controversy arose when a captive pack at [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park|Carlsbad]] designated for release was found to be largely composed of wolfdogs by Roy McBride, who had captured many wolves for the recovery programme in the 1970s. Though staff initially argued that the animals' odd appearance was due to captivity and diet, it was later decided to euthanise them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolfcrossing.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/the-courts-were-wrong-these-wolves-are-hybrids.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617162853/http://wolfcrossing.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/the-courts-were-wrong-these-wolves-are-hybrids.pdf |date=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a study compared the sequences of 61,000 [[Single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] ([[mutations]]) taken from across the genome of grey wolves. The study indicated that there exists individual wolves of dogwolf ancestry in most of the wolf populations of Eurasia but less so in North America. The admixture has been occurring across different time scales and was not a recent event. Low-level admixture did not reduce the wolf distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/eva.12595|pmid=29875809|title=Widespread, long-term admixture between grey wolves and domestic dogs across Eurasia and its implications for the conservation status of hybrids|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=11|issue=5|pages=662|year=2018|last1=Pilot|first1=Małgorzata|last2=Greco|first2=Claudia|last3=Vonholdt|first3=Bridgett M|last4=Randi|first4=Ettore|last5=Jędrzejewski|first5=Włodzimierz|last6=Sidorovich|first6=Vadim E|last7=Konopiński|first7=Maciej K|last8=Ostrander|first8=Elaine A|last9=Wayne|first9=Robert K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breed-specific legislation ==
The wolfdog has been the center of controversy for much of its history, and most [[breed-specific legislation]] is either the result of the animal's perceived danger or its categorization as protected native wildlife.&lt;ref name="defra.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/wolfdogs/wolfdogs.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215025632/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/wolfdogs/wolfdogs.pdf |date=December 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]], the [[RSPCA]], [[Ottawa Humane Society]], the [[Dogs Trust]] and the Wolf Specialist Group of the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] consider wolfdogs to be wild animals and therefore unsuitable as pets, and support an international ban on the private possession, breeding, and sale of wolfdogs.&lt;ref name="DEFRA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawahumane.ca/wolfdoghybrids.html |title=Ottawa Humane |publisher=Ottawahumane.ca |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/press_and_publications/press_releases/wolf_and_wolf-dog_hybrid.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181505/http://www.hsus.org/press_and_publications/press_releases/wolf_and_wolf-dog_hybrid.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Wolfdog Alliance, 40 U.S. states effectively forbid the ownership, breeding, and importation of wolfdogs, while others impose some form of regulation upon ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfdogalliance.org/legislation/statelaws.html |title=NWA |publisher=Wolfdogalliance.org |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island prohibit wolfdogs as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruch|first=Robert H.|title=The Wolf Almanac|year=2007|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-59921-069-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most European nations have either outlawed the animal entirely or put restrictions on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfdogalliance.org/legislation/statelaws.html |title=National Wolf Dog Alliance |publisher=Wolfdogalliance.org |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfdogs were among the breeds banned from the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] base at [[Camp Pendleton]] and elsewhere after a fatal dog attack by a Pitbull on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/my-entry.html |title=Marine Corps bans pit bulls, Rottweilers at Camp Pendleton, other bases |work=L.A.

==Description==
[[File:Wolfhybridskeleton.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of a wolf-dog hybrid from the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]]]

The physical characteristics of an animal created by breeding a wolf to a dog are not predictable, similar to that of [[mixed-breed dogs]]. Genetic research shows that wolf and dog populations initially diverged approximately 14,000 years ago and have interbred only occasionally since, accounting for the dissimilarity between dogs and wolves in behavior and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/276/5319/1687 |title=Vila, C., Savolainen, P., Maldonado, J. E., Amorim, I. R., Rice, J. E., Honeycutt, R. L., et al. (1997). Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog. '&amp;#39;Science 276'&amp;#39;(5319), 1687-1689. Retrieved December 21, 2006 |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=1997-06-13 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5319.1687 |volume=276 |journal=Science |pages=1687–1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the resulting adult wolfdog may be larger than either of its parents due to the genetic phenomenon of [[heterosis]] (commonly known as ''hybrid vigor'').&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; Breeding experiments in Germany with [[Poodle]]s and wolves, and later on with the resulting wolfdogs showed unrestricted fertility, mating via free choice and no significant problems of communication (even after a few generations). The offspring of poodles with either coyotes and [[jackal]]s however all showed a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding between the hybrids. The researchers therefore concluded that domestic dogs and wolves are the same species.&lt;ref name="Doris Feddersen-Petersen 2004"&gt;Doris Feddersen-Petersen, Hundepsychologie, 4. Auflage, 2004, Franck-Kosmos-Verlag 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfdogs display a wide variety of appearances, ranging from a resemblance to dogs without wolf blood to animals that are often mistaken for full-blooded wolves. A lengthy study by [[DEFRA]] and the [[RSPCA]] found several examples of misrepresentation by breeders and indeterminate levels of actual wolf pedigree in many animals sold as wolfdogs. The report noted that uneducated citizens misidentify dogs with wolf-like appearance as wolfdogs.&lt;ref name="DEFRA" /&gt; Wolfdogs tend to have somewhat smaller heads than pure wolves, with larger, pointier ears that lack the dense fur commonly seen in those of wolves. Fur markings also tend to be very distinctive and not well blended. Black coloured wolfdogs tend to retain black pigment longer as they age, compared to black wolves.&lt;ref name="diff"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section1.html | title = The Wolf Hybrid: Identification | work = Monty Sloan | publisher = Wolf Park | accessdate = 2007-05-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303000105/http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section1.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the presence of [[dewclaw]]s on the hind feet is considered a useful, but not absolute indicator of dog gene contamination in wild wolves. Dewclaws are the vestigial first toes, which are common on the hind legs of domestic dogs but thought absent from pure wolves, which only have four hind toes.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

Observations on wild wolfdogs in the former [[Soviet Union]] indicate that in a wild state these may form larger packs than pure wolves, and have greater endurance when chasing prey.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book | author = Graves, Will |url = http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | title = Wolves in Russia: Anxiety throughout the ages | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-55059-332-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} High wolf-content wolfdogs typically have longer [[canine teeth]] than dogs of comparable size, with some officers in the [[South African Defence Force]] commenting that the animals are capable of biting through the toughest padding "like a knife through butter".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{citation | year=2003 | chapter=The Wolf Inside Every Dog | title = The mammoth book of maneaters | editor1=Alex MacCormick | publisher=Carroll &amp;amp; Graf Publishers | isbn=978-0-7867-1170-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sense of smell apparently rivals that of most established scenthounds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Tests undertaken in the Perm Institute of Interior Forces in Russia demonstrated that high wolf-content wolfdogs took 15–20 seconds to track down a target in training sessions, whereas ordinary police dogs took three to four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/25-04-2006/79498-wolf-0 |title=Russian police employ wolves for service |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=2006-04-25 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific evidence to support the claims by wolfdog researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=N.

== Health ==
Wolfdogs are generally said to be naturally healthy animals, and are affected by fewer inherited diseases than most breeds of dog. Wolfdogs are usually healthier than either parent due to [[heterosis]].&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; Some of the established breeds of wolfdog that exist today were bred specifically to improve the health and vigor of working dogs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There is some controversy over the effectiveness of the standard dog/cat [[rabies]] vaccine on a wolfdog. The [[USDA]] has not to date approved any rabies vaccine for use in wolfdogs, though they do recommend an [[off-label use]] of the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/wolfdogs/wolfdogs.pdf |title=RSPCA report on wolfdogs |publisher=DEFRA |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfdog owners and breeders purport that the lack of official approval is a political move to prevent condoning wolfdog ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/wolfdogproject/rabies.html |title=The WolfDog Project QandA |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027130231/http://geocities.com/wolfdogproject/rabies.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperament and behavior==

Wolfdogs are a mixture of genetic traits, which results in less predictable behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog.&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; The adult behavior of wolfdog pups also cannot be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups, even in third-generation pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from the behavior of the parent animals.&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolfdog may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not.&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; The majority of high wolf-content wolfdogs are very curious and are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Due to the variability inherent to their admixture,&lt;ref name="Controversy" /&gt; whether a wolf–dog cross should be considered more dangerous than a dog depends on behavior specific to the individual alone rather than to wolfdogs as a group.

The view that aggressive characteristics are inherently a part of wolfdog temperament has been contested in recent years by wolfdog breeders and other advocates of wolfdogs as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inetdesign.com/wolfdunn/wolfdogfaq/pets.html |title=The Wolf Dunn's Wolfdog FAQ - Question #1 |publisher=Inetdesign.com |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Wolf Is At The Door, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolf-to-wolfdog.org/index1.htm |title=The Wolf Is At The Door, Inc |publisher=Wolf-to-wolfdog.org |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
