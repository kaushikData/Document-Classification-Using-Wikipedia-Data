'''Lehbib Ould Ali Ould Said Ould Yumani''', known as '''Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi''', is an [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] Islamic militant and leader of the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]].

== History ==

al-Sahrawi was born in [[Laayoune]], [[Western Sahara]] into part of a wealthy trading family that fled the city for [[refugee camp]]s in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name="Dilanian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|last2=Kube|first2=Courtney|last3=Bishop|first3=Mac William|title=U.S. Soldiers in Niger Were Pursuing ISIS Recruiter When Ambushed|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/africa/u-s-soldiers-niger-were-pursuing-isis-recruiter-when-ambushed-n813746|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guichaoua"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guichaoua|first1=Yvan|last2=Lebovich|first2=Andrew|title=America's options in Niger: join forces to reduce tensions, or fan the flames|url=https://theconversation.com/americas-options-in-niger-join-forces-to-reduce-tensions-or-fan-the-flames-86655|publisher=''The Conversation''|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Polisario Front]] and received military training, but demobilised amid promises of a [[United Nations]] referendum on the status of the Western Sahara.&lt;ref name="Guichaoua"/&gt;

A former commander in [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], he was later part of the group that founded the [[Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa]] in October 2011. While part of MUJWA/MUJAO, he was one of its most senior leaders, serving on its shura council and communicating with international media as MUJWA’s spokesman. By 2013, he was calling himself the leader of an organisation named the Mujahideen Shura Council in [[Gao]], [[Mali]]. After MUJAO merged with [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]]'s Al-Mulathameen group in August 2013 to form [[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoun]], he was an important leader in Al-Murabitoun, later becoming its overall head.&lt;ref name="jamestown"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/brief/may-2015-briefs/|title=May 2015 Briefs|website=Jamestown|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2015, Abu Walid declared his allegiance to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and formed [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]]. Not all of Murabitoun accepted the move, with [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]] denying that al-Murabitoun had pledged to Baghdadi, causing a split in the group. More than a year and a half later the allegiance was publicly accepted by IS's Amaq news agency.&lt;ref name="longwarjournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-recognizes-oath-of-allegiance-from-jihadists-in-west-africa.php|title=Islamic State recognizes oath of allegiance from jihadists in Mali &amp;#124; FDD&amp;#039;s Long War Journal|website=longwarjournal.org|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, he was reported to have issued threats against the Moroccan government.&lt;ref name="longwarjournal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/report-head-of-the-islamic-states-sahara-branch-threatens-morocco.php|title=Report: Head of the Islamic State&amp;#039;s Sahara branch threatens Morocco &amp;#124; FDD&amp;#039;s Long War Journal|website=longwarjournal.org|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, al-Sahrawi accused the Imghad and [[Idaksahak]] communities of defending Niger and France and threatened retaliation against them.&lt;ref name="Imghad and Idaksahak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jihadist leader Al-Sahraoui accuses and threatens two communities in Mali|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20170627-chef-jihadiste-al-sahraoui-accuse-menace-communautes-mali-imghad-idaksahak|publisher=RFI|accessdate=28 November 2017|language=French|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint-Amand Bazard''' (18 September 1791{{snd}}29 July 1832) was a French socialist, the founder of a secret society in France corresponding to the [[Carbonari]] of [[Italy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Biography==
He was born in Paris. He took part in the defence of Paris in 1815, and afterwards occupied a subordinate situation in the [[prefecture]] of the [[Seine (département)|Seine]] [[département in France|département]].  At 25 years of age, he was appointed a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]]. 
About 1820, he united some of his patriotic friends into a society called ''Amis de la vérité''. 
From this, a complete system of Carbonarism developed, whose peculiar principles were introduced from Italy by two of Bazard's friends. 
Bazard himself was at the head of the central body, and, while taking a general lead, contributed extensively to the Carbonarist journal, ''L'Aristarque''. 
An unsuccessful outbreak at [[Belfort]] ruined the society, and the leaders were compelled to conceal themselves. Bazard, after remaining for some time in obscurity in Paris, came to the conclusion that the ends of those who wished well to the people would be most easily attained, not through political agitation, but by effecting a radical change in their social condition.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

This train of thinking naturally drew him towards the socialist [[philosophy|philosophers]] of the school of [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simon]], whom he joined, he contributed to their journal, ''Le Producteur''; and in 1828 began to give public lectures on the principles of the school. His opposition to the emancipation of women brought about a quarrel with [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin|Enfantin]] in 1831, and Bazard found himself almost deserted by the members of the society. He attacked Enfantin violently, and, in a heated argument among them, he was struck down by apoplexy. After lingering for a few months, he died.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">[[File:Benzhu Sanxing, Dali, Yunnan.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sanxing (deities)|Sanxing]] (Three Star Gods) at a Benzhu temple on Jinsuo Island, in [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture|Dali]], [[Yunnan]].]]
'''Benzhuism''' ({{zh|c=本主教|p=Běnzhǔjiào|l=religion of the patrons}}) is the [[indigenous religion]] of the [[Bai people]], an ethnic group of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. It consists in the worship of the ''ngel zex'', the [[Bai language|Bai]] word for "patrons" or "lords", rendered as ''benzhu'' (本主) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], that are local gods and [[progenitor|deified ancestors]] of the Bai people. It is very similar to common [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]].

While many of the Bai are [[Buddhists]], the local government of China has recently helped the revival of the Benzhu [[ethnic religion]], for example through the promotion of the Gwer Sa La festival.&lt;ref&gt;Liang Yongjia, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The patrons==
===Local lords and ancestors===
The ''benzhu'' are mainly [[deification|deified]] ancestors, "patrons" or "lords" of the local communities. Every Bai village has its own pantheon of gods which has formed throughout its existence, incorporating its history in deifying virtuous leaders, warriors, and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"&gt; ''Cultural China'', [http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/216Traditions9978.html The Benzhu religion of the Bai]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103070312/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/216Traditions9978.html |date=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These deities, who are tied to the immediate surroundings, protect the people against sickness and violence, foster local economy, and grant prosperity.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt;

Generally, one village enshrines one benzhu, and there are also cases of multiple villages consecrated to the same benzhu. In every village around [[Erhai Lake]] the local people have developed a peculiar mythology about their local lord, differing from that of neighboring villages.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt; This tradition is similar to that of the [[City God (China)|City God Temple]] of Chinese religion.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt;

===Gods of nature===
Other ''benzhu'' are gods of the generation of the local place.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt; These include the God of the Mountain, the God of the Crops, the God of the Hunt, the [[Dragon King]] or the Mother Goddess of the Dragon King.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt;

==Features==
===Benzhu festivals===
Benzhu Festivals in [[Dali City]] take place according to the [[Chinese calendar|lunar calendar]], after [[Chinese New Year]]. During festivals, the benzhu shrine are taken from the temples and carried through the towns to a different location where they stay for a number of days. The villagers follow the gods to the designated place burning incense and worshiping with food and money.

===Psychology and shamanism===
The Bai believe that the soul does not die with the body, but it can go to the "Kingdom of the Shades" helped by complex ritual ceremonies performed by the living community.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt; Angry spirits can cause illness, but local gods can protect people against them. Illnesses are caused by the possession of evil spirits and they can be treated by female [[shaman]]s.&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt;

===Cult of the white stones===
The Nama branch of the Bai, residing near the [[Mekong River]], preserves a cult of the white stones common to the ethnic groups descended from the [[Qiang people]].&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt; Some believe they represent the bones of the ancestors, others that they are a representation of the Fire God, a deity worshipped around [[China]].&lt;ref name="culturalchina"/&gt;

'''Big Tex''' is a 55-foot (16.75m) tall statue and marketing icon of the annual [[State Fair of Texas]] held at [[Fair Park]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The figure has become a cultural icon of Dallas and Texas. Since 1952 Big Tex has served as a cultural ambassador to visitors, and the statue's prime location in the fairgrounds serves as a traditional meeting point.

On October 19, 2012, the last weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, Big Tex was destroyed by an electrical fire that started in the right boot and worked its way up the structure, first becoming visible from the neck area.
After the fire, a new Big Tex was created by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. This rendition made its first public appearance on September 26, 2013.&lt;ref name="dallasnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/state-fair-of-texas/headlines/20130926-resurrection-of-big-tex-called-for-engineering-skill-secrecy.ece|title=Resurrection of Big Tex called for engineering skill, secrecy|work=dallasnews.com|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/state-fair-of-texas/headlines/20130927-throughout-the-summer-big-tex-took-shape.ece|title=Throughout the summer, Big Tex took shape|work=dallasnews.com|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Big-tex-1956.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Big Tex, 1956]]

===Origins===
[[Kerens, Texas]] is known as the "Birthplace of Big Tex", although his original incarnation was as a 49-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) tall [[Santa Claus]] constructed from [[iron]] [[Casing (borehole)|drill casing]], [[papier mache]], and unraveled rope in 1949.&lt;ref name="ci.kerens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.kerens.tx.us/index.php?id=mteznzm1odmxnq5|title=City of Kerens, Texas|work=kerens.tx.us|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was an idea of Howell Brister, manager of the Chamber of Commerce, to encourage holiday sales in the town, and the "World's Largest Santa Claus" (a claim later disputed) stood over Colket Avenue for two holiday seasons — drawing press attention from as far away as Iran and Australia.&lt;ref name="BigTex_a"&gt;"Big Tex ready for 60th." Dallas Morning News, The (TX) 28 Sep. 2012, 1, BRIEFING: 09. NewsBank. Web. 19 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bigtex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigtex.com/sft/AboutUs/BigTex.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022170914/http://www.bigtex.com/sft/AboutUs/BigTex.asp |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Big D." Dallas Morning News. 12-17-1952&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled after Kerens residents Ottis Franklin Spurlock and Hardy Mayo, the figure was built by members of the community who welded the frame, fabricated the body and sewed the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/texas/2011-12-12/recalling-history-big-tex#.UIGSS2mMXV4|title=Recalling the history of Big Tex|work=Lubbock Online - Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two seasons the excitement over the statue faded, and Kerens offered it up for sale. In 1951, State Fair president [[R. L. Thornton]] purchased Santa's components for $750 and had artist Jack Bridges transform them into a [[cowboy]], giving birth to "Big Tex".

===1952 to 2012===
Big Tex made his debut at the 1952 fair, a 52-foot cowboy dressed in denim jeans and a plaid shirt donated by the H. D. Lee Company of Shawnee Mission, Kansas.&lt;ref name="big tex" /&gt; Artist Jack Bridges used a photograph of his own face, a photograph of rancher Doc Simmons and a photograph of Will Rogers to create the new look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesterdayusa.com/big_tex_fact_page.htm|title=BIG TEX FACT PAGE|work=yesterdayusa.com|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fair, his appearance was slightly altered to straighten his nose and correct an odd wink. It was in 1953 that Big Tex also began speaking. Using a custom-built recipromotor and a 75-watt speaker system housed in the figure's head, Jack Bridges devised a way to create the illusion of natural speech with a swinging jaw.&lt;ref&gt;"The Tallest Talkin' Texan is Texas' Tallest Talker." Dallas Morning News. 10-11-1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Tex also attended a convention in [[Minneapolis]] that year with the Dallas [[Jaycees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigtex.com/sft/guestinfo/documents/BigTex101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013201843/http://www.bigtex.com/sft/guestinfo/documents/BigTex101.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Big Tex received his first new change of clothes, again fabricated by the H. D. Lee Company.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair's Big 'Tex' to Get New Duds." Dallas Morning News. 09-26-1955&lt;/ref&gt; After that year's fair, he traveled to West Texas to participate in [[Abilene Christian University|Abilene Christian College]]'s 50th annual homecoming celebration.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Tex Goes to College." Dallas Morning News. 11-01-1955&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-foot-tall, 19-foot long plastic model of a Hereford steer (called "The Champ") accompanied Big Tex for the 1956 fair, but Big Tex was primarily displayed alone. During the 1950s Big Tex underwent further re-design, replacing the papier mache "skin" with fiberglass. The original head was put into storage and later sold at auction in 1993 to a Dallas collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/communityblogs/atmosphere/article/Archive-Head-of-Big-Tex-goes-for-big-bucks-at-3964277.php|title=Archive: Head of Big Tex goes for big bucks at auction|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Big Tex for State Fair of Texas 2006.jpg|200px|thumb|Big Tex, 2006]]

The State Fair of Texas announced the construction of a permanent, year-round statue of Big Tex in 1961, but the figure remained a seasonal feature appearing only during the fair.&lt;ref&gt;"Tex to Get Permanent Fair Home." Dallas Morning News. 09-21-1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Big Tex Circle display area was redesigned in 1966 with a larger mound.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Tex Gets Buildup." Dallas Morning News. 08-29-1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Tex traveled to his hometown of Kerens, Texas in 1981 to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the city.&lt;ref name="ci.kerens" /&gt; The figure continued to travel to various promotional events until the mid-1980s.

In 1997, Big Tex was given a skeletal makeover consisting of 4,200 feet of steel rods weighing 6,000 pounds. The new skeleton adjusted the posture and allowed for a new hand that waved to passersby, but kept the original head.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Jacquielynn. "A REFINED COWBOY - Body building has given Big Tex a picturesque physique." Dallas Morning News, The (TX) 23 Sep. 1997, ARLINGTON MORNING NEWS, NEWS ARLINGTON: 10A. NewsBank. Web. 19 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later his neck was animated, allowing it to turn; his mechanical mouth was also upgraded with a new system.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, Kim. "A turning point - State Fair will be a pivotal moment for Big Tex and new swiveling head." The Dallas Morning News 15 Sep. 2000, THIRD, NEWS: 1A. NewsBank. Web. 19 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Tex celebrated his 50th birthday in 2002, receiving a giant birthday cake and an [[AARP]] card. Shades of gray were added to the hair and wrinkles were added the figure's hands and face as Big Tex continued to "age".&lt;ref&gt;APPLETON, ROY. "Big Tex, 50, and he's still a hunk - No loose-fitting jeans here, but there is that AARP membership." The Dallas Morning News 17 Aug. 2002, SECOND, NEWS: 1A. NewsBank. Web. 19 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the State Fair of Texas celebrated Big Tex's 60th birthday.

==Destruction and recreation==
[[File:Big Tex fire.2 retouched.jpg|thumbnail|right|Big Tex as seen during the fire on 19 October 2012]]
On the morning of October 19, 2012 (the final weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, and on Big Tex's 60th birthday) a fire started inside the framework of Big Tex. The figure's clothing, face and hat were completely destroyed in minutes as onlookers watched. An official investigation determined that the fire started in an electrical panel (fixed wiring) under the attraction's right boot. This panel was believed to have powered the air compressor that kept the clothing of the statue 'inflated'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blaze began in Tex's Right Boot, State Fair official says|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Fire-leaves-Big-Tex-a-skeletal-frame-174951021.html|accessdate=5 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012020522/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Fire-leaves-Big-Tex-a-skeletal-frame-174951021.html|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the fire received national attention, and fair officials committed to rebuilding Big Tex "bigger and better" in time for the 2013 fair.

Working under secrecy, a new Big Tex was created during 2013 by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. at a cost of $500,000.&lt;ref name="dallasnews.com"/&gt; The recreated statue weighs {{convert|19,000|lb|kg|1}} more than the previous version, bringing him to {{convert|25,000|lb|kg|1}}. This allows Big Tex to withstand {{convert|100|mph|kph|1}} winds without needing support wires as in previous versions. The height was increased by {{convert|1|yd|cm|1}} to {{convert|55|ft|m|1}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Big-Tex-Makes-His-Debut-One-Day-Early--225380402.html|title=Big Tex Makes His Debut One Day Early|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Tex Circle, the location during the State Fair of Texas, was also enlarged and reinforced for the larger statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/entertainment/the-scene/Big-Tex-Circle-Plans-Receive-Praise-in-City-Review-197890601.html|title=Big Tex Circle Plans Receive Praise|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clothing ==
Big Tex generally receives a new shirt and jeans every 3 seasons, currently designed and fabricated by the Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company. His clothing will next be replaced in 2019.

Prior to 2013, Big Tex wore size 70 boots, a 75-gallon hat, a size 100 180/181 shirt made from nylon awning fabric and 284W/185L XXXXXL pair of Dickies jeans. The pants alone required {{convert|72|yd|m}} of [[denim]] and weigh in at {{convert|65|lb|kg}}. Over the years the outfit was accessorized with other articles associated with that year's State Fair of Texas theme. Big Tex has suffered a few garment mishaps over the years. In 1961, Hurricane Carla's winds tore his clothes. In 1970, his huge shirt was stolen from a pickup truck and received much publicity.&lt;ref name="BigTex_a" /&gt;

The recreated structure for Big Tex that appeared in 2013 required new clothing and larger sizes. The new Dickie shirt features a 14-foot collar, 23 foot sleeves and weighs {{convert|130|lb|kg}}. The shirt is made from {{convert|150|yd|m}} of awning material. The new Dickie jeans features a 27-foot waist, 22 foot inseam and weighs {{convert|100|lb|kg}}. The jeans are made from {{convert|100|yd|m}} of denim material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storeassured.com/big-tex-infographic/ |title=Vital Stats of Big Tex |author=Blair Valk |date=29 October 2013 |work=storeassured.com |publisher=Assured Self Storage |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voices of Big Tex==
Big Tex welcomes fairgoers with his friendly drawl of "Hoooowdeeee, fooolllllks!" and makes regular announcements throughout the duration of the State Fair of Texas. His booming voice has been played by only a few men over six decades, who perform every day of the fair from a booth known as the "doghouse".

Al Jones, a disc jockey for WRR FM 101.1, was the first voice of Big Tex. Al spoke for Big Tex for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.dallas.tx.us/cso/archives/Exhibits/WRR/WRRdjs.htm |title=Famous WRR Disc Jockeys |author= |date= |work= |publisher=dallascityhall.com |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio announcer Jim Lowe, the most well-known voice of Big Tex, performed for 39 continuous years until 1998. Dan Alexander stepped up for the next two years. In 2001 a statewide competition and contest, held live at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]], announced [[Sonny Ray Stolz]] as the next voice of Big Tex. But after only one season Sonny decided not to continue due to what he considered unprofessional treatment by Fair officials and the Fair brought in runner-up Bill Bragg in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesterdayusa.com/bigtex/ |title=Psst!

'''Captain Gallagher''' (died 1818) was an Irish highwayman who, as one of the later [[Irish Rapparees]] (guerrillas), led a bandit group in the hills of the Irish countryside, armed with a [[blunderbuss]], of the day, during the late 18th and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stand-and-deliver.org.uk/highwaymen/gallagher.htm |title=The Irish Highwayman" as told in "Tales from the West of Ireland" by Sean Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/IRELAND/2001-01/0978997840 |title=Subject: [IRELAND] Tales from the West of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Bonniconlon]], [[County Mayo]] he lived with his aunt in [[Derryronane, Swinford]] for much of his early life and raised near the woods of [[Barnalyra]]. As he reached early adulthood, he and group of others began raiding [[mail coaches]] as well as wealthy landowners and travelers throughout eastern Mayo and parts of southern [[County Sligo]] and western [[County Roscommon]].

His attacks on landowners were especially widely known and, in one reported incident, Gallagher and his men raided the home of an extremely unpopular landlord in [[Killasser]] and forced him to eat half a dozen [[eviction]] notices he had recently drawn up for nearly half a dozen [[tenant farmer]]s before escaping with silver and other valuables.

Although successfully evading British patrols for some time, he was finally apprehended by authorities in the parish of [[Coolcarney]] (or possibly [[Attymass]]) near the foothills of the [[Ox Mountains]] while recovering from an illness at a friend's home during Christmas.

He had been informed on by a neighbor whom Gallagher had formerly helped after sending a message of Gallagher's whereabouts to the British commanding officer at [[Foxford]]. Immediately sending for reinforcements from [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], [[Castlebar]] and [[Swinford]], a force of 200 [[Red coat (British army)|redcoats]] were sent after Gallagher and, upon their arrival, proceeded to surround the home where the highwayman had been staying. Gallagher, by then in poor health and not wishing to endanger his host or his family, surrendered to the British. Taken back to Foxford, he was tried and convicted before being taken to [[Castlebar]] where he was executed.

Shortly before his execution, he had claimed to the British commanding officer that his treasure had been hidden under a rock in the woods of Barnalyra. After Gallagher's execution, the officer quickly led several cavalryman to Barnalyra who discovered there were thousands of rocks in the wood, upon a long search of all the rocks within the area, they reportedly only recovered a jewel [[hilt]]ed sword. It has been speculated that Gallagher may have been hoping to lead them to the site in the hopes his men would be able to rescue him from their hideout near the Derryronane-Curryane border although the treasure, if he owned more than the sword, was never recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Charles William Frédéric Dumas''' (1721–1796) was a [[man of letters]] living in the [[Dutch Republic]] who served as an American diplomat during the [[American Revolution]].

He was born in German [[Ansbach]] to [[France|French]] parents, apparently lived in [[Switzerland]] for a time, and moved to the Netherlands around 1750.&lt;ref&gt;*Purcell, L. Edward. ''Who Was Who in the American Revolution''. New York: Facts on File, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8160-2107-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended [[Benjamin Franklin]] when the latter was in Holland at the beginning of the American Revolution, and when Franklin chaired the [[Committee of correspondence]], they employed Dumas as a secret agent to aid American interests in Europe. When [[John Adams]] became minister plenipotentiary to Holland, Dumas acted as his secretary and translator. When Adams went to [[Paris]], Dumas acted as chargé d'affaires ad interim from the United States. Dumas died soon after 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2y-W-_4gIM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:0_Y6oxjHcoqbcZ0uV7i6r_#PPA603,M1 Wharton, Francis (editor) "The revolutionary correspondence of the United States." Volume 1, 1889. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C.diplomatic  pages 603-604.Retrieved December 25, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, Dumas devised the first diplomatic [[cipher]] used by the Continental Congress and Benjamin Franklin for secret correspondence with agents in Europe. It was a substitution code based on a prose passage of 682 characters, so that a given character could be replaced by more than one number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/intelligence/intelltech.html "Codes and ciphers," in "Intelligence techniques," Central Intelligence Agency Retrieved December 25, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumas planted stories favorable to the United States in the Gazette de Leide [[Leyden, Holland]], with the goal of gaining a good credit rating for the United States in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;Knott, Stephen F., "Secret and sanctioned, covert operations and the American Presidency," Oxford University Press, 1996, page 21. {{ISBN|0-19-510098-0}}  {{ISBN|978-0-19-510098-3}}. Retrieved December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Dumas contacted officials in Holland, Spain and France seeking trade in badly needed materials for the United States. This led to beneficial trade during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2002_summer_fall/foreign_policy.htm Hartsoe, Kenneth D., Commerce and diplomacy- the first year of American foreign policy 1775-1776.

      <comment>I have condensed the previous description, which made multiple and confusing references to the Santa Monica Museum of Art. I replaced language that suggested that the Santa Monica Museum of Art had closed permanently with language that conveys the fact that it changed its location and name. I also added specific years to Longhauser's tenure at the Moore College of Art and Design instead of referencing "seventeen years".</comment>

==Early life and education==
Longhauser is from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. She attended [[Antioch College]] as a young woman. She married and had three children before completing her bachelor's degree in art history in 1971, from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Champion"&gt;Suzanne Muchnic, [http://search.proquest.com/docview/421676090/B16DD3BD2B5E426CPQ/10 "Champion of the Overlooked: The Santa Monica Museum's New Director Hopes to Make Room for Artists Who Haven't Yet Shown Up on the Radar"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (June 18, 2000): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Longhauser was director of several galleries in Philadelphia early in her career.&lt;ref name="Champion" /&gt;  She organized an "important show" of [[outsider art]] at the [[Philadelphia College of Art]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Tyson, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4552370/elsa_longhauser_credited_as_an/ "Fort Worth Museums Showcase Self-Taught Artists Who Defy Labels"] ''Kerrville Daily Times'' (November 9, 1998): 5A. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Longhauser continued her interest in the genre when she organized a touring show of [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight, [http://search.proquest.com/docview/282207739/B16DD3BD2B5E426CPQ/5 "Making Magic from the Mundane: Terry Fox's Work is Spiritual with a Secular Slant"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 23, 1994): 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she was guest co-curator with [[Harald Szeemann]] at the [[Museum of American Folk Art]] for a "major traveling show" of works by self-taught American artists.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Museum of Art, [http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/1998/6.html "Self-Taught Artists of the 20th Century: An American Anthology"] (March 10, 1998-May 17, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tessa DeCarlo, [http://search.proquest.com/docview/398647247/B16DD3BD2B5E426CPQ/6 "The Gallery: Drawings Lost and Found"] ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 11, 1998): A18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsa Longhauser became gallery director at Moore College of Art and Design in 1983; during her tenure there, she was called an "unsung hero of the local cultural scene".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sozanski, [http://articles.philly.com/1991-01-09/news/25820956_1_college-galleries-adolf-wolfli-show-art "Bringing Art from Margins to the Center; As Gallery Director at Moore College of Art and Design, Elsa Longhauser is Attracting International Attention"] ''Philly.com'' (January 9, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Longhauser left Philadelphia and became director of the Santa Monica Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="Cheng" /&gt;

'''Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr''' was Sultan of [[Pate_Island#Pate_Town|Pate]], [[Kenya]] (1779 - 1809).
Around 1800 the Pate Sultan took over [[Lamu]], however, they were deeply resented by the people of Lamu. Fumomadi was persuaded ("by a faithful old advisor") to build a [[Lamu Fort|fort]] on the seafront in Lamu Town, to protect members of his government. He died  (a natural death) before the first storey of the fort was completed.&lt;ref name=Martin7&gt;Martin, 1973, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

There was much disagreement over choosing his successor, as he had fifty children and all sons and male ín-laws were eligible for the throne. After "encouragement" from the powerful [[Mazrui]] family from [[Mombasa]]/[[Oman]], an in-law named [[Ahmad ibn Shaykh]] was chosen as the next Sultan.&lt;ref name=Martin7/&gt;

== Views on 2012 Assam violence ==

It has to tackle the problem of D-Voters (doubtful voters), numbering approximately 1.5 lakh, while preparing the electoral rolls of Assam. The subject matter is sub-judice. This also poses a very serious security threat to the country. It is advisable that these pending cases lying in various courts and tribunals be disposed of quickly and within a definite timeframe. People who are found to be illegal migrants by these tribunals should be deported. Unless this basic issue of illegal migration into the country is resolved, the problem is bound to recur from time to time and in place to place."&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/how-to-share-assam/980438/0 |title=How to share Assam |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno began his career after attending [[Osaka University of Arts]] as an [[animator]] for the anime series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982&amp;ndash;1983).&lt;ref name="gainax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainax.co.jp/hills/anno/bymyself-e.html |title=Official biography |publisher=[[Gainax]] |accessdate=2007-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819090939/http://www.gainax.co.jp/hills/anno/bymyself-e.html#1994 |archivedate=2007-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrapped up in producing the [[DAICON III and IV Opening Animations]] with his fellow students, he was eventually expelled from Osaka.&lt;ref name="khara"/&gt;

Anno did not gain recognition until the release of his work on [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s [[1984 in film|1984]] film ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]''. Running short on animators, the film's production studio posted an ad in the famous Japanese animation magazine [[Animage]], announcing that they were in desperate need of more animators. Anno, in his early twenties at the time, read the ad and headed down to the film's studio, where he met with Miyazaki and showed him some of his drawings. Impressed with his ability, Miyazaki hired him to draw some of the most complicated scenes near the end of the movie,&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Studio Ghibli, ''The Birth of Studio Ghibli'' video, [[circa|c.]] 2003 (included on UK Nausicaä DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; and valued his work highly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/features/archive/news/2006/05/20060504p2g00m0fe019000c.html |title=Evangelion Special: Genesis of a major manga |publisher=[[MSN News]] |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-24 |df= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno went on to become one of the co-founders of [[Gainax]] in December 1984.&lt;ref name="gainax"/&gt; He worked as an [[animation director]] for their first feature-length film, ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise]]'' (1987), and ultimately became Gainax's premiere anime director, leading the majority of the studio's projects such as ''[[Gunbuster]]'' (1988) and ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]'' (1990&amp;ndash;1991).&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030417/ |title=IMDB Profile |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anno fell into a four-year [[depression (mood)|depression]] following ''Nadia'' — the series was handed down to him from [[NHK]] from an original concept by Hayao Miyazaki (of which ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' is also partly based upon) and he was given little creative control.

In 1994, the minor planet [[9081 Hideakianno]] was named after him by his old friend [[Akimasa Nakamura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=祝！小惑星「庵野秀明」が誕生しました。|url=http://www.town.kumakogen.ehime.jp/culture/astro/obs/other/mp/Anno.html|website=www.town.kumakogen.ehime.jp|accessdate=19 July 2016|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120919044425/http://www.town.kumakogen.ehime.jp/culture/astro/obs/other/mp/Anno.html|archivedate=19 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=9081+Hideakianno|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Neon Genesis Evangelion''===
{{main article|Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)#Production}}

Anno's next project was the anime television series {{nihongo|[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]|新世紀エヴァンゲリオン|Shin Seiki Evangerion}} (1995&amp;ndash;1996), which would be touted as an influential animated series.

Anno's history of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturedvultures.com/evangelion-depression-hideaki-anno-lars-von-trier-anime/|title=Evangelion, Depression and why Hideaki Anno is the Lars Von Trier of anime}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the main source for many of the psychological elements of the series and its characters, as he wrote down on paper several of the trials and tribulations of his condition. During the show's production, Anno became disenchanted with the Japanese "[[otaku]]" lifestyle. For this and other reasons (although perhaps by design as well), ''Evangelion''{{'}}s plot became increasingly dark and psychological as the series progressed, despite being broadcast in a children's television timeslot. Anno felt that people should be exposed to the realities of life at as young an age as possible, and by the end of the series all attempts at traditional [[narrative]] logic were abandoned, with the final two episodes taking place within the main character's mind.

The show did not garner high ratings in Japan at its initial time slot, but after being moved to a later, more adult-oriented venue, it gained considerable popularity. Budgeting issues at Gainax also forced Anno to replace the planned ending of ''Evangelion'' with two episodes set in the main characters' minds. After these last two episodes were aired, Anno received numerous letters and emails from fans, both congratulating him on the series and criticizing the last two episodes. Among these were [[death threat]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats|title=End of Evangelion Death Threats - EvaWiki - An Evangelion Wiki - EvaGeeks.org|website=wiki.evageeks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and letters of disappointment from fans who thought Anno had ruined the series for them. In 1997, Gainax launched a project to re-adapt ''Evangelion''{{'}}s scrapped ending into a feature-length film. Once again, budgeting issues left the film unfinished, and the completed 27 minutes of animation were included as the second act of ''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth]]''. Eventually, the project culminated in ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'', a three-act film that served as a finale to ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''.

In September 1999, Anno appeared on the NHK TV-documentary "Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Senpai!", answering some ''Evangelion''-related questions, including the origin of the name ''Evangelion'', and teaching children about animation production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-05-03|title=Hideaki Anno talks to kids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2015, Anno spoke about his feelings regarding Asuka and Rei. He claimed:
"The truth is, I have no emotional attachment to Rei at all. 
In the midst of making Eva, I suddenly realized that I had forgotten her. Her very existence. For example, in episode seven, I remembered and added one shot with Rei. I had no attachment to her at all. I think that was okay, because in episode eight, she didn't appear. Not even in a single shot."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/04/14-1/evangelion-creator-hideaki-anno-discusses-rei-versus-asuka&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent work===
[[File:Hideaki Anno and Ryusuke Hikawa 20141030 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anno with [[Ryūsuke Hikawa]]. (October 30, 2014)]]
After ''Evangelion'', Anno directed the 1998 anime series ''[[Kare Kano|Kareshi Kanojo no Jijō]]'' (''Kare Kano'' for short, also known in English as ''His and Her Circumstances''), the first [[Gainax]] television series to be directly adapted from previously-written material. During the production of ''Kare Kano'', Anno became frustrated with the restrictions placed on the show by [[TV Tokyo]] after the [[Dennō Senshi Porygon|Pokémon seizure incident]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokyo Travelogue February 3rd, 1999|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031101182610/http://www.nausicaa.net/~michj/tokyo/990203.html|work=[[nausicaa.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has not directed television anime since then.

The director has also made forays into live-action films, beginning with ''[[Love &amp; Pop]]'' (1998), a [[cinéma vérité]]-style film about [[enjo kosai]] ("compensated dating", a form of teenage [[prostitution]]) in [[Japan]], of which a major portion was shot on miniature digital cameras with constantly shifting [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]]. He won Best New Director Award at 1998 [[Yokohama Film Festival]] for the film. [[Asumi Miwa]] who played the lead role won Best New Talent award respectively. His second live-action film, ''[[Shiki-Jitsu]]'' (2000) (''"Ritual Day"'' or ''"Ceremonial Day"''), is the story of a burnt-out former animation director (played by popular [[independent film|indie]] director [[Shunji Iwai]]) who falls in love with a woman disconnected from reality. Though an experimental work like ''Love &amp; Pop'', this film was shot using the more traditional [[2.35:1]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] and has a generally more polished presentation, eschewing the [[cinéma vérité]] grittiness of Anno's first live-action film. This movie earned him Best Artistic Contribution Award at [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] and very positive reviews.

Anno's third [[live-action film]] was ''[[Cutie Honey (film)|Cutie Honey]]'', based on [[Go Nagai]]'s 1973 manga and anime series. Released in the summer of 2004, this lighthearted fantasy/superhero film was a stark contrast to his earlier, more realist live-action works.  Later in 2004, Anno supervised but did not direct the three-part OVA, ''[[Re: Cutie Honey]]'', instead directed by [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]] (part 1), [[Takamichi Itō]] (part 2), and Masayuki (part 3).

Also released in 2004 was the movie {{nihongo|''[[Funky Forest]]''|ナイスの森|Nice no Mori}}, in which Anno makes several acting cameos: as the student in the front row of the "Home Room!" skit sitting next to Hataru, in "Who's the Director?" as an animator who feels he is being overworked, and finally in "Singles Picnic" he is among the men awaiting females who never come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On August 1, 2006, Hideaki Anno's official website was updated with job listings for key animators and production staff at a company he founded, [[Studio Khara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=9318|title=New Hideaki Anno Project in the Works|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, it is reported by the October edition of the Japanese animation magazine ''[[Newtype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2006, GAINAX's official website confirmed that ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' was in the works. The first three movies would be an alternate retelling of the TV series (including many new scenes, settings, backgrounds, characters), and the fourth movie would be a completely new conclusion to the story.  Kazuya Tsurumaki and Masayuki would direct the movies while Yoshiyuki Sadamoto would provide character designs and Ikuto Yamashita would provide mechanical designs. Shinji Higuchi would provide storyboards for the first movie. The first was launched in Summer 2007, and the second and third were planned to be launched in 2008, however, the second installment was released by itself on June 27, 2009. The third movie was to be released simultaneously with the fourth, instead, the third movie was released on November 17, 2012 and a release date for the fourth movie has yet to be announced. On February 17, 2007, Anno published an official statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies|title=Hideaki Anno Releases Statement About New Evangelion Movies|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Japanese Yahoo Portal for the films regarding his personal involvement and goals in their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2007, Hideaki Anno resigned from Gainax.&lt;ref name="khara"/&gt; In 2011 Anno co-produced the Koinobori Pictures movie ''Kantoku Shikkaku'' ("Failed Director"), directed by [[Katsuyuki Hirano]] featuring [[Yumika Hayashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/khara_inc/statuses/55828859714670595|title=株式会社カラー on Twitter|author=|date=|work=twitter.com|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110410172427/http://www.khara.co.jp/news/2011/04/000004.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101215045545/http://johakyu.net/archives/2010/12/2010-12-11-001074.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-04-06/evangelion-anno-produces-kantoku-shikkaku-film|title=Interest: Evangelion's Anno Produces Kantoku Shikkaku Film|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0030959|title=『エヴァ』庵野秀明の独占コメント掲載　実写映画初プロデュース作品は伝説の女優・林由美香を元恋人・平野勝之のカメラが追ったドキュメンタリー！（1/3）|author=|date=|work=cinematoday.jp|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Anno was the curator of an exhibit entitled ''Tokusatsu- Special Effects Museum-Craftsmanship of Showa and Heisei Eras Seen Through Miniatures'', held at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo]], featuring actual props and suits from many of Japan's [[tokusatsu]] films and TV shows. Anno also produced a short live-action film for the exhibit, entitled ''A Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo'', featuring the Giant Warrior-God from Studio Ghibli’s animated film [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2012/08/24/scifi-japan-tv-02-tokusatsu-museum/|title=SciFi JAPAN TV #02: Tokusatsu Museum 第２話「特撮博物館」|author=|date=24 August 2012|work=scifijapan.com|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3unlD_XIhQ|title=Tokusatsu Museum・特撮博物館 (SciFi Japan TV #02)|first=|last=CHO Japan|date=24 August 2012|website=Scifijapan.com|accessdate=19 July 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno has gone on to work with [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Studio Ghibli]] on several short films which have been shown at the [[Ghibli Museum]]. He also voiced the main character [[Jiro Horikoshi]] in Miyazaki's 2013 feature film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.

Anno designed the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato#Space Battleship Yamato: 2199|Space Battleship Yamato 2199]]'' sci-fi anime television series opening sequence.&lt;ref name="Yamato_2199_Anno"&gt;{{cite news|title=Evangelion Director Hideaki Anno to Design Yamato 2199 Anime Opening |work=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=2012-02-25|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/01/25/evangelion-director-hideaki-anno-to-design-yamato-2199-anime-opening|accessdate=2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Anno and Studio Khara launched ''[[Japan Animator Expo]]'', a series of [[original net animation]]s made by various directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-26/khara-dwango-launch-weekly-animator-expo-anime-shorts/.80355|title=Khara, Dwango Launch Weekly Animator Expo Anime Shorts|author=|date=|work=animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, it was announced that Anno would team up with close friend and Gainax cofounder [[Shinji Higuchi]] to write and codirect ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'', the 2016 reboot of [[Toho]]'s [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/hideaki-anno-and-shinji-higuchi-to-direct-tohos-godzilla-2016-1201464017/|title=Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi to Direct ‘Godzilla 2016’|first=Patrick|last=Frater|date=1 April 2015|work=variety.com|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
Anno has appeared in [[manga]] twice, both created by personal acquaintances. His wife, Moyoko Anno, wrote ''[[Insufficient Direction]]'', a chronicle of their courtship and marriage and depicting Anno's "true face" as "the founder of the [[otaku]] cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-16/moyoco-anno-insufficient-direction-manga-launches-project |title=Moyoco Anno's Insufficient Direction Manga Launches Project - News |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2014-02-16 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a college-age version of him appeared alongside other Gainax founders [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]], [[Takami Akai]], and [[Toshio Okada]] in the [[Kazuhiko Shimamoto]] manga ''[[Aoi Honō]]''. Anno attended [[Osaka University of Arts]] with Shimamoto. ''Aoi Honō'' was adapted into a live action television drama in 2014, where Anno was played by actor [[Ken Yasuda (actor)|Ken Yasuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-05-24/ken-yasuda-to-play-hideaki-anno-in-aoi-hono-drama/.74869|title=Ken Yasuda to Play Hideaki Anno in Aoi Honō Drama|author=|date=|work=animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2014 animated series [[Shirobako]] has a walk-on appearance by a character named "Mitsuaki Kanno", who is an obvious caricature of Anno.

'''I Gusti Nyoman Lempad''' (1862?&amp;ndash;1978) was known as a [[Balinese people|Balinese]] stone [[sculptor]] and [[architect]] (Undagi in [[Balinese language|Balinese]]) who built the palaces and temples in [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages. In his later years, he produced hundreds of linear drawings of [[Balinese mythology]] and folklore. ''Lempad of Bali'', a short documentary film produced by John Darling and Lorne Blair, tells the story of Lempad at the end of his life and his [[cremation]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Blair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pringle pp 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

Lempad's exact birth date, as many Balinese of his time, is unknown. But he was married when [[Krakatoa]] erupted in 1883. He died on April 25, 1978 at his home in Ubud, Bali. He gathered his family and asked them to bathe him and then died. The Balinese believed that he chose the time of his death at the day that considered most holy.&lt;ref&gt;Blair&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he maintained a close friendship with foreign artists, including [[Rudolf Bonnet]] and [[Walter Spies]], Lempad never compromised his distinctive identity as a Balinese artist, and one with a broad range of talents in many media; [[painting]], sculpture and architecture.

'''James Lewis Ranchino''' ({{IPAc-en|r|æ|n|ˈ|k|iː|n|oʊ}}; April 20, 1936 - November 7, 1978), known as '''Jim Ranchino''', was a pollster, [[political consultant]], and [[political scientist]] on the faculty of [[Ouachita Baptist University]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]], [[Arkansas]]. He died of a massive [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while awaiting to appear on [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television]] station [[KATV-TV|KATV]] on the night of the 1978 [[general election]].&lt;ref name=rnelson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rexnelsonsouthernfried.com/?p=955|title=Election Night|publisher=rexnelsonsouthernfried.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranchino was a strong supporter of his fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], future [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref name=amarcus/&gt; who that night easily defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Lynn Lowe]] to win the first of five non-consecutive terms as [[governor of Arkansas]].

==Background==

Ranchino was one of five children born in [[Herrin, Illinois|Herrin]] in [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]] in southern [[Illinois]] to Angelo "Comp" Ranchino (1908-1988) and the former Esther Verna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williamson.illinoisgenweb.org/marriage.html|title=Williamson County Marriage Project|publisher=Williamson.illinoisgenweb.org|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were three sisters, Alma Joy Hise (1928-2010) of Herrin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meredithwaddell.com/p/whatNew.php?whatnewID=177 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130902171706/http://www.meredithwaddell.com/p/whatNew.php?whatnewID=177 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 2, 2013 |title=Alma Joy Hise |publisher=meredithwaddell.com |accessdate=September 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariann R. Hunt (1933-2010), of [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]],&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilesfuneralhomes.com/obituary/Mariann-Hunt/Des-Moines-IA/856869|title=Mariann Hunt|publisher=ilesfuneralhomes.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cheryl Ranchino Trench, a newspaper columnist in Herrin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrinillinois.com/?page_id=653|title=Cheryl Ranchino Trench|publisher=herrinillinois.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a brother, John Edward Ranchino, who died in infancy.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt; Ranchino and his wife, Veda, had two children, Tony A. Ranchino (born 1969), a photojournalist for KATV in Little Rock, where his father collapsed, and Nicole "Niki" R. Jackson (born 1971), who was seven at the time of her father's death and operates a children's camp. After her husband's early death, Veda continued to live in [[Clark County, Arkansas|Clark County]] and the next year married local prosecuting attorney Henry Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2008/apr/06/frontampcenter-niki-jackson-20080406/|title=Spencer Watson, Niki Jackson, April 6, 2008|publisher=arkansasonline.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranchino graduated from [[Herrin High School]] in 1954. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Louisiana College]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="obu-bulletin"&gt;[https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=catalogs ''Ouachita Baptist University General Bulletin 1969–1970''], Ouachita Baptist University, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 or 1964, he received his [[Master of Arts]] in history from [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]; his thesis is entitled "The Work and Thought of a Jeffersonian in the Populist Movement: James Harvey 'Cyclone' Davis" and is a study of the [[Populism|Populist]] organizer and Democratic [[U.S. Representative]] [[James H. Davis (congressman)|James "Cyclone" Davis]] of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clio.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/Texts/Documents/Bibliography/biography.htm|title=Biography (Jim Ranchino)|publisher=clio.missouristate.edu|accessdate=September 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625065305/http://clio.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/Texts/Documents/Bibliography/biography.htm|archivedate=June 25, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied graduate political science, and also history under the historian [[William Appleman Williams]],&lt;ref name=rmoore&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Da-Ali-Show-Compleet-Seereez/dp/B002OID4WM|title=By Robert Moore - Published on Amazon.com|publisher=amazon.co.uk|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his time at the [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]], where he was from 1963 to 1965.&lt;ref name="obu-bulletin"/&gt; Ranchino was described as a "campus radical".&lt;ref name=amarcus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-229834253/bill-clinton-in-arkansas-generational-politics-the|title=Alan Marcus, Bill Clinton in Arkansas: Generational Politics, the Technology of Political Communication and the Permanent Campaign|publisher=''The Historian'' (Vol. 72, No. 2)|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and political career==

At Ouachita Baptist University, where he started in 1965,&lt;ref name="obu-bulletin"/&gt; his teaching colleagues included two other Arkansas political figures, [[Bob C. Riley]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas|lieutenant governor]] from 1971 to 1975, and the Clinton friend and [[Whitewater]] associate [[Jim McDougal|James B. Dougal]], who subsequently ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1982 against the late Republican [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]] in [[Arkansas' 3rd congressional district]]. Coincidentally, Clinton himself had lost the 1974 congressional race to Hammerschmidt. A Ranchino student recalls that the professor demanded original thinking by his students and sometimes gave false information in a lecture to test the alertness and preparation of the class.&lt;ref name=rmoore/&gt; Ranchino was the director of the OBU [[Volunteers in Service to America]] program, the first of its kind established in 1968 in Arkansas. Forty-eight students signed up initially as volunteers. In 1969, the program was co-sponsored by OBU and the Arkansas Council on Human Relations and described at the time as the largest of its kind in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4257|title=Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)|publisher=''Encyclopedia of Arkansas''|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. T. Simes, II, an [[African American]] student at OBU who in 1970 was elected vice president of the student body, recalls Ranchino as a:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
visionary.  I will never forget the conversation we had about political polling. He could foresee the art of polling as early as 1970. He allowed me to challenge him on this point. I didn’t believe that it was possible to predict voter behavior in that there were so many variables. Dr. Ranchino was right. Now polling is a basic component of our electoral process. Most memorable was the time he invited me to come to his office the following day to meet ... this man dressed like a [[hippie]], long hair, etc. Dr. Ranchino said to me, L. T., I want to introduce you to Bill Clinton. He became governor of Arkansas and later President of the United States. Times passes on ... While in [[University of Arkansas School of Law|law school]] I again met Bill Clinton as my law professor. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holyspirit777.com/testimony.aspx |title=L. T. Simes, Jr., The Testimony of the Holy Spirit |publisher=holyspirit777.com |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927021021/http://holyspirit777.com/testimony.aspx |archivedate=September 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1968 general election, Arkansas was declared "schizophrenic" by political observers for having cast its [[electoral vote]]s for [[George Wallace]], its gubernatorial majority for [[Moderate Republican]] [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], and its [[U.S. Senate]] ballots for [[J. William Fulbright]]. As a result, Ranchino in 1972 published the book ''From Faubus to Bumpers: Arkansas Votes, 1960-1970,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Faubus-Bumpers-Arkansas-votes-1960-1970/dp/B0006C6GYG|title=Jim Ranchino,  Faubus to Bumpers;: Arkansas votes, 1960-1970|publisher=[[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]]: Action Research, 1972|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a political analysis of state election during the preceding decade. In the study he concludes that Arkansas voters are flexible and [[Independent (politics)|independent]] and can make consistent ballot choices even if they appear inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pu2s11eTlf4C&amp;pg=PA251 |title=Janine A. Parry et al, Readings in Arkansas Politics and Government, |publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|year= 2009|pages=251–252|ISBN=1-55728-902-6|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranchino estimated the 1970 Arkansas electorate as 150,000 conservatives, 150,000 liberals, and 300,000 moderates. In his own words, Ranchino offers this analysis from 1970 which has been rendered obsolete by the development of political events in the 21st century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Republicans have never had a party in Arkansas in the strictest sense. They have not offered consistent opposition to the Democrats at all levels of government and have frequently opted out for individual efforts and campaigns at the expense of the broad party-oriented effort.&lt;br&gt;

...Whichever way the moderate vote leans in any specific election does make the essential difference between victory or defeat for the candidates. ... There is "no emerging Republican majority" (a term coined in 1969 by [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin P. Phillips]]) in Arkansas built on a coalition of [[Blue collar|blue-collar]], middle-class Democrats and upper-class traditional Republicans. The success that Republicans have had in Arkansas has come from a moderate liberal coalition based on blacks and [[Progressivism|progressive]] Democrats. That combination was shattered in 1970. ...&lt;ref&gt;Ranchino, ''From Faubus to Bumpers'', pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1976, Ranchino attributed the Democratic presidential nomination of former [[governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to Carter's young pollster, [[Patrick Caddell]], who advised the candidate to accent the "trust factor," rather than highlighting various temporary campaign issues. Ranchino called his fellow pollster Caddell "the best in the country."&lt;ref&gt;''The Blytheville, Arkansas, Courier News'', June 11, 1976, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1977, the cover of the ''[[Arkansas Times]]'' magazine carried an article by Ranchino, "The Arkansas of the '70s: The Good Ole Boy Ain't Whut He Used to Be", which reflects on the increasing use of [[marijuana]], pre-marital sexual relations, and unfaithfulness to marriage vows "becoming more the rule than the exception".&lt;ref&gt;Jim Ranchino, "The Arkansas of the '70s: The Good Ole Boy Ain't Whut He Used to Be", ''[[Arkansas Times]]'', September 1977, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The article was published at the height of [[Anita Bryant]]'s "Save the Children" campaign against homosexual rights in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. Ranchino wrote that many in Arkansas had by the late 1970s already been viewing the decline of family values with growing anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22315057/A-Crime-Unfit-to-Be-Named|title=W. Brock Thompson, A Crime Unfit to be Named: Arkansas and Sodomy|publisher=''[[Arkansas Historical Quarterly]]'' (Autumn 2002), p. 263-264|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and aftermath==

Ranchino had no inclination of his sudden death. He had done election commentary for KATV since 1972. He leased a private plane to take him out of state as soon as his assignment for KATV had been completed. Ranchino had worked as a pollster on a campaign and wanted to be there for the final counting of the votes.&lt;ref name=rnelson/&gt; Claudia Riley, widow of Lieutenant Governor Bob Riley, whose home in Arkadelphia had been a meeting place for many of the state's rising Democratic politicians,  called Ranchino prior to his death "a bright star on the horizon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/arkansas/interviews/riley.html|title=''Frontline''|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranchino's funeral services were held at the First [[Southern Baptist|Baptist]] Church of Arkadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXifeHLTyxkC&amp;pg=PA293 |title=Marvin Schwartz, In Service to America: A History of VISTA in Arkansas, 1965-1985.

'''John Ryan''' (1925–1992) was an Irish artist, broadcaster, publisher, critic, editor, and [[Public house|publican]].

Ryan was a well-known man of letters, artist and a key figure in bohemian Dublin of the 1940s and 1950s. Founded [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]], in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions. Friend and intimate (and sometime benefactor) to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war era, such as [[Patrick Kavanagh]] and [[Brendan Behan]]; Ryan's memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', evoke literary Dublin of the period 1945-55. Involved in numerous literary events and happenings and, with [[Brian O'Nolan]], organised the first [[Bloomsday]].

==Biography==
John Ryan attended [[Clongowes Wood College]] and the [[National College of Art and Design]] (NCAD), Dublin. One of the eight children of [[Séamus Ryan]],&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of [[Seanad Éireann]], and his wife Agnes Ryan née Harding who came from Kilfeacle and Solohead respectively in [[County Tipperary]] and who were [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] activists during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. His mother was a patron of the painter [[Jack Yeats]], amongst others. His sister was the actress [[Kathleen Ryan]]. Several of Ryan's children followed him into the arts: son and namesake [[John Ryan (publisher)|John Ryan]] (journalist, publisher and actor); [[Seamus Ryan (photographer)|Seamus Ryan]]  (photographer); Anna Livia Ryan (actress).&lt;ref name=ria-dict1&gt;{{cite book| last = McGuire| first = James| last2 = Quinn | first2 = James |year=2009|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|volume= Volume V|location=Dublin|publisher= Royal Irish Academy-Cambridge University Press|ISBN = 978-0-521-63331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ryan studied at the [[National College of Art and Design|NCAD]], but was largely a self-taught painter through a practice of 'careful intelligent observation' combined with 'a genuine and humorous love of land, sea and human tradition' (Hilary Pyle, 'John Ryan exhibition in Cork', [[The Irish Times]], 23 October 1981). He was a regular exhibitor at the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) from 1946 onwards, and also showed at the annual Oireachtas and the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA). Designed theatre sets for the [[Abbey Theatre|Abbey]], [[Gate Theatre|Gate]], [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatres]] as well as for the stage in London. He also acted in and produced several plays.

In response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions founded ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]]'' (1949–1951), and was editor of ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' from 1970–75. As a writer and critic he contributed to literary magazines and newspapers. Publishing two memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', a memoir of post-war literary Dublin, and ''A Wave of the Sea'' (Ward River, 1981), a marine memoir. A broadcaster from the early 1950s he became a long-time contributor to Sunday Miscellany on [[Radio Éireann]] (RTÉ Radio). Purchased The Bailey pub in 1957 which became a famous literary venue frequented by characters such as Kavanagh, O'Nolan, et al. A friend and intimate to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war period, such as [[Brendan Behan|Behan]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Patrick Swift]], [[Seán O'Sullivan (painter)|Seán O'Sullivan]], [[Pearse Hutchinson]], [[J. P. Donleavy]] and [[Brian O'Nolan]], et al., he was also a benefactor to some of these artists, particularly Patrick Kavanagh. During the war years he very cheaply rented a space above the family's Monument Creameries store (now a Burger King) on Grafton Street to sculptor [[Desmond MacNamara]], and which became the site for a famous bohemian salon attended by all of the foregoing names and many more.

Ryan was an important early champion of James Joyce's work in Ireland at a time when Joyce was largely ignored in his homeland: with Brian O'Nolan he organised the first [[Bloomsday]] celebration; in 1951 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce he published a special number  of ''Envoy'' dedicated to Joyce "which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countryman towards their illustrious compatriot"&lt;ref&gt;John Ryan, introduction to ''A Bash In The Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish (Brighton: Clifton Books, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Envoy, Vol. 5, No. 17, April 1951), inviting Brian O'Nolan to be guest editor; edited ''A Bash in the Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish, [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Brian O'Nolan]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Ulick O'Connor]], [[Edna O'Brien]] (Brighton: Clifton Books 1970); saved [[Leopold Bloom]]'s front door to 7 Eccles Street from demolition and used it in The Bailey pub in St. Anne Street, Dublin, from whence it was removed and transported to the Joyce Museum on N. Gt. George's St., Oct. 1995; arranged that the [[James Joyce Tower and Museum|James Joyce Tower]] become a museum; Secretary of the James Joyce Society of Ireland 1970–74.

==Envoy==
December 1949– July 1951. Founded and edited by Ryan.
Envoy was inaugurated in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions which had forced many writers to seek publication outside their homeland.
During its brief existence, ''Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art'', published the work of a broad range of writers, Irish and others. The first to publish [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[Brendan Behan]]'s first short stories and his first poem, and an extract from [[Samuel Beckett]]'s Watt. Envoy included [[Patrick Kavanagh]]'s infamous monthly "Diary". [[Brian O'Nolan]] was another substantial contributor and was "honorary editor"&lt;ref&gt;'In 1951, whilst I was editor of the Irish literary periodical Envoy, I decided that it would be a fitting thing to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce by bringing out a special number dedicated to him which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countrymen towards their illustrious compatriot. To this end I began by inviting Brian Nolan to act as honorary editor for this particular issue. His own genius closely matched, without in anyway resembling or attempting to counterfeit, Joyce's. But if the mantle of Joyce (or should we say the waistcoat?) were ever to be passed on, nobody would be half so deserving of it as the man whom under his other guises as Flann O'Brien and Myles Na gCopaleen, proved himself incontestably to be the most creative writer and mordant wit that Ireland had given us since Shem the Penman himself.' – John Ryan, Introduction to ''A Bash in the Tunnel'' (1970) [http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm John Ryan (1925–92) Ricorso.net]&lt;/ref&gt; for the special number commemorating James Joyce.

==Remembering How We Stood==
An affectionate account of Bohemian Dublin in the 1950s with Behan, Kavanagh, J. P. Donleavy (q.v.), Anthony Cronin and other Dublin characters. Ryan:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Dublin was a town of ‘characters’ then as now, and I suppose will ever be. A man I knew was taking a stroll down Grafton Street one day when he happened to overhear part of a discussion which three citizens were having outside Mitchell’s café. The gist of their dialogue was that they were deploring the absence from the Dublin scene of any real ‘characters’. They appeared to be genuinely aggrieved. They were, in fact, Myles na gCopaleen, Sean O’Sullivan and Brendan Behan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the foreword by [[J. P. Donleavy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As one reads his words, dressed in their wonderful finery of irony, the world he speaks of reblossoms to be back again awhile. To see, feel and smell the Dublin of that day... a masterpiece of reminiscence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First Bloomsday Celebration==

BLOOMSDAY (a term Joyce himself did not employ) was invented in 1954, the 50th anniversary, when John Ryan and the novelist [[Flann O'Brien]] organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the Ulysses route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (Registrar of Trinity College). Ryan had engaged two horse drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, which in Ulysses Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to poor Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. They planned to travel round the city through the day, visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which, in 1967, he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door) having rescued it from demolition . A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~maelduin/firstbloom.html An account of the first Bloomsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrick Kavanagh: 'O commemorate me where there is water'==
Whenever you mention Patrick Kavanagh’s seat on the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal Dublin]], most people will immediately think of the more famous park bench with the statue of Paddy himself sitting to one side of the seat almost beckoning for someone to sit down beside him. This bench is situated on the north bank of the Grand Canal between [[Baggot Street]] Bridge and the upstream Eustace Bridge. John Coll produced the sculpture and the seat was unveiled by President [[Mary Robinson]] on 11 June 1991, however this is not the original seat.
Only a relatively few people will be aware of the lesser known original Kavanagh seat situated on the South Bank at the Lock Gates close to Baggot Street Bridge. As is well known from his poem and heavy hints to his friends, he wished to be commemorated with a simple canal side seat near the lock gates of Baggot Street Bridge. To this effect shortly after his death in 1967, a committee was formed by the late John Ryan and Denis Dwyer to collect a sum of money to purchase the materials and labour for the seat. The seat was erected in the poet's memory by his friends in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Brady. His father and namesake was one of the original committee members, with John Ryan, of the Grand Canal South Bank Seat [http://kavanaghseat.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnny Briscoe''' is an American man falsely convicted of [[rape]] and other crimes and subsequently exonerated by DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-01-27-exonerated_N.htm Those cleared by DNA tests struggle to be free]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-conviction==
Briscoe had a son named Donyea in the early 1980s.

==Crime==
On October 21, 1982, in the early morning, '''Larry Smith''', an acquaintance of Briscoe, broke into a woman's apartment in suburban [[St. Louis, Missouri]], robbed the woman of her jewelry at knifepoint, and then raped her.  Smith remained with the woman, in a lit room, for an hour after the rape, while he smoked a [[cigarette]] and she smoked two.  He told her that his name was Johnny Briscoe.  After the rapist left the scene the victim called police. While police were still on the scene, Smith called the victim's apartment repeatedly, again identifying himself as Johnny Briscoe.  These calls were traced back to a [[payphone]] near Briscoe's apartment.  The woman identified Briscoe in both a photo and in a live [[police lineup]] in which Briscoe was the only person in an orange jumpsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnny Briscoe|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/Johnny_Briscoe.php|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Innocence Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130904225846/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/Johnny_Briscoe.php|archivedate=4 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction==
At the trial, a forensic hair examiner declared that a piece of hair found on the victim's bed was similar to Briscoe's hair.  Briscoe's attorney used an alibi defence, stating that Briscoe was at his apartment, watching [[1982 World Series#Game 7|Game 7]] of the 1982 World Series (in which the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]).  In the court room, Briscoe responded to a question and said that the Brewers won the World Series, making the alibi incredible.  The jury took less than 2 hours to convict Briscoe of all the charges: rape, sodomy, burglary, robbery, stealing and armed criminal action.  He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.

==Imprisonment and exoneration==
Briscoe spent five months in a cell adjacent to Larry Smith whom he confronted and accused of framing him. Smith denied the allegation.  Briscoe's wife divorced him 10 years into the sentence.

Briscoe requested that evidence from the crime scene be tested for  [[DNA profiling|DNA]] but the St. Louis [[District Attorney]] refused. In 1997 Briscoe's motion to compel the District Attorney to search for DNA evidence was rejected.

In 2000, [[Centurion Ministries]] took the case, and, that year and again in 2001, requested that the St. Louis Crime Laboratory search for DNA evidence. The Lab responded that the evidence collected could not be found and was probably destroyed.

In 2004, however, the cigarettes from the crime scene were found in an inventory, but the district attorney was not informed until July 6, 2006.  Testing proved that Larry Smith was the criminal, not Briscoe, and Briscoe was freed on July 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inmate Freed After 23-Year 'Mistake'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/19/national/main1819696.shtml|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=Associated Press: CBS News.com|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Freed After Serving 23 Years For Rape He Didn't Commit Speaks Out|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=100637|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=KSDK.com|date=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Karl|title=Johnny Briscoe free|url=http://www.capitaldefenseweekly.com/?p=1153|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=Capital Defense Weekly|date=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-release==
Briscoe's exoneration was widely covered in national news.  It is taking some time for him to convince his family of his innocence, and for him to get a full-time job.  He is suing St. Louis County and four police officers to compensate him for his time spent in prison.

[[File:Roubaix piscine weerts bara.JPG|thumb|Portrait painted in 1882]]

'''Joseph Bara''', also written '''Barra''' (30 July 1779 in [[Palaiseau]] &amp;ndash; 7 December 1793 in [[Jallais]]), was a young French republican [[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]] at the time of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

== Life, death, and legacy ==
[[File:Mort de Barra IMG 2266.JPG|thumb|''[[The Death of Young Bara|The Death of Joseph Bara]]'' (1794) by a pupil of [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]
[[File:MortdeJosephBara.jpg|thumb|''La Mort de Bara'' by [[Charles Moreau-Vauthier]] (1857–1924)]]

Bara was in fact too young to join the army, but attached himself to a unit fighting [[Revolt in the Vendée|counter revolutionaries]] in [[Vendée]]. After his death General J.-B. Desmarres gave this account, by letter, to the Convention. "Yesterday this courageous youth, surrounded by brigands, chose to perish rather than give them the two horses he was leading." &lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, Warren. Jacques-Louis David: Revolutionary Artist. pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy's death was seized on as a [[propaganda]] opportunity by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], who praised him at the [[French National Convention|Convention]]'s tribune saying that "only the French have thirteen-year-old heroes". But rather than simply being killed by [[Chouan|Breton royalists]] who solely wanted to steal horses, Bara was transformed into a figure who denied the [[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]] at the cost of death. His story became that having been trapped by the enemy and being ordered to cry ''"Vive le Roi"'' ("Long live the King") to save his own life, he preferred instead to die crying ''"Vive la République"'' ("Long live the Republic").

His remains were to be transferred to the [[Panthéon]] during a revolutionary festival in his honor but the event was cancelled when Robespierre was overthrown the day before it was to take place.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt;

'''L. Susan Brown''' (born 1959) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[anarchist communist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Bookchin|Bookchin, Murray]]. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993-1998, AK Press 1999, Footnote #1, p. 156 "I do not question the sincerity of Brown's libertarian views; she regards herself an anarcho-communist, as do I. But she makes no direct attempt to reconcile her individualistic views with communism in any form."&lt;/ref&gt; writer and theoretician.

Brown is best known for her book ''[[The Politics of Individualism]]'' (1993)&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;Brown, L. Susan. '[[The Politics of Individualism]],' Black Rose Books (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and for her article "Does Work Really Work?".&lt;ref name="work"&gt;Brown, L. Susan.  [http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/brown/sp001735.html "Does Work Really Work?" ]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Politics of Individualism'', she makes a distinction between "existential individualism" and "instrumental individualism" and examines how these forms are utilized in [[liberalism]] (particularly [[liberal feminism]]) and [[anarchism]]. She argues for a new vision of human [[Liberty|freedom]] which incorporates the insights of [[feminism]] and [[liberalism]] into a form of anarchism based on what she calls "existential individualism". The work focuses specifically on the similarities and differences of these political philosophies, by critically examining the liberal feminist writings of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Janet Radcliffe Richards]], especially focusing on the issues of employment, education, marriage and the family, and governmental politics. These works are, in turn, compared to the [[anarcha-feminism]] of [[Emma Goldman]].

In both ''The Politics of Individualism''&lt;ref name="politics"/&gt; and "Does Work Really Work?",&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; Brown's conception of [[libertarian socialism]] is that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have an ''equal'' amount of bargaining power, because, in Brown's view, an accumulation of monetary wealth leads to the centralization of economic and political power in the hands of a small [[elite]], reducing the bargaining power—and thus the [[liberty]]—of the other individuals in society.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politicspg117"&gt;Brown, L. Susan. '[[The Politics of Individualism]],' pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She provides an in-depth analysis of why, in her view, the [[wage labor]] system is inherently corrupt and unreformable and why it must be abolished and replaced with a system in which people would be completely free to choose to perform (or not to perform) voluntary activities, a system that would, in Brown's view, encourage people to be creative and self-directed, that would celebrate enjoyment and fulfillment.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;

Brown has published many articles on the political philosophy of anarchism and feminism, and has had her work translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

Brown works and lives in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada and holds a [[PhD]] from the [[University of Toronto]].

[[File:Witchcraft at Salem Village.jpg|thumb|350px|The central figure in this 1876 illustration of the courtroom in the [[Salem witch trials]] is usually identified as [[Mary Walcott]], one of the accusers.]]
This is a '''list of people''' associated with the '''[[Salem witch trials]]''', a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of [[witchcraft]] in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]] between February 1692 and May 1693. The trials resulted in the [[execution]]s of twenty people, most of them women.

Surnames in parentheses preceded by "[[née]]" indicate birth family [[maiden name]]s (if known) of married women, who upon marriage generally took their husbands' surnames. Due to the low population of the Massachusetts [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]] at the time of the trials, a significant percentage of local residents were related to other local residents through descent or by marriage. Many of the witchcraft accusations were driven at least in part by acrimonious relations between the families of the [[plaintiff]]s and [[defendant]]s. Unless otherwise specified, dates provided in this list use [[Julian calendar|Julian-dated]] month and day but [[New Style]]-enumerated year (i.e., years begin on January 1 and end on December 31, in the modern style).

In historical context, '''Litvin''' ({{lang-be|літвін, ліцвін}}, ''litvin'', ''litsvin''; {{lang-lt|lietuvis}}; {{lang-ru|литвин}}, ''litvin'', {{lang-uk|литвин}}, ''lytvyn''; {{lang-pl|Litwin}}) is a word of Polish descent, which in Polish language means "Lithuanian". Historically{{cn|date=September 2018}} was used to refer{{by whom|date=September 2018}} mostly to ethnic Lithuanians, sometimes to citizens of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] of other nations. According to the [[Statutes of Lithuania]], the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was populated with Litvins, [[Ruthenians|Rusyns]], and Zmuds ([[Samogitians]]) and therefore the full name for the state was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia.

The ethnographic or cultural studies about the ethnic group are poorly noted and are traced to the beginning of 18th century.&lt;ref name=horlenko&gt;Horlenko, V. ''[http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/0168.html Litvins of the Ukraine North are possibly a fragment of legendary tribe of Siverians (Литвини півночі України - ймовірний уламок племені літописних Сіверян)]''. "Landmarks of Ukraine". 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet-monk Klymentiy Zinoviyiv who published several works about cultural studies noted that Litvins, perhaps after the older pagan tradition worked on Sundays and rested on Fridays.&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artifacts of Ukrainian-Ruthenian language and literature / Shevchenko Scientific Society Archaeographic Commission. - Lviv, 1912. - Vol.7. - p.72. (Пам'ятки українсько-руської мови і літератури / Видає археографічна комісія НТШ. - Львів, 1912. - Т.VІІ. - С.72. )&lt;/ref&gt; More notes about Litvins were provided at the end of 18th century by historians of the Russian Empire Afanasiy (Opanas) Shafonsky and Yakov Markovych.&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt; According to Markovych, Litvins are a special regional group such as [[Gascoigne]] in France or [[Swabians]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markovych, Ya. Notes about Malorossiya its residents and literary works. - In Saint Petersburg, 1798. (Маркович Я. Записки о Малороссии, ее жителях и произведениях. - В Санкт-Петербурге, 1798.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Litvin (Litvyak) owes its origin to political and state factors and is a [[demonym]] (politonym) with reference to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt;

Self name of Litvins in Chernihiv region ([[Chernihiv Oblast]]) is Ruski, but not Moskals or Katsaps.&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt; The name of Litvins among them is accepted as derogative.&lt;ref name=horlenko/&gt;

In modern Belarus the word is widely used to describe only Grand Duchy of Lithuania citizens speaking [[Slavic languages]] ([[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]]), predominantly of [[Catholic]] faith and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian origin]] or who strongly associated themselves with [[Statehood Day (Lithuania)|the state of Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarnautojai.lt/memo/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=26 Jakubowski, Jan, "Studya nad stosunkami narodowoścemi na Litwie przed unią lubelską"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarnautojai.lt/memo/modules/myarticles/print.php?storyid=93 Turska, Halina "O powstaniu polskich obszarów językowych na Wileńszczyźnie"]&lt;/ref&gt; identifying themselves with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.litviny.net/&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea is not accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="belarusin.net" /&gt;

The term may specifically refer to people speaking [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] in historical contexts.&lt;ref name="vn"&gt;[[:be-x-old:Вячаслаў Насевіч|Вячаслаў Насевіч]].

In modern Belarus, the term is used by some to stress Belarusian participation and contributions to the former Grand Duchy.&lt;ref name="belarusin.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pazn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manarchija.org/pazniak |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408124644/http://www.manarchija.org/pazniak |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in Sydney, Luke Romyn's love of writing was evident from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Lorna Suzuki|url=http://web.me.com/imagobooks/IMAGO_FANTASY_REALM/Blog/Entries/2010/4/13_Entry_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first foray into writing was at the age of twelve with a short story titled, "Vesuvius, 79 AD!" and saw him recognized at a state level.

After the death of his father in [[Fiji]], Romyn's teen years were fraught with cases of him being in trouble with the law, starkly contrasted by him excelling in school work, which he professed often bored him. After finishing high school, Romyn landed a job as a nightclub bouncer which turned into a career as a contract security operator, taking him to various countries in roles as diverse as security for Disney stage shows to close protection for television and film stars, both Australian and international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon: Luke Romyn|url=https://www.amazon.com/Luke-Romyn/e/B004R2VLUA/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matthew "Matt" Parkman, Sr.''', is a [[fictional character]] of the [[NBC]] [[science fiction]] [[serial drama]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', played by [[Greg Grunberg]]. Matt is a [[police officer]], who works for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and [[NYPD]] in Seasons One and Two respectively. He is a [[telepathy|telepath]]; his ability allows him to read minds, and eventually extends into aspects of [[mind control]], as stated by [[Bob Bishop (Heroes)|Bob Bishop]].

==Plot==

===Genesis===
Matt Parkman is a [[police officer]] with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. He tried to become a [[detective]], but had flunked the exam three times due to [[dyslexia]]. Parkman is a mind-reader; he can hear the thoughts of people around him. He first realizes this after hearing the thoughts of [[Molly Walker]], a girl who was hiding from a [[serial killer]] named [[Sylar]].

He is nearly arrested by his FBI partner, but then is able to later prove his ability to read thoughts. He is then offered a position in the investigation. Things turn dangerous when a man who appears to be Sylar shows up. Stopping the man from harming Molly, Matt tries to comfort her while Audrey, the FBI agent, gives chase. Ultimately, the man escapes, but not before displaying apparent telekinesis and standing after being shot. Later, Matt comes home to his wife, [[List of characters in Heroes#Janice Parkman|Janice]].

Matt escapes to a bar after a heated argument with his wife and hears the thoughts of the various patrons. However, when he encounters a patron, a tall silent black man, whose mind he cannot read, the other voices fade out. The man sits and stares at Matt until Matt falls unconscious.

Matt wakes up strapped to a table with [[Noah Bennet|Mr. Bennet]] standing over him. Bennet explains that they had to drug him, and that he works for a secret company. Matt tries to read Bennet's mind, but is unable due to [[Haitian (Heroes)|The Haitian]], who was the man at the bar. Matt is still able to discern the name of Bennet's daughter, Claire, impressing Bennet with his developing power. The Haitian then wipes Matt's memories of being drugged and abducted by Bennet.

Matt wakes up a day later, suffering from what he thinks is a [[hangover]]. His wife Janice tells him he has been missing and was worried. He uses his ability to listen to her thoughts and give her everything she wants, healing the rift between the two of them.

The following day at work, Matt and his partner at the FBI run down a possible lead on Sylar after discovering a charred corpse with a fingerprint. Instead of Sylar, they find a man with [[radioactive]] powers. In a stand off, Matt defuses the situation by allowing the man to speak with his comatose wife. At the end of the day, Matt is informed by his old partner that he was being given another chance to apply for a detective position. Matt happens to read the man's mind, discovering that he is sleeping with Janice. Matt punches his former partner and is consequently suspended.

Unaware of this, Audrey asks Matt for assistance in interviewing [[Ted Sprague]], the man who radiates nuclear power. Matt talks with him and discovers that, like himself, Ted was abducted from a bar after seeing the Haitian and woke up later with [[amnesia]]. He further discovers similar marks on their necks. Then, [[Homeland Security]] takes Ted into custody before Matt can learn more, but Ted tells Matt to "find the Haitian." Audrey later notifies Matt that Ted has escaped. Matt and Audrey then investigate a crime scene at Union Wells High in [[Odessa, Texas]], where they suspect Sylar was intercepted by two people nearby. They don't consider [[Peter Petrelli]] a suspect in Jackie's death, but interrogate him and learn that Sylar's target was the cheerleader [[Claire Bennet]].

Matt later attempts to read Claire's mind when she is being interviewed. However, he is unable to hear anything except static, which also happened to him before he was abducted. Suspicious, he and Audrey stake out Primatech Paper and Matt recognizes The Haitian. He attempts to overhear Mr. Bennet or the Haitian's thoughts and is able to pick up just one word: "Sylar."

For the next two weeks, Matt keeps a close watch on Primatech Paper, but he is seen on cameras. Finally, in "[[Godsend (Heroes)|Godsend]]," Matt and Audrey organize a raid of Primatech. When they find nothing, their boss is very upset and threatens to fire Audrey. Fearful of losing her job, she tells Matt their partnership is over. Matt confronts Bennet, telling him he knows he was kidnapped and will make Bennet pay.

Matt faces a review board that questions his details of the past few weeks. They find his references to a "super-powered serial killer" almost insane. Matt recants his statement after hearing it will save his job. However, Matt is suspended for six months. At home, Matt takes a job as a bodyguard for money. His assignment is [[List of characters in Heroes#Aron Malsky|Aron Malsky]], a man who stole $2 million from [[List of Heroes characters#Daniel Linderman|Linderman]] as restitution. Upon learning the jeweler is on Linderman's payroll, they try to run, but [[Niki Sanders|Jessica]] comes to kill Aron for Linderman. After a fight, Jessica throws Matt out of a window and onto a sign girder before proceeding to tear Aron in half. Malsky had hidden diamonds in the ceiling shortly before he died. Matt finds them and keeps them.

In "[[Unexpected (Heroes)|Unexpected]]", Matt receives a call from Ted, who wants to meet Matt along with [[Hana Gitelman]]. Hana informs Matt of Primatech and the connection to their abductions and the markings on their necks. Ted wants to confront Mr. Bennet, but needs Matt's help. Matt agrees. Matt and Ted confront Mr. Bennet and his family at gunpoint as the family was coming home. However, things turn sour and Matt is soon captured again.

In "[[Parasite (Heroes)|Parasite]]", it is revealed that Matt is a prisoner of Thompson and his associates. Then in "[[.07%]]", Bennet helps Matt and Ted escape. Over breakfast, they solidify their plans to travel to [[New York City]] to knock out a tracking system. In "[[The Hard Part]]", Matt, Bennet and Ted continue their mission. They later are shown walking at Kirby Plaza in New York City, where Bennet and Claire are reunited. The group then splits in two, with Peter, Claire and Ted going to a remote town in Nebraska, and Matt and Bennet continuing with their mission to destroy the tracking system. Matt gets them where they need to go.

While waiting for the elevator, they bump into Jessica and her husband, D.L. Bennet and Matt then go to where the tracking system is, only to find Thompson waiting. Matt saves Bennet from death, and Bennet kills Thompson. The two then find the tracking system, surprised to find [[Molly Walker]]. Matt protests killing her, but Bennet says it must be done. They argue with Bennet until Matt is knocked out by Mohinder from behind.

In the finale, "[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]]", Matt finds Sylar and shoots him. However, Sylar reverses the bullets and gravely wounds Matt.

===Generations===
In "[[Four Months Later...]]," it is revealed Matt divorced Janice and that he is now a detective for the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], and is taking care of Molly Walker in Mohinder's apartment. He learns Molly is having nightmares of a dangerous man who can see her when she thinks of him. In "[[Lizards (Heroes)|Lizards]]", Matt is investigating the murder of [[Kaito Nakamura (Heroes)|Kaito Nakamura]]. He interrogates [[Angela Petrelli]] and learns that someone may have murdered Kaito for revenge; but Angela refuses to be interrogated further. Matt later saves Angela from a mysterious attacker. In "[[The Kindness of Strangers (Heroes)|The Kindness of Strangers]], Matt finds out that his father is part of The Company and that he is the dangerous man frightening Molly. Molly tries to find him for Matt, but she ends up in a coma.

In "[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]" Matt and Nathan track down Matt's father. When they find him, he reveals he is also a telepath, and is also about to be murdered. At first he seems sorry for having left Matt as a child but ends up tricking Matt and Nathan in separate illusions. Matt is trapped in jail, confronted by his ex-wife and the baby she gave birth to after the divorce. It is indicated that while she said that the baby she was having wasn't Matt's, he knew that this wasn't true. Matt is able to telepathically talk to Nathan and escape the illusion, finding that [[Bob Bishop (Heroes)|Bob]] is set to be killed.

In "[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]", Matt discovers he is able to manipulate people and uses it to find the last unknown survivor of the photograph by "interrogating" Angela Petrelli. He also finally defeats his father because he learns that like his father he is able to control all aspects of the brain. He manages to tap into this and enter the nightmare Molly's trapped in and summon his father into it. He realizes it's his father's own nightmare and after a battle of wills leaves it with Molly and uses his powers to trap his father in his own nightmare. In "[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]", he goes with Nathan to intercept Peter and [[Adam Monroe]], in hopes of stopping them from releasing a deadly virus that would kill 93% of the world's population. Before leaving to confront them, Angela warns Matt that if they cannot stop Peter, that he'll have to kill him. Upon meeting Peter at Primatech, Matt attempts to compel Peter to stop Adam. Though this proves unsuccessful, Nathan is later able to convince Peter that Adam has tricked him. Together, they manage to stop the virus, and resolve to reveal their secret, and the Company, to the world. Nathan enlists Matt's help to use his powers in convincing the media to hear him out. At the conference, Matt is present when Nathan is gunned down before he can reveal their secrets, but is unable to locate the assailant immediately after the attack.

===Villains===
In "[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]", after Nathan is shot, Matt and Peter chase the assailant, a future version of Peter, finding nothing. Matt later confronts the future Peter, who is disguised as his present self, when he becomes suspicious of his actions. Future Peter then removes his disguise, confesses that he is from the future and shot Nathan, and teleports Matt to an unknown location in Africa, because he knows too much. In "[[The Butterfly Effect (Heroes)|The Butterfly Effect]]", he is rescued by [[List of characters in Heroes#Usutu|Usutu]], who paints the future, particularly Parkman's life. He learns Parkman's name by reading it off his badge.

In "[[I Am Become Death]]", Matt sees the future through a dream caused by Usutu. In the dream, he finds himself still living with Molly in the same apartment as he did in the second season, only this time accompanied with another daughter, called Daniella, and the baby's mother, [[Daphne Millbrook|Daphne]]. Matt expresses his concern of Daphne still working for Pinehearst when she comes by to ask Molly where the present Peter fled to. Matt is next seen in awed silence watching a news report on the nuclear explosion in Costa Verde (caused by Sylar), with Molly, worried that Daphne was caught in the blast. Daphne arrives home seconds later with a smile, but gasps that she wasn't fast enough before collapsing in Matt's arms. Matt then wakes up to realize that he never left Usutu or the desert, and realizes that he must find Daphne to keep her from suffering the same fate she did in his dream. Usutu tells him that only Matt can find his way, and that he must follow his spirit guide. Matt is confused, but then notices the tortoise he saw right before meeting Usutu, and realizes it is his spirit guide. He is then seen following the tortoise as it moves slowly through the desert.

In "[[Dying of the Light (Heroes)|Dying of the Light]]", Matt has arrived at an airport with the tortoise. He is greeted by Daphne, who is shocked that he knows her name. He tells her that they are soulmates, which she doesn't believe, instead offering him a job at Pinehearst. She tells him to wait for her. After a while he decides to go ahead and leave. Daphne returns in time to stop him. She says he's a good guy and the people at Pinehearst aren't. She advises him to stay away. He tells her she should keep away from them as well. She tells him that she can't and leaves.

In "[[Eris Quod Sum]]", Daphne is directed by Arthur Petrelli to kill Matt after he does not come to Pinehearst. She has the gun pointed at Matt, but drops it. Knox, however, has followed her, and after knocking Daphne unconscious rips his hand through Matt, apparently killing him. After he leaves, this proves to be a dream sequence manifested by Matt. However, soon after this Daphne receives a call from Arthur revealing that she is fooling Matt into trusting her for an unknown purpose.

In "[[It's Coming]]", he and Daphne go to Primatech for help and find Angela in a coma. Matt decides to use his powers to try to wake her up. After Daphne supposedly goes to find a nurse but in reality alerts Arthur to his plans, Matt enters Angela's mind like he entered Molly's to save her from Maury. In Angela's mind, he finds her handcuffed to a chair and she tells him to leave as Arthur is too powerful. As he tries to free her, Arthur shows up disguised as Daphne and stabs him. When this wound manifests physically, the real Daphne grabs on to him and manages to get him to pull her into Angela's mind. Once there, Arthur reveals that Daphne had betrayed him, but while Daphne admits this, she repents, saying she loves Matt and the two embrace. Angela manages to convince Arthur to let her go and Matt pulls himself, Daphne and Angela back to the real world, finally waking her up. His psychic wound heals at this point. He then encounters Peter and attacks him for sending Matt to Africa, but Peter is able to convince him, after Matt verifies telepathically, that it wasn't him. Matt is present when Angela reveals that there's a catalyst needed for the formula and Claire realizes that it could be her.

In "[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse]]", Matt (like everyone else) loses his powers thanks to the eclipse, and Daphne goes home. When he goes to visit her, he discovers that Daphne had trouble walking before she gained her powers. He is later approached by Ando and Hiro, who want him to restore Hiro's memory after it was erased by Arthur, but he is unable to do so due to Hiro's inability to speak English, and aids them in finding a way to restore his memories by looking through ''9th Wonders'' comic books. When the eclipse is over, he helps Daphne reconcile with her father.

In "[[Dual (Heroes)|Dual]]", Matt, Daphne, and Ando discover that Hiro is trapped in the past, and Daphne steals a vial of Mohinder's superpower-granting formula so Ando can give himself powers and save him. Instead of gaining Hiro's power of space-time manipulation, however, Ando gains the ability to enhance the powers of other evolved humans, which enhances Matt's telepathy to the point where he can hear every thought in the city, and enhances Daphne's speed to the point where she can travel through time, which they use to rescue Hiro. Later, they successfully steal the formula and destroy it.

===Fugitives===
Matt is seen trying to live a normal life with Daphne, as a bodyguard. He begins seeing Usutu in his apartment, who tells him that he is becoming a prophet, like himself. Although Usutu is clearly dead, and he himself states he is an illusion, it is unclear how he is interacting with Matt. Matt then begins drawing the future like Usutu and Isaac Mendez. He is captured when Claire comes to warn him of Nathan rounding up the rest of the superhumans, and is seen on the plane with the rest when it goes down. Matt survives the crash and escapes together with Mohinder and Hiro Nakamura. He gets a vision from Usutu and leads his friends to a nearby trailer. There, he starts to draw under the spiritual guidance of Usutu. One of the pictures reveals Daphne getting shot in her shoulder near the plane crash, even though she wasn't on the plane. Daphne herself has run together with Ando Masahasi to the crash site to find him. After they find each other, Matt and Daphne embrace but she ends up shot by Danko's soldiers, just as depicted in Matt's paintings. Matt mind controls one of the soldiers, forcing him to shoot his comrades. The distraction allows Matt to escape with Hiro, Ando and Mohinder, leaving a presumably dead Daphne behind. Matt and Mohinder reunite with Peter Petrelli, Ando and Hiro and make plans what to do next.

At the end of "[[Building 26]]" and continued in "[[Cold Wars]]", Matt is seen kidnapping a drugged Noah Bennet at a bar along with Peter and Mohinder. The trio then take Noah to a Motel and Matt attempts to access Noah's memories about the Government's initiative and his meetings with Nathan Petrelli and The Hunter. He discovers that Bennet has warned Mohinder about the attacks, which leads to a fight between them with Mohinder, but then Bennet reveals that Daphne is alive and under custody.

Matt is subsequently captured by the government while trying to rescue Daphne. With Peter having sent a tape to the national news of the government illegally loading up American civilians, The Hunter states that he needs something to blame posthumans for. He drugs Matt and straps explosives to him, pushing him out of a van and behind the Capitol Building. The explosives are disarmed when Nathan intervenes, however, and the government apprehends Matt once again.

In "[[Cold Snap (Heroes)|Cold Snap]]", Matt, Mohinder, Tracy, and Daphne escape from the facility with help from Rebel. Matt takes Daphne with him to a hospital where she is treated for her gunshot wound. He enters Daphne's mind in her last moment of life, creating a fictional storybook ending for her in Paris to make her happy. However, she tells him to let go.

In "[[Turn and Face the Strange]]", Matt attempts to fulfill his lust for revenge against Danko by revealing the truth to Danko's girlfriend, who is unaware of what he really does for a living. Matt then prepares to kill her but cannot bring himself to do it. With nothing to live for, he allows Danko to fire at him. However, Hiro freezes time and rescues Matt. Matt meets his son and is last seen with Matt Parkman Jr. in the back of a car as Hiro and Ando enter.

In "[[I Am Sylar]]", Hiro and Ando try to convince Matt to join them bringing down Building 26, but he refuses as he wants to be there for his kid and feels he must retrieve Matt Jr. to Janice back in [[Los Angeles|LA]]. Once there, he is ought to help Janice and Jr. escape HLS agents and eventually have a life together as a family, but then he realizes than he must help Hiro and Ando so they all will be safe from Building 26. As the agents get inside the house, Matt makes them believe nobody is there.

In "[[An Invisible Thread]]", Matt is seen heading to [[Washington D.C.]] to join Hiro and Ando; once in the bus stop, he meets Angela who finally convinces him about the importance of Nathan, and that he will save him. They both enter the battle room to find Nathan's dead body. Later, when Sylar is drugged and Peter and Claire are sent away, Angela and Noah convince Matt to brainwash Sylar making him believe he is the real Nathan, due to the fact that he got his appearance and memories, because they all need him to stop the hunt of posthumans. Along with Angela and Noah, they are the only ones that knows the truth about Nathan being dead and Sylar alive impersonating him. He is among the people who witness "Sylar" (James Martin) being cremated at Coyote Sands.

===Redemption===
In "[[Orientation (Heroes)|Orientation]]", Matt is living a comfortable life with [[List of characters in Heroes#Janice Parkman|his wife]] and [[List of characters in Heroes#Matt Parkman, Jr.|son]]. Ever since he forced [[Sylar]] to turn into [[Nathan Petrelli|Nathan]], Matt has sworn off using his power. When [[Angela Petrelli|Angela]] calls asking for help with Sylar, Matt refuses. Later, Matt begins experiencing a hallucination of Sylar, who tells him that when Matt forced his way into Sylar's mind, a part of the serial killer latched on to Matt's own brain. Sylar wants his body back, which Matt says he won't let happen. Sylar begins to harass Matt to force him to lose control and use his power. Matt has an outburst at his addiction meeting (where he refers to his power in vague terms as his "addiction") and later on when Matt is interrogating a suspect. Finally, Sylar goads Matt into using his power to drive away the handsome water delivery boy, because Matt was jealous of the delivery boy's relationship with his wife and son.

In "[[Ink (Heroes)|Ink]]", Matt thinks his one use of his power was a slip up, and turns in his 30-day sobriety chip. Sylar continues to taunt Matt, who says that he will ignore him since Sylar has no real power locked up in Matt's head. While investigating the house of a suspected drug dealer, Sylar points out to Matt that his suspect is hiding in a closet with a gun. Matt is stunned when Sylar turns out to be correct. After the suspect is tied up, Matt's partner checks upstairs, and Sylar points out a pink stuffed bunny in the next room, hinting that a little girl has been kidnapped. Matt finds a ransom note, confirming this fear. Matt reads the suspect's mind and finds the girl's body. He goes berserk and starts pounding the suspect. His partner re-enters the room and demands to know what Matt is doing. Matt tries to explain, but suddenly the bunny, ransom note, and body are gone. Sylar taunts that he used Matt's own power against him, and made him see things that weren't there, and Matt realizes that Sylar does have power over him. Matt's partner is planning to call him in, but Matt, not wanting his life to be ruined, uses his power to convince his partner that the beating of the suspect was justified, and causes him to call it in as such. Sylar gives Matt an ultimatum: either give his body back, or Sylar will continually ruin Matt's life.

Matt still refuses to return Sylar to his body, and in "[[Strange Attractors]]", Sylar takes control of Matt's body while he's making love to Janice. Matt, fearing that this new development will put his family in danger, reveals what is happening to him to Janice and she offers to take their son and leave to let Matt deal with it. Matt discovers that drinking alcohol appears to injure Sylar, and quickly downs several glasses. Sylar finally appears to disappear, and Matt blacks out right as Janice returns with Matt's partner from the force. Matt awakens hours later, and talks with his wife and partner, vowing to never let this happen to him again. However, it is revealed that Sylar took control of Matt's body while he was blacked out, and now is controlling him completely.

In "[[Shadowboxing (Heroes)|Shadowboxing]]", Matt attempts [[suicide by cop]] to prevent Sylar from taking revenge on the people who separated his mind from his body; he is last shown in an ambulance as they try to revive him. In "[[Brother's Keeper (Heroes)|Brother's Keeper]]", he is healed by Peter and explains the situation, but Nathan brushes up against Matt's hand during a struggle with a guard, allowing Sylar to transfer back in. Simultaneously horrified at Nathan's plight and relieved at his own, Matt uses his telepathy to sneak out of the hospital.

In "[[The Art of Deception (Heroes)|The Art of Deception]]", Matt is confronted by Sylar upon coming home from the store and is shocked, believing Sylar is somehow in his head again.  However, it is Sylar in his own body again and Sylar, wanting to become human again, demands that Matt put a block on his powers.  Matt is unable to do anything due to feedback, but is able to read Sylar's mind enough to tell that he's actually serious.  Sylar ends up threatening Janice (who finally realizes who he is), but Matt talks him down and gets him to allow Janice to leave.  At Janice's suggestion, Matt decides to get rid of Sylar for good and pretends to block his powers while in reality he traps Sylar in his own worst nightmare: a world where he is completely alone with no powers and an hour in the real world equals a year there.  After erasing Sylar's memory of what he did, Matt starts to brick Sylar in behind his wall when Peter arrives looking for Sylar.  Peter copies Matt's powers again and, reading his mind, learns what he did.  Needing Sylar's help, Peter enters Sylar's mind to free him against Matt's warnings that he might get trapped.  Later, Matt fully bricks up Sylar, but leaves Peter's unconscious body lying against the wall.

In "[[Brave New World (Heroes)|Brave New World]]," Matt is in his kitchen looking through the refrigerator when there's what sounds like an explosion, unknown to him the awakened Sylar breaking free of his prison.  Matt is confronted by several Eli clones and tries to use his powers to stop them, but is unable to as only the real Eli has a mind that can be manipulated.  Outnumbered and pretty much powerless, Matt is overpowered and his knee dislocated before the Elis' prepare to kill him with kitchen knives.  At the last second, the clones disappear as Peter and Sylar defeat the real Eli and the other clones and knock out the Prime Eli which gets rid of the clones.  Matt is pissed that Peter freed Sylar and refuses to help Peter by reading Eli's mind, so Peter does it himself and learns Samuel's terrible plans.  Peter tries to take off with Sylar, but Matt mentally commands Sylar to stay and he and Peter try to convince Matt that Sylar has changed, going so far as to have Matt read his mind.  Matt says that while Sylar's mind wants to change, he can't tell what his heart wants, but gives him a chance and orders him and Peter out.  Alone with the unconscious Eli, Matt brainwashes him into turning against Samuel which ultimately helps defeat him as Eli's support helps cause the carnies to turn on Samuel and strip him of his powers.

==Heroes Reborn==
In "June 13 - Part 2", Matt is brought in by Harris to find out where Claire is. To Noah's shock, Matt now works for Erica and is selling his power to the highest bidder. While Erica won't save everyone, she will save some and that's all Matt cares about now. He reads Noah's mind and learns of Claire's death in childbirth but Caspar Abraham erases Noah's memories before Matt can get anymore. Caspar knocks out Harris and while Matt has the two at his mercy, he can't bring himself to harm them and lets them both go.

==Alternate futures==
* In the alternate future of "[[Five Years Gone]]", in which New York City is destroyed by a [[nuclear explosion]], Matt is seen working as Director of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and is in direct contact with the now [[President of the United States|President]] [[Nathan Petrelli]] (who is actually Sylar in disguise). In this future Matt is seen as being a much darker and cynical man who hunts down those with abilities and arrests them in exchange for the protection of [[List of characters in Heroes#Matt Parkman.2C Jr.|his son]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=20604&lt;/ref&gt; He kills Hana Gitelman, Mr. Bennet and Future Hiro. At the end of the episode, he is shocked to find that Sylar had been using his powers to disguise himself as Nathan. He still cares about his family however and has a much greater deal of control over his powers, being able to "rip out" memories instead of passively overhearing thoughts.
* In the alternate future of "[[I Am Become Death]]", in which abilities are publicly available, Matt is living with his adoptive daughter [[Molly Walker|Molly]], his wife [[Daphne Millbrook|Daphne]], and his own infant daughter. He attempts to talk his wife out of tracking down [[Peter Petrelli|Peter]]. He watches Daphne die in his arms when she returns after trying to escape the [[nuclear explosion]] in Costa Verde.

==Powers and abilities==
Matt is a [[telepath]], able to read and manipulate the thoughts of others. In the episode "[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]", Bob states that Matt, like his father, should be able to control all aspects of the mind, including thoughts and senses, with practice. Matt originally could not activate his at will, causing him to pick up the thoughts of all those in close proximity to him. He gradually learns to elicit specific thoughts from people, and eventually learns to compel individuals to do as he wishes.

Though Matt's power enables him to read the minds of most people, it can be defeated through various methods. The [[Haitian (Heroes)|Haitian]]'s power is able to nullify Matt's, protecting himself and those in his vicinity. Other telepaths, such as [[Peter Petrelli]] and [[List of Heroes characters#Maury Parkman|Maury Parkman]], are also able to shield their minds. Finally, since Matt only speaks English, he cannot understand thoughts in other languages; [[Noah Bennet]] is able to defeat Matt's power by thinking in Japanese, which also happens with the child-minded [[Hiro Nakamura|Hiro]] who didn't know English. Although in "[[Cold Wars]]" Matt was able to overcome this while displaying a new ability with his telepathy where he was able to make his victims relive past events by going through their memory, while doing this to his victims such as Noah Bennet, it causes them pain.  However, this is merely due to them resisting his efforts and it is shown that if the person who he's doing it to allows him to do it of their own free will, there's no pain.

An interesting aspect of Matt's mind-reading is that it allows him to read any thoughts going through a person's mind - at one point, Matt read [[Jessica Sanders]]' mind and heard Niki in there as well. Jessica was surprised ("You heard Niki?").

He is able to enter the minds of various individuals in different episodes, including [[Nathan Petrelli]], [[Molly Walker]], and [[Angela Petrelli]]. When Maury traps Matt inside Molly's "nightmare world", Matt is able to bring his father in with them and subsequently leave with Molly, trapping Maury in his own nightmare (though Maury escapes).  He later enters Angela's mind to free her after Arthur Petrelli traps her in her own mind and succeeds with Daphne's help, gaining the ability to pull people in with him at the same time.  Apparently to free someone trapped in their own mind, someone has to enter it as Peter later has to do the same thing to free Sylar when Matt traps him in a nightmare. In "[[Cold Snap (Heroes)|Cold Snap]]" he enters [[Daphne Millbrook|Daphne]]'s mind to give her a fairytale ending while she dies.

Matt's ability to compel others is not as honed as his father's, though he demonstrates the ability at various points.

Matt can place suggestions in others through telepathic commands as a form of [[mind control]], but those aware of what he is doing can resist. In "[[Cautionary Tales (Heroes)|Cautionary Tales]]", [[Angela Petrelli]] initially resists his commands, though she experiences a nosebleed and eventually succumbs.

In "[[Eris Quod Sum]]", Matt is able to make the villain [[List of characters in Heroes#Knox|Knox]] see an [[illusion]] of Daphne and Matt himself dying, as well as momentarily immobilize him physically. In "[[Cold Snap (Heroes)|Cold Snap]]" and "[[I Am Sylar]]" he is able to make agents ignore him and company, making them believe there was no one at the place.

In Volume Four, the combination of the growth of his telepathy and the precognitive visions induced by Usutu grants him access to the "same plane of consciousness" that other precognitive characters access for their own powers, allowing him to draw the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19984&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Isaac Mendez]], he didn't show any artistic skills until gaining this ability, which also happens to other characters.

In "[[The Art of Deception (Heroes)|The Art of Deception]]", Matt tries to use his telepathy to remove Sylar's powers by putting a mental block on them.  Due to feedback, he is unable to, but is able to read Sylar's mind enough to know that he is actually serious about this.  Ultimately Matt uses his powers to trap Sylar in a nightmare where he has no powers and is alone, similar to what his father once did to Molly Walker.  In this nightmare one hour in the real world equals one year in the nightmare.  Sylar is ultimately freed from his nightmare by [[Peter Petrelli]] who enters his mind and frees him like Matt did for Molly Walker and Angela Petrelli.

'''Med Jones''' a.k.a. '''Med Yones''' is an American [[economist]]. He is the president of International Institute of Management, a U.S. based research organization. His work at the institute focuses on economic, investment, and business strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim.education/advisors/medjones/index.htm "Med Jones Biography"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===The Great Recession of 2008===

Med Jones is one of few economists who predicted the [[Great Recession]] of 2008 caused by the burst of the [[United States housing bubble]], the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]] and the [[Stock market crash of 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DvEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=rational+investing+med+jones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcy-amnNnZAhVQRK0KHW1oCisQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rational%20investing%20med%20jones&amp;f=false |title=Columbia University Press, Rational Investing Book, Page 61-62 What Can Be Forecasted}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://qrius.com/pluralism-economics-today-understanding-ispie-rebellion/ "International Student Initiative for Pluralism in Economics (ISIPE) - The Indian Economist"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2006 white paper, he listed three major U.S. economic risks for the decade between 2007-2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/u.s.economyrisks/ "US Economy Risks and Strategies 2007-2017"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The risks included the housing bubble and consumer debt, among the main risks to the US economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=eTNpBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bubbles,+Booms+and+Busts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Med%20Yones Bubbles Booms and Bust Book "]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, in a Reuters' Interview, he, again, said the impact of the subprime mortgages will not be limited to the housing sector, he warned about increased bankruptcies,  stock market crash,  and a loss of the confidence in the US economy. According to Reuters,  “He said the bursting of the real estate bubble and high consumer debt were a major worry" and “if people started to think there may be a lot of bankruptcies (in the subprime lending market), then you’re going to see the stock market sell-off.” More importantly, he explicitly warned about a much worse economic crisis as a result of the subprime mortgages, stating that “The worst thing that could happen to any economy is the loss of confidence”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/11/us-column-stocks-outlook-idUSN0925116620070311 "Early warning for the Stock Market - Reuters Interview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[Federal Reserve]] was still blind to the impact of the housing bubble and subprime crash. In August 2007, the [[New York Federal Reserve]] reported that for the most part, [[Bear Stearns]]' (mortgage-related financial) problems did not pose a substantial risk to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2013/01/18/news/economy/federal-reserve-transcripts/index.html  "CNN Report: The Federal Reserve was blind to crisis in 2007"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fed Chairman stated that: "The housing market has looked a bit more solid, and the worst outcomes have been made less likely".  In May 2008. In a congressional testimony, the Fed Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] said he saw only a "limited" impact of subprimes on "the broader housing market." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsweek.com/economy-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke-blame-75505 "Newsweek"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, top economists and some [[Nobel laureates]] in [[Economics]], came under criticism for defending their failure to see the crisis, stating that the economic crisis was unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/08/economists-on-the-defensive-robert-lucas/22979/ "Richard Posner - Economists on the Defensive--Robert Lucas - The Atlantic"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wharton University, "What made it worse is that not only the top economists failed to predict it, they positively denied that it will happen." &lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-economists-failed-to-predict-the-financial-crisis/ "Wharton University Knowledge - Finance "]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic forecasting is the holy grail of investing. Wall Street spends billions of dollars on economic research and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1428  "IBIS World Industry Reports"]&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate economic forecasting is regarded by academics and investors to be next to impossible. Yet, sometimes some analysts emerge with a specific view that contradicts the mainstream and with exceptional accuracy they prove the most respected economists and investors wrong. Among the economists who predicted the crisis, Jones' predictions are considered the most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2011/10/06/does-stock-forecasting-work "Does Stock Forecasting Work - US News &amp; World Report - Smart Money"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.hu/gazdasag/gazdasagpolitika/mit-josolt-valojaban-a-josprofesszor-357164  "The Global Economy Magazine"]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DvEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=rational+investing+med+jones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcy-amnNnZAhVQRK0KHW1oCisQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rational%20investing%20med%20jones&amp;f=false |title=Columbia University Press, Rational Investing Book, Page 61-62 What Can Be Forecasted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] Administration and mainstream economists at leading think tanks, were focused on finding ways to restore"economic confidence". 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2010/01/11/the-status-report-obamas-effort-to-restore-economic-confidence/  "The Status Report: Obama’s Effort to Restore Economic Confidence"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, seven years after the [[Great Recession]], academic researchers presented a paper at the [[World Economic Forum]] explaining that economic confidence was not fully taken into consideration in academia and it was a major factor for recovery from great recession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/why-you-need-to-restore-confidence-to-recover-from-a-recession/ "] World Economic Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors and investment advisers who follow Jones' predictions regard him among the prominent independent thinking money managers and economists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reppondinvestments.com/investment-resources/economists/ "Independent Thinking Economists and Money Managers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== His Views on Economic Forecasting and Wall Street ===

Despite having the most accurate forecasting record of the great recession and recovery, he advises investors against using his own forecasts. Jones believes economic forecasting is unreliable and Wall Street is a casino. In one interview, he says "I do not advise anyone to invest based on my outlook of the economy. The truth is that when people invest on Wall Street, they are essentially making bets about the future.” In addition, although he is known for his work on economics, he tries to distance himself from the economic profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aesinternational.com/investors-youre-not-as-smart-as-you-think-you-are "An interview with Simon Danaher, Online Editor of International Advisor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gross National Happiness Index - GNH Index===

Mr. Jones is credited with the introduction of the first [[Gross National Happiness]] Index (GNH Index) in 2005, also known as [[Gross National Well-being]] Index (GNW Index).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter "UAE Appoints the first Minister of Happiness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he published a white paper titled the American Pursuit of Unhappiness calling on policymakers, economists and researchers implement the first GNH Index framework.

The term [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH) was coined in 1972 by [[Sicco Mansholt]] one of the Founding Fathers of the European Union and the fourth President of the European Commission. GNH is often misattributed to Bhutan's fourth King, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] who popularized the concept in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-gnh-origin.htm "The Origin of GNH - The European GNH Institute (2018)"]&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH philosophy suggested that the ideal purpose of governments is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness and the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/papers/mcdonald.pdf "McDonald, Ross (2005). "Rethinking Development. Local Pathways to Global Wellbeing". St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. p. 3."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of economic policies on the subjective well-being of the citizens.

The purpose of the GNH Index was to create a new metric as an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrates subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators. The GNH Index was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political mission statement into a second generation implementation holistic (objective and subjective) concept and by treating happiness as a socioeconomic development metric. The proposed metric measures socioeconomic development by tracking seven wellness development areas: economic, environmental, physical, mental, workplace, social, and political via objective data and subjective results via survey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gross National Happiness|"GNH Index"]]&lt;/ref&gt; GNH value is proposed to be an index function of the total average per capita. In the same year, he published a global GNH Index survey blueprint that can benchmark the subjective well-being in different countries, correlate happiness levels with differences in local policies to help identify best practices and major socioeconomic policy issues. The first Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey was launched in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/polls/GrossNationalHappinessSurvey.htm "The Global Gross National Happiness Index - Global GNH Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of GNH index initiative in 2005, several initiatives were launched that adapted the gross national happiness index to their community.

In a report (2012) prepared for the US Congressman Hansen Clarke, R, Researchers Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, at [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in [[Harvard University]], recommended that "the Congress should prescribe the broad parameters of new, carefully designed supplemental national indicators; it should launch a bipartisan commission of experts to address unresolved methodological issues, and include alternative indicators." They proposed that the government can use the survey results to see which well-being dimensions are least satisfied and which districts and demographic groups are most deficient, so as to allocate resources accordingly. The report list the Gross National Happiness Index and its seven measurement area as one of the main frameworks to consider.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192803/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf "National Indicators for a New Era (page 81), Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Thailand releases Green and Happiness Index (GHI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=2154&amp;a=2 [Green and Happiness Index (GHI"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219080709/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=2154&amp;a=2 |date=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, In the United States, the Gallup poll system launched the happiness survey and collected data on a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.wharton.upenn.edu/socialimpact/GrossNationalHappiness "University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Social Impact Wiki Tex Book"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallup Well-Being Index was modelled after the GNH Index framework of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102099/1/Sheikh%20Mohammad%20Shafiqul_Alam_Thesis.pdf "Developing Life Cycle Environmental Indicators - Sheikh Alam (2016) - Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Brisbane, Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Well-Being Index score is an average of six sub-indexes that measures life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviours, and access to basic necessities. In October 2009, the USA scored 66.1/100.

In 2010 the [[Bhutan]] GNH Index was conducted for the first time, the Bhutan GNH Index is similar to the first GNH Index created by Med Jones &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=OSy7Ubd-PX8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=GNH+%22Med+Jones%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Med%20Jones%22 "In pursuit of political happiness - Alastair Campbell, Strategy Director of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 UN General Assembly Resolution 65/309, titled "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development"  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/ageing/documents/NOTEONHAPPINESSFINALCLEAN.pdf UN Happiness Resolution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launches "Better Life Index" (BLI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/ "Better Life Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network (CIW Network)  releases The Canadian Index of Wellbeing (CIW) &lt;ref&gt;[https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/ "Canadian Index of Wellbeing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a leading Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]], published an article suggesting that western GDP economics is an incomplete development model and called for the adoption of Bhutan's GNH philosophy and Jones' GNH Index in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/magazine/1.1563206 "Why Ordinary Economic Indicators Do Not Tell The Whole Truth, haaretz, Israel"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the city of Seattle in Washington, launched its own happiness index initiative, emphasizing measures similar to the GNH Index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainableseattle.org/sahi "Seattle Happiness Initiative"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326070228/http://www.sustainableseattle.org/sahi |date=2015-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[South Korea]] Launched Happiness Index citing the GNH Index framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001669362 "South Korea Happiness Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Government of [[Goa]] 2030 Vision and Roadmap in (2012) cited the GNH Index as a model for measuring happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130308055852/https://www.goa.gov.in/pdf/GGJDC_Report.pdf  (Goa 2030 Vision and Roadmap -Page 110) "Goa 2035 Vision, page 110"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 The government of [[Dubai]] launched its localized Happiness Index to measure the public's contentment and satisfaction with different government services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/uae/dubai-brings-in-happiness-index "The National Newspaper"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the United Kingdom launched its own well-being and happiness  statistics .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc146/wrapper.html "National Well-Being Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710061905/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc146/wrapper.html |date=2015-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Professor [[Peter T. Coleman (academic)|Peter T. Coleman]], a world-renowned director of the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at [[Columbia University]], suggested that Jones' GNH Index initiative could inform the [[Global Peace Index]] Initiative GPI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-five-percent/201211/the-missing-piece-in-sustainable-peace "The Missing Piece in- Sustainable Peace, Professor Peter T. Coleman, professor of psychology and education at Columbia University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noteworthy Happiness Index initiatives that followed the GNH Index of 2005 are the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [[OECD Better Life Index]] in 2011, [[World Happiness Report]] in 2011 and the [[Social Progress Index]] SPI in 2013

'''Menachem Mendel Schneersohn''' (September 9, 1789 (29 Elul 5549) – March 17, 1866 (13 Nissan 5626) [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|OS]]) also known as the '''''Tzemach Tzedek''''' was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]], leading 19th century [[posek]], and the third [[Rebbe]] (spiritual leader) of the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|chasidic]] movement.

== Biography ==
The Tzemach Tzedek was born in [[Liozna]], on September 9, 1789. His mother Devorah Leah died just three years later, and her father Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] raised him as his own son. He married his first cousin [[Chaya Mushka Schneersohn]], daughter of Rabbi [[Dovber Schneuri]]. After his father-in-law/uncle's death, and a three-year interregnum during which he tried to persuade the [[Hasidim]] to accept his brother-in-law Menachem-Nachum Schneuri or his uncle Chaim-Avraham as their leader,&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt; he assumed the leadership of Lubavitch on the eve of [[Shavuot]] 5591 (May 5, 1831 OS).

He was known as the ''Tzemach Tzedek'' ("Righteous Sprout" or "Righteous Scion"), after the title of a voluminous compendium of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) that he authored.&lt;ref&gt;"Tzemach" (צמח) has the same [[gematria]] as "Menachem" (מנחם), and "Tzedek" (צדק) has the same as "Mendel" (מענדל). The original responsa ''Tzemach Tzedek'' were those of [[Menachem Mendel Krochmal]]. Schneersohn's responsa are known as ''Shu"t Tzemach Tzedek Hachadashot'', "the new Tzemach Tzedek responsa". Rabbi Menachem Mendil Hager, the first [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Viznhitzer Rebbe]], called his commentary on the Torah ''Tzemach Tzadik'' (צמח צדיק), because he spelled his name with an extra yod (מענדיל).&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored ''Derech Mitzvotecha'' ("Way of Your Commandments"), a mystical exposition of the ''Mitzvos''. He compiled major works of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi for publication, including the ''[[Siddur]] L'Kol Ha'Shanah'' (commonly known as ''Siddur Im Dach''), ''[[Likutei Torah]]'' and ''[[Likutei Torah/Torah Or|Torah Ohr]]''. He also authored a philosophical text entitled "Sefer Chakira: Derech Emuna" (Book of Philosophy: The Way of Faith).

The Tzemach Tzedek enjoyed close ties with other Jewish leaders. In the course of his battle against the ''[[Haskalah]]'' in Russia, he forged a close alliance with Rabbi Yitzchak of [[Valozhyn]], a major leader of the [[misnagdim]], which led to warmer relations between them and the Hasidim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-history.com/Chabad/index.html ''The Tzemach Tzedek and the ''Haskalah'' Movement'', Official Chabad history.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Baruch Epstein]], his father Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] spent six months under the Tzemach Tzedek's tutelage, and learned most of his mystical knowledge during that time. This story is disputed by Hassidic historian [[Yehoshua Mondshein]].&lt;ref&gt;The claim is in ''Mekor Baruch'', chapter 20. But see [http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=artdays&amp;id=785 ''Mekor Baruch - Mekor Hakzavim''] by Yehoshua Mondshein.&lt;/ref&gt;

His close friendship with professor J Berstenson, the Czar's court physician, often helped the delicate negotiations relating to the welfare of the community.&lt;ref name="poor"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', entry: Schneersohn, Menachem Mendel. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. {{ISBN|1-56821-123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He set up an organisation called ''Hevras Techiyas Hameisim'' to assist Jewish boy-soldiers who were being recruited and converted to [[Christianity]] by the Russian army. These soldiers known as [[Cantonists]] were taken away from the Jewish community to other villages. Schneersohn arranged for his students to pay them regular visits to keep up their spirits and discourage them from converting.&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt;

In 1844-45 he took steps to increase the enrollment and viability of the Lubavitch [[Yeshiva]]s in [[Dubroŭna]], Pasana, Lyozno and [[Kalisz]], expanding their enrollment to around 600 students in total.&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Hasidism |author=H. Rabinowicz|page=134 |year=1970 |isbn=0-87677-005-7 |publisher=Hartmore House}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Repeated attempts by the authorities to entrap him using informers such as Hershel Hodesh, Benjamin the Apostate and Lipman Feldman failed.&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer HaToldos Rav Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn MiLubavitch'', Glitzenstein, A. H.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
He died in [[Lyubavichi, Rudnyansky District, Smolensk Oblast|Lubavitch]] on 13 Nissan 5626 at the age of 77, leaving behind him seven sons and two daughters. He was succeeded by one of his youngest sons, Shmuel&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt; as the Rebbe of Lubavitch, while three of his other sons formed breakaways of the Chabad movement which continue to some extent even today.

Several of his sons established Chasidic dynasties,&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt; see [[#Sons]].

{{Chabad sidebar}}

== Famous quote ==
A famous saying of the Tzemach Tzedek is ''Think good and it will be good'' (original Yiddish: ''Trakht gut vet zein gut''). This expresses the Chabad view that simply by virtue of a person's trust in God, that person's prayer may be answered.

== Sons ==

The Tzemach Tzedek had seven sons:&lt;ref&gt;The introduction to ''[[Hayom Yom]]'', by Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Rabbi Baruch Shalom (1805–1869) did not become a rebbe in his own right; he chose to remain in Lubavitch and become a chasid of his youngest brother. Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the seventh Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch, was his great-great-grandson.

2. Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Schneersohn]] (Maharil) (1808–1866) settled in [[Kopys]] a few months after the death of his father, where he founded the [[Kopust]] branch of Chabad. He died two months later. He had three sons:
* Rabbi [[Shlomo Zalman Schneersohn]] (1830–1900), oldest son of Rabbi Yehuda Leib, assumed his father’s position in Kopust. He is the author of a work on Hasidism titled "Magen Avot" ("Shield of the Fathers").
* Rabbi [[Shalom Dovber Schneersohn of Rechitsa]] (d. 1908), known as the Rashab of Rechitsa.&lt;ref&gt;a Hebrew acronym for "&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;av &lt;u&gt;Sh&lt;/u&gt;alom &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;er"&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding his brother, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman, Rabbi Shalom Dovber served as the Kopuster movement's rebbe in the town of [[Rečyca|Rechitsa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaminetzky, Yosef. Y. ''Days in Chabad''. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn, NY. (2005): p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Shalom Dovber seems to have died without a successor.
* Rabbi [[Shmaryahu Noah Schneersohn]] (1842–1924), known as Shmaryahu Noah of Babruysk. Succeeding his brother, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman, Rabbi Shmaryahu Noah served as the Kopuster movement's rebbe in the town of [[Babruysk]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaminetzky, Yosef. Y. ''Days in Chabad''. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn, NY. (2005): p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[rav]] of the chasidim in Babruysk from 1872, and founded a [[yeshiva]] there in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminetzky, Yosef. Y. ''Days in Chabad''. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn, NY. (2005): p. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored a two volume work on Hasidism, titled "Shemen LaMaor" ("Light for the Luminary").&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;Lowenthal, Naftali. Schneersohn, Shmaryahu Noah. ''Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', Jason Aronson Publishers. London. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hebrew1"&gt;Schneerson, Shmaryahu Noah. ''Shemen La'moar''. Vol. 1. Kfar Chabad, Israel. (1964): p. 1.

3. Rabbi Chaim Schneur Zalman (1814–1880) was Rebbe in [[Lyady, Vitebsk Region|Lyady]] after his father, the Tzemach Tzedek died. He founded the [[Liadi (Hasidic dynasty)|Liadi]] branch of Chabad. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Yitzchak Dovber (1835–1910) of Liadi, author of ''Siddur Maharid'', and his son-in-law, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak (d. 1905) of Siratin, a scion of the Rebbe of Radzimin.

4. Rabbi Yisroel Noach (1815–1883) of [[Nizhyn]] founded the [[Niezhin (Hasidic dynasty)|Niezhin]] branch of Chabad. Although officially a Rebbe, he had only a small following. He had no successor. His son was Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Kischinev, whose daughter, Nechama Dina Schneersohn, married Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.

5. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak (1822–1876) was a Rebbe in [[Ovruch]]. He founded the [[Avrutch (Hasidic dynasty)|Avrutch]] branch of Chabad. He was compelled to assume this position by his father-in-law, Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel of Cherkas (son of Rabbi [[Mordechai of Chernobyl]] and son-in-law of [[Dovber Schneuri|the Mitteler Rebbe]]) against his father’s wishes. He was the maternal grandfather and namesake of Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]], the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch.

6. Rabbi Yaakov, although leaving descendants, died at quite a young age. He lived in [[Orsha]]. Little is known about him.

7. Rabbi [[Shmuel Schneersohn]] (Maharash) (1834–1882) of Lubavitch, his youngest son, succeeded him as the Rebbe of Lubavitch.&lt;ref name="poor"/&gt;

== ''Ohr HaTorah'' ==
Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] said of the Tzemach Tzedek's work "''Ohr HaTorah''" that it contains all the previous and future teachings of the Chabad Rebbes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer HaSichos'' 5752, Vol. 1, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the main figure in the foundation of the Israeli town of [[Nazareth Illit]] and the Wingate Sports Center that was named after his friend [[Orde Wingate]].

The Shatner Centre in Jerusalem was named after him. His son, David, is an expert on [[Water politics|water]] and the "[[borders of Israel]]" and was in the delegations that brokered peace agreements with [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21268">'''Ferdinand "Nand" Peeters''' ([[Mechelen]], October 13, 1918 – [[Turnhout]], December 27, 1998) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician and gynecologist]], whose research led directly to the development of Anovlar, the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] introduced outside the [[United States]], in 1961, the first whose side-effects were acceptable, and the first that was used world-wide (Albach 1997:939). It remained in production, in its original formula, from its introduction until 1986 — although, beginning in 1964, [[Schering AG]] (the company that produced it) also marketed variants with lower doses of hormones, some of which continued to be named Anovlar. Nand Peeters's research also contributed substantially to the treatment of [[Rh disease|Rh-disease]].

==Biography==
Nand Peeters was a son of Désiré Peeters, a surgeon who founded his own clinic in Mechelen. After attending the local Saint Rumbold's high school, he studied at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], intending to become a gynecologist. But he finished his training in a maternity ward in [[Bruges]].

In 1945 he married Paula Langbeen, with whom he had six children, and who was his book-keeper all his life—Peeters detested all administrative work. 

In 1946 he settled as an ob-gyn in Turnhout. At the time Turnhout had none, even though it was (and is) the largest town in the northern part of the [[Campine]], with a population then of about 32,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Verslag over het Bestuur en de Toestand der Zaken van de Stad Turnhout … 7 Juni 1948'', available on this [http://stadsarchiefturnhout.turnhout.preview.anaxis.be/_uploads/www.stadsarchiefturnhout.be/downloads/Stadsverslag_1946_1947.pdf page of the Turnhout City Archives]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perinatal infant mortality in Turnhout was between 10 and 12% before his arrival; in his first year in Turnhout he managed to bring it down to two cases in some 500 deliveries.

He was appointed head of the Maria Gabriël Maternity and of the gynecology department of Turnhout's municipal Saint-Elisabeth hospital in 1951. Under his direction, that department became one of the best in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Even as early as January 1954 the statistics about his department that he presented at a meeting at Leuven University turned out to be the best in the country.&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired the most modern technology available, did innovative research, encouraged young and promising doctors that he hired to do likewise, and introduced new techniques like [[Medical ultrasonography|echography]]. In 1952 Leuven University appointed him as one of its supervisors of trainee doctors. This appointment was withdrawn in 1963, for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;As late as 2011, the university claimed his file, likely to reveal the reason, "was hard to find".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, also in Turnhout, he founded the Saint-Elisabeth nursing school, where he taught gratis. Naturally the school provided him with well-trained nursing staff, whom he entrusted with far greater responsibilities than was customary at the time.

He retired in 1986. An [[intracranial hemorrhage]] in 1988 ended his active life—communication became impossible. He lived another ten years, dying on December 27, 1998.

==Ob-gyn==
Peeters was first and foremost a practicing ob-gyn, a very busy and highly competent one, who stopped counting the number of deliveries that he had done when he reached the number of 30,000.

Throughout his career his abiding concern was for the comfort of his patients. He was a man of few words, but a good listener, and the stories told by his patients&lt;ref&gt;Both in ''De pil van dokter Peeters'', a documentary broadcast on March 8, 2012 by [[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]], and in Van den Broeck 2014. Van den Broeck describes his interviews with the first patients that volunteered for Peeters's tests on what was to become Anovlar as the most probing (original Dutch "de meest indringende") of his entire career of 25 years as a journalist.&lt;/ref&gt; testify to the respect in which they held him and the trust they put in him.

He did research, taught, and lectured to and published for both health care professionals and the general public. But he did all this because he hoped thereby to improve the welfare of his patients and of pregnant and nubile women in general. Typically, pain management during delivery was the first problem he tackled as a researcher, while still a trainee in Bruges.

==The development of Anovlar==
Peeters closely followed the development of various hormones and their uses in the nineteen-fifties. He was aware of the work of [[Gregory Goodwin Pincus|Pincus]] and of the serious side-effects of Pincus's Enovid, which was first introduced as a remedy against [[menstrual disorder]]s in 1957. He knew that Schering AG had developed a number of hormones, and when Jean Frenay, a representative of Schering, told him the firm had combined two of them, [[norethisterone acetate]] and [[ethinylestradiol]] into an experimental preparation called SH-513 (containing 2&amp;nbsp;mg of the former and 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg of the latter) he asked for enough SH-513 to test it on a number of his patients. Peeters, wrote Frenay to Schering, "principally thinks of ovulation inhibition for contraceptive purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of May 5, 1959, quoted in Van den Broeck, Janssens &amp; Defoort 2012:322.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea of developing SH-513 into a contraceptive pill stemmed from Peeters, not from Schering. In fact, initially Schering's principal gynecologist wanted Peeters to test SH-513 as a treatment for [[dysmenorrhea]]. But eventually Peeters got formal permission from Schering to test SH-513 for the purpose of contraception.

Peeters selected from his patients those whose prognosis envisioned the risks of dying in childbirth, of stillbirth, and/or of Rh disease. He told them explicitly that he was developing a new medication, and got their permission to test it on them. The results of his small-scale trial (on no more than 50 fertile married women)&lt;ref&gt;Van den Broeck, Janssens &amp; Defoort 2012:323.&lt;/ref&gt; led him to conclude that a dose of 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;mg of norethisterone acetate and 'at least' 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg of ethinylestradiol was both efficient and had few side effects. Schering then made its SH-639 using this dose, and had it tested in trials in Germany, Australia, Japan and the USA on 14,038 menstrual cycles of 2433 women. The conclusion was an outright recommendation to introduce SH-639 as a hormonal contraceptive.

But Schering hesitated to introduce it in Germany, fearing comparison with [[Nazism|Nazi]] eugenics, still a painful memory in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Understandably so. [[Carl Clauberg]], for example, had taken part in Schering clinical research programs before WWII (Van den Broeck, Janssen &amp; Defoort 2012:324) and had experimented with [[progestin]]s. — On the relationship between Schering AG and Nazism, see Wlasich 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first introduced in Australia, on February 1961, as "Anovlar", a name intended to mean 'without ovulation'. The following table&lt;ref&gt;From Albach 1997:939.&lt;/ref&gt; shows Anovlar’s introduction times in a number of countries:
* Australia: February 1961
* Germany: June 1961
* Switzerland: October 1961
* Austria: June 1962
* France: February 1964
* Spain: June 1964
* Belgium: March 1965
* Italy: end of the 1960s
* Japan: beginning of the 1970s only for "gynecological indications"; June 1999 for contraceptive purposes

==Fame …==
The results of Peeters's research were published as Peeters F., M. Van Roy &amp; R. Oeyen 1960. (Van Roy was Peeters's [[clinical biologist]]; Oeyen, his assistant.) Requests for offprints came flooding in from all over the world, especially after the introduction of Anovlar, over 50,000 of them.

He addressed the Third World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Vienna, September 1961) and the 60th Congress of the North-West-German Gynecological Society (Kiel, 1961). He also spoke at the Second Fertility Congress in Brussels, where he met with Eleanor Mears, co-author of a highly favorable&lt;ref&gt;From the Summary: "this would appear a most acceptable form of contraception. The product was well tolerated and side-effects were few. … Cycle control was remarkably good … As a result of this [trial] …, the Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control has recommended anovlar for use as an alternative oral contraceptive in [[Family Planning Association|F.P.A.]] clinics."&lt;/ref&gt; report of a large-scale clinical trial of Anovlar, published in the prestigious ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]''.

In the early sixties, his reputation was considerable.

==… and silence==
But in his own country, Peeters faced problems. Until 1973, publications on birth control were liable to fall foul of Belgian law, which considered them obscene. In Belgium, Peeters had to keep quiet about his work.&lt;ref&gt;A meeting of the Flemish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology Peeters co-hosted on May 1960 in Turnhout had as its subject "ovulation suppressors". But its minutes make no mention of "birth control" or "contraception", subjects which might well have led to its being considered an obscene meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Belgium was a very Catholic country, and at the time the [[Catholic Church]]'s controlling document on hormonal contraception was ''[[Casti connubii]]'', which flatly forbade it. Peeters's employ was in the hands of the town council of Turnhout, entirely dominated by the [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian People's Party]]. The threat of losing his job, which he loved, was real, and he had to tread very carefully as long as the Catholic Church forbade artificial contraception and as long as Turnhout remained monolithically catholic, i.e., throughout his active life.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible, but not certain, that a presentation Peeters gave at a congress of the International Fertility Association held at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1963 led to the withdrawal of his appointment to supervise trainee doctors.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since October 1958, [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] was pope, and [[Aggiornamento]] seemed possible, even in the Catholic Church's view on birth control. Nand Peeters thought so. On May 1, 1963, he was granted a short private audience with John XXIII, from which he came away with the impression "that the pope provided support for the pill".&lt;ref&gt;A somewhat literal translation from the original Dutch: "dat de paus zijn steun verleende aan de pil".&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, in 1963 John XXIII established the ''Pontifical Commission on Birth Control'', which continued its work under the aegis of [[pope Paul VI]], though in a much expanded composition. In 1964, Paul VI convened the First European Congress of Catholic Doctors (Malta, 1964), which was almost entirely devoted to birth control. Peeters was one of the speakers.

When Paul VI confirmed the Catholic Church's total rejection of birth control by "artificial methods" in his ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' in 1968, Peeters was greatly disappointed and angry.&lt;ref&gt;At one point he fumed: "We'll go to the pope and we'll tell him that he should write an encyclical ''Pacem in Utero'': peace in the womb." The allusion is to John XXIII's last encyclical, ''[[Pacem in terris]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was a devout and committed catholic, and he could not square it with his conscience to publicly distance himself from the teaching of his church.

The Catholic Church’s ban on birth control as well as the political situation in Turnhout left him no choice but to withdraw into silence. This he did so successfully that his own children knew only vaguely that he had had something to do with Anovlar. That it was he who actually developed it they discovered only in 1995, when Schering, ignorant of Peeters's medical condition, asked him for help in contributing to the eponymous catalog (Staupe &amp; Vieth 1996) of ''Die Pille: Von der Lust und von der Liebe'', an exhibition put on by the [[German Hygiene Museum]].

The result was that his name fell into oblivion. When he died, only the local Turnhout press reported on his death.

==Peeters's ethics about the pill==
Peeters never accepted his church's absolute prohibition of the pill. He never repudiated his work on Anovlar. On the contrary, he was quietly proud of it. When he was asked to contribute an article on himself in a Dutch version of ''[[Who's Who]]'', he cited just one publication, Peeters 1970, his Dutch adaptation of a German work on hormone treatment, intended for doctors. He wanted them to continue to use hormones, including Anovlar, which he discussed in this book without mentioning his role in its development. And he continued to do research, not only on Anovlar, but also on other pills, such as Eugynon, Aconcen and Sequilar. However, he published his results only in medical journals.

More importantly, he unhesitatingly prescribed the pill when he deemed that a patient's health was threatened by too many pregnancies (too often life-threatening ones—ten or twelve children was not unusual in the Campine in the sixties), by late pregnancies or by the threat of yet another stillbirth, due, e.g., to Rh-disease. He would not have others, whoever they might be, influence his medical judgment, and for him the health of his patient always remained paramount. Also, he defended in no uncertain terms a couple's right to decide on the number of children they would have: "It is you and your husband who decide the number of your children, and that's not the pope's business."

Even so, Peeters remained a fundamentally conservative catholic, who strongly disapproved of the loose mores of the sexual revolution, largely due to the pill,&lt;ref&gt;One of his sons claims that this disapproval was also one of the reasons Peeters did not discuss Anovlar, which was in effect his indirect contribution to this sexual revolution.&lt;/ref&gt; and who agreed with his church that coitus should only take place within marriage.

==Other research==
In 1964, [[Ortho Pharmaceutical]] asked Peeters to participate in a clinical trial of a variant of RhoGAM, its [[Rho(D) immune globulin]]. He accepted. Peeters took the lead of a small team of doctors and a great number of midwives, whom he alerted to the problem of Rh-disease and who, aware of his excellent reputation in the region, willingly cooperated. The medication was tested on more than 700 women, and the trial was a resounding success: not a single case of Rh-disease was reported, leading one of his colleagues to say that it made the Campine the first Rh-disease free region in the world. When he presented the results to a Berlin conference attended by over 2500 gynecologists and [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]],&lt;ref&gt;This information (in Van den Broeck 2014:209) is based on a reminiscence of a collaborator of Nand Peeters’s, who puts the conference (which he does not specify further) in 1967 in Berlin. Probably it was the first European Congress of Perinatology, held in Berlin in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; it turned out that his was by far the most extensive clinical trial. But he ascribed its success to the midwives and the maternities involved in the study, and he did not even publish his results. He was too busy lecturing and teaching refresher courses to doctors.

==Nonmedical activities==
Whilst studying and for some time after his study, he was also a prominent leader in a catholic youth movement, the "Katholieke Studenten Actie" (KSA). His was a serious and time-consuming commitment: he wrote a brochure (Peeters 1944) for them, and until the day before his marriage, he could not be reached for a while, because he was inspecting KSA summer camps (together with [[Pieter De Somer]], another KSA-leader who was to become a noted medical researcher).

In 1948, upon the death of [[Jozef Simons]], Nand Peeters succeeded him as chairman of the Turnhout branch of the [[Davidsfonds]], a function which he retained until 1965, and in 1967 he co-founded the Campine branch of the [[Orde van den Prince]].&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.ovdp.net/index.php/nieuws/nieuwsbrief/4714 this page] on the website of the Orde.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Trivia==
* In 1970 the then Minister of Culture Frans Van Mechelen sent one of his collaborators to the immensely popular Nand Peeters to ask him to run for mayor of Turnhout for the Christian People's Party. Peeters refused: a doctor should be there for everyone, and not be beholden to a political party.
* On October 23, 1985, [[Pope John Paul II]] granted Peeters the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] award, obviously not for his development of Anovlar, but for his services to education.
* On Monday March 31, 2014, the Turnhout City Council decided that a street in a new social housing development is to be named "Dokter Nand Peetersstraat".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'' April 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dokter Nand Peetersstraat has since been built; its first inhabitants moved in on May 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

* Early in 2014 Belgian [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 1]] organized a poll asking its listeners what they considered "the best Belgian invention of all times". As soon as "Dr. Peeters's Pill" was nominated, it received massive support, almost exclusively from women. In the broadcast of the final, on April 4, 2014, it received 38% of the votes, outpolling the [[saxophone]], the [[Mercator projection]], the Belgian [[praline]] and [[JPEG]]&lt;ref&gt;Considered a Belgian invention, because it is based on research by the Belgian mathematician [[Ingrid Daubechies]].&lt;/ref&gt; by wide margins.
* On June 12, 2017, the Belgian post office ''bpost'' issued a First Day Sheet "Medische doorbraken/Avancées médicales" (Medical Breakthroughs), which featured a stamp in honor of Nand Peeters, showing his picture and a picture of the original Anovlar package.&lt;ref&gt; [https://eshop.bpost.be/nl/products/medische-doorbraken This page] on the ''bpost'' website (consulted on June 13, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Scudder''' (May 10, 1733 – October 17, 1781) was an American physician and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]] leader during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He served as a delegate for [[New Jersey]] to the [[Continental Congress]], where he was one of two delegates from New Jersey to sign the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|title=Richard B. Scudder, Co-Founder of MediaNews Group, Dies at 99 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/richard-b-scudder-co-founder-of-medianews-group-dies-at-99.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nathaniel was born in Monmouth Court House, [[Province of New Jersey]], which later became [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey]]. He attended the College Of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) and graduated in 1751. He then studied medicine before setting up a practice in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]]. His home site is now within the Borough of Freehold.

Dr. Scudder was active in civic and militia affairs. When the revolution split the colonies, he supported the rebel cause. He was a member of the county's [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], and represented it in the Provincial Congress held in 1774. That same year he was named lieutenant colonel in the county's first regiment of militia. In 1776 he was elected to a one-year term as Monmouth County's first member of the newly constituted [[New Jersey Legislative Council]], and in 1780 he was elected to the [[New Jersey General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;''Manual of the Legislature of New Jersey, 1914''; Thomas F. Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, Scudder became the colonel of his militia regiment and that fall was sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress. During the summer of 1778, he was particularly busy and finally abandoned his medical practice altogether. He split his time between the Congress and militia activities. He led his regiment in the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in June. He wrote a series of impassioned letters to local and state leaders urging the adoption of the Articles of Confederation and, when New Jersey's legislature approved them in November, he endorsed them for the state at the Congress.

Scudder continued both forms of service for several years. Finally, on October 17, 1781, he led a part of his regiment to offer resistance to a British Army foraging party, and was killed in a skirmish near [[Shrewsbury, New Jersey]]. He is buried in the Tennent Church Graveyard in [[Manalapan Township, New Jersey|Manalapan Township]]. Dr. Scudder was the only member of the Continental Congress to die in battle during the Revolutionary War, and the last Colonel to die in battle.

{{Politics of the Philippines}}
"'''Operation Big Bird'''" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Oplan Big Bird'') was the attempt of the [[Philippine Government]] during the presidency of [[Corazon Aquino]] to recover the alleged US$7.5 billion of hidden accounts and assets of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his family in the [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banks]].&lt;ref name="Distorting" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideOpinion.htm?f=2010/february/23/emiljurado.isx&amp;d=2010/february/23|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joker"/&gt; Conceived by Philippine [[banker]] Michael de Guzman, it commenced shortly after Marcos was forced into [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=googlebooksOperationBigBird/&gt; Initially, Operation Big Bird did not recover any money with two differing reports by Representative Victorio Chaves and Senator [[Jovito R.

After Ferdinand Marcos fled the Philippines, President Aquino's Executive Order No. 1 on February 28, 1986, created the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG).  The mandate of the PCGG was to recover all the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand Marcos, his family, relatives, associates, and cronies. Salonga was called to head the PCGG.

Operation Big Bird began when Filipino banker and Chairman of Credit Manila, de Guzman, contacted the Aquino administration and offered his services to recover the Marcos' wealth in the various banks in [[Switzerland]] and other countries.  De Guzman then was put in touch with [[Brigadier General]] [[Jose T. Almonte]] and Charlie Avila.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;

The banks, financial institutions and other companies that dealt with the Marcos wealth and assets were held in various countries, namely:&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bernstein-realestate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/realestate/commercial-property-bernstein-brothers-tangled-tale-americas-towers-crown.html|title=Commercial Property: The Bernstein Brothers; A Tangled Tale of Americas Towers and the Crown|date=January 13, 1991|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 June 2010 | first=David W. | last=Dunlap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of Marcos wealth and Operation Big Bird==

===Pre-EDSA Revolution===
*July 7, 1960
**Marcos opened his first bank account in [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan Bank]] in [[New York City]]. He deposited US$215,000.00.&lt;ref name="Chrono"&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/secretgoldtreaty/chron_appendix7.htm Marcos Chronology Report]&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 1968
**An official of [[Credit Suisse]] in [[Zurich]], Walter Fessler, was brought to [[Manila]] on the request of [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang]]. Forms were filled out and signatures appended. Marcos, on his signature verification form, wrote "''William Saunders''," an alias he had used in his [[World War II]] days, and underneath that name he wrote his real name.  [[Imelda Marcos]] did the same, choosing "''Jane Ryan''" as her pseudonym. Four bank accounts were opened. Four checks, totaling US$950,000.00 were given for the deposit.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/jul2003/152154.htm|title=Rep of the Phil vs Sandiganbayan : 152154 : July 15, 2003 : J.

*Sometime in 1982
**Credit Manila establishes its operations in [[Vienna]] with the incorporation of Exportfinanzierungsbank GmbH.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*Sometime in 1985
**Mike De Guzman makes acquaintance with Victor Bou Dagher in Vienna, a Lebanese national residing in [[Austria]] who has some connections and acquaintances in the European banking network.  De Guzman later introduces Dagher to Gen. Almonte in Manila in view of the news of Marcos hiding and moving their wealth in the Swiss banks.  The group outlines their plans in capturing the Marcos money.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*February 25, 1986
**The [[People Power Revolution]] brings the downfall of Pres. Ferdinand Marcos.  Marcos, his family, and [[retinue]], are taken by [[U.S. Air Force]] helicopters from the PSG Compound across the [[Pasig River]] from Malacañan Palace, and are brought to [[Clark Air Base]].  The next day they were flown to [[Guam]].

===Post-EDSA Events &amp; The Lebanese Connection===

*February 26, 1986
**The Marcos party arrived in [[Honululu]], [[Hawaii]], beginning their exile.  [[U.S. Customs]] officers take 5 hours to go over the 278 crates that group brought along with them.  Twenty-two crates contained more than Php27.7 million in newly minted currency, mostly hundred-peso denominations worth approximately US$1,270,000.00&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;
**There were other [[certificates of deposit]] from Philippine banks worth about US$1 million, five handguns, 154 videotapes, seventeen cassette tapes, and 2,068 pages of documents - all of which were impounded by Customs. The Marcos party was allowed to keep only US$300,000.00 in gold and $150,000.00 in [[bearer bonds]] that they brought in with their personal luggage because they declared them and broke no US customs laws.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;
**There were 24 one-kilo gold bars fitted into a $17,000 hand-tooled [[Gucci]] briefcase with a solid gold buckle and a plaque on it that read, "''To Ferdinand Marcos, from Imelda, on the Occasion of our 24th Wedding Anniversary''."&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;
*March 1, 1986
**De Guzman returns to Vienna and meets Dagher who updates him on the various reactions in the Swiss banking community regarding the recent developments in Manila.  De Guzman begins to take action on how to transfer the money from the Swiss Banks to Austria.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenixmaterials.org/pdf/010207.pdf|title=Phoenixmaterials.org|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 2, 1986
**De Guzman and Dagher fly to [[Lebanon]] via [[Cyprus]] to meet with some influential contacts in the European banking industry - [[Beirut]] being the banking capital of the Mediterranean basin.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*March 3, 1986
**At [[Larnaca]], De Guzman was finally able to get through to Gen. Almonte, who has been tied down with the recent changes in the government after his role in the EDSA Revolution, particularly the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]].  Almonte informs De Guzman that he needs to get back to Manila to recommend him to Pres. Aquino for a possible appointment in the new government.  De Guzman informs Almonte of his plans in Lebanon and promised to get back to him after his trip.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
**After arriving in [[Jounieh]], De Guzman and Dagher met with fellow bankers who give him an idea on how [[Iran]] was able to recover the frozen assets of the abdicated [[Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi|Shah]] in Switzerland. De Guzman was informed by the contacts that the Swiss banks will be moving the Marcos money to various financial institutions to safeguard the deposits and avoid a massive withdrawal - which the bankers alleged was a dark practice of the Swiss banking systems even in little affairs such as marital [[divorce]]. This brought forth the suggestion that De Guzman should go to Hawaii and meet with the Marcoses to get a [[Power of Attorney]] to withdraw the money in their behalf before the banks close in on the accounts. De Guzman claims he has no intimate associations with the Marcoses, but that his only contact would be Col. [[Irwin Ver]], former Commanding Officer of the [[Presidential Security Group]], and son of General [[Fabian Ver]].  It was here where De Guzman and his associates started calling the plan "'''Operation Big Bird'''."&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*March 12, 1986
**President Aquino passes Executive Order No. 2, freezing all Marcos assets in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Jakarta"&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/resources/org.apache.wicket.Application/repo?nid=62506d95-a33e-11dc-bf1b-335d0754ba85 Efforts to Recover Assets Looted by Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 15, 1986
**De Guzman and Dagher return to Vienna, and was able to get the new contact details of Irwin Ver in [[Hickam Air Force Base]] in Hawaii through his in-Laws who were still in Manila.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;

===The Power of Attorney from the Marcoses===
*March 18, 1986
**De Guzman and Dagher arrive in Honolulu and meet Col. Ver and Gen. Ver.  The meeting was mainly a personal one.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*March 19, 1986
**De Guzman and Dagher meet with the Vers once more and convince him to raise the subject with the Marcoses on the Swiss banks freezing their accounts.  Gen. Ver initially refuses as he says that this was a matter to Marcos alone and not himself, but De Guzman was able to convince the elder Ver.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*March 20, 1986
**De Guzman receives a call from Irwin Ver who confirms that a meeting has been arranged with the Marcoses - Ferdinand, Imelda and [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Bongbong]] - at their temporary lodging in the base housing inside Hickam AFB.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
**At the meeting, De Guzman shared the news that the Swiss banks will make a move on their account.  Marcos wanted to confirm this information and sends Bongbong and De Guzman around 10:00 pm to [[Honolulu International Airport]] to call their personal banker in Credit Suisse, Ernst Scheller.  The off-base call was made to avoid possible wire taps or listening devices.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
**Upon their return to the base housing, the Marcoses hold a family meeting where Bongbong updates the family on the teleconference.  An hour later, Bongbong leaves with De Guzman for the airport once more, but this time the telephone operator refuses to give Bongbong the international connection.  They return to the base housing, where De Guzman received a note from Imelda stating "Palmy Foundation" and a plastic bag containing [[traveler's cheque]]s worth US$300,000.00.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;
*March 21, 1986
**De Guzman is called for a lunch meeting by Col. Ver.  In the said meeting, Gen. Ver hands De Guzman an [[Allied Banking Corporation]] (in Hong Kong) [[cashier's check]] worth US$150,000.00 from [[Lucio Tan]], and requested the latter to clear the check and send the money back.  De Guzman later admitted in the [[Philippine House of Representatives]]' investigation on Operation Big Bird that he didn't intend to return the money, but use it to fund the said operation.&lt;ref name="Mike2"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xK0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2888,2202751&amp;hl=en |title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Imelda produces the Power of Attorney and tasks Bongbong to hand this to De Guzman back at the hotel.  Bongbong orients De Guzman on their contact in Credit Suisse, Ernst Scheller, and told him to get in touch with the gentleman once they enter Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"&gt;[http://www.aic.gov.au/events/aic%20upcoming%20events/2000/~/media/conferences/transnational/chaikin.ashx Tracking the Proceeds of Organized Crim - The Marcos Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial attempt in Switzerland===
*March 22, 1986
**De Guzman and Dagher leave Hawaii for Vienna, and proceed in securing their entry visas to Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*March 24, 1986
**De Guzman flies with Dagher to Zurich to meet with Scheller and present the Power of Attorney to transfer the Marcos money to the Exportfinanzierungsbank in Vienna.  They were initially informed by Scheller that the Swiss authorities have put a "freeze order" on all the accounts linked to the Marcoses, but failed to produce any formal documentation on this.  Scheller also mentioned that he re-documented the records already and moved the accounts as instructed by Ms. Fe Gimenez, Marcos' personal secretary, three weeks before after their evacuation of Malacañan Palace.  Without the formal notice of the freeze order, De Guzman suspects Scheller of stalling the transfer in protection of the interest of Credit Suisse and not the Marcoses.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**After the meeting, Scheller calls on the [[Swiss Federal Banking Commission]] that De Guzman was trying to transfer US$213 Million to Vienna.  That very same evening the Banking Commission, in an unprecedented move, imposed an emergency freeze order on all the accounts of the Marcoses. This act was questioned later since the Banking Commission does not have the authority to freeze bank accounts.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
**The [[Swiss Federal Council]] taking note of the confusion created by the Banking Commission's "freeze order" made a follow through act, and formalized the freeze order in anticipation of the new Philippine government's claim on the said accounts.  The Aquino government welcomed the freeze order, and the PCGG hired three prominent Swiss lawyers Messr. Sergio Salvioni, Guy Fontanet, and Moritz Leuenberger, to handle its case.  The said lawyers were recommended by [[List of judges of the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Chief Justice]] of the Federal Supreme Court [[Otto Konstantin Kaufmann]], who was the classmate of Salonga in [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salonga"&gt;[http://www.kilosbayan.org/openletter01302006.htm Letter of Jovito Salonga to Pres.

*April 18, 1986
**The Philippine government submitted an informal request to the Swiss authorities for mutual assistance in the recovery of the Marcos wealth.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
*April 25, 1986
**The Government of the Philippines submits a follow-through formal request for mutual assistance to investigate and retrieve the ill-gotten wealth.  The Swiss [[Federal Office of Police]] then issued a freeze order in substitution for the exceptional freezing order of the Federal Council.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

===Operation Big Bird under the Philippine Government===
*May 7, 1986
**Mike de Guzman attempts once more to retrieve the Marcos money in the Swiss accounts, by making Scheller acknowledge their personal meeting and the Power of Attorney.  Scheller replied by [[telex]] from Credit Suisse, but informs De Guzman that the freeze order is still in place.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**De Guzman finally calls Gen. Almonte and updates him of his recent activities.  Almonte on the other hand informed De Guzman that there are some parties in the new government who have serious doubts about him as he had a reputation for being an associate of [[Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.|Danding Cojuangco]], a Marcos crony.  This prompts De Guzman to head to Manila to present his plans for Operation Big Bird to the new Philippine Government.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 16, 1986
**Back in Manila, Gen. Almonte arranges a meeting between De Guzman and the brother of Pres. Aquino, Congressman [[Jose Cojuangco, Jr.|Peping Cojuangco]] ([[Legislative districts of Tarlac#1st District|Tarlac, 1st District]]).&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurado"/&gt;  De Guzman offered to help the Aquino government in retrieving the Marcos wealth in return for a fee of 20% commission on the initial batch of funds. De Guzman presented that they had identified accounts in Credit Suisse amounting to US$213 million, and eleven foundations that held a total of US$4.5 billion in deposits in nine different banks with an additional US$3 billion in precious metals and securities on deposit - or a tentative total of US$7.5 billion.  And most of all, they had the Power of Attorney from the Marcoses.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;  Cojuangco instructs Dr. Fernando Carrascoso, who was present in the meeting, to arrange for De Guzman's introduction to PCCG Chairman Jovito Salonga.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 18, 1986
**Dr. Carrascoso informs De Guzman that Chairman Salonga was not available, and thus he was instead referred to Commissioner Raul Daza.  The meeting was also attended by Mayor Charlie Avila.  De Guzman briefs the gentleman on the plans of Operation Big Bird.  Daza committed to get approval from Salonga.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 20, 1986
**Daza receives the approval from Salonga to head to Vienna, and he informs De Guzman right away.  Plans are made for Avila, Daza, and De Guzman to head to Vienna on June 22 to meet up with Dagher and his associates.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 22, 1986
**Salonga changes his order a few hours before the group was to depart for Vienna, and informs Daza to stay in Manila for a court case.  De Guzman was caught surprised by this sudden change and arranges for a meeting with Salonga at the latter's residence in [[Mandaluyong]] to plead the importance of the group's mission to Vienna.  Salonga was hesitant, and tells De Guzman that he should instead coordinate with the PCGG's Swiss lawyers in [[Bern]].  Having no other recourse, De Guzman requests Salonga for a letter of introduction to Philippine Ambassador Luis Ascalon who would arrange for the meeting with the Swiss lawyers.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**De Guzman confers with Gen. Almonte once more and informs him of Salonga's decision, and pleads with the General to accompany him to Switzerland to give his mission an official basis.  Almonte and De Guzman proceeds to Peping Cojuangco's residence and updates the Congressman on the meeting with PCGG and the change of plans.  It was then decided to push through with the Operation, and De Guzman informs Dagher of their arrival by June 25.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 25, 1986
**Gen. Almonte receives a last-minute clearance from Executive Secretary Arroyo, and flies with De Guzman to Vienna, where they meet Dagher and his associates, who then proceeds in orienting Almonte on the possible actions to take to retrieve the Marcos money identified in the Swiss banks.  Almonte satisfied with the plan sends a telex to Peping Cojuangco.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 26, 1986
**De Guzman, Dagher, and Almonte fly to Bern, where the group, through the arrangement made by Amb. Ascalon, met with PCCG lawyer Dr. Salvioni, who advises them that any request made by the Philippine Government must be signed by the Solicitor-General of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**After the meeting Dagher updates De Guzman that the Swiss banks have received the news of their arrival and thus they might take action in moving the funds.  Taking this matter seriously, Almonte calls on Cojuangco to request Arroyo to authorize Ambassador Ascalon to file the official documents for the request of transfer in place of the Solicitor-General.  Cojuangco connects Almonte to Arroyo directly, who confirms verbally that he will prepare the formal authorization for Ascalon.  The group waits for two days in Bern without any follow through from Malacañang.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*June 28, 1986
**After losing two days in Bern, De Guzman and Almonte return to Manila with a sense of urgency and met up with Cojuangco, to give him a personal debriefing on the developments in Switzerland, and to activate the plan of the government to retrieve the plundered money in the Swiss banks.  Cojuangco assessed the situation and weighed on the possibility of Operation Big Bird failing.  That if it failed it would damage the President's reputation as well as cause another turmoil for the country.  Almonte countered that if they didn't proceed with Operation Big Bird, the country will lose 3 to 5 years before gaining a hand on the money.  Cojuangco concluded that he will confer with his brother, Pedro Cojuangco, before they present it to the President, their sister.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*July 1, 1986
**After conferring with his older brother, Congressman Cojuangco presents the options to President Aquino, and a meeting was arranged for General Almonte and De Guzman to orient the President on Operation Big Bird.  Aquino approved the plan, and Operation Big Bird finally commenced with De Guzman, Almonte, being joined by Solicitor-General Sedfrey Ordoñez.&lt;ref name="Chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19950427&amp;id=xIwmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6324,3399325|title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Guzman makes Ordoñez and Almonte members of the Board of Exportfinanzierungsbank, along with Almonte's former mentor and former Marcos Executive Secretary, Amb.

===Second attempt with the Philippine Government===
*July 4, 1986
**De Guzman, Almonte, and Ordoñez arrive in Bern, and are met by Ascalon.  Ascalon informs the new Philippine government recovery team that the three Swiss lawyers of the PCGG and a gentleman by the name of Pieter Hoets was waiting at the Philippine Embassy.  Upon arrival at the Embassy, Hoets and the lawyers insisted that the scheduled meeting with the Swiss bankers should only be attended by Ordoñez, and that De Guzman and Almonte should not be included.  Almonte defends the group and reminds that they have all been appointed by the President to work as a team on Operation Big Bird.  A long argument ensues between the Swiss lawyers and the Philippine representatives.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**Having enough of the stalling of the three lawyers and Hoets, and with the 11:00am appointment coming, General Almonte called De Guzman, Ascalon and Ordoñez aside, and to the surprise of the Swiss lawyers, sped off to the meeting at the [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]] (FDJP).  The group arrived just in time, and sat down with Dr. Lionel Frei, Chief of Section in charge of the case, Dr. Pierre Schmidd, Vice Director of the FDJP, and Dr. Hess, representative of [[Elisabeth Kopp]], [[Member of the Swiss Federal Council]] who is overseeing the FDJP.  After Ascalon and Ordoñez's formalities with the Swiss officials, Almonte proceeds in explaining the government's position.  The three Swiss lawyers and Hoets joined the meeting when De Guzman presented the Power of Attorney from the Marcoses, the list of identified accounts, and the action plan for transferring the money to Austria.  Overall the meeting only took 20 minutes, when the Swiss authorities unanimously decided to approve in principle the selective defreezing of only those identified Marcos accounts and foundations, amounting to US$213 million.&lt;ref name="Joint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xK0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6262,2471801&amp;hl=en|title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Swiss authorities advised the Philippine representatives to formalize the request, and even told them to finish this before the day's end.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
**Upon returning to the Philippine Embassy, the group calls Chairman Salonga and Congressman Cojuangco on the success of the Operation, and rushes to complete the required formal documents.  Dr. Salvioni questions the urgency of the Filipino team, but was ignored and Ordoñez signed the request accordingly.  The letter arrived at the FDJP with 15 minutes to spare before the 6:00 pm deadline.  FDJP was to act on the request, and by Monday, July 7, have the Zurich Court execute a transfer instruction to the Swiss banks.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*July 5, 1986
**Ordoñez, Almonte, and De Guzman arrive in Vienna after a 12-hour train ride, to prepare the transfer of the funds to the Philippine Government's account at the Exportfinanzierungsbank.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*July 6, 1986
**De Guzman receives additional information on the newly identified Marcos accounts in Switzerland amounting to US$3 billion in six different banks.  The breakdown of the deposits are US$700 million in money placements, US$1.3 billion in [[Security (finance)|securities]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and US$1 billion in [[Gold certificates]].  It was suggested for the team to prepare the same request as those of July 4, and that Almonte shall fly to Switzerland first thing the next day to endorse the documents to Ambassador Ascalon for a formal communication to the FDJP.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
*July 7, 1986
**Almonte flies alone to Zurich at 6:00am with the signed documents, but Ascalon refuses to affix the official communication of the Embassy without the approval of Dr. Salvioni. De Guzman, who was in Vienna, frantically tries to track down Dr. Salvioni to no avail.   Almonte returns to Vienna that night and briefly updates Ordoñez on what has transpired in Bern.  Ordoñez postpones the meeting until the next day.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**The FDJP meanwhile acts on the request and lifts the freeze order on the US$213 Million identified by the Philippine representatives.&lt;ref name="Mike"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19890712&amp;id=xK0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6344,1998683|title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

*July 8, 1986
**The Judge of Instructions in Zurich ordered Credit Suisse to release and transfer the defreezed Marcos deposits to the account of the Philippine Government in Exportfinanzierungsbank in Vienna.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
**Ordoñez however made a turn around, in fear of the money being diverted from Vienna to a Marcos-favored destination.  The Swiss lawyers hired by the PCGG tipped Ordoñez on the credibility of De Guzman and his bank in Vienna.  Ordoñez instructed the Swiss lawyers, without informing Almonte and De Guzman, to request the FDJP and Credit Suisse to direct the transfer of the monies to a new destination, the newly opened account of the Philippine Government within the said bank.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
**Ordoñez secretly left Vienna for Zurich then to Manila on the orders of PCGG Chairman Salonga.&lt;ref name="Raider"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurado"/&gt;  Almonte and De Guzman are left in Vienna without an idea as to what happened to the Solicitor-General, and frantically search Vienna for the Filipino official, until confirming on July 10 that Ordoñez was already in Manila.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**Meanwhile, before the transfer was made, the Credit Suisse official, Ernst Scheller, contacted the son of the former President, [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Bongbong Marcos]], and informed him of the Philippine Government's actions.  This gave Ferdinand Marcos to execute a revocation of his Power of Attorney to De Guzman.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
*July 11, 1986
**De Guzman and Almonte head back to Manila and debrief Congressman Cojuangco on the events that took place in Bern and Vienna.
**Marcos' revocation of the Power of Attorney was sent by facsimile to his Swiss lawyer, Bruno de Preux of the law firm Tavernier, Gillioz, de Preux, Dorsaz in Geneva.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;
*July 13, 1986
**The [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] quotes Ordoñez that they were able to retrieve the initial US$213 million of Marcos' plundered money in Switzerland, and that the said fund will be in the government's hands soon.&lt;ref name="Mike2"/&gt;
**Marcos' Swiss lawyers submit copies of the revocation to the Swiss authorities.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Almonte receives a call from [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang]] on December 24, 1986, and was called for a meeting with the President to debrief her on what actually happened in Switzerland and Austria.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;  The meeting was confirmed by Ms. Ching Escaler, Aquino's Appointments Secretary (and later Philippine Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations|UN]] in Geneva and [[New York City]]) on December 29, 1986.  Almonte arrived with De Guzman in Malacañang, and was met first by Executive Secretary [[Joker Arroyo]] who stalled the two along with [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]] Secretary Ordoñez from meeting the President.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurado"/&gt;

Meanwhile, on October 21, 1988, a US [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] [[Grand Jury]] in New York indicts Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos for a US$268 million racketeering scheme, siphoning the Philippine Treasury of US$103 million, and defrauding US banks of US$165 million.  By November 3, Imelda returns to Hawaii after [[Doris Duke]] posted a US$5 million bail.&lt;ref name="Jakarta"/&gt;

The Philippine Government thus lost its chance to recover the money in the Marcos Swiss accounts through 'Operation Big Bird. The whole fiasco was then brought into light by the [[Philippine House of Representatives]]' Committee on Public Accountability in mid-1989, under the Chairmanship of Cong. Victorico "Concoy" Chaves ([[Legislative districts of Misamis Oriental#2nd District|2nd District, Misamis Oriental]]).&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

The Chaves Report suggested that the Philippine Government would have immediately recovered the $213 million in July 1986 from Credit Suisse and its affiliates had the operation not been stopped by PCGG Chairman [[Jovito R. Salonga|Salonga]] and Solicitor-General Ordoñez, and that this would have "paved the way to the recovery of the other deposits of the Marcoses with the Swiss banks" which was estimated by the Chaves Report to be at least $3 billion.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

On the side of De Guzman and Gen. Almonte however, they also lay the blame on Executive Secretary [[Joker Arroyo]], and Philippine Ambassador to Bern, Luis Ascalon, aside from Ordoñez and Salonga.&lt;ref name="Joker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yK0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5931,3694774&amp;hl=en|title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jovito Salonga, who by 1989 was already the Senate President, and Ordoñez who became Justice Secretary, have fully denied these accusations.&lt;ref name="Joint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xa0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2870,2632571&amp;hl=en|title=Manila Standard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chaves Report also rejected the view of the Swiss attorneys and PCGG Chairman [[Jovito R. Salonga]] that they had saved the Philippine Government from a massive theft. It concluded that if the funds were remitted to the Vienna bank to the account of Philippine government, whose authorized joint signatories were Solicitor-General Ordoñez and Gen. Almonte, there was no realistic chance that De Guzman would have stolen the money.  In addition to this the Exportfinanzierungsbank in Vienna was also strictly regulated by the Austrian Federal Market Authority (FMA), and that the bank's board even had Almonte, Ordoñez, and Amb. Alejandro Melchor - ensuring the Philippine government's interest in the bank protected. And finally, De Guzman expected to receive a commission of $40 million (i.e. a 20% commission on the $213 million) if the monies were recovered, and thus he had an interest in ensuring that recovery did take place.&lt;ref name="Track"/&gt;

On December 20, 1990, the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] decided that the US$213 Million along with other banking documents should be transferred to the Philippine government, with conditions however.&lt;ref name="TheNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenews.jang.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=26762|title=Today's Newspaper - The News International|work=The News International, Pakistan|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1995, the PCGG filed with the District Attorney in Zurich, Switzerland, an additional request for the immediate transfer of the deposits to an escrow account in the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB).  The request was granted.  On appeal by the Marcoses, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, in a decision dated December 10, 1997, upheld the ruling of the District Attorney of Zurich granting the request for the transfer of the funds.  In 1998, the funds were remitted to the Philippines in escrow.&lt;ref name="Sandigan"/&gt;

On December 10, 1997 under the Swiss Federal Act of International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (IMAC), the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, issued the final decision to transfer the fund to the [[Sandiganbayan]] which now grew to US$540 Million due to interest.&lt;ref name="TheNews"/&gt;

Also in 1997 the [[Philippine Senate]]'s Blue Ribbon Committee and the House of Representatives' Committee on Good Government, would again review the saga of Operation Big Bird, with the same conclusion. Aquino's Vice President, [[Salvador Laurel]] would reflect that this their administration's greatest failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylaurel.com/from_the_lips_of_a_dying_president.html From the lips of dying President]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting April 1998 up to July of that year, the Swiss authorities started transferring the identified Marcos money in Swiss banks to an escrow account in the PNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgid=2341&amp;printFriendly=true|title=Supreme Court: Bankruptcy Proceedings|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 1999, Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice [[Francis E. Garchitorena]] denies the motion to release US$150 million from the funds to pay Marcos [[human rights]] victims.&lt;ref name="Sandigan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/top-stories/15080-rights-abuse-victims-win-vs-marcos-estate|title=The Manila Times Online - Trusted Since 1898|work=The Manila Times Online|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 1999, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee held a special hearing in the Philippine Consulate in Honululu. In the hearing, businessman [[Enrique Zobel]] testified that in early 1989, he met with Marcos as he was for asking a US$250 million loan from him. Zobel in turn, refused it unless there was a financial backing. Marcos later produced documents of a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] trust in gold accounts to pay off the loan.&lt;ref name=pimentel-zobel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nenepimentel.org/bluerib/zobel-depo.shtml|title=DEPOSITION OF MR. ENRIQUE J. ZOBEL|date=October 27, 1999|work=[[Senate of the Philippines]]|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2004, the Marcos money which now grew to US$683 million, was finally transferred by PNB to the [[Bureau of the Treasury (Philippines)|Bureau of the Treasury]].&lt;ref name="TheNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2004/01/18/news/$683m.still.in.escrow.at.pnb.malacanang.assures.html $683M still in escrow at PNB, Malacañang assures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mb.com.ph/node/153939 PNB given until Feb. 2 to remit $683-M funds]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the '''Agrarian Reform Law''', part of the retrieved Marcos wealth will be utilized for the government's agrarian reform program, and the remaining part for the compensation of the victims of the Marcos dictatorship.  Once all pending legalities were settled regarding the US$683 Million in escrow, the fund was finally transferred to the [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]] and [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]].

However, by 2005, the [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] (PCIJ) reports that the portion of the money was diverted by the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Arroyo]] administration for the [[Philippine general election, 2004|President's campaign during the 2004 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcij.org/stories/2005/farmfunds.html|title=Billions in Farm Funds Used for Arroyo Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to Senate Blue Ribbon Committee inquiry concluding that Pres. Arroyo mismanaged the fund - which then became known as the [[Fertilizer Fund scam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quezon.ph/2007/08/09/sandbagging-the-opposition/|title=Sandbagging the opposition|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcij.org/blog/?p=689|title=Senate links Arroyo to fertilizer fund scam|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Patricia Clementina''' (fl. 590), was a politically active aristocrat in Byzantine [[Naples]] in the late 6th century. She is mentioned in the letters and documents of [[Gregory the Great]], and exemplifies the unusual degree of influence females could have in Byzantine Italy. 

Clementina is called ''[[patrikios|patricia]]'' and was a very wealthy aristocrat and landowner with her own court. She was powerful in her own right because of her great wealth and not because she was related to powerful men, which was somewhat unusual in her time. She was a controversial political figure in southern Italy and known for her involvement in the local religious conflicts and power struggles between powerful clerics and kept in contact with papal envoys. At one point, a peasant revolt broke out on one of her estates. Clementina attempted to prevent the election of bishop [[Amandus of Sorrento]] because she wished for him to stay in her entourage.

== Early life ==
Baljak is a [[Cebuano people|Cebuana]] of [[Croats|Croatian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] descent. She was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] but moved to [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]] as a child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeelifestylecebu.com/right-as-raine-baljak/|title=Right as Raine Baljak|last=Taboada|first=Patty|date=July 1, 2016|website=Zee Lifestyle Cebu|publisher=Zee Lifestyle Cebu|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/82003/miss-cebu-takes-after-beauty-queen-mom|title=Miss Cebu takes after Beauty Queen Mom|last=Sibi|first=Juli Ann M.|date=January 14, 2016|website=Cebu Daily News - Inquirer.net|publisher=INQUIRER.net|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her childhood, she remembers raising money with her cousin to contribute a small playground built in Maslog that still exists today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  She has mentioned in interviews that she enjoys rock climbing &lt;ref name="A Beauty so Profound"/&gt; and in a 2006 Freeman article she won first place at ten years old in an Aboitiz Baseline Climbing competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=No-ot|first1=Caecent|title=Aboitiz makes it two in-a-row|url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-sports/322658/aboitiz-makes-it-two-row|website=The Freeman|ref=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2014, Baljak competed in Manila for the International Schools Athletics Conference representing [[Cebu International School|CIS]] Girls Basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIS ISAC Teams Compete in Manila|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.452226438159648.93328.433904753325150&amp;type=3|website=Cebu International School|ref=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIS ISAC Girls Basketball|url=https://www.facebook.com/CebuInternationalSchool/photos/a.433945159987776.90085.433904753325150/602249529824004/?type=3&amp;permPage=1|website=Cebu International School|ref=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also volunteered for the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] in September 2013 - January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agrawal|first1=Hansika|title=Make-A-Wish|url=https://casjournalhansikaa.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/make-a-wish/|website=IB CAS Journal Hansika Agrawwal|publisher=Wordpress}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Baljak volunteered for the [http://yellowboat.org/ Yellow Boat Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIS volunteers for the Yellowboat Foundation|url=https://www.facebook.com/CebuInternationalSchool/photos/a.433945159987776.90085.433904753325150/613461822036108/?type=3&amp;theater|website=Cebu International School|ref=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Baljak's graduating year from [[Cebu International School]], her Visual Arts class exhibited their artworks at the Ayala Center Cebu on March 16–24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cebu International School Newsflash|url=http://cis.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NEWSFLASH-13-March-2015_final.pdf|website=Cebu International School|ref=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

On the relocation of the Cebu Farmers’ Market (CFM) at VIBO Place along Escario Street in [[Cebu City]], Baljak attended supporting the organic fruit and vegetable farmers. She presented a demo alongside friend, Chef Chip Lopez of Kairos – The Lazy Chef as they prepared a [[Green papaya salad|Thai green papaya salad]] using green papaya from her family's 8Hills [[Natural farming|Natural Farm]] for the dish. The nineteen year old [[beauty queen]] brought with her an heirloom [[mortar and pestle]] to prepare a [[Veganism|vegan]] sauce for the salad, explained some of the reasons why eating plant-based food has helped her live a healthier life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/101426/not-your-usual-farmers-market|title=Not your usual farmers’ market|last=Sinson|first=Frauline Maria|date=August 14, 2016|website=Cebu Daily News|publisher=The Cebu Daily News.

'''Rod Stoner''' is a former British army corporal from the Parachute Regiment who was employed as a security consultant by the [[private military contractor]] [[Aegis Defence Services]] in 2004 and 2005. He appeared in the 1982 [[BBC1]] documentary ''[[The Paras]]''.

==Disaffected==
A common complaint by Aegis employees is that the "old boy" system reigns, and senior management often behaves as if they are still in the military. Rod Stoner became disgruntled with the management of Aegis in Iraq, where it is contracted to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], and left Aegis during 2005. In October 2005, Stoner set up a website and published a number of videos allegedly showing Aegis personnel shooting indiscriminately, and without warning, at Iraqi civilian vehicles.

==Television interview==
On 6 April 2006 Stoner was identified on [[Channel 4 News]] as the [[whistleblower]] who had created the website and posted the videos there. Stoner told the programme that Aegis was about to take legal action to have him silenced, and to get his website closed down:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They're accusing me of breach of confidence, breach of contract and copyright infringement. I can't understand how they can do that because as soon as the videos were out, they denied they were anything to do with them. Most of the clips that were shot, I was in the vehicle. My original intention of building the website was to draw out the problems so that Aegis had no choice but to put it right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a separate [[More 4|More 4 News]] programme, Aegis was reported to be unable to confirm whether its employees were involved in the incidents shown in the videos.

{{Malay name|Sha'ari|Tadin}}
'''Sha'ari Tadin''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: شءاري تادين; b.2 August 1931 – d.13 December 2009) was a [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP), and Senior [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the Minister for Culture in the [[Singapore Government]]. As the first [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] graduate MP, he was also highly regarded as '''Cikgu Sha'ari''', for his role as educator.

==Education==
Sha'ari was born in [[Kuala Pilah]], [[Negri Sembilan]], [[Federated Malay States]] (now [[Malaysia]]). 
He was an ethnic [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] descent and was the eldest of six siblings. He was educated at the Malay School in Kuala Pilah and completed his primary education in the sixth grade (Darjah 6) during the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] from 1942–1945.

After the war, Sha'ari completed his primary education in Singapore at Outram School (now [[Outram Secondary School]]) in less than three years. He later had his secondary education at [[Victoria School]] and on obtaining his Senior Cambridge Certificate, joined the Teachers' Training College (now [[National Institute of Education]]) and started his teaching career in 1957.

==Teaching and scholarship==
Sha'ari taught in various primary schools between 1954 and 1960. One of his former students from Jalan Daud Primary School was [[Zainul Abidin bin Mohamed Rasheed]], former Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mayor of North East District of Singapore.

In 1961 Sha'ari taught Science to Malay-medium pupils at Siglap Secondary School. A year later he was awarded the Federation Colombo Plan Scholarship to study at the [[University of Malaya]] (UM) in Kuala Lumpur, leading up to a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in Malay Studies. While at UM, he was elected President of the ''Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia'' (PKPIM) or National Union of Federation Muslim Students from 1963 to 1965, as well as Executive Committee member of the ''Masjlis Belia Malaysia'' or Malaysian Youth Council (MYC) Executive Committee in 1963 and 1964. He was also Deputy Leader of UM's first Student Exchange Programme delegation to [[Chulalongkorn University]], Bangkok in 1963; and part of MYC's delegation to the 5th General Assembly of the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) Conference at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], USA.

With a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in Malay Studies, he returned to Singapore in 1965. He taught Malay and Economics (in the Malay language) to the first batch of pre-University Malay-medium pupils at Sang Nila Utama Secondary School, the first Malay secondary school in Singapore. He was also part of the Singapore delegation to the Third Asian Teachers' Leadership Seminar Committee, Permanent Congress of Malay Language and Culture in 1966. Within 2 years at Sang Nila Utama Secondary School, he became Acting Principal in 1967. He also tutored many students, one of whom was the son of the first President of Singapore, [[Yusof bin Ishak]].

==Politics==
In the mid 1960s newly independent Singapore was facing problems such as mass unemployment, shortage of public housing as well as lack of land and natural resources. The Government's implementation of a large-scale public housing programme caused many residents from largely rural areas to be relocated to various parts of the island. There was a strong need to establish closer rapport with the people, especially in the Malay community and help them understand the need for better public housing.

===First Malay graduate MP (1968)===
As one of the first few Singaporean Malay scholars in the 1960s, Sha'ari was approached by the Prime Minister of Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], to join the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) and to contest in the republic's general elections. Dedicated to teaching and his students, it took much persuasion before Sha'ari agreed to join politics. He strongly believed in a strong foundation in education among the younger generation of citizens, and being in Parliament would enable him to continue his work and do more for the nation.

===Member of Parliament for Kampong Chai Chee (1968–1976)===
In February 1968 Sha'ari retired temporarily from Government Service to enable him to stand as a PAP candidate for Kampong [[Chai Chee]] in the 1968 Singapore General Elections. Returning unopposed with over 75 percent of votes, Sha'ari became Member of Parliament for Kampong Chai Chee and the '''first Malay graduate PAP MP'''.

===Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (1968–1972)===
In May 1968, at the age of 36, Sha'ari was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture. He spent time and energy with the people, grassroots leaders and residents in his constituency to better understand their concerns and to be able to help them understand the need for building a better future for Singapore.

===Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (1972–1976)===
Within four years in office, Sha'ari he was promoted to Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Culture) in 1972. He had also temporarily performed the duties of Parliamentary Secretary (Education) before the 1972 General Elections.

During his tenure at the Ministry of Culture, he was instrumental in the promotion of arts and culture of Singapore and its introduction overseas. In 1969, he founded ''Majlis Pusat'' (''Pertubuhan-Pertubuhan Budaya Melayu'') or Central Council of Malay Cultural Organisations, and became its patron until 1987. He helped to establish the National Dance Company (now Singapore Dance Theatre), which made its debut in the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in 1972. He led cultural delegations to [[Indonesia]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Tehran]] and [[South Korea]]. He was leader of the Singapore contingent at the [[1974 Asian Games]] in Tehran. He was also a special guest of the Governments of [[West Germany]], Japan and France in 1972, 1974, 1975 respectively.

===Other senior appointments===

* 1975 – Opening of the Six French Masters of Photography Exhibition, at [[National Museum of Singapore]]

* 1976 – PERGAS Study Centre
* 1978 – Bedok View Secondary School

===Member of Parliament for Bedok (1976–1980)===
[[Bedok]] was partly reclaimed in 1966. In 1973 development started for the creation of [[Bedok New Town]], the fifth new town by the [[Housing Development Board]] ([[HDB]]). Bedok became a constituency in 1976 under the charge of Sha'ari, who formed the Citizens' Consultative Committee. That same year he contested in the General Elections in Bedok constituency and was returned with a majority vote of nearly 75 percent.

On 28 September 1978, as the Member of Parliament for Bedok Constituency, he officially opened [[Bedok View Secondary School]], the 139th school built by the government and the first government secondary school to be built within Bedok New Town.

==Continuing teaching and education==
In February 1977 Sha'ari rejoined the Ministry of Education as an aided Education Officer. That same year he was seconded as Principal of [[Telok Kurau Secondary School]], whilst still serving as a member of parliament. Under his leadership and guidance, the number of 'O' level passes increased at the school.

Upon retiring from politics Sha'ari was posted to the [[Ministry of Education, Singapore]]'s Public Relations Unit in 1985 until 1987. He also served as a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of South East Asian Studies (ISEAS) in December 1987.

At the age of 56, Sha'ari obtained a master's degree in Social Sciences in Sociology from the [[National University of Singapore]] in 1987, after submitting his thesis entitled 'A Study of Performance and Motivation of Schoolchildren in an Integrated Secondary School'. His achievements have become a source of inspiration to many under his guidance and mentorship, and those who know him.

==Awards==
Sha'ari received the ''Anugerah Jasawan'' (Meritorious Award) by ''Majlis Pusat'' in 1984. The Singapore Government has also accorded him the ''Pingat Bakti Setia'' (Excellent Service Award) for his commitment and contribution to public service.

==Death==
Sha'ari died of heart failure at his home on 13 December 2009 at 12:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. Prior to his death he had been bedridden for quite some time with [[Parkinson's disease]].

==Early years==
Born in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], and a member of the [[Cherokee Nation]], Sixkiller's family moved to [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] in southern [[Oregon]] when he was a year old, where his father worked in a lumber mill.&lt;ref name=legsix&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2StSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qnUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7222,2623012 |work=St. Petersburg Times |location=(Florida) |title='Legend of Sonny Sixkiller' latest football ballad |agency=UPI |date=November 14, 1970 |page=2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blount&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blount| first=Roy, Jr.|title=The magic number is Sixkiller|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=October 4, 1971|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1971/10/04/612437/the-magic-number-is-sixkiller&lt;!--

In football, Sixkiller was an All-Southern Oregon Conference selection and a second team All-State selection. He was a back-up at quarterback as a sophomore to senior Gene Willis, who later played at [[Washington Huskies football|Washington]]. In [[basketball]], he was an all-conference selection. In [[baseball]], he was a pitcher and an all-conference selection. Sixkiller graduated in 1969 and had hoped to stay in-state and play for [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], but head coach [[Dee Andros]] declined to offer him a [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]], wary of his short stature ({{height|ft=5|in=11}}, {{nowrap|{{convert|171|lb|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=legsix/&gt;}}

==University of Washington==
On the advice of Willis, head coach [[Jim Owens]] recruited Sixkiller and offered him a scholarship to the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. Due to his name, he was given uniform number 6. He became the starting quarterback for the [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]] as a sophomore in [[1970 Washington Huskies football team|1970]] and led the Huskies to a {{nowrap|6-4}} record, a vast improvement over the {{nowrap|1–9}} record in [[1969 Washington Huskies football team|1969]]. He completed 186 passes for 2,303 yards and 15 touchdowns in what many called the Year of The Quarterback, in which [[Jim Plunkett]] of [[1970 Stanford Indians football team|Stanford]] passed for 2,715 yards on the year and broke his own conference record. Plunkett won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in [[1970 college football season#Heisman Trophy voting|1970]], &lt;!--given annually to the top college football player in the country,--&gt; beating out [[1970 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame's]] [[Joe Theismann]] and [[Archie Manning]] of [[1970 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]].

Sixkiller missed four games as a senior in [[1972 Washington Huskies football team|1972]] finished his college career with 385 completions for 5,496 yards and 35 touchdowns, and held fifteen school records.&lt;ref name= ramsonny&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g-ZVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2743,2793519 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=UPI |title=Sonny's bid for Ram job comes to end |date=August 12, 1973 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huskies posted consecutive {{nowrap|8–3}} records in [[1971 Washington Huskies football team|1971]] and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/pac10/washington/yearly_results.php?year=1970 cfbdatawarehouse.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925043336/http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/pac10/washington/yearly_results.php?year=1970 |date=2012-09-25 }} - Washington Huskies - 1970-74&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] allowed only one team to play in the postseason, the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], until the [[1975 NCAA Division I football season|1975]] season.

==Professional football==
Unselected in the [[1973 NFL Draft]], Sixkiller had tryouts with the [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] in 1973,&lt;ref name= ramsonny/&gt; and with the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in 1974. He signed with the [[Philadelphia Bell]] of the [[World Football League]] in September 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ExxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=newDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1667,1732052 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Bell inks Huskies' Sixkiller |date=September 20, 1974 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played with [[The Hawaiians (WFL)|The Hawaiians]] in 1975, until the league folded in October.

'''Susan Harris''' (née '''Spivak'''; born October 28, 1940) is an American television comedy writer and producer.

Harris created numerous TV series: ''[[Fay (TV series)|Fay]]'', ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', ''[[Loves Me, Loves Me Not (TV series)|Loves Me, Loves Me Not]]'', ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'', ''[[It Takes Two (U.S. TV series)|It Takes Two]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Empty Nest]]'', ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', ''[[Good &amp; Evil]]'', ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' and ''[[The Secret Lives of Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Golden Girls' Creator Adds Shows |publisher= LA Times|date=September 10, 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-10/entertainment/ca-2286_1_golden-girls|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She also wrote or co-wrote all of the episodes of ''Soap''. Her most financially successful show was ''The Golden Girls''. Harris married television producer [[Paul Junger Witt]] on September 18, 1983; he co-produced all the shows she created. She was married from 1965 to 1969 to actor Berkeley Harris, and is the mother of author [[Sam Harris]]. The first script Harris sold was ''[[Then Came Bronson]]''. She then wrote for ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' and the TV adaptation of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park (TV series)|Barefoot in the Park]]''. Her abortion episode for the [[Bea Arthur]]-starring series ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' in the 1970s won Harris the [[Humanitas Prize]]. She would later work with Arthur again in the 1980s when Arthur took one of the lead roles in ''The Golden Girls''.

Harris had the symptoms of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], which affected her ability to participate in the production of ''The Golden Girls''. In an episode of that show titled "Sick and Tired" (1989), Harris wrote some of her struggles into the storyline where Arthur's character [[Dorothy Zbornak|Dorothy]] was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. It later turned out Harris had an [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] issue, but she wrote the episode as "my revenge script for all the people out there who had a disease like that".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/the-golden-girls-creators-on-finding-new-fans.html|title=The Golden Girls Creators On Finding a New Generation of Fans|last=Hunt|first=Stacey Wilson|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris formed the production company [[Witt/Thomas Productions|Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions]] with Paul Junger Witt and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]]. She was honored with the Writers' Guild's [[Paddy Chayefsky]] Award in 2005 and inducted into the [[Television Academy Hall of Fame]] in 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Theodoros Paphitis''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος Παφίτης}}; born 24 September 1959) is an English-Cypriot retail magnate and entrepreneur. He is best known for his appearances on the BBC business programme ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'' and as former chairman of [[Millwall Football Club]].

Paphitis has made the majority of his fortune in the retail sector. In 2006, he sold his equity stake in the lingerie brand [[La Senza]] for a reported £100 million. He is the owner of stationery chain [[Ryman]], the homewares specialist [[Robert Dyas]] and lingerie retailer [[Boux Avenue]].

The 2017 ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' estimated his wealth at £286 million, listing him as the 406th richest person in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Sunday Times Rich List|url=http://nuk-rich-list-ui-2017-uk-prod.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/richlist/view/group6/50/name/desc/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[Solent University]] in [[Southampton]] named Paphitis as their new Chancellor. He will assume the role in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/16257676.Dragons__39__Den_star_to_become_Hampshire_university__39_s_new_chancellor/|title=Dragons' Den star to become Hampshire university's new chancellor|work=Daily Echo|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paphitis was inaugurated as the university's Chancellor on October 11 2018. He will serve a minimum of three years. Paphitis succeeded [[Lord West of Spithead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/16978483.amp/|title= Celebrity entrepreneur Theo Paphitis is new chancellor of Solent University|work=Daily Echo|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Theodoros Paphitis was born on 24 September 1959 in [[Limassol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theopaphitis.com/biography.asp|title=Theo Paphitis – Biography|work=theopaphitis.com|accessdate=9 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113225248/http://www.theopaphitis.com/biography.asp |archivedate = 13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the second of three brothers, with elder brother Marinos and younger brother George. They also share two half-brothers. Paphitis moved to [[London]] with his parents and Marinos when he was nine years old. He attended Ambler Primary School in [[Islington]] and [[Woodberry Down School|Woodberry Down Comprehensive School]] in [[Manor House, London|Manor House]], where he battled with [[dyslexia]], but began his entrepreneurial activities by running the school's [[tuck shop]] at the age of 15.

==Career==
===Business===
Paphitis took a job as a tea boy and filing clerk at a [[City of London]] [[insurance broker]]. Wanting more money, he discovered his passion for retailing and sales when at 18 he worked as a sales assistant for [[Watches of Switzerland]] in [[Bond Street]].&lt;ref name="TIL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23417900-details/Enter+the+Dragon+of+balls,+rubber+and+lingerie/article.do |title=Enter the Dragon of balls, rubber and lingerie |publisher=This is London |date=24 October 2007|accessdate=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 21, he joined [[Legal &amp; General]] selling commercial mortgages, which taught him to read other businesses' [[balance sheet]]s.

Aged 23, he set up a property finance company with close friend and business associate Mark Moran, and kept going when the friend left in partnership with Hanover Druce, making his first money on the rise of the 1980s commercial property markets.&lt;ref name="TIL"/&gt; Spotting the rise in [[mobile telephone]]s, he bought into NAG Telecom, becoming chairman alongside fellow director [[Anthony Kleanthous|Tony Kleanthous]]. Paphitis gained a large market share for NAG by negotiating concessionary positions in [[Ryman]] stationery stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paphitis |first=Theo |title=Enter the Dragon |year=2010 |publisher=Hachette UK |isbn=1-4091-2413-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ryman went bankrupt, Paphitis approached the administrators and bought the company. He turned it around by improving relations with suppliers, and enthusing the management team,&lt;ref name="TIL"/&gt; cementing his reputation for turning failing companies into highly successful and profitable businesses. His ventures now include [[Ryman]], [[Robert Dyas]] and [[Boux Avenue]]. He co-owns [[Red Letter Days]] with fellow ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'' businessman [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]]. In 2006, he sold his equity stake in the UK and EU segment of the global lingerie brand, [[La Senza]], for a reported £100m.&lt;ref name="TIL1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/news/lingerie.htm |title=La Senza sold to Lion Capital |publisher=fashionunited.co.uk |date=13 July 2006 |accessdate=13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Paphitis was one of several interested parties in bidding for failed retail chain [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]].&lt;ref name="Citi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citywire.co.uk/personal/-/news/markets-companies-and-funds/content.aspx?ID=322569&amp;re=4281&amp;ea=180442|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729172359/http://www.citywire.co.uk/personal/-/news/markets-companies-and-funds/content.aspx?ID=322569&amp;re=4281&amp;ea=180442|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 July 2012|title=Dragon's (sic) Den star among Woolies bidders|publisher=Citiwire|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he later pulled out because of unrealistic numbers quoted by the administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7764534.stm |title=Dragon out of race for Woolworths |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Paphitis set up a new lingerie chain, [[Boux Avenue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/dragon-takes-the-plunge-into-lingerie-2296348.html | title= Dragon takes the plunge into lingerie | location=London |work=The Independent | date=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by the end of 2013 had grown to 21 stores in the UK with a further four internationally.

In July 2012, he bought the hardware retailer [[Robert Dyas]]. Paphitis said: "It is a business which fits well with my investment criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theo Paphitis buys Robert Dyas chain for £10m |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/10/theo-paphitis-buys-robert-dyas |accessdate=16 October 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football===
As chairman from 1997, Paphitis took [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] out of administration and on to the [[2004 FA Cup Final]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. He is perhaps best known for his work to reduce football [[hooliganism]], and appointing as Millwall manager [[Dennis Wise]], and together they guided the club to their first official appearance in the final of the FA Cup and into European football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/22/football.paulkelso |title=Millwall get FA Cup sympathy vote |last=Kelso |first=Paul |date=22 May 2004 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=10 November 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After almost eight years at the helm of Millwall, Paphitis stepped down from his role as chairman in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burnige named Millwall chairman |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/4242983.stm |accessdate=8 January 2014 |work=BBC Sport |date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paphitis is a director and part-owner of [[Isthmian League]] side [[Walton &amp; Hersham F.C.|Walton &amp; Hersham]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Paphitis' other companies became sponsors of the League's cup competitions with [[Robert Dyas]] sponsoring cup tournaments. [[Boux Avenue]] became title sponsor of the Boux Avenue Women's Cup.

===Television===
After appearing on series four of the [[BBC]] ''[[Back to the Floor (UK TV series)|Back to the Floor]]'' series while chairman at Millwall FC, Paphitis was approached to become one of the "dragons" in the second series of the [[BBC Two]] entrepreneurship series ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'' in 2005 and left the programme after the 2012 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4nhgBmsXHWDjRqC704jPLyD/about-dragons-den|title=Dragons' Den – About the Show |work=BBC |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paphitis was known as a straight-talking but approachable and sincere 'dragon' who made many investments on the show, both alone and jointly with other dragon investors. In February 2013, he announced that he would be leaving the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21367311 |title=Dragons' Den: Theo Paphitis says "I'm out" |work=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Paphitis had a three-part television series on BBC Two called ''Theo's Adventure Capitalists''.  The series followed British businesses looking to enter new markets in Brazil, India and Vietnam.  The series was supported by the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00scx8q |title=Theo's Adventure Capitalists |work=BBC|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Paphitis presented the seven-part BBC Two series called ''[[Britain's Next Big Thing]]''. The series examined the stories of artists, scientists, manufacturers and brand owners looking to sell their products and services to UK retailers including Boots and Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010hgwc |title=Britain's Next Big Thing |work=BBC |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After time away from television to concentrate on business, Paphitis returned with appearances on BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' and [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[The Agenda]]''.  In March 2014, he appeared in ''[[Famous, Rich and Hungry]]'', a two-part BBC documentary series which aimed to promote awareness of British people living in poverty, and raise money for [[Sport Relief]].

==Personal life==
Paphitis lives with his wife Debbie in [[Weybridge, Surrey]]. They have two sons and three daughters, including twins, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name="BBCTheo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/thedragons/theo.shtml |title=The Dragons' Stories: Theo |work=BBC |accessdate=10 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913125711/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/thedragons/theo.shtml |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/240124/Theo-Paphitis-Branded-lazy-at-school-but-i-was-dyslexic|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505003003/http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/240124/Theo-Paphitis-Branded-lazy-at-school-but-i-was-dyslexic|deadurl=yes|title=Theo Paphitis: Branded lazy at school but I was dyslexic|date=5 May 2013|archivedate=5 May 2013|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paphitis attributes his success to his natural common sense, and his favourite motto is a famous business school motto: "KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid". He has said, "There are three reasons to be in business. To make money, to have fun, and to make money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden |title=Dragons' Den |work=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paphitis is a keen fan of cars. His car collection has a series of [[personalised number plate]]s, including RYM4N on his [[Maybach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regtransfers.co.uk/main/STORIES/t1heo.asp |title=Celebrity Number Plates Stories: Enter The Dragon – Theo Paphitis |publisher=Regtransfers.co.uk|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2017, the burglar who stole Paphitis' [[Land Rover]] received a jail sentence of two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burglar who stole Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis' £45,000 Land Rover is jailed for two-and-a-half years|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3786499/burglar-who-stole-dragons-den-star-theo-paphitis-45000-land-rover-is-jailed-for-two-and-a-half-years/|work=The Sun|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paphitis has been criticised for some of his views on women. In 2008, he was quoted by Kira Cochrane of ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as saying that although women may refuse to take [[maternity leave]], "their brains turn to mush" after the pregnancy and "they take three months off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cochrane |first=Kira |title=Now, the Blacklash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/gender.women |work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 May 2011 |location=London |date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paphitis voted for [[Brexit]] in 2016, describing the [[EU]] as a "failed experiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theo Paphitis: I'm voting for a Brexit as EU is 'failed experiment' |url=https://www.retail-week.com/policy-and-legal/theo-paphitis-im-voting-for-a-brexit-as-eu-is-failed-experiment/7008573.article?authent=1 |accessdate=13 September 2018 |work=retail-week.com |date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore "Ted" Aranda, Ph.D.''' is a [[Belize]]an politician and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] activist.

== Education and UDP career ==
Aranda holds a Ph.D. and worked with the Belize branch of the [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] organization. In 1974 he joined the newly formed [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] and quickly rose up the ranks. In 1979 he was one of the [[Belizean legislative election, 1979|five representatives elected]] for the UDP, representing the [[Dangriga (Belize House constituency)|Dangriga]] constituency. He was elected UDP leader as the previous leader, [[Dean Lindo]], was defeated for re-election in the [[Fort George (Belize House constituency)|Fort George]] constituency. After a stormy stint as the country's first post-independence [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]], Aranda was either ousted from or resigned UDP leadership in late 1982, leaving the party entirely shortly thereafter.

== Christian Democratic Party and move to the PUP ==
Aranda briefly revived the [[Christian Democratic Party (Belize)|Christian Democratic Party]] in 1983 and unsuccessfully sought re-election in Dangriga under its banner in 1984, finishing third with 24.3 percent of the vote. He went on to join the [[People's United Party]] and re-captured the Dangriga seat as its candidate in 1989. Russell "Chiste" Garcia defeated him for the seat in 1993, but Aranda won a third non-consecutive term in 1998. He was not a candidate for re-election in 2003. Since Belize's 1981 independence from [[Great Britain]] Aranda is the only person to win election to the Belize House as a candidate for both the UDP and the PUP.

== World Garifuna Organization ==
In 2000 Aranda formed the World Garifuna Organization, a body claiming to represent Garinagu across the world and in Belize, though the official Belize body is the National Garifuna Council. Aranda has been at odds with younger members of the Garinagu population.

[[File:Dyl Ulenspiegel.jpg|thumb|225px|The prankster Till Eulenspiegel, depicted with ''owl'' and ''mirror'' (title page of the [[Strasbourg]] edition of 1515)]]
'''Till Eulenspiegel''' ({{IPA-de|tɪl ˈʔɔʏlənˌʃpiːɡəl}}, [[Low German]]: ''Dyl Ulenspegel'' {{IPA-dedia|dɪl ˈʔuːlnˌspeɪɡl̩}}) is the protagonist of a German [[chapbook]] published in 1515 (a first edition of c. 1510/12 is preserved fragmentarily) with a possible background in  earlier [[Middle Low German]] [[German folklore|folklore]].

Eulenspiegel is a native of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] whose [[picaresque]] career 
takes him to many places throughout the  [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 
He plays [[trickster|practical jokes]] on his contemporaries, especially [[scatological]] in nature, exposing vices at every turn.
His life is set in the first half of the 14th century, and the final chapters of the chapbook describe his death from the [[Black Death|plague of 1350]].
His name translates to "owl mirror", and the frontispiece of the 1515 chapbook, as well as his alleged tombstone in [[Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein]], display the name in [[rebus]] writing, by an [[owl]] and a [[hand mirror]]. There is a suggestion that the name is in fact a veiled pun on a Low German phrase translating to "wipe-arse".&lt;ref name=wipe-arse&gt;From a Middle Low German verb ''ulen'' "to wipe" and ''spegel'' "mirror", a term used in the sense of "buttocks, behind" (used in [[Medieval hunting|hunting]] jargon of the bright tail area of [[fallow deer]]); ''ul'n spegel'' would then amount to an imperative "wipe the arse!". Paul Oppenheimer, "Introduction" in: ''Till Eulenspiegel. His Adventures''. Routledge, 1991, p. LXIII. See also [[Swabian salute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Retellings of the Eulenspiegel tradition have been published in modern literature, since the later 19th century. Notably,  ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak]]'' by  [[Charles De Coster]] (1867) transfers the character to the context of the  [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Dutch Revolt]]. The Ulenspiegel (modern  [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Tijl Uilenspiegel'') from this novel became a symbol of [[Flemish independence]].

==Origin and historicity==
According to the chapbook, Eulenspiegel was born in [[Kneitlingen]] near [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] around 1300. As a vagrant (''Landfahrer''), he travelled through the [[Holy Roman Empire]], especially [[Northern Germany]], but also the [[Low Countries]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. 
He is said to have died in [[Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein]], near [[Lübeck]] and [[Hamburg]], of the [[Black Death]] in 1350.

The first known chapbook on Eulenspiegel was printed in c. 1510&amp;ndash;1512 in Strasbourg.  It is  reasonable to place the folkloristic origins of the tradition in the 15th century, although, in spite of often-repeated{{by whom|date=March 2018}} suggestions to the effect "that the name 'Eulenspiegel' was used in tales of rogues and liars in Lower Saxony as early as 1400",&lt;ref name=Michaelis&gt;Ruth Michaelis-Jena, "Eulenspiegel and Münchhausen: Two German Folk Heroes", ''Folklore'' '''97'''.1 (1986:101-108) p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; 15th-century references to a Till Eulenspiegel  turn out to be surprisingly elusive.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer /&gt; 
The text of the first extant edition, printed by [[Johannes Grüninger]], is in the [[High German]] language. 
There has been a debate surrounding the possible existence of an older [[Low German]] edition, now lost.
This version has been attributed to [[Hans Dorn]], the only known printer active in Brunswick at the beginning of the 16th century (active from at least 1502). Sodmann (1980) in support of this hypothesis adduced the woodcut of a fool on horseback holding a hand mirror used by Dorn in later prints, as the title illustration of his ''Liber vagatorum'' and ''Grobianus'', which may originally have served as the title illustration of the lost Eulenspiegel edition.&lt;ref&gt;Hill-Zenk (2011:[https://books.google.ch/books?id=4ONYUr8yfqIC&amp;pg=PA331 331f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several suggestions as to the author of the 1510 chapbook, none of which has gained mainstream acceptance. 
Candidates include [[Thomas Murner]],&lt;ref&gt;Authorship was first attributed to Murner by Lappenberg (1854) and was long taken for granted, but is "no longer taken seriously" (Oppenheimer 1991:xxviii).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Bote]],  [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]], or an author collective surrounding [[Johannes Grüninger]], including Thomas Murner,  [[Johannes Adelphus]], [[Tilemann Conradi]] and [[Hermannus Buschius]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schulz-Grobert, ''Das Straßburger Eulenspiegelbuch'', Niemeyer, Tübingen (1999).
Authorship of Bote was suggested due to the [[acrostic]] ''ERMAN B'' being formed by the initials of chapters 90 to 95. In support of Bote being the author: Siegfried H. Sichtermann, '' Die Wandlungen des Till Eulenspiegel'' (1982).  Schulz-Grobert argues against Bote's authorship, assuming that the acrostic, if genuine,   more likely refers to  Buschius.&lt;/ref&gt;
The author of the 1515 edition in a short preface identifies himself only as "N". He gives the year 1500 as the date when he originally began to collect the tales, stressing the difficulty of the project and how he wanted to abandon it several times, saying that he is now publishing it after all to "lighten the mood in hard times". The preface also announces the inclusion of material from [[Pfaff Amis]] and [[Pfaff vom Kahlenberg]], but no such material is present in the 1515 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Ein_kurtzweilig_lesen_von_Dyl_Vlenspiegel.djvu&amp;page=3 fol 2r.]: ''Als man zalt von Crist geburt. M.ccccc. bin ich, N, durch etlich personen gebetten worden, dz ich dise hystorien und geschichten in zu lieb sol zesammen bringen [...]'' 
"In the year 1500 counted from the birth of Christ, I, N., have been asked by several persons that I should collect these stories and tales to please them [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vlenspiegel 1515 259.jpg|thumb|upright|Owl-and-mirror rebus from the depiction of Eulenspiegel's tombstone and epitaph in the 1515 edition (fol. 130).&lt;ref&gt;The epitaph is given as ''Dissen stein sol niemans erhaben / Ulenspiegel stat hie begraben.'' "Let no-one lift this stone / Eulenspiegel stands buried here". Eulenspiegel "stands" rather than lies in his grave due to a mishap during his burial described in the final story of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The literal translation of the High German name "Eulenspiegel" is "owl mirror" (hence ''owle-glasse''). It is both innocuous and indicative of his character and has been explained as a garbled form of an expression for "wipe-the-arse":&lt;ref name=wipe-arse/&gt; 

Despite of the name's High German meaning, the book's hero acts out the Plattdeutsch version of his name: ulen, "to sweep" or "clean", and Spiegel, "mirror", which - to the very day - is German speaking hunter's jargon for "hind parts" or "backside", so that in the original Plattdeutsch, his surname means "wipe my a*se", in essence, "kiss my a*se".

Many of Till's  pranks are [[scatology|scatological]] in nature, and involve tricking people into touching, smelling, or even eating Till's excrement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/od/literature/a/Till-Eulenspiegel.htm|title=Till Eulenspiegel|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114003553/http://german.about.com/od/literature/a/Till-Eulenspiegel.htm|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/fart.html#innkeeper&lt;/ref&gt;
Scatological stories abound, beginning with Till's early childhood (in which he rides behind his father and exposes his rear-end to the townspeople) and persisting until his death bed (where he tricks a priest into soiling his hands with feces).&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer /&gt;

In modern scholarship, there have been some attempts to find evidence for the historicity of Till Eulenspiegel's person. 
Hucker (1980) mentions that according to a contemporary legal register of the city of Brunswick one ''Till van Cletlinge'' ("Till from/of Kneitlingen") was incarcerated there in the year 1339, along with four of his accomplices, for highway robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulrich Hucker|first=Bernd Ulrich|title=Till Eulenspiegel: Beiträge zur Forschung und Katalog der Ausstellung vom 6. Oktober 1980 bis 30. Januar 1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpltHAAACAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Stadtarchiv und Stadtbibliothek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Till Eulenspiegel-Gedenkstein (Eulenspiegel-Grab) in Mölln.JPG|thumb|180px|Upper half of "Eulenspiegel's tombstone" in [[Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein]].]]
In [[Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein|Mölln]], the reported site of Eulenspiegel's death and burial in the plague year of 1350, a memorial stone was commissioned by the town council in 1544, now on display in an alcove on the outside wall of the tower of St. Nicolai church. The stone is inscribed in Low German, as follows:
:''Anno 1350 is dusse / steen upgehaven und / Tyle ulen spegel lenet / hier under begraven. / Marcket wol und / dencket dran. wat / ick gwest si up eren. / All de hir vor aver / gan. moten mi / glick weren.''
:"This stone was carved in 1350, and Tyl Ulenspegel lies buried underneath. Note well and remember what I have been on Earth.  All those who pass here will become as I am now."
The inscription (including the date of 1350) was allegedly copied from an older tombstone, now lost. This older tombstone is referred to in the chapbook of 1515, and it is mentioned as still being extant in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moelln-tourismus.de/a-eulenspiegel-gedenkstein moelln-tourismus.de]{{unreliable source?|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1544 stone is mentioned by  [[Fynes Moryson]] in his ''Itinerary'' of 1591.
Moryson also reports that in his time, the citizen of Mölln held a yearly festival in Eulenspiegel's honour, on which occasion they would present the clothes worn by Eulenspiegel when he died.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Walz, "Fynes Moryson and the Tomb of Till Eulenspiegel" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''42'''.7 (November 1927:465-466) p 465; Walz quotes Moryson's description of "a famous Jester Oulenspiegell (whom we call Owlyglasse)": "the towns-men yeerly&lt;!--yeerly in original--&gt; keepe a feast for his memory, and yet show the apparell he was wont to weare." 
The earliest reference to the gravestone is of the mid-sixteenth century, in [[Reimar Kock]]'s  ''Lübscher Chronik'' (1550). By the 17th century it was noted as "often renewed".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapbook tradition==
{{commonscat|Ein kurtzweilig lesen von Dyl Vlenspiegel}}
[[File:Nuremberg Euelenspiegel.png|thumb|Woodcut for the 32nd chapter in the 1515 edition: Eulenspiegel is pursued by Nuremberg guards, he leads them across a broken bridge and they fall into the moat.]]
The two earliest printed editions, in [[Early New High German]], were printed by [[Johann Grüninger|Johannes Grüninger]] in [[Strasbourg]]. The first edition was unknown before sixteen folia of printing proofs  
were discovered in 1971 in the binding of a Latin edition of [[Reynard]].
Honegger ({{year needed|date=March 2018}}) dated these pages to 1510/11 based on the type used, but this date has since been called into question. 
Only a single specimen of the first edition has been preserved, discovered in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ulrich Hucker {{year needed|date=March 2018}}, see Paul Oppenheimer, ''Till Eulenspiegel: His Adventures" (1991), Introduction, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty folia are missing, including the title page. 
A previous owner has replaced the missing pages by pages torn from an Eulenspiegel edition of c. 1700.
It was most likely  published in 1512. The sixteen folia discovered by Honegger are likely printing proofs for this edition.
It  consists of 100 folia with 66 woodcuts of high quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The 1515 edition was also printed by Grüninger in Strasbourg. Its full title reads:
:''Ein kurtzweilig Lesen von Dyl Ulenspiegel, geboren uß dem Land zu Brunßwick, wie er sein leben volbracht hatt, xcvi seiner geschichten.''
:"A diverting read of ''Dyl Ulenspiegel'', born in the land of Brunswick, how he spent his life; 96 of his stories".
The text is divided into 95 chapters (numbered to 96 as chapter number 42 is missing).
The 1515 edition is decidedly inferior, missing many of the illustrations of the older edition, and showing signs of careless copying of the text.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
It is uncertain how many of these chapters were present in the earlier edition of 1510/12, although some of the chapters appear to be later additions. The initials of the final six chapters form the "acrostic" ''ERMANB'', which has been taken as a hidden reference to the book's author.
The first  chapters are dedicated to Till's childhood. In chapter nine, Till leaves his mother and begins his life as a vagrant. He takes up diverse occupations, but each chapter ends with his moving on to another place.
The final seven chapters are dedicated to his death and burial.

In the chapbooks, Eulenspiegel is presented as a [[trickster]] who plays practical jokes on his contemporaries, exposing vices at every turn, greed and folly, hypocrisy and foolishness. As Peter Carels notes, "The fulcrum of his wit in a large number of the tales is his literal interpretation of figurative language."&lt;ref name=Carels&gt;Peter E. Carels, "Eulenspiegel and Company Visit the Eighteenth Century" ''Modern Language Studies'' '''10'''.3 (Autumn 1980:3-11) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Previously, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] made a similar observation.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Paul Oppenheimer's introduction to ''Till Eulenspiegel:His Adventures'', paperback published by Oxford University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-19-282343-4}}, page xxii.  "''Eulenspiegel: alle Hauptspässe des Buches beruhen darauf, dass alle Menschen figürlich sprechen und Eulenspiegel es eigenlich nimmt''" ("Eulenspiegel: all the chief jests of the book depend on this: that everybody speaks figuratively and Eulenspiegel takes it literally.")&lt;/ref&gt;)  Although craftsmen are featured as the principal victims of his pranks, neither the nobility nor the pope is exempt from being affected by him.

A third Strasbourg edition, of 1519, is better again and is usually used in modern editions to provide the sections that are missing in the surviving 1510/12 copy.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer&gt;Paul Oppenheimer, ''Till Eulenspiegel: His Adventures" (1991){{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Antwerp group" of Eulenspiegel editions comprises a number of Flemish, French and English publications. It is only slightly younger than the Strasbourg editions, these books were probably printed from before 1520, first in [[Antwerp]] by [[Jan van Doesborch]].
It is possible that the first English translation was printed by van Doesborch as early as 1520. In this edition the name ''Ulenspiegel'' is rendered ''Howleglas'' (as it were "owl-glass").
Later English editions, derived from the Antwerp group, were printed by [[William Copland]] in London, in 1547 and 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Hill-Zenk (2011:[https://books.google.ch/books?id=4ONYUr8yfqIC&amp;pg=PA2 2])&lt;/ref&gt;

''Owleglasse'' is mentioned in [[Henry Porter (playwright)|Henry Porter]]'s  ''The Two Angry Women of Abington'' (1599) and again in [[Ben Jonson]]'s  comedic play ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610).

The first modern edition of the chapbook of 1519 is by Lappenberg (1854). Lappenberg was not yet aware of the existence of the 1515 edition.
The 1515 and 1519 editions were  published in facsimile by Insel-Ferlag in 1911 and 1979, respectively.
An English translation by Paul Oppenheimer was published in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;
''A Pleasant Vintage of Till, Eulenspiegel'' (Wesleyan University Press) 1972, with introduction and critical apparatus; Oppenheimer, ''Till Eulenspiegel: His Adventures'' was published in the Garland Library of Medieval Literature, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Editions of Eulenspiegel in German, Dutch, Flemish, French and English remained popular throughout the early modern period. By the late 17th century, Eulenspiegel and his pranks had become proverbial, with the French adjective ''espiègle'' "impish, mischievous" derived from his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé'' reports attestation of the adjective in 1690.&lt;/ref&gt;
The German noun ''Eulenspiegelei'' (as it were "owlglassery") is recorded in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The plural ''Eulenspiegeleien'' used by [[Goethe]] in 1826: H. G. Gräf (ed.), ''Goethe über seine Dichtungen'' (1903),  [https://archive.org/stream/goeberseinedich11grgoog#page/n69/mode/2up p. 41].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reception==

In the eighteenth century, German satirists adopted episodes for social satire, and in the nineteenth and early twentieth-century versions of the tales are [[bowdlerize]]d, to render them fit for children, who had come to be considered their chief natural audience, by expurgating their many scatological references.&lt;ref name=Carels /&gt;

''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak]]'', an 1867 novel by Belgian author [[Charles De Coster]], has been translated, often in mutilated versions, into many languages. 
It was De Coster who first transferred Ulenspiegel from his original late medieval surroundings to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In this version, Ulenspiegel was born in  [[Damme]], West Flanders and became a Protestant hero of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. The author gives him a father, Claes, and mother, Soetkin, as well as a girlfriend, Nele, and a best friend, [[Lamme Goedzak]]. In the course of the story Claes is taken prisoner by the Spanish oppressors and burned at the stake, while Soetkin goes insane as a result. This tempts Thyl to start resistance against the Spanish oppressors. Thanks to the 1867 novel, Ulenspiegel has  become a symbol of [[Flemish nationalism]], with a statue dedicated to him in Damme.

[[Richard Strauss]] wrote the tone poem ''[[Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche]]'', Op. 28, in 1894-1895.
In 1902 [[Emil von Reznicek]] adapted the story into an [[opera]]: ''Till Eulenspiegel''. In 1913 [[Walter Braunfels]] adapted the story into an opera ''[[Ulenspiegel]]''. The [[Ballets Russes]] adapted the story into a ballet in 1916, later re-adapted by [[George Balanchine]] for [[Jerome Robbins]] at [[New York City Ballet]].

A French edition, ''Les Aventures de Til Ulespiègle'', was published by  Constantin Castéra in 1910.
In 1927 [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] wrote the verse ''Till Eulenspiegel''.
Dutch comics artist [[George van Raemdonck]] adapted the novel into a comic strip in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/raemdonck.htm|title=George van Raemdonck|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s [[Ray Goossens]] made a [[gag-a-day]] comic about Uilenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/goossens_ray.htm|title=Ray Goossens|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Wladimir Vogel]] was a Russian composer who wrote a drama-oratorio Thyl Claes in the late 30s or early 40s, derived from De Coster's book.

Between 1945 and 1950 a German satirical magazine was called [[Ulenspiegel (magazine)|''Ulenspiegel'']].
The satirical magazine  [[Eulenspiegel (magazine)|''Eulenspiegel'']] was published from 1954 in Berlin, [[East Germany]].
Ulenspiegel was mentioned in [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s "[[The Master and Margarita]]" as a possible prototype for the [[black cat]] character [[The Master and Margarita#Woland and his retinue|Behemoth]].
In 1956 the film ''[[Les Aventures de Till L'Espiègle]]'' was made by [[Gérard Philipe]] and [[Joris Ivens]], which adapted De Coster's novel. (English title: "Bold Adventure"). The film was a French-East German co-production.

[[Willy Vandersteen]] drew two comic book albums about Uilenspiegel, "De Opstand der Geuzen" ("The Rebellion of the [[Geuzen]]") and "Fort Oranje" ("Fort Orange"), both drawn in a realistic, serious style and pre-published in the Belgian comics magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' between 1952 and 1954. They were published in comic book album format in 1954 and 1955. The stories were drawn in a realistic style and in some instances followed the original novel very closely, but sometimes followed his own imagination more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/v/vandersteen.htm|title=Willy Vandersteen|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kibbutz]] theatre director and producer [[Shulamit Bat-Dori]] created an open-air production of ''Till Eulenspiegel'' at [[Mishmar HaEmek]], Israel, in 1955 that drew 10,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=8vYVAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Howard%20Fast%27s|title=The Jewish Labour Movement|first=Leon|last=Samuels|journal=The Jewish Quarterly|volume=3|issue=3|year=1956|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/01374.php|title=(1904-שולמית בת-דורי (1985)) |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Shulamit Bat-Dori (1904-1985)|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|work=Lexicon of Modern Hebrew Literature|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 the BRT (nowadays the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]) made a children's TV series, ''Tijl Uilenspiegel''.
In 1973 [[Walter van der Kamp]] directed ''Uilenspiegel'', a Dutch film.
[[Rainer Simon]] directed ''Tijl Eulenspiegel'' in 1975, which was an East-German production.
''Ulenspiegel (Legenda o Tile)'', was a 1976 Soviet film, based on De Coster's novel, and directed by [[Aleksandr Alov]] and [[Vladimir Naumov]], "The Legend of Till Ullenspiegel" (1976).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074784/ Legenda o Tile (1979)], [[IMDB]].com&lt;/ref&gt;
The Soviet [[composer]] [[Nikolai Karetnikov]] and his librettist filmmaker [[Pavel Lungin]] adapted De Coster's novel as the [[samizdat]] opera "[[Till Eulenspiegel (Karetnikov opera)|Till Eulenspiegel]]" (1983), which had to be recorded piece-by-piece in secret and received its premiere (1993) only after the Soviet Union collapsed.

[[Michael Rosen]] adapted the story into a 1989 children's novel, illustrated by [[Fritz Wegner]]: ''The Wicked Tricks of Till Owlyglass'', {{ISBN|978-0744513462}}.
In 2003 [[Eberhard Junkersdorf]] adapted the story into a feature-length animated film.
In 2014 [[Christian Theede]] directed the film ''Till Eulenspiegel''.
[[Clive Barker]] incorporated elements of the Till Eulenspiegel story in his play ''Crazyface''.{{year needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kehlmann]] in his novel ''Tyll'' (2017) places Tyll ''Ulenspiegel'' in the context of the [[Thirty Years' War]].

There are three museums in Germany featuring Till Eulenspiegel. One is located in the town of [[Schöppenstedt]] in Lower Saxony, which is nearby his assumed birthplace Kneitlingen. 
The second is located in the supposed place of his death, the city of [[Mölln]] in Schleswig-Holstein, and the third in Bernburg (Saale), Sachsen-Anhalt. In the town of Damme, Belgium, there is also a museum honoring him, and there is a fountain and statue featuring Till Eulenspiegel in the Marktplatz of Magdeburg, capital city of Sachsen-Anhalt.

'''Teresa''' "'''Tracy'''" '''Bond''' (born '''Teresa''' "'''Tracy'''" '''Draco''', and also known as the '''Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo''') is a fictional character and the main [[Bond girl]] in the 1963 [[James Bond]] novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', and its [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|1969 film adaptation]]. She is the only Bond girl to actually marry 007. In the film version, Tracy is played by actress [[Diana Rigg]].

==Biography==
Born Teresa Draco in 1943, she is the only child of Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the [[Union Corse]], a powerful Corsican crime syndicate – not quite as large as [[SPECTRE]], but with substantially larger "legal" operations, including Draco Construction. Teresa goes by "Tracy" because she feels "Teresa" does not suit her (as she introduced herself to Bond, "Teresa is a [[saint]]; I'm known as Tracy").

Tracy's mother died in 1955; her father then sent her to a [[boarding school]] in Switzerland. Deprived of a stable home life, Tracy joined the "international fast set", committing "one scandal after another"; when Draco cut off her allowance, Tracy committed "a greater folly" out of spite. She later married Italian Count Giulio di Vicenzo who, during their marriage, got hold of a large portion of her money before eventually leaving her; he subsequently died while driving a [[Maserati]] in the company of one of his mistresses. During this marriage, Tracy had a child, who later died of [[spinal meningitis]].

[[File:Tracy and James just got married.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. and Mrs. Bond.]]
Desperate with grief for her child, Tracy attempted suicide by walking into the sea in Portugal, only to be saved by James Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/girls/rigg.php3?t=ohmss&amp;s=ohmss |title=MI6 :: The Home Of James Bond 007 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=15 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115101924/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/girls/rigg.php3?t=ohmss&amp;s=ohmss |archivedate=15 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When her father meets Bond, he pleads with Bond to continue to see her, claiming that their relationship had changed her for the better. Bond initially refuses, but he changes his mind when Marc-Ange offers his resources for anything Bond desires. Since the events of ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' and the demise of SPECTRE, Bond had been hunting for [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], and at one point was willing to retire from [[MI6]] because he felt the hunt was folly and that his services and abilities could be used better. Using Draco's resources, however, Bond is able to track Blofeld to [[Switzerland]]. In return, Bond continues to see Tracy and eventually falls in love with her. Tragedy strikes on their wedding day, however, when Blofeld and his henchwoman [[Irma Bunt]] shoot at Bond and Tracy in a [[drive-by shooting]]. Tracy is shot in the head and killed.

In the film, Tracy drives a red 1969 model [[Mercury Cougar]] XR-7 convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_6081-Mercury-Cougar-1969.html |title=1969 Mercury Cougar XR-7 in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service, 1969" |publisher=IMCDb.org |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In Fleming's novels, Bond is a broken man after Tracy's death. In ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', he has begun drinking heavily, which has affected his work; [[M (James Bond)|M]] is forced to acknowledge that he is no longer fit for service. However he decides to give Bond one last chance and assigns him to an intelligence-related diplomatic affair in [[Japan]]. This in turn leads to a duel to the death with Blofeld in the climax of the novel, and Bond is finally awarded his revenge. In the aftermath, however, he is left with [[amnesia]].

In the films, James Bond is tracking Blofeld in the pre-title credits sequence of ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. The film does not explain why nor does it mention Tracy. Originally, it had been planned that ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' would end with Bond and Tracy driving away from their wedding. The scenes where she was shot were filmed at the same time with the intention that they would form the pre-title sequence of ''Diamonds Are Forever''. This was rendered inviable when [[George Lazenby]] left the role.

Subsequent films reference the fact that Bond was previously married, but only fleetingly:

*In ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', when Bond meets [[Anya Amasova]] in the Mujaba Club bar, in [[Cairo]], she recites a few facts about his life to prove that she had researched him. She mentions facts about his career and his relationships, noting that he had "...many lady friends, but married only once. Wife killed..." at which point Bond immediately cuts her off, snapping "All right. You've made your point." Anya comments that he's surprisingly sensitive, to which Bond responds, "About certain things, yes."
[[Image:Tracy Bond gravestone.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The tombstone of James Bond's wife, Teresa, which Bond visits in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. Shown at a James Bond convention in 1992.]]
*In ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', in the pre-titles sequence, Bond lays flowers at Tracy's grave (in an English churchyard) before boarding a [[helicopter]]. An uncredited man in a wheelchair who strokes a white cat (implied to be [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]) has booby-trapped the helicopter. Bond lifts the man's wheelchair with one of the helicopter's skids and drops him (wheelchair and all) down a tall industrial [[smokestack|chimney]]. The headstone clearly reads: "TERESA BOND, 1943–1969, Beloved Wife of JAMES BOND, [[We Have All the Time in the World|We have all the time in the World]]" – referring to the final words in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and the [[Louis Armstrong]] song. Also, the headstone shows Tracy died in 1969, the same year ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' was released.&lt;ref name=thejamesbonddossier&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thejamesbonddossier.com/content/dismissing-the-james-bond-code-name-theory.htm|title=Dismissing The James Bond Code Name Theory |website=thejamesbonddossier ||last=Lyng |first=Eoghan |date=2015 |access-date=2018-02-11 |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*In ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', after [[Felix Leiter]]'s wedding, Felix's new wife Della throws her garter at Bond, teasing him, "the one who catches this is the next one who..." Bond looks visibly pained; when Della asks Felix about it, Felix makes a short, sad reference to Bond once having been married, "but that was a long time ago."
* In ''[[GoldenEye]]'', [[Alec Trevelyan]] tells Bond, "I might as well ask you if all those vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed... or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect."
*In ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', Elektra King asks Bond if he's "ever lost a loved one." Bond pauses and brushes off the question.

==Movie props==
Tracy's [[wedding dress]] is now kept at the Admiral Hotel in [[Milan]], along with a big collection of ''[[James Bond]]'' and ''[[Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang]]'' items.
