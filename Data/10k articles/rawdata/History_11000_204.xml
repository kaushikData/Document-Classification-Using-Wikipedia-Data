[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|250px|Gergio Deluci, ''[[Christopher Columbus]] Arrives in America in 1492,'' 1893 painting.]]
The '''15th century''' was the [[century]] which spans the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] years [[1401]] to [[1500]].

In '''[[History of Europe|Europe]]''', the 15th century is seen as the bridge between the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Early Renaissance]], and the [[Early modern period]]. 
Many technological, social and cultural developments of the 15th century can in retrospect be seen as heralding the "[[European miracle]]" of the following centuries. In religious history, the Roman [[Papacy]] was split in two parts in Europe for decades (the so-called [[Western Schism]]), until the [[Council of Constance]]. The division of the Catholic Church and the unrest associated with the [[Hussite]] movement would become factors in the rise of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the following century.

[[Constantinople]], in what is today [[Turkey]], then the capital of the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Fall of Constantinople|falls]] to the emerging Muslim [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], marking the end of the tremendously influential Byzantine Empire and, for some historians, the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Crowley |title=Constantinople: The Last Great Siege, 1453 |publisher=Faber |year=2006 |isbn=0-571-22185-8 }} (reviewed by {{cite web |first=Charles |last=Foster |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155920054.html |title=The Conquestof Constantinople and the end of empire |work=Contemporary Review |date=22 September 2006 |quote= It is the end of the Middle Ages |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822080420/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155920054.html |archivedate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event forced Western Europeans to find a new trade route,  adding further momentum to what was the beginning of the [[Age of Discovery]],  which would lead to the global mapping of the world. Explorations by the  [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)|Portuguese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Spanish]] led to European sightings of the [[Americas]] (the [[New World]]) and the sea passage along [[Cape of Good Hope]] to India, in the last decade of the century. These expeditions ushered in the era of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires.

The fall of Constantinople led to the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy, while [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of the mechanical [[movable type]] began the [[Printing Press]]. These two events played key roles in the development of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish [[Reconquista]] leads to the final fall of the [[Emirate of Granada]] by the end of the century, ending over seven centuries of Muslim rule and returning Spain back to Christian rulers.

The [[Hundred Years' War]] end with a decisive [[Kingdom of France|French]] victory over the [[Kingdom of England|English]] in the [[Battle of Castillon]]. Financial troubles in England following the conflict results in the [[Wars of the Roses]], a series of dynastic wars for the throne of England. The conflicts end with the defeat of [[Richard III]] by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], establishing the [[House of Tudor|Tudor dynasty]] in the later part of the century.

In '''[[History of Asia|Asia]]''', under the rule of the [[Yongle Emperor]], who built the [[Forbidden City]] and commanded [[Zheng He]] to [[Treasure voyages|explore the world overseas]], the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s territory reached its pinnacle. 
[[Tamerlane]] established a major empire in the Middle East and Central Asia, in order to revive the [[Mongol Empire]].

In '''[[History of Africa|Africa]]''', the [[Muslim conquest of the Sudan|spread of Islam]] leads to the destruction of the Christian kingdoms of [[Nubia]], by the end of the century leaving only [[Alodia]] (which was to collapse in 1504). The formerly vast [[Mali Empire]] teeters on the brink of collapse, under pressure from the rising [[Songhai Empire]].

In the '''[[Pre-Columbian era|Americas]]''', both the [[Inca Empire]] and the [[Aztec Empire]] reach the peak of their influence.

'''Alf Lüdtke''' (born 18 October 1943 in [[Dresden]]) (also '''Alf Luedtke''') is a historian and a leading German representative of the history of everyday life (''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' in German). He says his main fields of interest and research include work as a social practice, the connection of production and destruction through "work", forms of taking part and acquiescing in European dictatorships in the 20th century, and remembering and memorialising forms of dealing with war and genocide in the modern era.

==Life==

Together with [[Hans Medick]], Alf Lüdtke can be considered a founder of ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'', a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s.

Lüdtke studied history along with sociology and philosophy in [[Tübingen]] (1965-1972, MA 1974). In 1980 he obtained his doctorate at the [[University of Konstanz]]. Lüdtke's dissertation ''Gemeinwohl, Polizei und Festungspraxis'' analysed governmental violence practices of [[Prussia]] in the early 19th century. One of his articles, "The Role of State Violence in the Period of Transition to Industrial Capitalism: The Example of Prussia from 1815 to 1848", was published in ''Social History'' in 1979. His article describes the idea that state violence under the [[feudal]] system was necessary to create a control amongst the Prussian working class in order to prepare them for the different structure of [[capitalism|capitalist]] society. Lüdtke was interested in how the growth of state and the growth of capitalism related to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Lüdtke, Alf. "The Role of State Violence in the Period of Transition to Industrial Capitalism: The Example of Prussia from 1815 to 1848", ''Social History'' 4 (1979): 175-221 (JSTOR).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he attained his habilitation in the fields Modern History (''Neuere Geschichte'') and Contemporary History (''Zeitgeschichte'') at the faculty of the humanities and social science of the [[University of Hannover]], where he subsequently taught history from 1989 to 1999. In 1995 he was appointed extraordinary professor in Hannover and in 1999 professor at the [[University of Erfurt]]. In Erfurt, Lüdtke is honorary professor for historical anthropology since 2008.
Since 1975 Lüdtke worked at the [[Max Planck Institute for History]] in Göttingen. In 1999 Alf Lüdtke and Hans Medick founded the ''Arbeitsstelle für Historische Anthropologie'' of the Max Planck Institute for History at the University of Erfurt.

Since the 1980s, Lüdtke has kept regular contacts in France and the USA, among other things through the International Round Table of History and Anthropology. Since the beginning of the 1990s he regularly was guest professor at the historical seminar at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. At the end of the 1990s first contacts with South Korea developed, which evolved into regular scholarly exchanges. Beginning in 2005, Lüdtke took part in the conferences on Mass Dictatorship at the [[Research Institute on Comparative Culture and History]] (RICH) in Seoul. From November 2008 to August 2013 he did seminars and workshops in South Korea as part of the "World Class University" program of the Korean National Research Foundation.

Since 2011 Lüdtke has been a member of the work group ''Erfurter RaumZeit-Forschun'', since 2014 he is a fellow at the ''Internationales Geisteswissenschaftliches Kolleg'' "Work and Life Cycle in Global Perspective" at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

Lüdtke is the founder and editor of the journal ''[[Sozialwissenschaftliche Informationen]]'', as well as co-founder and co-editor of the journals ''[[Werkstatt Geschichte]]'' and ''[[Historische Anthropologie. Kultur – Gesellschaft – Alltag]]''.

Lüdtke combined issues of sociology, ethnology and anthropology with those of history. Especially through his research on the life worlds of industrial workers and so-called "ordinary" people, he gave impetuses to German and international historical science. His recent research projects include ''Blockings and Passages: the Grenzübergangsstellen of the GDR'', war as work, and the recent state of transnational [[historiography]].

Alina is a [[Point-of-sale malware|Point of Sale Malware]] or POS RAM Scraper that is used by cybercriminals to scrape [[credit card]] and [[debit card]] information from the [[point of sale]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Alina-POS-malware--sparks--off-a-new-variant/ Alina POS malware "sparks" off a new variant]&lt;/ref&gt; It first started to scrape information in late 2012. It resembles JackPOS Malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityweek.com/researchers-id-new-variant-alina-pos-malware New Variant of Alina PoS Malware]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.hpe.com/t5/Security-Research/Alina-POS-Malware/ba-p/6385271#.V2qUC_l96Uk Alina POS Malware]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of Alina POS RAM Scraper==
Once executed, it gets installed on the user's [[computer]] and checks for updates. If an update is found, it removes the existing Alina code and installs the latest version. Then, for new installations, it adds the [[file path]] to an AutoStart runkey to maintain persistence. Finally, it adds java.exe to the %APPDATA% directory and executes it using the parameter &lt;code&gt;alina=&lt;path_to_executable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for new installations or, &lt;code&gt;update=&lt;orig_exe&gt;;&lt;new_exe&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-pos-ram-scraper-malware.pdf PoS RAM Scraper Malware: Past, Present, and Future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sisainfosec.com/2015/07/pos-malware-stealth-tool-to-steal.html PoS RAM Scraper Malware Mechanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Alina inspects the user's processes with the help of Windows API calls:
* '''CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()''' takes a snapshot of all running processes
* '''Process32First()/Process32Next()''' retrieve the track 1 and track 2 information in the process memory
Alina maintains a [[Blacklisting|blacklist]] of processes, if there is no process information in the blacklist it uses '''OpenProcess()''' to read and process the contents in the memory dump. Once the data is scraped Alina sends it to C&amp;C servers using an [[POST (HTTP)| HTTP POST]] command that is hardcoded in binary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Alina--Casting-a-Shadow-on-POS/ Alina: Casting a Shadow on POS]&lt;/ref&gt;

}} ({{lang-bn|মুক্তিযুদ্ধ}} ''{{transl|bn|Muktijuddho}}''), also known as the '''Bangladesh War of Independence''', or simply the '''Liberation War''' in Bangladesh, was a revolution and [[War|armed conflict]] sparked by the rise of the [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] and [[self-determination]] movement in what was then [[East Pakistan]] during the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. It resulted in the independence of the [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]]. The war began after the [[Pakistan]]i [[Military dictatorship|military junta]] based in [[West Pakistan]] launched [[Operation Searchlight]] against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, [[intelligentsia]], religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 elections]] and arrested [[Prime minister-designate]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]. The war ended on 16 December 1971 after West Pakistan surrendered.

Rural and urban areas across East Pakistan saw extensive military operations and air strikes to suppress the tide of [[civil disobedience]] that formed following the 1970 election stalemate. The [[Pakistan Army]], which had the backing of Islamists, created radical religious militias – the [[Razakar (Pakistan)|Razakars]], [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]] and [[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)|Al-Shams]] – to assist it during raids on the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQHIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The World's Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs|last=Schneider|first=B.|last2=Post|first2=J.|last3=Kindt|first3=M.|date=20 July 2009|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230623293|location=|pages=57|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsrfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pakistan: From the Rhetoric of Democracy to the Rise of Militancy|last=Kalia|first=Ravi|date=21 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136516412|location=|pages=168|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pg 600.

Members of the Pakistani military and supporting militias engaged in mass murder, deportation and [[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War|genocidal rape]]. The capital [[Dhaka]] was the scene of numerous massacres, including the [[Operation Searchlight]] and [[1971 Dhaka University massacre|Dhaka University massacre]]. An estimated 10 million Bengali [[refugee]]s fled to neighboring India, while 30 million were internally displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Genocide: A-L|last=Totten|first=Samuel|last2=Bartrop|first2=Paul Robert|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9780313346422|location=|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sectarian violence]] broke out between Bengalis and [[Persecution of Biharis in Bangladesh|Urdu-speaking immigrants]]. An academic consensus prevails that the atrocities committed by the Pakistani military were a [[genocide]].

The [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence]] was proclaimed from [[Chittagong]] by members of the [[Mukti Bahini]] – the national liberation army formed by Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians. The [[East Bengal Regiment]] and the [[Border Guards Bangladesh|East Pakistan Rifles]] played a crucial role in the resistance. Led by [[M. A. G. Osmani|General M. A. G. Osmani]] and [[List of sectors in the Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sector commanders]], the [[Mukti Bahini|Bangladesh Forces]] waged a mass [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the Pakistani military. They liberated numerous towns and cities in the initial months of the conflict. The Pakistan Army regained momentum in the [[monsoon]]. Bengali guerrillas carried out widespread sabotage, including [[Operation Jackpot]] against the Pakistan Navy. The nascent [[Bangladesh Air Force]] flew [[sortie]]s against Pakistani military bases. By November, the Bangladesh forces restricted the Pakistani military to its barracks during the night. They secured control of most parts of the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamal|first=Ahmed|date=5–17 October 2008|title=Mukti Bahini and the liberation war of Bangladesh: A review of conflicting views|url=http://www.cdrb.org/journal/2008/4/1.pdf|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=30|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was formed on 17 April 1971 in [[Mujibnagar]] and moved to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] as a [[government in exile]]. Bengali members of the Pakistani civil, military and [[diplomatic corps]] defected to the Bangladeshi provisional government. Thousands of Bengali families were [[Internment|interned]] in West Pakistan, from where many escaped to [[Afghanistan]]. Bengali cultural activists operated the clandestine [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra|Free Bengal Radio Station]]. The plight of millions of war-ravaged Bengali civilians caused worldwide outrage and alarm. The Indian state led by [[Indira Gandhi]] provided substantial diplomatic, economic and military support to Bangladeshi nationalists. British, Indian and American musicians organised the [[The Concert for Bangladesh|world's first benefit concert]] in New York City to support the Bangladeshi people. [[Ted Kennedy|Senator Ted Kennedy]] in the United States led a congressional campaign for an end to Pakistani military persecution; while US diplomats in East Pakistan strongly [[Archer Blood#The Blood telegram|dissented]] with the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]'s close ties to the Pakistani military dictator [[Yahya Khan]].

India joined the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched [[Operation Chengiz Khan|preemptive air strikes]] on North India. The subsequent [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani War]] witnessed engagements on two war fronts. With [[air supremacy]] achieved in the eastern theatre and the rapid advance of the [[Mitro Bahini Order of Battle December 1971|Allied Forces]] of Bangladesh and India, Pakistan [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender|surrendered]] in Dacca on 16 December 1971.

The war changed the geopolitical landscape of [[South Asia]], with the emergence of Bangladesh as the seventh-most populous country in the world. Due to complex regional alliances, the war was a major episode in [[Cold War]] tensions involving the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The majority of member states in the United Nations recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign nation in 1972.

[[File:India religion map 1909 en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of the [[British Raj]] in 1909 showing [[Muslim]] majority areas in green, including modern-day Bangladesh in the east and Pakistan in the west.]]

Prior to the [[Partition of India|Partition of British India]], the [[Lahore Resolution]] initially envisaged separate [[Muslim]]-majority states in the eastern and northwestern zones of British India. A proposal for an independent [[United Bengal]] was mooted by Prime Minister [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] in 1946, but was opposed by the colonial authorities. The [[East Pakistan Renaissance Society]] advocated the creation of a [[sovereign state]] in eastern British India. Eventually, political negotiations led, in August 1947, to [[Partition of India|the official birth of two states]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=78xTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6DgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1738,3655&amp;dq=india+partition&amp;hl=en|title=The Leader-Post - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving presumably permanent homes for Muslims and Hindus respectively following the departure of the British.

=== Language controversy ===
{{main|Bengali language movement}}
[[File:Shaheed minar Roehl.jpg|thumb|Language movement memorial]]

In 1948, [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] declared that "[[Urdu]], and only Urdu" would be the federal language of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement|title=Language Movement - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=11 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033428/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BKzbHnFTfEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sociolinguistics and Language Education|last=Hornberger|first=Nancy H.|last2=McKay|first2=Sandra Lee|date=17 June 2010|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=|isbn=9781847694010|location=|pages=158|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Urdu was historically prevalent only in the north, central, and western region of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]]; whereas in East Bengal, the native language was [[Bengali language|Bengali]], one of the two most easterly branches of the [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/languagecentre/languages/bengali/|title=SOAS Language Centre - Bengali Language Courses|work=soas.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengali-speaking people of Pakistan constituted over 30% of the country's population. The government stand was widely viewed as an attempt to suppress the culture of the eastern wing. The people of East Bengal demanded that their language be given federal status alongside Urdu and English. The [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] began in 1948, as civil society protested the removal of the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] from currency and stamps, which were in place since the [[British Raj]]. The movement reached its climax in 1952, when on [[Language Movement Day|21 February]], the police fired on protesting students and civilians, causing several deaths. The day is revered in Bangladesh as the [[Language Movement Day]]. Later, in memory of the deaths in 1952, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]] in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Mother Language Day|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/motherlanguageday/|website = www.un.org|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disparities ===
Although East Pakistan had a larger population, West Pakistan dominated the divided country politically and received more money from the common budget.

Bengalis were under-represented in the Pakistan military. Officers of Bengali origin in the different wings of the armed forces made up just 5% of overall force by 1965; of these, only a few were in command positions, with the majority in technical or administrative posts.&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bd0139) |title=Library of Congress studies |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date=1 July 1947 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Pakistanis believed that Bengalis were not "martially inclined" unlike [[Pashtuns]] and [[Punjabis]]; the "[[Martial race]]s" notion was dismissed as ridiculous and humiliating by Bengalis.&lt;ref name="Library" /&gt; Moreover, despite huge defence spending, East Pakistan received none of the benefits, such as contracts, purchasing and military support jobs. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] over [[Kashmir]] also highlighted the sense of military insecurity among Bengalis, as only an under-strength [[infantry]] division and 15 [[Military aircraft#Combat aircraft|combat aircraft]] without tank support were in East Pakistan to thwart any Indian retaliations during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2002/dec/demons.htm |title=Demons of December – Road from East Pakistan to Bangladesh |publisher=Defencejournal.com |accessdate=23 June 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609122558/http://www.defencejournal.com/2002/dec/demons.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rounaq Jahan]] | title=Pakistan: Failure in National Integration | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=1972 | isbn=0-231-03625-6}} Pg 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious and cultural differences ===
The only common bond between the two Pakistani wings was religion. But there were differences even in religious practices. Bengali Muslims tended to be less conservative in religious zeal, and had come to accept their Hindu minority and neighbours despite some communal clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icj.org/the-events-in-east-pakistan-1971-a-legal-study/|title=The events in East Pakistan, 1971: a legal study|last=|first=|date=|website=ICJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Bengali Muslims strongly objected to the Islamist paradigm imposed by the Pakistani state.&lt;ref name="Haqqani2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYppZ_dEjdIC&amp;pg=PA19|title=Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military|date=10 March 2010|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|isbn=978-0-87003-285-1|pages=19–|author=Husain Haqqani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most members of West Pakistan's ruling elite also belonged to a liberal society, yet understood a common faith as the mobilising factor behind Pakistan's creation and the subsuming of Pakistan's multiple identities into one.&lt;ref name="Haqqani2010"/&gt;

Cultural and linguistic differences between the two wings outweighed any religious unity. The Bengalis were very proud of their culture and language which, with its Eastern [[Nagari]] script and [[Pali]] vocabulary, was unacceptable to the West Pakistani elite, who considered it to smack of Hindu culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gK3d627xESAC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Military Intervention and Secession in South Asia: The Cases of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Kashmir, and Punjab|last=Anne Noronha dos Santos|first=|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bangladeshi liberation struggle against Pakistan was led by secular leaders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsrfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pakistan: From the Rhetoric of Democracy to the Rise of Militancy|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this reality and the feeling of Islamic solidarity in the background, Islamists in East Pakistan viewed Bengali nationalism as unacceptable and instead sided with the Pakistani Army's efforts to crush the Bengali independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach17.pdf|title=Religious Extremism and Nationalism in Bangladesh|last=LINTNER|first=BERTIL|date=2004|website=|page=418|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secularists hailed the Bangladeshi victory as the triumph of secular Bengali nationalism over religion-centred Pakistani nationalism.&lt;ref name="RiazRahman2016"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shantanu Majumder |year=2016 |chapter=Securalism and Anti-Secularism |editor1=Ali Riaz |editor2=Mohammad Sajjadur Rahman |title=Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC9-CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |publisher=Routledge |page=46 |isbn=978-1-317-30877-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the politically-active [[ulama]] of East Pakistan either remained neutral or sided with the Pakistani state, since they perceived the break-up of Pakistan as a loss for Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmed1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ishtiaq Ahmed|title=State, Nation and Ethnicity in Contemporary South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czSm7cmhgA0C&amp;pg=PA223|year=1998|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-85567-578-0|pages=223–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political differences ===
Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country's population,&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political System of Pakistan
|first=Khalid B.|last=Sayeed|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1967|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; political power remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment came up with the "[[One Unit]]" scheme, where all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was solely to counterbalance the East wing's votes.

After the assassination of [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], Pakistan's first prime minister, in 1951, political power began to devolve to the new [[President of Pakistan]], which replaced the office of [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor General]] when Pakistan became a republic, and, eventually, the military. The nominal elected chief executive, the Prime Minister, was frequently sacked by the establishment, acting through the President.

The East Pakistanis observed that the West Pakistani establishment would swiftly depose any East Pakistanis elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, such as [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], [[Mohammad Ali Bogra]], or [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]]. Their suspicions were further aggravated by the military dictatorships of [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] (27 October 1958 – 25 March 1969) and [[Yahya Khan]] (25 March 1969 – 20 December 1971), both West Pakistanis. The situation reached a climax in 1970, when the [[Bangladesh Awami League]], the largest East Pakistani political party, led by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], won a landslide victory in the national elections. The party won 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan, and thus a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly. This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government. However, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] (a former Foreign Minister), the leader of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], refused to allow Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Hassan 2000 p. 393"&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposed the idea of having two Prime Ministers, one for each wing. The proposal elicited outrage in the east wing, already chafing under the other constitutional innovation, the "One Unit scheme". Bhutto also refused to accept Rahman's [[Six point movement|Six Points]]. On 3 March 1971, the two leaders of the two wings along with the President General Yahya Khan met in [[Dhaka|Dacca]] to decide the fate of the country. After their discussions yielded no satisfactory results, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a nationwide strike. Bhutto feared a civil war, therefore, he sent his trusted companion, [[Mubashir Hassan]].&lt;ref name="Hassan 2000 p. 393" /&gt; A message was conveyed, and Rahman decided to meet Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Hassan 2000 p. 393" /&gt; Upon his arrival, Rahman met with Bhutto and both agreed to form a coalition government with Rahman as Premier and Bhutto as President.&lt;ref name="Hassan 2000 p. 393" /&gt; However, the military was unaware of these developments, and Bhutto increased his pressure on Rahman to reach a decision.&lt;ref name="Hassan 2000 p. 393" /&gt;

On 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (soon to be the prime minister) delivered a speech at the Racecourse Ground (now called the [[Suhrawardy Udyan]]). In this speech he mentioned a further four-point condition to consider at the National Assembly Meeting on 25 March:
* The immediate lifting of [[martial law]].
* Immediate withdrawal of all military personnel to their barracks.
* An inquiry into the loss of life.
* Immediate transfer of power to the elected representative of the people before the assembly meeting 25 March.

He urged his people to turn every house into a fort of resistance. He closed his speech saying, "Our struggle is for our freedom. Our struggle is for our independence." This speech is considered the main event that inspired the nation to fight for its independence. General [[Tikka Khan]] was flown into Dacca to become Governor of East Bengal. East-Pakistani judges, including Justice Siddique, refused to swear him in.

Between 10 and 13 March, [[Pakistan International Airlines]] cancelled all their international routes to urgently fly "government passengers" to Dacca. These "government passengers" were almost all Pakistani soldiers in civilian dress. MV ''Swat'', a ship of the Pakistan Navy carrying ammunition and soldiers, was harboured in [[Chittagong]] Port, but the Bengali workers and sailors at the port refused to unload the ship. A unit of [[Border Guards Bangladesh|East Pakistan Rifles]] refused to obey commands to fire on the Bengali demonstrators, beginning a mutiny among the Bengali soldiers.

=== Response to the 1970 cyclone ===

The [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] made [[landfall]] on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of 12 November, around the same time as a local [[Tide|high tide]],&lt;ref name="IMD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cd024_pdf/005ED281.pdf#page=10|title=Annual Summary – Storms &amp; Depressions|work=India Weather Review 1970|author=[[India Meteorological Department]]|year=1970|accessdate=15 April 2007|format=PDF|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people. Though the exact death toll is not known, it is considered the deadliest [[tropical cyclone]] on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ag127e/ag127e07.htm |title= Thematic paper: Role of forests and trees in protecting coastal areas against cyclones |last=Fritz |first=Hermann M. |last2=Blount |first2=Chris |work=Coastal protection in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami: What role for forests and trees? |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129050856/http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ag127e/AG127E07.htm |archivedate=29 November 2014 |accessdate=27 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the landfall, President Khan conceded that his government had made "slips" and "mistakes" in its handling of the relief efforts due to a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster.&lt;ref name="NYT-6"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yahya Condedes 'Slips' In Relief|first=Sydney|last=Schanberg|authorlink=Sydney Schanberg|work=The New York Times|date=22 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement released by eleven political leaders in East Pakistan ten days after the cyclone hit charged the government with "gross neglect, callous and utter indifference". They also accused the president of playing down the magnitude of the problem in news coverage.&lt;ref name="NYT-10"&gt;{{cite news|title=East Pakistani Leaders Assail Yahya on Cyclone Relief|author=Staff writer|agency=Reuters |work=The New York Times|date=23 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November, students held a march in Dacca protesting the slowness of the government's response.&lt;ref name="NYT-13"&gt;{{cite news|title=Copter Shortage Balks Cyclone Aid|author=Staff writer|work=The New York Times|date=18 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]] addressed a rally of 50,000 people on 24 November, where he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation.

As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March, the Dacca offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a [[general strike]] and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]]. With this increase in tension, foreign personnel were evacuated over fears of violence. Relief work continued in the field, but long-term planning was curtailed.&lt;ref name="NYT-12"&gt;{{cite news |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=11 March 1971 |title=Pakistanis Crisis Virtually Halts Rehabilitation Work in Cyclone Region |newspaper=The New York Times |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict widened into the Bangladesh Liberation War in December and concluded with the creation of Bangladesh.

=== Operation Searchlight ===
{{main|Operation Searchlight}}
[[File:March71.PNG|thumb|Location of Bengali and Pakistani military units during [[Operation Searchlight]], March 1971]]

A planned military pacification carried out by the [[Pakistan Army]] – codenamed ''Operation Searchlight'' – started on 25 March 1971 to curb the [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali]] independence movement&lt;ref name="epw"/&gt; by taking control of the major cities on 26 March, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military,&lt;ref&gt;Salik, Siddiq, ''Witness To Surrender'', pp 63, 228–9 {{ISBN|984-05-1373-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; within one month. The Pakistani state claimed to justify starting Operation Searchlight on the basis of [[Persecution of Biharis in Bangladesh|anti-Bihari violence]] by Bengalis in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nationbuilding, Gender and War Crimes in South Asia|last=D' Costa|first=Bina|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415565660|location=|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the beginning of the operation, all foreign journalists were systematically deported from East Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siddiqui  |first=Asif |date=December 1997 |title=From Deterrence and Coercive Diplomacy to War: The 1971 Crisis in South Asia |journal=Journal of International and Area Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–92 |jstor=43106996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also began the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. These systematic killings served only to enrage the Bengalis, which ultimately resulted in the secession of East Pakistan later in the same year. Bangladeshi media and reference books in English have published casualty figures which vary greatly, from 5,000–35,000 in Dacca, and 200,000–3,000,000 for Bangladesh as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c1m.htm#Bangladesh|title=Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls|website=necrometrics.com|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although independent researchers, including the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]], have put forward the figure ranging from between 125,000 and 505,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergman|first1=David|title=Questioning an iconic number|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/questioning-an-iconic-number/article5940833.ece|accessdate=28 September 2016|agency=The Hindu|issue=1|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Rudolph Rummel]] puts total deaths at 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rummel | first1 = Rudolph | authorlink1 = Rudolph Rummel | title = Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder since 1900 | chapter = Chapter 8: Statistics of Pakistan's Democide Estimates, Calculations, And Sources | page = 544 | isbn = 978-3-8258-4010-5 | quote = "...They also planned to indiscriminately murder hundreds of thousands of its Hindus and drive the rest into India. ...

According to the ''Asia Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GF23Df04.html|work=Asia Times Online|title=Indians are bastards anyway|last=Debasish Roy Chowdhury|date=23 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At a meeting of the military top brass, Yahya Khan declared: "Kill 3 million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands." Accordingly, on the night of 25 March, the Pakistani Army launched ''Operation Searchlight'' to "crush" Bengali resistance in which Bengali members of military services were disarmed and killed, students and the intelligentsia systematically liquidated and able-bodied Bengali males just picked up and gunned down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the violence focused on the provincial capital, Dacca, it also affected all parts of East Pakistan. Residential halls of the [[University of Dhaka|University of Dacca]] were particularly targeted. The only Hindu residential hall – [[Jagannath Hall]] – was destroyed by the Pakistani armed forces, and an estimated 600 to 700 of its residents were murdered. The Pakistani army denied any cold blooded killings at the university, though the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]] in Pakistan concluded that overwhelming force was used at the university. This fact, and the massacre at Jagannath Hall and nearby student dormitories of Dacca University, are corroborated by a videotape secretly filmed by Professor Nurul Ula of the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology|East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology]], whose residence was directly opposite the student dormitories.&lt;ref name="nurullah"&gt;{{cite book

The scale of the atrocities was first made clear in the West when [[Anthony Mascarenhas]], a Pakistani journalist who had been sent to the province by the military authorities to write a story favourable to Pakistan's actions, instead fled to the United Kingdom and, on 13 June 1971, published an article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' describing the systematic killings by the military. The [[BBC]] wrote: "There is little doubt that Mascarenhas' reportage played its part in ending the war. It helped turn world opinion against Pakistan and encouraged India to play a decisive role", with Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] herself stating that Mascarenhas' article has led her "to prepare the ground for India's armed intervention".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16207201|title=Bangladesh war: The article that changed history – Asia |publisher=BBC |date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu areas suffered particularly heavy blows. By midnight, Dacca was burning, especially the Hindu-dominated eastern part of the city. ''Time'' magazine reported on 2 August 1971, "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Pakistani military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=2105&amp;Itemid=524 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109145345/http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=2105&amp;Itemid=524 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 November 2013 | title=The Hindu genocide that Hindus and the world forgot | publisher=[[India Tribune]] | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested by the Pakistani Army. Yahya Khan appointed Brigadier (later General) [[Rahimuddin Khan]] to preside over a special tribunal prosecuting Rahman with multiple charges. The tribunal's sentence was never made public, but Yahya caused the verdict to be held in abeyance in any case. Other Awami League leaders were arrested as well, while a few fled Dacca to avoid arrest. The Awami League was banned by General Yahya Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/651231/Agha-Mohammad-Yahya-Khan |title=Encyclopædia Britannica – Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=23 June 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604051235/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/651231/Agha-Mohammad-Yahya-Khan| archivedate= 4 June 2011 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Declaration of independence ===
{{see also|Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|7th March Speech of Bangabandhu}}
[[File:Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|Following the Pakistan Army's brutal [[Operation Searchlight]] on 25 March 1971, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] declared the [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|Independence of Bangladesh]] and called for nationwide resistance on 26 March midnight, which led the Bangladesh Liberation War to officially start within hours.]]

The violence unleashed by the Pakistani forces on 25 March 1971 proved the last straw to the efforts to negotiate a settlement. Following these outrages, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signed an official declaration that read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today Bangladesh is a sovereign and independent country. On Thursday night, West Pakistani armed forces suddenly attacked the police barracks at Razarbagh and the EPR headquarters at Pilkhana in Dacca. Many innocent and unarmed have been killed in Dhaka city and other places of Bangladesh. Violent clashes between E.P.R. and Police on the one hand and the armed forces of Pakistan on the other, are going on. The Bengalis are fighting the enemy with great courage for an independent Bangladesh. May Allah aid us in our fight for freedom. Joy Bangla [May Bangladesh be victorious].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sheikh Mujib also called upon the people to resist the occupation forces through a radio message. Rahman was arrested on the night of 25–26 March 1971 at about 1:30&amp;nbsp;am (as per Radio Pakistan's news on 29 March 1971).

[[File:1971 BDLib poster.jpg|thumb|upright|An iconic poster by [[Quamrul Hassan]] on [[General Yahya Khan]], representing the Pakistani military junta as demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Afreen Mallick|first1=Sadya|title='Potua' and freedom's colours|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=119256|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A telegram containing the text of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration reached some students in [[Chittagong]]. The message was translated to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] by Dr. Manjula Anwar. The students failed to secure permission from higher authorities to broadcast the message from the nearby Agrabad Station of [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]]. However, the message was read several times by the independent Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro Radio established by some rebel Bangali Radio workers in Kalurghat. Major Ziaur Rahman was requested to provide security of the station and he also read the Declaration on 27 March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.bdnews24.com/?p=2769|title=arts.bdnews24.com " সংযোজনস্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা: বেলাল মোহাম্মদের সাক্ষাৎকার|work=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Ziaur Rahman]] broadcast announcement of the declaration of independence on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, at the direction of Bangobondhu Mujibur Rahman, hereby declare that Independent People's Republic of Bangladesh has been established. At his direction, I have taken the command as the temporary Head of the Republic. In the name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, I call upon all Bengalees to rise against the attack by the West Pakistani Army. We shall fight to the last to free our motherland.

The [[Kalurghat]] Radio Station's transmission capability was limited, but the message was picked up by a Japanese ship in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. It was then re-transmitted by [[Radio Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DedtAAAAMAAJ|title=History of freedom movement in Bangladesh, 1943-1973: some involvement|last=Gupta|first=Jyoti Sen|date=1974|publisher=Naya Prokash|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=325–326|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]].

[[M. A. Hannan]], an Awami League leader from Chittagong, is said to have made the first announcement of the declaration of independence over the radio on 26 March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/declaration.html |title=History : The Declaration of Independence |website=Virtual Bangladesh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901035519/http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/declaration.html |archive-date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

26 March 1971 is considered the official [[Independence Day (Bangladesh)|Independence Day of Bangladesh]], and the name Bangladesh was in effect henceforth. In July 1971, Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] openly referred to the former East Pakistan as Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0876091990&amp;id=srCLD-PXl-gC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=Z-Ms05pjX5&amp;dq=pakistan+army&amp;as_brr=1&amp;sig=yGuwg89UCjmVOaa0w0gpvg2IWo8#PPA37, M1 India, Pakistan, and the United States: Breaking with the Past By Shirin R.

== Liberation war ==
{{main|Mukti Bahini|Timeline of the Bangladesh Liberation War}}

=== March–June ===
At first, resistance was spontaneous and disorganised, and was not expected to be prolonged.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan Defence Journal, 1977, Vol 2, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Pakistani Army cracked down upon the population, resistance grew. The [[Mukti Bahini]] became increasingly active. The Pakistani military sought to quell them, but increasing numbers of Bengali soldiers defected to this underground "Bangladesh army". These Bengali units slowly merged into the Mukti Bahini and bolstered their weaponry with supplies from India. Pakistan responded by airlifting in two infantry divisions and reorganising their forces. They also raised paramilitary forces of [[Razakar (Pakistan)|Razakars]], [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badrs]] and [[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)|Al-Shams]] (who were mostly members of the Muslim League and other Islamist groups), as well as other Bengalis who opposed independence, and [[Bihar]]i Muslims who had settled during the time of [[Partition of India|partition]].

On 17 April 1971, a provisional government was formed in [[Meherpur District]] in western Bangladesh bordering India with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was in prison in Pakistan, as President, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] as Acting President, [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] as Prime Minister, and General [[M. A. G. Osmani|Muhammad Ataul Ghani Osmani]] as Commander-in-Chief, Bangladesh Forces. As fighting grew between the occupation army and the Bengali Mukti Bahini, an estimated 10 million Bengalis sought refuge in the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm |title=Bangladesh |publisher=State.gov |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622143445/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm| archivedate= 22 June 2011 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June–September ===
{{see also|List of sectors in the Bangladesh Liberation War|Military plans of the Bangladesh Liberation War}}
[[File:Sectors of Bangladesh Liberation War.svg|thumb|[[List of sectors in the Bangladesh Liberation War|The eleven sectors]] during the Bangladesh Liberation War]]
[[File:George Harrison - Bangla Desh.png|thumb|Advertisement for former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]'s "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]" single, released in July 1971 to raise international awareness and funds for the millions of Bangladeshi refugees.]]

Bangladesh forces command was set up on 11 July, with Col. [[M. A. G. Osmani]] as commander-in-chief (C-in-C) with the status of Cabinet Minister, Lt. Col., Abdur Rabb as chief of Staff (COS), Group Captain A K Khandker as Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) and Major A R Chowdhury as Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS).

General Osmani had differences of opinion with the Indian leadership regarding the role of the Mukti Bahini in the conflict. Indian leadership initially envisioned Bengali forces to be trained into a small elite guerrilla force of 8,000 members, led by the surviving [[East Bengal Regiment]] soldiers operating in small cells around Bangladesh to facilitate the eventual Indian intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; but with the Bangladesh government in exile, General Osmani favoured a different strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, ''Surrender at Dacca'', pp 42–44, pp 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Moyeedul, Muldhara’ 71, pp 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bengali conventional forces would occupy lodgment areas inside Bangladesh and then the Bangladesh government would request international [[diplomatic recognition]] and intervention. Initially [[Mymensingh]] was picked for this operation, but Gen. Osmani later settled on Sylhet.
* Sending the maximum number to guerrillas inside Bangladesh as soon as possible with the following objectives:&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Major Rafiqul, ''A Tale of Millions'', pp. 227, 235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., ''Bangladesh at War'', pp 161–163&lt;/ref&gt;
** Increasing Pakistani casualties through raids and ambush.
** Cripple economic activity by hitting power stations, railway lines, storage depots and communication networks.
** Destroy Pakistan army mobility by blowing up bridges/culverts, fuel depots, trains and river crafts.
** The strategic objective was to make the Pakistanis spread their forces inside the province, so attacks could be made on isolated Pakistani detachments.

Bangladesh was divided into [[List of sectors in the Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sectors]] in July,&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Major Rafiqul, ''A Tale of Millions'', pp. 226–231&lt;/ref&gt; each with a commander chosen from defected officers of the Pakistani army who joined the [[Mukti Bahini]] to conduct guerrilla operations and train fighters. Most of their training camps were situated near the border area and were operated with assistance from India. The 10th Sector was directly placed under the Commander in Chief (C-in-C) General M. A. G. Osmani and included the Naval Commandos and C-in-C's special force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberationwarmuseumbd.org/history/#blaf |title=Bangladesh Liberation Armed Force |website=Liberation War Museum, Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three brigades (11 Battalions) were raised for conventional warfare; a large guerrilla force (estimated at 100,000) was trained.&lt;ref&gt;Raja, Dewan Mohammad Tasawwar, ''O GENERAL MY GENERAL (Life and Works of General M. A. G. Osmani)'', pp. 35–109, {{ISBN|978-984-8866-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three brigades (eight infantry battalions and three artillery batteries) were put into action between July and September.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp 44&lt;/ref&gt; During June and July, Mukti Bahini had regrouped across the border with Indian aid through [[Operation Jackpot]] and began sending 2000–5000 guerrillas across the border,&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Moyeedul, ''Muldhara 71'', pp 44&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called Monsoon Offensive, which for various reasons (lack of proper training, supply shortage, lack of a proper support network inside Bangladesh) failed to achieve its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman, ''How Pakistan Got Divided'', pp 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Moyeedul, ''Muldhara 71'', pp 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Maj. Gen. Fazal Mukeem, ''Pakistan's Crisis in Leadership'', p 125&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali regular forces also attacked BOPs in [[Mymensingh]], [[Comilla]] and [[Sylhet]], but the results were mixed. Pakistani authorities concluded that they had successfully contained the Monsoon Offensive, which proved a near-accurate observation.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Rao Farman, ''When Pakistan Got Divided'', p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niazi, Lt. Gen. A.A.K, ''The Betrayal of East Pakistan'', p 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla operations, which slackened during the training phase, picked up after August. Economic and military targets in Dacca were attacked. The major success story was Operation Jackpot, in which naval commandos mined and blew up berthed ships in Chittagong, [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Chandpur District|Chandpur]] on 15 August 1971.&lt;ref name="Untold heroism of Muktibahini Frogmen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Mihir, K|title=War in the Indian Ocean|year=1995|publisher=Lancer Publisher &amp; Distributor|location=56, Gautaum Nagar, New-Delhi, 110049, India|isbn=978-1-897829-11-0|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On the water front spectacular achievement"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robi|first=Mir Mustak Ahmed|title=Chetonai Ekattor|year=2008|publisher=Zonaki Publisher|location=38, Bangla Bazar (2nd Floor), Dacca-1100, Bangladesh|url=http://opac.iub.edu.bd/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=15244&amp;query_desc=%28su%3A{Bangladesh}%29|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladeshi conventional forces attacked border outposts. Kamalpur, Belonia and the [[Battle of Boyra]] are a few examples. 90 out of 370 BOPs fell to Bengali forces. Guerrilla attacks intensified, as did Pakistani and Razakar reprisals on civilian populations. Pakistani forces were reinforced by eight battalions from West Pakistan. The Bangladeshi independence fighters even managed to temporarily capture [[Aerodrome#Airstrip|airstrips]] at [[Lalmonirhat District|Lalmonirhat]] and [[Shalutikar]].&lt;ref name=ACIG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_326.shtml |title=India – Pakistan War, 1971; Introduction By Tom Cooper, with Khan Syed Shaiz Ali |publisher=Acig.org |accessdate=23 June 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606195040/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_326.shtml| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these were used for flying in supplies and arms from India.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had concluded that instead of taking in millions of refugees, India would be economically better to go to war against Pakistan.&lt;ref name="MSN Encarta" /&gt; As early as 28 April 1971, the Indian Cabinet had asked General [[Sam Manekshaw|Manekshaw]] (Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee) to "Go into East Pakistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1971: Making Bangladesh a reality – I|url = http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/1971-making-bangladesh-a-reality-i/|website = Indian Defence Review|accessdate = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hostile relations in the past between India and Pakistan added to India's decision to intervene in Pakistan's civil war. Resultantly, the Indian government decided to support the creation of a separate state for ethnic Bengalis by supporting the [[Mukti Bahini]]. [[Research and Analysis Wing|RAW]] helped to organise, train and arm these insurgents. Consequently, the Mukti Bahini succeeded in harassing Pakistani military in East Pakistan, thus creating conditions conducive for a full-scale Indian military intervention in early December.&lt;ref name="MSN Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588350_3/Indo-Pakistani_Wars.html#s29 |title=Indo-Pakistani Wars |work=MSN Encarta |accessdate=20 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrHv6ph?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588350_3/Indo-Pakistani_Wars.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF) launched [[Operation Chengiz Khan|a pre-emptive strike on Indian Air Force bases]] on 3 December 1971. The attack was modelled on the [[Israeli Air Force]]'s [[Operation Focus]] during the [[Six-Day War]], and intended to neutralise the [[Indian Air Force]] planes on the ground. The strike was seen by India as an open act of unprovoked aggression, which marked the official start of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani War]]. As a response to the attack, both India and Pakistan formally acknowledged the "existence of a state of war between the two countries" even though neither government had formally issued a [[declaration of war]].&lt;ref name="time-edge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910155-1,00.html|title=India and Pakistan: Over the Edge|work=Time|date=13 December 1971|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Indian [[corps]] were involved in the liberation of East Pakistan. They were supported by nearly three [[brigade]]s of Mukti Bahini fighting alongside them, and many more who were fighting irregularly. That was far superior to the Pakistani army of three [[division (military)|divisions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878969-4,00.html |title=Bangladesh: Out of War, a Nation Is Born |work=Time |date=20 December 1971 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians quickly overran the country, selectively engaging or bypassing heavily defended strongholds. Pakistani forces were unable to effectively counter the Indian attack, as they had been deployed in small units around the border to counter the guerrilla attacks by the Mukti Bahini.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Army after Independence'' by Maj KC Praval 1993 Lancer, p. 317 {{ISBN|1-897829-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to defend Dacca, the Pakistanis surrendered on 16 December 1971.

=== Air and naval war ===
The Indian Air Force carried out several sorties against Pakistan, and within a week, IAF aircraft dominated the skies of East Pakistan. It [[East Pakistan Air Operations, 1971|achieved]] near-total [[air supremacy]] by the end of the first week, as the entire Pakistani air contingent in the east, PAF No.14 Squadron, was grounded because of Indian and Bangladesh airstrikes at Tejgaon, Kurmitolla, Lal Munir Hat and Shamsher Nagar. [[Hawker Sea Hawk|Sea Hawks]] from the carrier [[INS Vikrant (R11)|INS ''Vikrant'']] also struck Chittagong, [[Barisal]] and [[Cox's Bazar]], destroying the eastern wing of the [[Pakistan Navy]] and effectively blockading the East Pakistan ports, thereby cutting off any escape routes for the stranded Pakistani soldiers. The nascent [[Bangladesh Navy]] (comprising officers and sailors who defected from the Pakistani Navy) aided the Indians in the marine warfare, carrying out attacks, most notably [[Operation Jackpot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/independence-day-special-2015/submariners-heroism-and-the-first-military-response-france|title=Naval Commandos in Operation Jackpot|work=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction in West Pakistan to the war ===
Reaction to the defeat and dismemberment of half the nation was a shocking loss to top military and civilians alike. Few had expected that they would lose the formal war in under a fortnight, and there was also unsettlement over what was perceived as a meek surrender of the army in East Pakistan. [[Yahya Khan]]'s dictatorship collapsed and gave way to Bhutto, who took the opportunity to rise to power. [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi|General Niazi]], who surrendered along with 93,000 troops, was viewed with suspicion and contempt upon his return to Pakistan. He was shunned and branded a [[Treason|traitor]]. The war also exposed the shortcomings of Pakistan's declared strategic doctrine that the "defence of East Pakistan lay in West Pakistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/oct/yaqub.htm |title=Defencejournal |publisher=Defencejournal |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018222302/http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/oct/yaqub.htm |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dead link &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/aug2004-weekly/nos-15-08-2004/pol1.htm#1 Redefining security imperatives by M Sharif]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghazali.net/book8/Chapter_5/body_chapter_5.html |title=General Niazi's Failure in High Command |publisher=Ghazali.net |date=21 August 2000 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war there were widespread killings and other atrocities – including the displacement of civilians in Bangladesh (East Pakistan at the time) and widespread violations of human rights began with the start of [[Operation Searchlight]] on 25 March 1971.

Following Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration of independence in March 1971, a worldwide campaign was undertaken by the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] to drum up political support for the independence of East Pakistan as well as humanitarian support for the Bengali people.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided extensive diplomatic and political support to the Bangladesh movement. She toured many countries in a bid to create awareness of the Pakistani atrocities against Bengalis. This effort was to prove vital later during the war, in framing the world's context of the war and to justify military action by India.&lt;ref name="recog-story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072 |title=The Recognition Story |publisher=Bangladesh Strategic and Development Forum |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050939/http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, following Pakistan's defeat, it ensured prompt recognition of the newly independent state of Bangladesh.

=== United Nations ===

Though the United Nations condemned the human rights violations during and following Operation Searchlight, it failed to defuse the situation politically before the start of the war.

Following India's entry into the war, Pakistan, fearing certain defeat, made urgent appeals to the United Nations to intervene and force India to agree to a [[ceasefire]]. The [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] assembled on 4 December 1971 to discuss the hostilities in South Asia. After lengthy discussions on 7 December, the United States made a resolution for "immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of troops". While supported by the majority, the USSR vetoed the resolution twice. In light of the Pakistani atrocities against Bengalis, the United Kingdom and France abstained on the resolution.&lt;ref name="time-edge" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Zulfiqar_Ali_Bhutto's_farewell_speech_to_the_United_Nations_Security_Council|title=Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's farewell speech to the United Nations Security Council|last=Bhutto|first=Zulfiqar Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December, with Pakistan facing imminent defeat, the United States requested that the Security Council be reconvened. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was rushed to New York City to make the case for a resolution on the cease fire. The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan's forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic. Bhutto, frustrated by the failure of the resolution and the inaction of the United Nations, ripped up his speech and left the council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Most UN member nations were quick to recognise Bangladesh within months of its independence.&lt;ref name="recog-story" /&gt;

===Bhutan===
As the Bangladesh Liberation War approached the defeat of the Pakistan Army, the Himalayan kingdom of [[Bhutan]] became the first state in the world to recognise the newly independent country on 6 December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/08/bhutan-recognised-bangladesh-first|title=Bhutan recognised Bangladesh first - Dhaka Tribune|work=dhakatribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the first [[President of Bangladesh]] visited Bhutan to attend the coronation of [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], the fourth King of Bhutan in June 1974.

=== US and USSR ===

US President [[Richard Nixon]] and his National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a ''[[China–United States relations#Rapprochement|rapprochement]]'' and which he intended to visit in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of [[West Pakistan]] would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. To demonstrate to China the ''bona fides'' of the United States as an ally, and in direct violation of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan and routed them through Jordan and Iran,&lt;ref name="Shalom"&gt;Shalom, Stephen R., [http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/issue47/articles/a07.htm The Men Behind Yahya in the Indo-Pak War of 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the genocidal activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the [[Archer Blood#The Blood telegram|Blood telegram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/perspective/the-triumvirate-the-diplomat-the-journalist-and-the-artist-1330978|title=The triumvirate of the Diplomat, the Journalist and the Artist|date=17 December 2016|newspaper=The Daily Star|access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yahya and Nixon.jpg|thumb|The [[Nixon administration]] was widely criticised for its close ties with the military junta led by General [[Yahya Khan]]. American diplomats in East Pakistan expressed profound dissent in the [[Blood Telegram]].]]

Nixon denied getting involved in the situation, saying that it was an internal matter of Pakistan, but when Pakistan's defeat seemed certain, Nixon sent the aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] to the [[Bay of Bengal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Scott |title=Naval 'Show of Force' By Nixon Meant as Blunt Warning to India |work=Bangor Daily News |publisher=Google News |date=21 December 1971 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUU0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IeEIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5099,2016461&amp;dq=nixon+pakistan+military&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; a move deemed by the Indians as a nuclear threat.

The Soviet Union supported Bangladesh and Indian armies, as well as the [[Mukti Bahini]] during the war, recognising that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals – the United States and China. It gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, the USSR would take countermeasures. This was enshrined in the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|Indo-Soviet friendship treaty]] signed in August 1971.

At the end of the war, the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were among the first to recognise Bangladesh. The Soviet Union accorded recognition to Bangladesh on 25 January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USSR, Czechoslovakia Recognize Bangladesh |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Sumter Daily Item, via Google News |location=Sumter, South Carolina, US |date=25 January 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0dIoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gQYGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2219,2272476&amp;dq=bangladesh+ussr+recognize&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States delayed recognition for some months, before according it on 8 April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nixon Hopes for Subcontinent Peace |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Herald-Journal, via Google News |location=Spartanburg, South Carolina, US |date=9 April 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5TMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5ssEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3505,1398456&amp;dq=usa+recognize+bangladesh&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
As a long-standing ally of Pakistan, the People's Republic of China reacted with alarm to the evolving situation in East Pakistan and the prospect of India invading West Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled [[Kashmir]]. Believing that just such an Indian attack was imminent, Nixon encouraged China to mobilise its armed forces along its border with India to discourage it. The Chinese did not, however, respond to this encouragement, because unlike the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino-Indian War]] when India was caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army was prepared and had deployed eight mountain divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against such an eventuality.&lt;ref name="time-edge" /&gt; China instead threw its weight behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.

When Bangladesh applied for membership to the United Nations in 1972, China vetoed their application&lt;ref name="oxnard"&gt;{{cite news |title=China Recognizes Bangladesh |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Press Courier, via Google News |location=Oxnard, California, US |date=1 September 1975 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rnVKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RSINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4237,20391&amp;dq=china+recognize+bangladesh&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; because two United Nations resolutions regarding the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilians had not yet been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China Veto Downs Bangladesh UN Entry |agency=United Press International |date=26 August 1972 |publisher=The Montreal Gazette, via Google News |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GQsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w6EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4712,6055847&amp;dq=bangladesh+united-nations+china&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; China was also among the last countries to recognise independent Bangladesh, refusing to do so until 31 August 1975.&lt;ref name="recog-story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxnard" /&gt;

'''The Big History Project''' was started by [[Bill Gates]] and [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] to enable the global teaching of the subject of [[Big History]], which is described as "the attempt to understand, in a unified way, the history of Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibhanet.org/|title=International Big History Association - Home|website=www.ibhanet.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a course that covers history from the [[Big Bang]] through to the present in an interdisciplinary way. The Big History Project “is dedicated to fostering a greater love and capacity for learning among high school students”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bighistoryproject.com|title=Big History Project|website=www.bighistoryproject.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}{{Nature timeline}}
Bill Gates became interested in big history when he heard a series of -98 lectures by Christian published by The Teaching Company under the name "Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity". For Gates, “he really blew me away. Here’s a guy who’s read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bighistoryinstitute.org/big_history_project/|title=Big History Project - Macquarie University|website=bighistoryinstitute.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gates and Christian met to discuss the lectures, the genesis of the Big History Project occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/so-bill-gates-has-this-idea-for-a-history-class.html|title=So Bill Gates Has This Idea for a History Class ...|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|date=2014-09-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They founded the project, and developed a team to achieve their stated goal, “to get big history taught to as many students around the world as possible”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To achieve that goal Big History Project was launched at the 2011 [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference at Long Beach, California on 2 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conferences.ted.com/TED2011/program/|title=TED2011: Program|website=conferences.ted.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Christian presented an 18-minute lecture outlining big history and the intention of creating a global online delivery of a classroom-tested course aimed at 9th grade students. His presentation was part of the Bill Gates-curated “Knowledge Revolution” section of the conference.  Christian's TED talk has been posted, and the link can be found below.  The Big History Project website has also made available pdf versions of some of the timelines that support Christian's TED presentation.  That link can also be found below.

==Project team==
The academic advisers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bighistoryproject.com/BigHistory/The-Project/The-Team/Founders/Bill-Gates | title=The Big History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Bob Bain, Associate Professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;
#[[Marnie Hughes-Warrington]] (Pro-Vice Chancellor, [[Monash University]], Melbourne);
#Tracy Sullivan (Director of the Australian History Museum at [[Macquarie University]], Sydney), and
#[[Sal Khan]] (founder and Executive Director of the [http://www.khanacademy.org Khan Academy]).
The Seattle-based consultancy team [http://intentionalfutures.com Intentional Futures] works directly with the Project's founders on strategy, course content, software design, marketing and school implementation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bighistoryproject.com/About|title=About Big History|website=www.bighistoryproject.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027050003/http://www.bighistoryproject.com/About|archive-date=October 27, 2012|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Big History Association is also listed as a partner in the project.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Initial pilot program==
Seven schools were selected for the initial classroom pilot phase of the project. In the United States, San Diego High School of International Studies (California); The Rivers School (Massachusetts); Northville High School (Michigan); Greenhills High School (Michigan) and Lakeside School (Washington) taught Big History in the 2011/12 school year. In Australia, Narara Valley High School in New South Wales and Nossal High School in Victoria taught the course in their 2012 school year.
In 2011 the Big History Project team held conferences in Sydney and Seattle with the teachers from the schools. These conferences established a framework for developing a school-based curriculum for big history, and outlined a structure for planning specific lessons to be trialled in classrooms in 2011/12. Teachers are developing lessons for their specific schools, and these lessons will be pooled as part of a developing resource base to facilitate the teaching of the course internationally.

==Future pilot program==
A second phase of piloting in schools will be utilized in 2012/13 before the release of a free curriculum online in 2013. Participating schools will “have the opportunity to pioneer the curriculum and will play key roles in evaluating and improving the course”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bighistoryproject.com/Big-History/Apply-Now|title=The Big History Project|website=www.bighistoryproject.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia 26 schools were undertaking the course in 2013, with more due to take it up in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/bill-gates-big-history/4946140 Bill Gates plans to teach Australian man's history course in schools worldwide] ABC ''[[Lateline]]'', 9 September 2013.

According to one definition, "The counterintelligence state is characterized by the presence of a large, elite force acting as a watchdog of a security defined as broadly that the state must maintain an enormous vigilance and enforcement apparatus... This apparatus is not accountable to the public and enjoys immense police powers... Whether the civilian government is able to [[Civilian control of the military|control the security bodies]] is an open question; indeed ''the civilian government is so penetrated by the apparatus that there is no clear distinction between the two.''"&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

==Soviet Union==
There was a massive security apparatus in the [[Soviet Union]] to prevent any opposition, and "every facet of daily life fell into the [[KGB]]'s domain."&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

Undercover staff of the KGB included three major categories:
:(a) the [[Active reserve (KGB)|active reserve]],
:(b) the "trusted contacts" (or "reliable people"), and
:(c) "civilian informers" (or "secret helpers").

The "active reserve" included KGB [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] with a military rank who worked undercover. "Trusted contacts" were high placed [[civilian]]s who collaborated with the KGB without signing any official working agreements, such as directors of personnel departments at various institutions, academics, deans, or writers and actors.&lt;ref name="Albats"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia—Past, Present, and Future.'' 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}, pages 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Informers were citizens secretly recruited by the KGB, sometimes using forceful recruitment methods, such as [[blackmail]]. The precise number of people from various categories remains unknown, but one of the estimates was 11 million "informers" in the Soviet Union, or one out of every eighteen adult citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Pringle. ''Andropov's Counterintelligence State'', International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, 13:2, 193–203, page 196, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
A "Law on Foreign Intelligence" adopted in August 1992 provided conditions for penetration by former KGB officers to all levels of the government and economy, since it stipulated that "career personnel may occupy positions in ministries, departments, establishments, enterprises and organizations in accordance with the requirements of this law without compromising their association with foreign intelligence agencies."&lt;ref name="Anderson1"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600601079958 The HUMINT Offensive from Putin's Chekist State] Anderson, Julie (2007), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 20:2, 258–316&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Russian banker, "All big companies have to put people from the security services on the board of directors... and we know that when [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] calls, they have to answer them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2008-28-3.cfm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current FSB colonel explained that "We must make sure that companies don't make decisions that are not in the interest of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9682621|title=The making of a neo-KGB state|date=2007-08-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-24|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181050/http://finrosforum.fi/?p=513|title=FINROSFORUM - Home|date=2011-07-20|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olga Kryshtanovskaya]], director of the Moscow-based [[Center for the Study of Elites]], has found in the beginning of the 2000s that up to 78% of 1,016 leading political figures in [[post-Soviet Russia]] have served previously in organizations affiliated with the KGB or FSB.&lt;ref name="Finn"/&gt; She said: "If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in [[business]], [[political parties]], [[NGO]]s, regional governments, even culture... They started to use all political institutions."&lt;ref name="Finn"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101434.html ''In Russia, A Secretive Force Widens''], by P. Finn, Washington Post, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"Under [[Russian Federation]] President and former career foreign intelligence officer [[Vladimir Putin]], an '[[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB State]]' composed of [[Chekism|chekists]] has been established and is consolidating its hold on the country. Its closest partners are [[organized crime|organized criminals]]. In a world marked by a [[globalization|globalized economy]] and information infrastructure, and with [[List of designated terrorist organizations|transnational terrorism groups]] utilizing all available means to achieve their goals and further their interests, [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian intelligence]] collaboration with these elements is potentially disastrous.", said politologist [[Julie Anderson (politologist)|Julie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600601079958 The HUMINT Offensive from Putin's Chekist State] Anderson, Julie (2007), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 20:2, 258 – 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takeover"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600500483699 The Chekist Takeover of the Russian State], Anderson, Julie (2006), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 19:2, 237 – 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] compared the takeover of Russian state by [[silovik]]s with an imaginary scenario of [[Gestapo]] coming to power in Germany after [[World War II]]. He noted a fundamental difference between the [[secret police]] and ordinary [[political parties]], even totalitarian ones, such as the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. The Russian secret police organizations use various violent [[active measures]]. Hence, according to Felstinsky, they killed [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and directed [[Russian apartment bombings]] and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?200627-1/book-discussion-blowing-russia-secret-plot Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror] Historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] explains his views on the nature of Putinism on [[C-SPAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former KGB officer [[Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy]] shares similar ideas. When asked "How many people in Russia work in [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]]?", he replied: "Whole country. FSB owns everything, including [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] and even own Church, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]... Putin managed to create new [[social system]] in Russia" [http://www.voanews.com/russian/archive/2007-02/2007-02-02-voa3.cfm].

"Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], or the [[Soviet Union]] – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Putins government – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent", said intelligence expert Marc Gerecht.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.25917/pub_detail.asp A Rogue Intelligence State?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4874">'''Nikoloz "Didi-Niko" Dadiani''' ({{lang-ka|ნიკოლოზ ["დიდი ნიკო"] დადიანი}}; 1764 – 25 February 1834) was a Georgian nobleman of the [[House of Dadiani]] and a historian. He played a prominent role in the government of the [[Principality of Mingrelia]], which became an autonomous subject of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1804. Dadiani's principal historical work is ''The History of the Georgians'', whose final chapters are an indispensable source for the early modern history of western Georgia. Nikoloz Dadiani, his name [[hypocorism|hypocorized]] to Niko, was named ''didi'', Georgian for "big", to distinguish him from his younger namesakes in the Dadiani family.&lt;ref name="achp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikolas (Didi Niko) Dadiani (1764-1834)|url=http://achp.si.edu/dadiani/nikolas.html|website=Dadiani Dynasty|publisher=Smithsonian Institution in association with National Parliamentary Library of Georgia|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Nikoloz Dadiani was a son of Giorgi Dadiani (died 1799), brother of [[Katsia II Dadiani]], Prince of Mingrelia. His involvement in the politics and government of Mingrelia began in October 1804, when he became a member of the regency council for his underage relative, [[Levan V Dadiani]], a grandson of Katsia II. The council was presided by Levan's mother, the dowager-princess [[Nino, Princess of Mingrelia|Nino]]. A few months earlier, Mingrelia had become part of the Russian Empire as an autonomous principality. In 1805, Didi-Niko Dadini led a Mingrelian delegation to [[St. Petersburg]] sent to address the principality's territorial grievances with its neighbors. On his return, Dadiani found himself at odds with the dowager-princess, whom he accused of using the regency council to appease her own ambitions. After Levan V Dadiani became of age and Nino was sidelined from Mingrelia's government in 1811, Didi-Niko Dadiani's influence grew. The prince-regnant Levan had little interest in government affairs and day-to-day administrative routine and relied on Didi-Niko, who served as a chancellor (''mdivanbegi'') for years and, between 1804 and 1811, composed a new government code, known as ''dasturlama'', to improve Mingrelia's governance.&lt;ref name="achp"/&gt;

Didi-Niko Dadiani was a loyal subject to the Russian crown. As part of the Mingrelian forces ("militia"), he fought on the Russian side in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)]], [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]], and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]]. He, further, aided the Russians in suppressing the western Georgian rebellions of 1810 and 1819–1820. He was made major-general and awarded the [[Order of St. Anna]], First Class.&lt;ref name="achp"/&gt;

== A historian ==
During his years in government, Dadiani wrote his major historical work, ''The History of the Georgians'' (ქართველთ ცხოვრება, ''k'art'velt' ts'khovreba''), which he completed in 1823. It is composed of three parts; the first two segments are based, respectively, on the medieval compendium, ''[[The Georgian Chronicles|kartlis tskhovreba]]'', and the history  by [[Prince Vakhushti]]. The final part is an original work, dealing mostly with the history of western Georgia between 1749 and 1823 and containing many valuable, otherwise unrecorded details. He also wrote a travelogue of his mission to Russia, which has not survived.&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ka:დადიანი ნიკო გიორგის ძე [Dadiani, Niko Giorgis dze]|url=http://science.org.ge/encyclopedia/index.php/%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%93%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%9C%E1%83%98#.E1.83.93.E1.83.90.E1.83.93.E1.83.98.E1.83.90.E1.83.9C.E1.83.98_.E1.83.9C.E1.83.98.E1.83.99.E1.83.9D_.E1.83.92.E1.83.98.E1.83.9D.E1.83.A0.E1.83.92.E1.83.98.E1.83.A1_.E1.83.AB.E1.83.94|website=ენციკლოპედია საქართველო, ტ. 3 [Encyclopaedia Georgia, Vol. III]|publisher=National Academy of Sciences of Georgia|language=ka|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dadiani died in 1834 and was buried at the [[Martvili Monastery]]. He was married twice; first, to Mariam née [[Eristavi of Guria]] and, then, after her death in 1802, Ekaterine Marshania from [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]]. He had seven children—two daughters and five sons. His descendants are still extant.&lt;ref name="achp"/&gt;

'''Diodorus Siculus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|d|ɔː|r|ə|s|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Διόδωρος Σικελιώτης}} ''Diodoros Sikeliotes'') ({{fl.}}&amp;nbsp;1st century BC) or '''Diodorus of Sicily''' was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]. He is known for writing the monumental [[universal history]] ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of [[Troy]], arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the [[Trojan War]] to the death of [[Alexander the Great]]. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. ''Bibliotheca'', meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.

==Life==
According to his own work, he was born at [[Agira|Agyrium]] in [[Sicily]] (now called Agira).&lt;ref&gt;Diod. ''History'' 1.4.4.&lt;/ref&gt; With one exception, [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] affords no further information about his life and doings beyond in his work. Only [[Jerome]], in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' under the "year of [[Abraham]] 1968" (49 BC), writes, "Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious". However, his [[English language|English]] translator, [[Charles Henry Oldfather]], remarks on the "striking coincidence"&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus of Sicily In Twelve Volumes'' by [[Charles Henry Oldfather]] (1977), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; that one of only two known Greek inscriptions from Agyrium (''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' XIV, 588) is the tombstone of one "Diodorus, the son of Apollonius".&lt;ref&gt;''Ctesias' Persian History: Introduction, text, and translation by Ctesias'' by Jan P. Stronk (2010), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{main|Bibliotheca historica}}
[[File:Bibliotheca historica.tif|thumb|''Bibliotheca historica'', 1746]]
Diodorus' [[universal history]], which he named ''Bibliotheca historica'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἱστορικὴ Βιβλιοθήκη}}, "Historical Library"), was immense and consisted of 40 books, of which 1–5 and 11–20 survive:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164108/Diodorus-Siculus "Diodorus Siculus" entry in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''].&lt;/ref&gt; fragments of the lost books are preserved in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and the excerpts of [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]].

It was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of [[Ancient Egypt]] (book I), of [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], [[Scythia]], and [[Arabia]] (II), of [[North Africa]] (III), and of [[Greece]] and Europe (IV–VI).

In the next section (books VII&amp;ndash;XVII), he recounts the history of the world from the [[Trojan War]] down to the [[death of Alexander the Great]]. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the [[Diadochi|successors of Alexander]] down to either 60 BC or the beginning of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]]. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name "Bibliotheca" in acknowledgment that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], [[Ephorus]], [[Theopompus]], [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], [[Duris of Samos]], [[Diyllus]], [[Philistus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], and [[Posidonius]].

His account of [[gold mining]] in [[Nubia]] in eastern [[Egypt]] is one of the earliest extant texts on the topic, and describes in vivid detail the use of [[slave labour]] in terrible working conditions. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] wrote a Commentary on Diodorus's ''Analemma''. The now lost ''Analemma'' applied geometrical constructions in a plane to solve some astronomy-related problems of spherical geometry. It contained, for example, a discussion of sundial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones, Introduction, ''Pappus of Alexandria Book 7 of the Collection: Part 1. Introduction, Text, and Translation'' (2013) ed., Tr. &amp; commentary by Alexander Jones, ''Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 8''&lt;/ref&gt;

He also gave an account of the [[Gauls]]:
"The Gauls are terrifying in aspect and their voices are deep and altogether harsh; when they meet together they converse with few words and in riddles, hinting darkly at things for the most part and using one word when they mean another; and they like to talk in superlatives, to the end that they may extol themselves and depreciate all other men. They are also boasters and threateners and are fond of pompous language, and yet they have sharp wits and are not without cleverness at learning." (Book 5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Diodorus Siculus — Book V Chapters 19‑40|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Ann Fox-Genovese''' (May 28, 1941 – January 2, 2007) was an American historian best known for her works on women and society in the [[Antebellum South]]. A Marxist early on in her career, she later converted to Roman Catholicism and became a primary voice of the conservative women's movement. She was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2003.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Ann Fox was born in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. She was the daughter of [[Cornell University|Cornell]] professor Edward Whiting Fox, a specialist in the history of [[Europe|modern Europe]], and Elizabeth Mary (née Simon) Fox, whose brother was real estate mogul [[Robert E. Simon|Robert Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://search.lib.unc.edu/search?R=UNCb5334468 | title = Fox and Simon Family Papers, 1862–1991 | publisher = UNC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was Protestant, of English, Scottish and Irish descent; her mother was Jewish, from a family that immigrated from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.christendomreview.com/Volume001Issue002/douglas_ambrose_01.html | journal = Christendom review | title = Douglas Ambrose | volume = 1 | issue = 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4618/Fox-Genovese-Elizabeth-Ann-1941.html | contribution = Fox‐Genovese, Elizabeth Ann | publisher = J rank | title = Encycloedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Fox studied at the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] in France and attended [[Bryn Mawr College]], where in 1963 she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in French and history. At [[Harvard University]], she earned an [[Master's degree|MA]] in history in 1966 and a PhD in 1974.

In 1969 she married fellow historian [[Eugene D. Genovese]] and changed her surname to Fox-Genovese. They collaborated on some historical works in the course of their careers and had a professional partnership.&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2012/09/28/on-eugene-genovese/ Tribute to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese], ''Chronicle of Higher Education''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s they founded the journal, ''Marxist Perspectives,''&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; publishing the first issue in Spring 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrooklyninstitute.com/archive-library/book-2/ ''Marxist Perspectives'', Vol.1, No.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161820/http://thebrooklyninstitute.com/archive-library/book-2/ |date=July 14, 2014 }}, The Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, accessed June 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "brilliant but short-lived", it was published into the early 1980s. In 2012 ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' magazine
announced plans to digitize issues of the journal in a collaboration for open access with the [[Brooklyn]] Institute for Social Research, and make it available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/marxist-perspectives-revived "'Marxist Perspectives' Revived"], ''Dissent'' blog, April 18, 2012, accessed June 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing her PhD, Fox first taught at [[Binghamton University]] and [[The University of Rochester]]. In 1986 she was recruited as founding director for the Institute for [[Women's Studies]] at [[Emory University]]. At the Institute, she served as director and began the first [[doctorate|doctoral]] program in Women's Studies in the US;&lt;ref name = "Obit"/&gt; she personally directed thirty-two doctoral [[dissertation]]s. She also taught history as the Eleonore Raoul Professor of the [[Humanities]].&lt;ref name = "Obit"/&gt;

In 1993 L. Virginia Gould, one of her former graduate students, named Fox-Genovese and Emory University as co-defendants in a sexual discrimination and harassment lawsuit.  Emory settled the lawsuit out of court. Financial details were not released.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{Citation | last = Margalit | first = Fox | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/arts/07fox-genovese.html | title = Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, historian, Is Dead at 65 | newspaper = The New York Times | date = January 7, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox-Genovese grew up in a household of secular intellectuals who were respectful of Christianity, but nonbelieving. For most of her adult life, she considered herself Christian only "in the amorphous cultural sense of the word."  Having "thoroughly imbibed [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy," she inhabited "a world that took it as a matter of faith that '[[God is dead]]'." In 1995, however, Fox-Genovese publicly [[religious conversion|converted]] to [[Roman Catholicism]], due in part to her deep unease about "[[moral relativism]]" (since she found "a world in which each followed his or her moral compass" neither rational nor viable). She said she was also reacting to the pride and self-centeredness that she had witnessed in the [[secularism|secular]] [[academia|academy]].&lt;ref name= "Conversion"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=2597&amp;var_recherche=Elizabeth+Fox-Genovese |title= A Conversion Story | first = Elizabeth | last = Fox–Genovese | journal= First Things | issue = 102 |date=April 2000 | pages=39–43 | accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers regarded her reputation as a feminist as being at odds with her conversion, but she found it to be "wholly consistent."&lt;ref name = "Obit"&gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/33650.html "Elizabeth Fox-Genovese: Unorthodox scholar"], ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', January 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, "Sad as it may seem, my experience with radical, upscale feminism only reinforced my growing mistrust of individual pride."&lt;ref name="Conversion"/&gt;

Fox-Genovese died in 2007, aged 65, in Atlanta. She had lived with [[Multiple sclerosis|MS]] for 15 years. The following year, Eugene Genovese published a tribute to his wife, ''Miss Betsey: A Memoir of Marriage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Voices; Vol. XXIV, No. 2 |edition = online |chapter = 3.

==Scholarship==
Fox-Genovese's academic interests changed from [[French history]] to the history of women in the United States before the [[American Civil War]].  Virginia Shadron, assistant dean at Emory, later said that Fox-Genovese's ''Within the Plantation Household'' (1988) cemented her reputation as a scholar of women in the [[Old South]].&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Contemporary reviews praised it; one described her work as bridging "the gap between the study of individual identity and the economic and social milieu."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2122860 David Weiman, Review: "'Within the Plantation Household: Black and White Women of the Old South', by Elizabeth Fox-Genovese"], ''The Journal of Economic History,'' Vol. 50, No. 3 (Sep. 1990), pp. 759–61, Published by: Cambridge University Press, accessed June 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Mechal Sobel of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "Elizabeth Fox-Genovese undertakes the enormous tasks of telling the life stories of the last generation of black and white women of the Old South, and of analyzing the meanings of these connected stories as a way of illuminating both Southern and women's history—tasks at which she succeeds brilliantly."&lt;ref name="UNC"/&gt;

This book received the following awards:
* 1988 C. Hugh Holman Award, Society for the Study of Southern Literature
* 1989 Julia Cherry Spruill Prize, Southern Association for Women Historians
* 1989 Outstanding Book Award, Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America&lt;ref name="UNC"&gt;[http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=507 ''Within the Plantation Household''], University of North Carolina Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox-Genovese also wrote scholarly and popular works on feminism.  Through her writings, she alienated many [[feminists]] but attracted many women who may have considered themselves [[conservative feminists]]. [[Princeton University]] history professor [[Sean Wilentz]] said, "She probably did more for the conservative women's movement than anyone... [Her] voice came from inside the academy and updated the ideas of the conservative women's movement. She was one of their most influential intellectual forces."&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Fox-Genovese reportedly had no patience with the cultural feminist trend of viewing women and men as possessing completely different values, and she criticized the idea that women's natural instincts and experience of oppression gave them a superior capacity for justice and mercy.&lt;ref name="Young2007"/&gt; For this, she had been labelled by [[Cathy Young]] as an "[[antifeminist]]".&lt;ref name="Young2007"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8226">'''Frank Forrest Latta''' (1892–1983), [[California]] [[oral historian]] and [[ethnographer]] of the [[Yokut people]] and [[historian]] of the early settlement of the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

==Early life==
Frank Forrest Latta was the son of Presbyterian minister Eli C. Latta and teacher Harmonia Campbell, born on September 18, 1892, in [[Stanislaus County]], near [[Orestimba Creek]].  Latta lived most of his life in the San Joaquin Valley.  His father and three other brothers had come to California from Arkansas during the [[California Gold Rush]].  His father and one brother remained there, one returned to Arkansas, one wrote he was returning home to Arkansas with $8,000 in gold, then disappeared without a trace.

As a young boy Latta worked on several ranches in the San Joaquin Valley and became interested in the stories of the early pioneers, and in 1906 began interviewing people and gathering research regarding early life and early farming in California.  Latta also spent much time researching the Miller &amp; Lux farming corporation and its founders [[Henry Miller (rancher)|Henry Miller]] and [[Charles Lux]].

To support himself Frank F. Latta became a teacher.  He taught drafting and carpentry at high schools in [[Gustine, California|Gustine]], [[Porterville, California|Porterville]], [[Shafter, California|Shafter]] and [[Bakersfield, California]] from 1915 to 1945.  In 1919, he married Jeanette Allen and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/ca/stanislaus/cemeteries/patterson-1988-transcription.txt  Patterson Cemetery District; Obits listing; Latta, Jeanette, M 880818 p3]&lt;/ref&gt;  When not teaching Latta was traveling the San Joaquin Valley, interviewing pioneers and Native Americans, gathering artifacts articles or writing at home.  He published a large number of articles in San Joaquin Valley newspapers during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.huntington.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15150coll1/id/2943/rec/10  Finding aid for Frank F. Latta Collection: Skyfarming, 1802-1982 (bulk 1860-1975); Biographical Note]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and Ethnographic Writing ==
In the early 1920s he began interviewing surviving Yokuts and settlers acquainted with them.  Among these was [[Thomas Jefferson Mayfield]], ("Uncle Jeff"), the youngest son of a settler on the [[Kern River]] from Texas, [[William Mayfield]].  Uncle Jeff grew up in a Yokuts village, following the death of his mother.  His story prompted Latta to write his story, first as a series of newspaper articles, then as a book ''Uncle Jeff's Story : a tale of a San Joaquin Valley pioneer and his life with the Yokuts Indians'' in 1929.  First printed in 1936, ''California Indian Folklore'' was Frank Latta's first work that specifically focused on the Native Americans of the San Joaquin Valley, describing the culture of the many tribes of the Yokuts.  Also in 1936 he published a small book ''El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles'', describing the route and history of [[El Camino Viejo]], the old Spanish road and the settlements along it on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, from [[Los Angeles]] to what is now [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].  Born near were that road crossed Orestimba Creek, it was a route that he had traced on his trips through the valley and taken photos of many of its features and landmarks.  In 1938, Latta was honored with the presidency of the League of Western Writers.

Latta helped found the [[Kern County Museum]] in [[Bakersfield]] in 1941 where he worked both as a curator and as its director from 1945 until 1956. Latta also continued his research into the Yokuts.  From this information gathered for more than a half-century, interviewing over 200 elderly Yokuts and a number of settlers, Latta compiled and published the Handbook of Yokuts Indians, in 1949.  The first edition was published through the Kern County Museum in a first issue of only 500 copies.  A revised and enlarged edition would be published by him in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coyotepress.com/latta.html  coyotepress.com; Brewer's Historical Press and Coyote Press have joined forces to reissue two of Frank F. Latta's classics; biographic material mentioned by Michael J. Moratto and William J. Wallace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1949, Latta published his book ''Black Gold In The Joaquin'', the story of the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] in California, from the Indian usage of the oil, to the discoveries and the development of the extraction technology from the mid - 19th century to 1900.

In 1956 Latta moved to Santa Cruz, purchasing the Gazos Ranch in southern [[San Mateo County]], formerly the Steele Ranch, south of [[Pescadero, California]] near [[Gazos Creek]].  He and his wife Jean intended to retire there and to turn the ranch into a 
historical museum to house his extensive collection of historical items he had collected 
over the years.  He also intended to expand it into an 80-acre picnic and camping area 
stretching for a mile along the coast between Ano Nuevo Island and Pigeon Point with a realistic California Indian village and a pioneer California town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halfmoonbaymemories.com/?p=2485  Half Moon Bay Memories &amp; El Granada Observer, Created by June Morrall, 1957; Historical Museum at Pescadero]&lt;/ref&gt; After going through official county procedures, Latta thought he was on his way to beginning his larger project, and made a public announcement of it, but then was stopped in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.halfmoonbaymemories.com/?p=2489  Half Moon Bay Memories &amp; El Granada Observer,  Created by June Morrall, 1957: Historical Museum-Resort at Pescadero?]&lt;/ref&gt;  However he was able to establish the Rancho Gazos Historical Indian and Early Californian Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblaze.com/story/20070414233740nnnn.nb/topstory.html Yokuts Indian Artifacts From The Collection of Frank F. Latta, By Courtney Puffer, NewsBlaze, April 14, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Late in his life he published a series of books from information he had gathered over many years. ''The Dalton Gang Days'' and the ''Saga of Rancho El Tejon'' were first published in 1976.  '' Tailholt Tales,'' a much expanded version of Mayfield's memoir, was also published in that year, decades after his first efforts at correcting, commenting upon and filling out the original slim volume&lt;ref name="Margolin"&gt;Margolin, Malcolm. Forward to Indian Summer: Traditional Life among the Choinumne Indians.  Thomas Jefferson Mayfield. Berkeley: Heyday, 2006. 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s. ''Death Valley '49ers'' was first published in 1979, and ''Joaquín Murrieta and His Horse Gangs'', first published in 1980.

Frank Forrest Latta died in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in May 8, 1983, and was buried at [[Hills Ferry, California|Hills Ferry]] Cemetery in [[Newman, California]] not far from where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/ca/stanislaus/cemeteries/hillsferry-hl.txt California Tombstone Project; Hills Ferry Cemetery, Newman, Stanislaus County, CA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Ludwig Balthasar Amelung''' ({{OldStyleDate|23 March|1842|11 March}} – {{OldStyleDate|20 March|1909|7 March}}) was a [[Baltic German]] [[cultural history|cultural historian]], businessman and [[chess endgame]] composer.

Amelung was born at [[Võisiku]] ({{lang-de|Woiseck}}) manor in [[Governorate of Livonia]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Jõgeva County]] in [[Estonia]]). 1862–1864 he studied [[philosophy]] and [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]]. 1864–1879 and 1885–1902 he was the director of the Rõika-[[Meleski]] mirror factory which he inherited from his father. Amelung published writings about the culture and history of Estonian localities like [[Viljandi]], [[Tallinn]] and [[Põltsamaa]].&lt;ref name=tea&gt;{{cite web|title=Amelung, Friedrich|url=http://www.ents.ee:81/PrintArticle.aspx?aid=2312|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217110404/http://www.ents.ee:81/PrintArticle.aspx?aid=2312|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 February 2013|publisher=TEA e-Entsüklopeedia|accessdate=29 January 2013|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amelung was known as a [[chess]] player and a famous chess quiz's author. 1879–1885 he lived in [[Tallinn|Reval]] (now Tallinn) and studied the chess history of the Baltics. Between 1888 and 1908 he edited the [[List of chess periodicals|chess magazine]] ''Baltische Schachblätter''. In 1898 he established the Baltic Chess Society. Amelung published about 230 [[endgame studies]], making him the first chess historian in the Baltic States.&lt;ref name=viljandi&gt;{{cite web|title=23. märts - Friedrich Amelung 170|url=http://uudiskirjandus.blogspot.com/2012/03/23-marts-friedrich-amelung-170.html|publisher=Viljandi Linnaraamatukogu|accessdate=29 January 2013|language=Estonian|date=23 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304205124/http://uudiskirjandus.blogspot.com/2012/03/23-marts-friedrich-amelung-170.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a few games with [[Adolf Anderssen]], [[Gustav Neumann]], [[Carl Mayet]], [[Emil Schallopp]], [[Andreas Ascharin]], [[Emanuel Schiffers]].

He died in 1909 in [[Riga]] and is buried at the [[Kolga-Jaani]] cemetery in Estonia.&lt;ref name=tea/&gt;

'''George Chauncey''' (born 1954)&lt;ref name=birth&gt;http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0308/features/index.shtml.  Accessed March 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  is a professor of [[history]] at [[Columbia University]].  He is best known as the author of ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940'' (1994).

==Life and works==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2016}}
Chauncey received his B.A. (1977) and Ph.D. (1989) in history from [[Yale University]], where he studied with [[Nancy Cott]] and [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]].  From 1991 to 2006, he taught in the Department of History at the [[University of Chicago]], rising from assistant professor to full professor of history. In 2006, he joined the Yale faculty. He subsequently joined Columbia University's department of history in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/chauncey-george/|title=Chauncey, George {{!}} Department of History - Columbia University|website=history.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/01/25/chauncey-gregg-to-leave-yale-after-11-years/|title=Chauncey, Gregg to leave Yale after 11 years|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1930'' (1994)  was published to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Rebellions]]. It combined social, political, and cultural history, and in it Chauncey argues that early twentieth century New York had a thriving, open gay culture. Using newspaper accounts from a wide variety of mainstream and underground publications, the archives of reform organizations, police and court records, popular cartoons and caricatures, guidebooks, and maps, Chauncey offers a rich and textured account of urban gay life. The book was acclaimed for several original findings, among them the malleability of sexual identities (he finds, for example, widespread acceptance of homosexual practices among working-class, heteronormative men), the use of [[house concert]]s as covers for sexual activity, a discussion of the "panzy craze", and the relative novelty of the category of "closeted" gay men. According to Chauncey, it was not until the 1930s and afterward that a strict regime of policing gay male sexuality emerged. It was in this period, he contends, that homosexual behavior began to move underground.

Chauncey wrote an historical defense of [[gay marriage]].{{Context inline|date=June 2016}} He is currently finishing a history of gay New York from the mid-twentieth century to the present.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Chauncey is the recipient of fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Humanities Center]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Center for Scholars and Writers at the [[New York Public Library]].

== Expert testimony ==
Chauncey has testified as an [[expert witness]] in several major gay rights cases, and he was the organizer and lead author of the Historians' Amicus Brief in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), which weighed heavily in the Supreme Court's landmark decision overturning the nation's remaining sodomy laws. In that brief, Chauncey argued for the historical specificity of understandings of sodomy, challenging the reasoning in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' (1986) that antisodomy laws were an enduring feature of the American legal system.

Chauncey most notably testified as an expert witness in the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] case, ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', on behalf of the successful [[plaintiff]]s.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', at 20-21, 29-30, 71, 85, 93, 96, 97, 99-110, 134.  Found at [http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i//MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/Life/gaymarriage.pdf on MSNBC media website], at pp. 22-23, 31-32, 73, 87, 95, 98, 99, 101-111, 136.  Accessed August 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Perry'' case, the Court found him to be "qualified to offer testimony on social history, especially as it relates to gays and lesbians."&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; The court recounted his academic qualifications, citing his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], his authorship of books, and original research using primary sources.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; The decision cited Chauncey's testimony on a dozen [[Issue of fact|issues of fact]] or [[Point of law|points of law]] that were [[relevancy|relevant]] to the case.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

'''Heinrich Friedjung''' (January 18, 1851 – July 14, 1920) was an [[Austria]]n historian and journalist.

Friedjung was born in [[Roschtin]] ({{lang-cs|Roštín}}), [[Moravia]] (then, [[Austrian Empire]]; today, [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a [[Jewish]] family grew up in [[Vienna]], and studied history in [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]] under [[Theodor Mommsen]] and [[Leopold von Ranke]]. He taught history and [[German language]] at the [[Commercial Academy]] (''Handelsakademie'') in Vienna from 1873 to 1879; he was then fired for criticizing the government.

He subsequently became active in politics, notably for his liberal and [[German nationalism in Austria|German-nationalistic]] views and support for the Greater German solution to the [[German question]].

Friedjung died in Vienna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">'''Janet Kitz''' (born January 1, 1930) is an author and historian in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] who played a key role in the recognition of the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]], the largest man-made explosion prior to the atomic bomb and the worst man-made disaster in Canadian history.

==Family and education== 
Janet F. Kitz, (née Brownlee) was born in [[Carnwath]], [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] in 1930. She studied at the Lanark Grammar School and earned a Teaching Certificate from [[Jordanhill College]] in [[Glasgow]]. Kitz taught first in Edinburgh and then in London and [[Davos, Switzerland]]. She also worked as a British Red Cross Welfare Officer in Davos. Janet emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1971 following her marriage to [[Leonard Arthur Kitz]], a lawyer and former mayor of Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.ca/academics/archives/janet-k.html ”Janet F. Kitz Doctor of Letters”, Saint Mary’s University, Honorary Degrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Halifax explosion==
===Museum work===
Kitz had never heard of the Halifax explosion before she moved to Halifax. However, while taking anthropology courses at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary’s University]], Kitz grew interested in the disaster and its effects on the people of Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Inness and Tracy Leal, "Putting a Face on a disaster", ''Halifax Chronicle Herald'', December 2, 2007, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1917 munitions explosion killed nearly 2,000 people but was little known outside of Halifax. Only two books had been written about the event in the 70 years after the explosion and the only commemoration was a library in the North End of Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;Shania Luck, "Halifax Explosion Gaining Momentum", ''Halifax Chronicle Herald'', December 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
After writing a paper about the explosion, Kitz was hired by the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] to assist the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in cataloguing thousands of objects in the mortuary collection of objects from victims of the explosion discovered in the basement of [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|the provincial legislature]]. This led to a temporary exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic called "A Moment in Time" in 1987 which was expanded to become a permanent exhibit curated by Kitz called "Halifax Wrecked" in 1994. Kitz also became to interview survivors of the explosion and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Inness and Leal, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Kitz’s work at the museum led her to write the 1989 book ''[[Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery]]''. The book combined artifact research, oral history and documentary history to explore the explosion through the families involved. It has remained a definitive account which has influenced numerous works published since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/on-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-halifax-explosion-two-new-books-examine-the-disasters-place-in-canadasmythology/article37123260/ Dean Jobb, “The Halifax Explosion Still Reverberates”, ''Globe and Mail'', December 2, 2017, p.

[[File:The Reverend John Allen Giles (1836–1840), by Charles J. Grant.jpg|thumb|John Allen Giles by Charles J. Grant.]]
Rev. '''John Allen Giles''' (1808–1884) was an English historian. He was primarily known as a scholar of [[Anglo-Saxon language]] and history. He revised Stevens' translation of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''. He was a fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;1852 reprinted in ''Good stories from Oxford and Cambridge and the dioceses'' 1922 "Miss Brassie spilled a glass of wine when she was eight years old ; J. A. Giles was sitting next to her, and observed that it was an unladylike thing. " Not so unladylike," replied she, " to spill the wine, as it is ungentlemanlike in you to tell me of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of William Giles and his wife Sophia, née Allen, he was born on 26 October 1808 at Southwick House, in the parish of [[Mark, Somerset]]. At the age of sixteen he entered [[Charterhouse School]] as a Somerset scholar. From Charterhouse he was elected to a Bath and Wells scholarship at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], on 26 November 1824. In Easter term 1828 he obtained a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Variations of first-class honours|double first class]], and shortly afterwards graduated B.A., proceeding M.A. in 1831, in which year he gained the Vinerian scholarship, and took his D.C.L. degree in 1838. His election to a fellowship at Corpus on 15 November 1832 followed his college scholarship as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Giles, John Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giles wished to become a barrister, but was persuaded by his mother to take orders, and was ordained to the curacy of [[Cossington, Somerset|Cossington]], Somerset. The following year he vacated his fellowship, and was married. In 1834 he was appointed to the head-mastership of [[Camberwell Collegiate School]], and on 24 November 1836 was elected head-master of the [[City of London School]]. The school did not do well under him, and he resigned on 23 January 1840; his resignation, however, has also been attributed to some misfortune connected with building speculations. He was succeeded by [[George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer]]. He retired to a house which he built near [[Bagshot]], and there took pupils, and wrote.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

After a few years Giles became curate of [[Bampton, Oxfordshire]], where he continued taking pupils, and edited and wrote a great number of books. Among them was one entitled ''Christian Records'', published in 1854, which related to the age and authenticity of the books of the New Testament. [[Samuel Wilberforce]] as [[bishop of Oxford]], required him, on pain of losing his curacy, to suppress this work, and break off with another literary undertaking. After some letters, which were published, he complied with the bishop's demand.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In September 1846 Giles secured an introduction to [[André-Marie Ampère|Ampère]] from [[Sainte-Beuve]],and subsequently contributed amongst other works six volumes of Bede to [[Migne]]'s [[Patrologia Latina]].

On 6 March 1855 Giles was tried at the Oxford spring assizes before [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]], on the charges of having entered in the marriage register book of Bampton parish church a marriage under date 3 October 1854, which took place on the 5th, having himself performed the ceremony out of [[canonical hours]], soon after 6 a.m.; of having falsely entered that it was performed by license; and of having forged the mark of a witness who was not present. He pleaded not guilty, but it was clear that he had committed the offence to cover the pregnancy of one of his servants, whom he married to her lover, Richard Pratt, a shoemaker's apprentice. Pratt's master, one of Giles's parishioners, instituted the proceedings. Giles spoke on his own behalf, and declared that he had published 120 volumes. His bishop also spoke for him. He was found guilty, but strongly recommended to mercy. Lord Campbell sentenced him to a year's imprisonment in [[Oxford Castle]]. After three months' imprisonment he was released by royal warrant on 4 June.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

After two or three years Giles took the curacy, with sole charge, of [[Perivale]] in [[Middlesex]], and after five years became curate of [[Harmondsworth]], near [[Slough]]. At the end of a year he resigned this curacy, and went to live at [[Cranford, London|Cranford]], nearby, where he took pupils, and after a while moved to [[Ealing]]. He did not resume clerical work until he was presented in 1867 to the living of [[Sutton, Surrey]], which he held for seventeen years, until his death on 24 September 1884.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Much of Giles's work was hasty, and done for booksellers. His ''Scriptores Græci minores'' was published in 1831, and his ''Latin Grammar'' reached a third edition in 1833. He published a ''Greek Lexicon'' in 1839.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Between 1837 and 1843 Giles published the ''Patres Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ'', a series of thirty-four volumes, containing the works of [[Aldhelm]], [[Bæda]], [[Boniface]], [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop Thomas]], [[John of Salisbury]], [[Peter of Blois]], [[Gilbert Foliot]], and other authors. Giles published his translation of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]’s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' in 1842&lt;ref&gt;It was reprinted in 1848 and 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes the ''[[Prophecies of Merlin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Merlin: The Prophetic Vision and the Mystic Life|last = Stewart|first = Robert John|publisher = RJ Stewart Books|year = 2009|isbn = 9780981924656|location = Arcata California|pages = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several volumes of the [[Caxton Society]]'s publications were edited by him, chiefly between 1845 and 1854. Among these were ''Anecdota Bædæ et aliorum'', ''Benedictus Abbas, de Vita S. Thomæ'', ''[[Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense]]'', ''La révolte du Conte de Warwick'', and ''Vitæ quorundam Anglo-Saxonum''. His ''Scriptores rerum gestarum Willelmi Conquestoris'' was published in 1845.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Giles contributed to [[Bohn's Antiquarian Library]] translations of ''Matthew Paris'' (1847), ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', (1849), and other works. In 1845 he published ''Life and Times of Thomas Becket'', 2 vols., translated into French, 1858; in 1847, ''History of the Ancient Britons'', 2 vols., and in 1848, ''Life and Times of Alfred the Great''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In 1848, he produced ''Six Old English Chronicles''&lt;ref&gt;''Six Old English Chronicles, of Which Two Are Now First Translated from the Monkish Latin Originals''; it included [[Æthelweard (historian)|Ethelwerd's ''Chronicle'']], [[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Asser's ''Life of Alfred'']], [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]’s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|British History]]'', [[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae|Gildas]], [[Historia Brittonum|Nennius]], and [[The Description of Britain|Richard of Cirencester]]. Later (posthumous) editions allowed that the "translation [of Nennius] is substantially that of the Rev. W. Gunn, Published in 1819" and that the work attributed to Richard of Cirencester was actually an 18th century forgery by [[Charles Bertram]].&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly reprinted previously published material.

In 1847–8 appeared his ''History of Bampton'', 2 vols., and in 1852 his ''History of Witney and some neighbouring Parishes''. While at Bampton, in 1850 he published ''Hebrew Records'' on the age and authenticity of the books of the Old Testament, and in 1854 ''Christian Records on the Age, Authorship, and Authenticity of the Books of the New Testament'', in which he contended, in a preface dated 26 October 1853, that the "Gospels and Acts were not in existence before the year 150", and remarks that "the objections of ancient philosophers, Celsus, Porphyry, and others, were drowned in the tide of orthodox resentment" (see ''Letters of the Bishop of Oxford and Dr. J. A. G.'', published in a separate volume).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; A review of Giles' 1854 ''Christian Records'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=John Allen|authorlink=John Allen Giles|title=Hebrew and Christian Records: An Historical Enquiry Concerning the Age and Authorship of the Old and New Testaments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDVVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR3|volume=1|year=1877|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|page=3|quote=Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=yDVVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1SZKPttmAIukoChg8zQZRTzzq0Xw&amp;ci=54%2C118%2C845%2C1409&amp;edge=0 Title&amp;nbsp;page] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=John Allen|authorlink=John Allen Giles|title=Hebrew and Christian Records: An Historical Enquiry Concerning the Age and Authorship of the Old and New Testaments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egHNEcFZ-x0C&amp;pg=PR3|volume=2|year=1877|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|page=3|quote=Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=egHNEcFZ-x0C&amp;pg=PR3&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U22FYX7tYj8kBrfLC6fckGiJ-G56w&amp;ci=35%2C125%2C874%2C1482&amp;edge=0  Title&amp;nbsp;page] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, "His [Giles] object is to establish ...that the historical books of the New Testament are without any evidence, external or internal, of origin from an [[Apostolic Age|apostolical period]] or source&amp;nbsp;; and abound in irreconcilable discrepancies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Foreign Quarterly Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O55ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA552|year=1854|publisher=Treuttel|page=552|quote=His [Giles] object is to establish&amp;nbsp;—against Paley especially— a set of purely negative results&amp;nbsp;; that the historical books of the New Testament are without any evidence, external or internal, of origin from an apostolical period or source&amp;nbsp;; and abound in irreconcileable discrepancies.

Gospels not Named by Him|quote=The testimony of Justin Martyr who wrote his "Apology for the Christians" in A.D. 151, must remove all doubt that the four evangelic histories were already in his time the basis of Christian teaching and the exclusive record of Christ's life and miracles. Such also is the common opinion respecting the origin of the Gospels&amp;nbsp;: taking for granted the report made by Lardner, and from him copied into the "Evidences of Christianity", few persons have ever compared the report with the original witnesses&amp;nbsp;; and never felt a misgiving that statements could, even unintentionally, be so perverted.

In 1853 he began to work on a series called ''Dr. Giles's Juvenile Library'', which went on appearing from time to time until 1860, and comprised a large number of school-books, ''First Lessons'' on English, Scottish, Irish, French, and Indian history, on geography, astronomy, arithmetic, &amp;c. He contributed ''Poetic Treasures'' to Moxon's ''Popular Poets'' in 1881.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

{{Politics of Lithuania}}
The following is a list of rulers over [[Lithuania]]—grand dukes, kings, and presidents—the heads of authority over historical Lithuanian territory. The timeline includes Lithuania as a sovereign entity or legitimately part of a greater sovereign entity as well as Lithuania under control or occupation of an outside authority (i.e., [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]). The incumbents and office-holders are listed by names most commonly used in [[English language]]. Where appropriate, the alternations in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (later [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) and [[Polish language|Polish]] are included.

The state of Lithuania formed in the 1230s, when threatened by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] in the north and the [[Teutonic Knights]] in the west, the [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] united under the leadership of [[Mindaugas]]. He became the only crowned [[king of Lithuania]]. His state became known as [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. After Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] became also king of [[Poland]] in 1386, the two states became closer connected and since 1440 both were ruled by a common ruler. In 1569 [[Union of Lublin]] was signed and a new entity—the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]—emerged. The [[Partitions of Poland|commonwealth was partitioned]] in 1795 and Lithuania became part of the [[Russian Empire]] till 16 February 1918. The [[Council of Lithuania]] was able to establish the sovereignty only in 1919, after Germany lost [[World War I]]. The first republic of Lithuania existed until 1940 when it was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet-German War]], Lithuania was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1944, as Germany was losing the war, Russia re-occupied Lithuania and established the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare independence. The restored Republic of Lithuania is a democratic republic, a member of both the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].

The monarchs retained separate titles for both parts of the state, and their numbering was kept separately. The [[Jagiellon dynasty]] was a direct continuation of the [[Gediminids]].

==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)==
{{main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established by [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569. The elected King of Poland was to be elected by Lithuanian noble families as a Grand Duke of Lithuania (until then Lithuanian dukedom was hereditary). The first ruler of the common country was Sigismund II Augustus. Following the partitions in 1772, 1793, and 1795, the commonwealth ceased to exist and Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire for 123 years. There are some gaps in the timeline as it took a while to elect a new king. The first Grand Duke elected after the Gediminyds line became extinct and after the Valois fled back to France was [[Stephen Báthory]], who had made an effort to be recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania by establishing [[Vilnius University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2350">'''Ludovico Baille''' ([[Cagliari]] February 3, 1764 &amp;ndash; Cagliari March 14, 1839)

Having graduated in law from the [[Reale Università di Cagliari]] he was appointed in 1786 to the Ministry of the Spanish government at [[Turin]], but his chief interest was in tracking down in [[archives]] and [[library|libraries]] the materials that would serve him for a planned history of his native [[Sardinia]], which remains in manuscript.

In 1800, he returned to Sardinia and continued his research. He was an active member of the Royal Society of Agriculture and Economics and president of the University library, while he held official posts as censor and assistant to the reform magistracy. A member of various academies, he maintained correspondence with many of the Italian scholars of his day:  Mattei, Marini, Vernazza, and Angius. In the last decade of the 18th century, Baille was the guiding spirit behind the institution at Cagliari of a museum of antiquities and of natural history.

His papers, both edited and unedited, constitute one of the important sources for the study of Sardinian history. In his spare time he composed [[sonnet]]s.

The Baille archives are at the Biblioteca Universitaria di Cagliari. They include a parchment codex containing the acts of the Sardinian [[synod]] held at [[Santa Giusta]], November 3, 1226 and the 16th-century manuscript of [[Giovanni Proto Arca]]'s seven books of the natural and moral history of Sardinia (''Naturalis et moralis historiae de rebus Sardiniae, libri septem''), among other documents.

His published works include:
*''Il sigillo dei bassi tempi'', Torino, 1797.
*''Il sigillo secondo dei bassi tempi'', Torino, 1800.
*''Iscrizioni latine'', Cagliari, 1821, 1831, 1832, 1830.
*''Sonetti,'' Cagliari, 1784-89-93. 1803-7-12-16-22-23-24-26-27-31.

Also in manuscript are his notes on economics, a dissertation on Sardinia, records of his voyages in 1788&amp;ndash;89, and notes on antiquities.

'''Maashaus''' ({{lang-de|Maßhaus}}) is a spacious room taking the whole front part of a ground floor of a multi-storied [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] town house.

This room was used mainly for serving beer, or other kinds of trade and craft. It was not heated. It also worked to link together other parts of the house, since it held a staircase to the first floor above ground (where the owner lived) and to the basement, an archway or similar passage to the courtyard and so on. The ceiling was almost always [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and was often supported by an asymmetrically placed central [[column]]. It was separated from the street or the arcade by a wall with a doorway and one or more windows.

==Origins==

Maashauses started to appear in the 13th century as a manifestation of the trend to sequester the living quarters of a burgers' house to the first floor. What used to be a main living room of the house, the so-called smoke abode, kept only its public, trade and craft functions, which remained on the ground floor, because they required the proximity of the cellar, the courtyard and especially the street entrance. The trade activities involved mainly the aforementioned serving of beer, which is related to the [[brewing right]]s (in the [[Middle Ages]] a vast majority of burgers' houses were granted this right), but other trade and crafts were performed there also.

==Maashauses in Bohemia==

In the 19th century most maashauses were converted to private shops. Later, they were being renovated in many historic cities as part of restoration activities in the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|socialist period]]. To this day, maashauses are found in many buildings in the centers of [[Český Krumlov|Česky Krumlov]], [[Slavonice]] and so on. After 1989 many maashauses were again employed for retail or by pubs and restaurants.

==Etymology==
"[[Maß]]“ is  an old unit of volume (approximately equivalent to 1.4 [[Litre|l]]), used for measuring mainly [[beer]], ''haus'' means a "house“ in German, but in the past it could also stand for the main living room of a house. Therefore, maashaus could be translated as a "beer house".

In 1967, Tushnet received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karr |first1=Mia C. |title=Law Professor Included on Conservative Nonprofit’s ‘Watchlist’ |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/11/28/law-prof-conservative-watchlist/ |accessdate=August 15, 2018 |work=Harvard Crimson |date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pazzanes |first1=Christina |title=Are there holes in the Constitution? |url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/are-there-holes-in-the-constitution/ |accessdate=August 15, 2018 |work=Harvard Law Today Magazine |date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in history from [[Yale University]] and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[Yale Law School]]. Tushnet has been a faculty member at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and he taught for many years at the [[Georgetown University Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Faculty Notes |journal=The Gargoyle-Alumni Magazine of the University of Wisconsin Law School |date=Autumn 1977 |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=https://issuu.com/wisclaw/docs/gargoyle_09_1|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faculty Bio-Mark Tushnet |url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/mark-tushnet/ |publisher=Georgetown Law Center |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter|first1=Brian|title=Harvard Makes Offer to Mark Tushnet |url=http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2006/02/harvard_makes_o.html |publisher=Blog: Brian Leiter's Law School Reports |date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tushnet served as a law clerk to [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]] on the Supreme Court between 1972 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mineo |first1=Liz |title=Thurgood Marshall: The soundtrack of their lives Five former clerks of the Supreme Court justice and civil rights champion recall the man who became an icon |url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/thurgood-marshall-soundtrack-lives/ |accessdate=August 15, 2018 |work=Harvard Law Today Magazine |date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 congressional hearing on President [[Bill Clinton]]'s veto of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], Tushnet testified about his involvement in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the 1973 case that struck down state laws prohibiting abortion. During questioning it was alleged that a memorandum written by Tushnet to Marshall had a significant influence on the outcome of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origins &amp; Scope of Roe v.

One of the more controversial figures in constitutional theory, he is identified with the '[[critical legal studies]]' movement and once stated in an article that, were he asked to decide actual cases as a judge, he would seek to reach results that would "advance the cause of socialism".&lt;ref&gt;"The Dilemmas of Liberal Constitutionalism," 42 ''[[Ohio State Law Journal]]'' 411, 424 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Tushnet is a main proponent of the idea that [[judicial review]] should be strongly limited and that the Constitution should be returned "to the people."  Tushnet is, with Harvard Law Professor [[Vicki Jackson]], the co-author of a [[casebook]] entitled ''Comparative Constitutional Law'' ([[Foundation Press]], 2d ed. 2006).

Thom applied the statistical ''lumped variance test'' of J.R. Broadbent&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent S.R., Quantum hypothesis, Biometrika, 42, 45-57 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; on this quantum and found the results significant,&lt;ref name="KelleyMilone2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David H.

==Other units==
Thom suggested  that "There must have been a headquarters from which standard rods were sent out but whether this was in these islands or on the Continent the present investigation cannot determine."&lt;ref name="Thom1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Margaret Ponting has suggested that artefacts such as a marked bone found during excavations at [[Dail Mòr]] near [[Callanish]], the [[Patrickholme bone bead]] from [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Dalgety bone bead]] from [[Fife]] in [[Scotland]] have shown some evidence of being [[measuring rod]]s based on the Megalithic Yard in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Ruggles2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Ponting|chapter=Megalithic Callanish|editor=Clive Ruggles|title=Records in Stone: Papers in Memory of Alexander Thom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3JGYd1kJoC&amp;pg=PA431|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53130-6|pages=423–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[oak]] rod from the [[Iron Age]] fortified settlement at [[Borre Fen]] mearured {{convert|53.15|in|cm}} with marks dividing it up into eight parts of {{convert|6.64|in|cm}}.

V. Glob in 1875 measured {{convert|30.9|in|cm}}. Keith Critchlow suggested this may have shrunk {{convert|0.63|in|cm}} from its original length of one Megalithic Yard over a period of 3000 years.&lt;ref name="Critchlow1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Critchlow|title=Time stands still: new light on megalithic science, p. 37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK3aAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1979|publisher=Gordon Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom  made a comparison of his Megalithic Yard with the Spanish [[Spanish customary units#Vara (unit of length)|vara]], the pre-metric measurement of Iberia, whose length was {{convert|2.7425|ft|m}}. Archaeologist [[Euan Mackie]] noticed similarities between the Megalithic Yard and a unit of measurement extrapolated from a long, marked shell from [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] and ancient measuring rods used in mining in the [[Austria]]n [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]].&lt;ref name="MacKie1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Euan Wallace MacKie|title=The megalith builders, p. 192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7gOBAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1977|publisher=Phaidon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested similarities with other measurements such as the ancient  [[History of measurement systems in India|Indian ''gaz'']] and the [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Sumerian šu-du3-a]].&lt;ref name="MacKie1977"/&gt; Along with [[John Michell]], Mackie also noted that it is the diagonal of a rectangle measuring 2 by 1 [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Egyptian remen]]s.&lt;ref name="Michell1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Michell|title=City of Revelation: On the Proportion and Symbolic Numbers of the Cosmic Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHfubwAACAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1978|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-12321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKie1977a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Euan Wallace MacKie|title=Science and society in prehistoric Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3O-QgAACAAJ|accessdate=26 April 2011|year=1977|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-70245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Verify source|date=April 2011}} [[Jay Kappraff]] has noted similarity between the Megalithic Yard and the ancient [[Indus]] ''short yard'' of {{convert|33|in|m}}.&lt;ref name="Kappraff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Kappraff|title=Beyond measure: a guided tour through nature, myth, and number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAfBrK678_kC&amp;pg=PA237|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4702-7|pages=237–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Macaulay]]&lt;ref name="MacaulayBatchelor2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Macaulay|author2=Richard A.

==Reception==
Thom's proposals were initially ignored or regarded as unbelievable by mainstream archaeologists.&lt;ref name="KendallHodson1974a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David George Kendall|author2=F. R. Hodson|author3=Royal Society (Great Britain)|author4=British Academy|title=The Place of astronomy in the ancient world: a joint symposium of the Royal Society and the British Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHLvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 April 2011|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press for the British Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive Ruggles, citing astronomer Douglas C. Heggie, has said that both classical and Bayesian statistical reassessments of Thom's data "reached the conclusion that the evidence in favour of the MY was at best marginal, and that even if it does exist the uncertainty in our knowledge of its value is of the order of centimetres, far greater than the 1mm precision claimed by Thom. In other words, the evidence presented by Thom could be
adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the 'unit' reflecting an average length of pace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive|title=Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07814-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David George Kendall]] makes the same argument,&lt;ref name="KelleyMilone2011"/&gt; and says that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, and that a statistical analysis of sites would reveal whether they were measured by pacing or not. In an investigation for the [[Royal Academy]] Kendall concluded that there was evidence of a uniform unit in Scottish circles but not in English circles, and that further research was needed.&lt;ref name="KendallHodson1974b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David George Kendall|author2=F. R. Hodson|author3=Royal Society (Great Britain)|author4=British Academy|title=The Place of astronomy in the ancient world: a joint symposium of the Royal Society and the British Academy, Hunting Quanta, p. 249 &amp; 258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHLvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press for the British Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Hunting quanta |author= Kendall, D. G. |year= 1974 |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences |issue= 276 |pages= 231–266 |url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/74285?uid=3737952&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101451086431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistician P. R. Freeman reached similar conclusions and found that two other units fit the data as well as the yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A Bayesian Analysis of the Megalithic Yard |journal= Journal of the Royal Statistical Society |volume= 139 |issue= 1 |year= 1976 | url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2344382?uid=3737952&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101451301701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Heggie casts doubt on Thom's suggestion as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered "little evidence for a highly accurate unit" and "little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heggie|first=Douglas C.|title=Megalithic Science: Ancient Mathematics and Astronomy in North-west Europe|year=1981|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05036-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Rings of Stone: The Prehistoric Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland.'' [[Aubrey Burl]] calls the megalithic yard "a chimera, a grotesque statistical misconception." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balfour|first=M|author2=O GIngerich|title=Book-Review - Stonehenge and its Mysteries|journal=Journal of Historical Astronomy|year=1980|volume=SUPP. VOL.11, P.S104|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/JHAS./0011//0000104.000.html|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers have concluded that there is marginal evidence for a standardized measuring unit, but that it was not as uniform as Thom believed.&lt;ref name="KelleyMilone2011"/&gt;

==Arguments for a geometric derivation==
Some commentators upon Thom's megalithic yard (John Ivimy and then Euan Mackie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Euan Mackie|title=Science and Society in Prehistoric Briain, p. 53-57|year=1977|publisher=Paul Elek}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have noted how such a measure could relate to geometrical ideas found historically in two Egyptian metrological units; the remen of about 1.2 feet and royal cubit of about 1.72 feet. The remen and royal cubit were used to define land areas in Egypt: "On documentary and other evidence Griffith came to the conclusion that the square on the royal cubit was intended to be twice that on the remen; and Petri identified the remen as a length of 20 digits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.E.Berriman|title=Historical Metrology, p. 71|year=1953|publisher=J.M.Dent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A square with side length equal to the diagonal of a square with side length equal to one remen has an area of one square royal cubit, ten thousand (a myriad) of which defined an Egyptian land measure,  the setat. [cite mackie] John Ivimy noted that "The ratio MY : Rc is SQRT(5) : SQRT(2) to the nearest millimeter, which makes the MY equal to SQRT(5) remens, or the length of a 2 x 1 remen rectangle.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Ivimy|title=The Sphinx and the Megaliths, p. 132|year=1974|publisher=Turnstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; see figure below.
[[File:Derivation of Megalithic Yard from Remen and Royal Cubit.png|thumb|Explains how some have derived Thom's Megalithic Yard unit of measure from metrological land measure relationships established historically in Egypt's Dynastic periods]]
The main weakness in this argument is probably that, in order to derive their yard, the builders of the megalithic monuments would have needed the remen and royal cubit, upon which this geometrical relationship relies.

It officially began in August 2014.

Political analysts likewise suggested that the insurgent leader's death will likely lead to Al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution.&lt;ref name="Ucdostgl"&gt;{{cite news|title=US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader |url=http://www.wsvn.com/story/26458182/pentagon-confirms-death-of-somalia-terror-leader |accessdate=6 September 2014 |agency=Associated Press |date=5 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906201659/http://www.wsvn.com/story/26458182/pentagon-confirms-death-of-somalia-terror-leader |archivedate=6 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===August 2014===

====16 August====
*Hiraan region Governor Abdifatah Hassan Afrah indicates that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have liberated a number of towns in the region from the Al-Shabaab militants. Among the captured local areas are Abesale, Badi Keen, Buuq Goosaar, El Ade and Far Libah.&lt;ref name="Sgskibgnal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Govt soldier killed in Beledweyne Gun Attack, new areas liberated|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/116/somalia-govt-soldier-killed-in-beledweyne-gun-attack-new-areas-liberated|accessdate=16 August 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====17 August====
*Somali national army forces assisted by AMISOM troops begin a major military operation against Al-Shabaab in central Somalia. The move comes 24 hours after the national chief of military announced the start of new offensives against the insurgent group. Hiran Governor Abdifatah Hassan indicates that the allied forces are slated to liberate the remaining parts of the province that are under militant control, and in the process remove roadblocks that the insurgents erected. An RBC Radio correspondent in Beledweyne also reports that the allied forces have left Buloburte in Hiran and are heading toward Burane in the Middle Shabelle province. Additionally, Hassan indicates that AMISOM's Ethiopian contingent left Elbur in the Galgadud province and are bound for Al-Shabaab controlled areas.&lt;ref name="Smocicsr"/&gt;

*Somali government forces assisted by Ethiopian AMISOM troops capture [[Tiyeglow]] from Al-Shabaab. The offensive is part of a larger military cleanup operation dubbed "Operation Indian Ocean". Situated around 530&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Mogadishu along the main road linking Beledweyne and Baidoa, Tiyeglow previously served as a strategic base for the insurgent group. Witnesses indicate that the Al-Shabaab fighters mounted no resistance during the raid, fleeing instead to adjacent forested areas. According to AMISOM, the successful military operation deprives the insurgent group of high extortion fees that it would previously charge to vehicles traveling along the town's principal road. The siege also now gives the Somali government full control of the [[Bakool]] province. Additionally, AMISOM representatives indicate that, in an attempt to slow the allied forces' march, the insurgents planted roadside explosive devices before fleeing, which they were presently defusing.&lt;ref name="Sfaalttbrfa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia forces and AMISOM liberate Tiyeeglow town in Bakool region from al-shabaab|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/202/somali-forces-and-amisom-liberate-tiyeeglow-town-in-bakool-region-from-alshabaab|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====30 August====
*General Abdirizak Khalif Elmi, frontline armed forces commander-in-chief, announces that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have seized [[Bulo Marer]] in the Lower Shabelle province from Al-Shabaab. Located between 115&amp;nbsp;km to 120&amp;nbsp;km south of Mogadishu, the town previously served as a strategic base and tax collection center for the insurgent group, from which it would launch attacks on other areas. According to witnesses, the militants mounted a heavy armed resistance, with the battle for control of the town lasting several hours. The joint allied forces also captured Goolweyn and Jerlio before heading to Bulo Marer. Government and AMISOM forces are now marching toward the port city of [[Barawa|Barawe]], Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold in the province. The militants reportedly already transported radio broadcasting equipment for the purpose.&lt;ref name="Satsamoobm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali, AU troops squeeze Al Shabaab militants out of Bulo Marer|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/242/somali-au-troops-squeeze-al-shabaab-militants-out-of-bulo-marer|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saedcbmcfotlb"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: AU Envoy describes capture of Bulo Marer as critical for operations to liberate the port city of Baraawe|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-au-envoys-describes-capture-of-bulo-marer-is-critical-for-operations-to-liberate-the-port-city-of-baraawe/|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=30 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903062822/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-au-envoys-describes-capture-of-bulo-marer-is-critical-for-operations-to-liberate-the-port-city-of-baraawe/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hiran Governor Abdifatah Hassan announces that the Somali National Army assisted by Djiboutian AMISOM forces are securing adjacent areas before entering Jalalaqsi in the Hiran province. Al-Shabaab militants had vacated the town the day before ahead of the allied forces' march.&lt;ref name="Ssamtatjtihr"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: SNA and AMISOM troops advance towards Jalalaqsi town in Hiran region|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-sna-and-amisom-troops-advance-towards-jalalaqsi-town-in-hiran-region/|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Heavily armed Al-Shabaab militants attack the Godka Jilacow prison in Mogadishu, a key interrogation center run by the National Intelligence and Security Agency. The raid is an apparent attempt to free other insurgents held at the facility. It begins when a vehicle carrying explosives detonates at the prison gates, with militants armed with guns and grenades then attempting to penetrate the compound. According to Somali police Capt. Mohamed Hussein, prison guards manage to repel the attack, killing all of the attackers. Witnesses also report that no prisoners have escaped. Ministry of National Security spokesman Mohamed Yusuf Osman indicates that seven Al-Shabaab fighters, three security guards and one civilian were killed during the gunfight. Al-Shabaab later claims responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name="Saraotp"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Army Repels Attack on Top Prison|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/somalia-extremists-attack-high-security-prison-25194397|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ekamapis"&gt;{{cite news|title=11 Killed as Militants Attack Prison in Somalia|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/explosion-gunfire-at-somali-intelligence-offices/2433747.html|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=VOA|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM soldiers begin a military offensive against Al-Shabaab insurgents in the Middle Shabelle province. According to regional Governor Ali Mohamud Gudlawe, the march is part of a larger, nationwide security cleanup operation to remove the militants from their remaining bastions. The joint forces are reportedly heading from Mahaday to villages situated near the local river, with residents indicating that an allied convoy is making its way toward the principal corridor adjoining the Hiran province. Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Mus’ab states that his group will try and halt the government and AMISOM forces' advance by laying siege to towns that the allied forces have liberated.&lt;ref name="Smosimsr"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Military operation starts in Middle Shabelle region|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-military-operation-starts-in-middle-shabelle-region/|accessdate=31 August 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud a few hours later orders a full public inquiry into the attack.&lt;ref name="Spshhoafpeianfm"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: President says he has ordered a full, public enquiry into the attack on NISA facility in Mogadishu|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-president-says-he-has-ordered-a-full-public-enquiry-into-the-attack-on-nisa-facility-in-mogadishu/|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=1 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104931/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-president-says-he-has-ordered-a-full-public-enquiry-into-the-attack-on-nisa-facility-in-mogadishu/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture Fidow in Middle Shabelle from Al-Shabaab. It is situated 60&amp;nbsp;km from the provincial capital Jowhar. The militants reportedly vacated the village ahead of the raid.&lt;ref name="Sjfcfmsr"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Joint forces capture Fidow, Middle Shabelle region|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-joint-forces-capture-fidow-middle-shabelle-region/|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=31 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903151959/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/08/somalia-joint-forces-capture-fidow-middle-shabelle-region/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Somali government forces and AMISOM troops seize Kurtunwaarey in Lower Shabelle from Al-Shabaab. It is situated 20&amp;nbsp;km west of the Bulo Marer district. The militants reportedly vacated the town before the arrival of the allied forces.&lt;ref name="Jfskt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joint forces seize Kurtunwaarey town|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=3356|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Goobjoog|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2014===

====1 September====
*Arriving from the Middle Shabelle regional capital of Jowhar, Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops from the Burundian contingent capture Kililka Shiinaha and Dhiin Garas from Al-Shabaab. According to Somali National Army mobilizer Abdirizak Khalif Elmi, the allied forces are now heading toward Jalalaqsi. Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur Siidi also indicates that the joint forces will lay siege to the Al-Shabaab bastions of Saakow and Bu'ale in the Middle Jubba province.&lt;ref name="Safatasht"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali, AU forces advance towards Al Shabaab-held town|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/258/somali-au-forces-advance-towards-al-shabaabheld-town|accessdate=2 September 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*U.S. military forces conduct an operation against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. [[John Kirby (soldier)|John Kirby]] indicates that they are still assessing the raid's impact. Masked militants subsequently begin mass arrests of local residents under charges of spying. Additionally, a senior Somali intelligence official states that the U.S. drone strike was targeting the Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane ([[Moktar Ali Zubeyr]]) as he was leaving a gathering of the group's senior commanders. The meeting was reportedly over the ongoing joint offensive by Somali military and AMISOM forces against Al-Shabaab's remaining bastions. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official adds that the attack occurred in a forest adjacent to Sablale district, and also suggests that Godane may have been killed during the drone strike.&lt;ref name="Ufsieis"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. forces strike Islamic extremists in Somalia|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/u-s-forces-strike-islamic-extremists-in-somalia/|accessdate=2 September 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Umcois"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. military conducts operation in Somalia |url=http://www.click2houston.com/news/us-military-conducts-operation-in-somalia/27828716 |accessdate=2 September 2014 |agency=CNN |date=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903123035/http://www.click2houston.com/news/us-military-conducts-operation-in-somalia/27828716 |archivedate=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials later clarify that the strike was carried out via both drone and manned aircraft, with U.S. special operations forces destroying a vehicle and training camp using laser-guided munitions and Hellfire missiles.&lt;ref name="Pcdostl"/&gt; According to a U.S. government source, a Twitter account that was linked by American authorities to Al-Shabaab also declared that Godane had died during the raid. While the Arabic tweet's authenticity is being analyzed, Godane does not appear in any social media or other public outlet to confirm that he is still alive. Experts suggest that his death would trigger a power struggle within the militant group to fill the leadership void, and may ultimately lead to its fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Saoalstps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Attack on Al-Shabaab Islamist leader seen triggering power struggle|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/279/somalia-attack-on-alshabaab-islamist-leader-seen-triggering-power-struggle|accessdate=4 September 2014|agency=Reuters|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====3 September====
*Following a cabinet meeting, the federal government announces a 45-day ultimatum to Al-Shabaab members to surrender, disarm and renounce violence. According to Minister of National Security Khalif Ahmed Ereg, any individual who ignores the directive will be held legally accountable. The cabinet also calls on local Islamic scholars and society members to assist in convincing young militants to leave Al-Shabaab and join the peace process.&lt;ref name="Sggasfduts"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Gov’t gives Al Shabab members 45 days ultimatum to surrender|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-govt-gives-al-shabab-members-45-days-ultimatum-to-surrender/|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=3 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903155245/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-govt-gives-al-shabab-members-45-days-ultimatum-to-surrender/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Hiran regional administration announces that Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops have driven Al-Shabaab completely out of the Hiran province. The allied forces are now slated to open the road between Beledweyne and Bulobarte. Additionally, they are marching toward the remaining areas under militant control, including Barawe where a number of Al-Shabaab commanders reportedly reside.&lt;ref name="Sasdooh"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Al-shabab driven out of Hiran|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-al-shabab-driven-out-of-hiran/|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=Raxanreeb|date=3 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904084759/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/09/somalia-al-shabab-driven-out-of-hiran/|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====5 September====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11676">{{About|Karl Marx's statement|Slipknot's song|Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)}}
"[[Religion]] is the '''opium of the people'''" is one of the most frequently paraphrased statements of German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]]. It was translated from the [[German language|German]] original, {{lang|de|"Die Religion ... ist das Opium des Volkes"}} and is often rendered as "religion... is the [[opiate]] of the ''[[Common people|masses]]''."

The quotation originates from the introduction of Marx's work ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', which he started in 1843 but which was not published until after his death.  The introduction to this work was published separately in 1844, in Marx's own journal ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'', a collaboration with [[Arnold Ruge]].

The full quote from Karl Marx translates as: "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people". Often quoted only in part, the interpretation of the metaphor in its context has received much less attention.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15-38. [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Full quotation ==
{{main article|Marxism and religion}}

The quotation, in context, reads as follows (emphasis added):
{{quote|The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.

Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. ''Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.''

The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976.

== Meaning ==
Marx was making a [[structural functionalism]] argument about [[religion]], and particularly about [[organized religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pGbdI4L0qsC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=opiate|title=The Encyclopedia of World Religions|last=Ellwood|first=Robert S.|last2=Alles|first2=Gregory D.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=|isbn=9781438110387|location=|pages=160–161|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/intelligence/the_big_question/what_is_the_opium_of_the_people_|title=What is the opium of the people?|last=|first=|date=2015-01-05|work=|newspaper=[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]|access-date=2016-12-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that religion had certain practical functions in society that were similar to the function of [[opium]] in a sick or injured person: it reduced people's immediate suffering and provided them with pleasant illusions which gave them the strength to carry on. Marx also saw religion as harmful, as it prevents people from seeing the [[Social class#Marxist|class structure]] and [[Oppression#Class oppression|oppression]] around them, thus religion can prevent the necessary revolution.

== History ==
Marx wrote this passage in 1843 as part of the introduction to a book that criticized philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s 1820 book, ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.  The introduction was published in 1844 in a small journal.  The book itself was published [[Wikt:posthumously|posthumously]].

As the  ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'' journal had a print run of just 1,000, it had no popular effect during the 19th century.  The phrase became better known during the 1930s when Marxism was more popular.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Modern comparisons ==
Religion has become, in many Western countries, less common and less accepted since Marx wrote this now-famous line.  Some writers speculate on what the modern "opium of the people" would be, such as [[Sports fan|sports fandom]], [[celebrities]], the distractions of television, internet, and other entertainment, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Similar statements ==
The same metaphor was used by many authors during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/11/opium-of-the-people-the-religious-heritage-of-karl-marx-and-the-frankfurt-school/|title=Opium of the People?

===Heinrich Heine===
In 1840, [[Heinrich Heine]] also used the same analogy, in his essay on [[Ludwig Börne]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Welcome be a religion that pours into the bitter chalice of the suffering human species some sweet, soporific drops of spiritual opium, some drops of love, hope and faith.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, Heinrich [https://books.google.com/books?id=UuGpguw7XhAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=heinrich+heine+%22ludwig+b%C3%B6rne%22+Opium&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OWnLU4CVBsq2yATOuIGwCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=heinrich%20heine%20%22ludwig%20b%C3%B6rne%22%20Opium&amp;f=false ''Ludwig Börne - a Memorial'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Kingsley]], a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Church of England]], wrote this four years after Marx:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22an+opium+dose+for+keeping+beasts%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=22iLvZxqi5&amp;sig=fxREGReXNbAdJEOIP0DsYMA9OgE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3bOaSvHLF5TJ-Qbi4-WOBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22an%20opium%20dose%20for%20keeping%20beasts%22&amp;f=false Reader in Marxist Philosophy by Howard Selsam, Harry Martel(1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miguel de Unamuno ===
[[Miguel de Unamuno]], the famed Spanish author of the [[Generation of '98]], focused his [[Nivola]] [[San Manuel Bueno, mártir]] around the theme of religion's opiatic affect on the people of rural Spain. In the book, the protagonist Don Manuel, is a priest who does not believe in God, but continues preaching because he sees the positive impact he can make in the lives of his parishioners. Religion in this way also serves to cure his own deep depression, through the happiness he feels from helping the people of Valverde de Lucerna. Unamuno makes direct reference to Marx when Don Manuel explains:
{{quote|Yes, I know that one of the leaders of what they call the social revolution has said that religion is the opium of the people. Opium… opium, yes! Let’s give them opium, and let them sleep and dream. And with this crazy activity of mine, I have also been using opium.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.armandfbaker.com/translations/unamuno/san_manuel_bueno_martir.pdf Miguel de Unamuno, ''San Manuel Bueno, Martír'' (1930). p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Lenin ===
[[Vladimir Lenin]], speaking of religion in ''Novaya Zhizn'' in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;''Novaya Zhizn'' No. 28, December 3, 1905, as quoted in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/dec/03.htm Marxists Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; alluded to Marx's earlier comments{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} (emphasis added):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven. ''Religion is opium for the people''. Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.

The '''Paris Gun''' ({{lang-de|Paris-Geschütz / Pariser Kanone}}) was the name given to a type of German long-range [[siege gun]], several of which were used to bombard [[Paris]] during [[World War I]]. They were in service from March to August 1918. When the guns were first employed, Parisians believed they had been bombed by a high-altitude [[Zeppelin]], as the sound of neither an aeroplane nor a gun could be heard. They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and are considered to be [[supergun]]s.

Also called the "''Kaiser Wilhelm Geschütz''" ("[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor William]] Gun"), they were often confused with [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]], the German [[howitzer]] used against the [[Liège (city)|Liège]] forts in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name, as well.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For an instance of war-time naming of this gun as "Big Bertha", see {{cite news | title = Paris again Shelled by Long-Range Gun | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 6, 1918 | page = 3 | format = PDF | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/06/97014230.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ley196112"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also confused with the smaller "[[Langer Max]]" (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived; although the famous [[Krupp]]-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.

As military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.

==Description==
[[File:George Eastman House - Bouvigny (French) - Emplacement d-une Bertha (pd).jpg|thumb|A Paris gun turntable mounting, as captured by United States forces near Château-Thierry, 1918 postcard]]
Due to the weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Allied offensives its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source—not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.

The gun was capable of firing a {{convert|106|kg|adj=on}}&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|120}} shell to a range of {{convert|130|km|mi|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|42.3|km|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|120}}—the greatest height reached by a human-made [[projectile]] until the first successful [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second trajectory,&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|33}} each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of {{convert|1640|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|33}} or 3,681 MPH

Seven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out [[38 cm SK L/45 "Max"]] gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from {{Convert|380|mm|in|0|sp=us}} to {{Convert|210|mm|in|0|sp=us}}. The tube was {{Convert|21|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long and projected {{Convert|3.9|m|ft|0|sp=us}} out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, 12-meter–long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of {{Convert|34|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|84}} This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun's [[rifling]].&lt;ref name="miller737"&gt;Miller (1921) pg.737&lt;/ref&gt; The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old 38&amp;nbsp;cm gun did not require modification or reinforcement.

Since it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|66}} It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a "noise-screen" chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.

The projectile was flying significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist [[Adam Hochschild]] put it this way: "It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of {{convert|25|mi}} at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere".&lt;ref&gt;''To End All Wars'' by Adam Hochschild c. 2011 Adam Hochschild(Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company New York; 2011) pp.320 - 321&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over {{Convert|130|km}}.

The unfinished [[V-3 cannon]] would have been able to fire somewhat larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished [[Project Babylon|Iraqi super gun]] would also have been substantially bigger.

[[File:Miller Paris Gun Shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Post-war diagram of a Paris gun shell&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1921) pg.742&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Paris Gun [[shell (projectile)|shells]] weighed {{convert|106|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|120}} The shells initially used had a diameter of {{convert|216|mm|abbr=on}} and a length of  {{convert|960|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|120}} The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} of [[TNT]].&lt;ref name=bull /&gt;{{rp|120}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This overall weight of Paris Gun shells is not atypical for artillery of this calibre. As a comparison, World War 1-era,  British [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI – VIII|BL 8-inch howitzer]] fired a {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shell. The 210mm shell fired by the World War 2-era [[21 cm Kanone 39]] weighed {{convert|135|kg|abbr=on}} and contained {{convert|18.8|kg|abbr=on}} of explosives (13.9% by weight).&lt;/ref&gt; The small amount of explosive – around 6.6% of the weight of the shell – meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell's size.&lt;ref name=Maitland&gt;{{cite journal | author=Major J. Maitland-Addison | title=The Long Range Guns | journal=The Field Artillery Journal |date=July–September 1918 | issue=3 | url=http://sill-www.army.mil/FAMAG/1918/JUL_SEP_1918/JUL_SEP_1918_PAGES_321_341.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of the shell casing, to withstand the forces of firing, meant that shells would explode into a comparatively small number of large fragments, limiting their destructive effect.&lt;ref name=Maitland /&gt; A crater produced by a shell falling in the [[Tuileries Garden]] was described by an eyewitness as being {{convert|10|to|12|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} across and {{convert|4|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} deep.&lt;ref name="miller83"&gt;Miller (1921) pg.83&lt;/ref&gt;

The shells were propelled at such a high velocity that each successive shot wore away a considerable amount of steel from the rifled bore. Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore, and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of {{convert|238|mm|abbr=on}} with a new set of shells.

The shell's explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuses was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuses proved very reliable as not one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris failed to detonate.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1921) pg.744&lt;/ref&gt; The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap – a highly unusual feature for the time – and the side had grooves that engaged with the [[rifling]] of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper [[driving band]]s provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.&lt;ref name=Maitland /&gt;

[[File:Eglise St Gervais Paris bombardement 1918.jpg|thumb|right|The damage to St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church (1918)]]
The gun was fired from a wooded hill (Le mont de Joie) near [[Crépy, Aisne|Crépy]] and the first shell landed at 7:18&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 21 March 1918 on the ''Quai de la Seine'', the explosion being heard across the city. Shells continued to land at 15 minute intervals, with 21 counted on the first day.&lt;ref name="miller723"&gt;Miller (1921) pg.723&lt;/ref&gt; The initial assumption was these were bombs dropped from an airplane or Zeppelin flying too high to be seen or heard.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This was not an unreasonable assumption, as Zeppelins on night-time air-raids over the United Kingdom had previously used the tactic of cutting their engines when upwind of the target, then releasing their bombs as they silently drifted overhead.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few hours, sufficient casing fragments had been collected to show that the explosions were the result of shells, not bombs. By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initially press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun.&lt;ref name="miller723" /&gt; The actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance&lt;ref name="miller728"&gt;Miller (1921) pg.728&lt;/ref&gt; aviator [[Didier Daurat]].

The Paris gun emplacement was dug out of the north side of the wooded hill at [[Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Position {{coord|49|31|40.43|N|3|18|17.57|E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gun was mounted on heavy steel rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.

The Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance was so far that the [[Coriolis effect]]—the rotation of the Earth—was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (west-southwest) from Crépy-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees North.

Between 320 to 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property.  The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a single shell hit the roof of the [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]], collapsing the roof on to the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service.  A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded.

The gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruyères-sur-Fère, near [[Château-Thierry]], but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n44hAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA937&amp;ots=vLkDBl-s4n&amp;dq=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&amp;pg=PA937#v=onepage&amp;q=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&amp;f=false|title=Columbia Alumni News|last=|first=|publisher=Alumni Council of Columbia University (Vol. 10, No. 30)|year=1918|isbn=|location=|pages=937|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War I==
[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 railway gun]] elevated to the firing position]]
Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.&lt;ref name="Venzon2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Cipriano Venzon|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-68446-4|pages=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun—which was specifically banned under the [[Versailles Treaty]]. This work would eventually lead to the [[V-2 rocket]] that was used in [[World War II]].

Despite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the [[21 cm K 12 (E)]], a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept.&lt;ref&gt;Ford (2000), p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp's engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K12 a [[railway gun]].

The first K12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France; they were used to shell [[Kent]] in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941. One gun was captured by Allied forces in the Netherlands in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ford (2000), p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A parody of the Paris Gun appears in the [[Charlie Chaplin]] movie ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.  Firing at the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]], the "Tomanians" (the fictional country that represented Germany) succeed in blowing up a small [[outhouse]]. The destruction of the St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church inspired [[Romain Rolland]] to write his novel ''[[Pierre et Luce]]''.

==Early life==
Peter John Anderson was the only son of Agnes Shaw Grant (daughter of Isabella Grant and Alexander Grant of Dundreggan, Glenmoriston) and Peter Anderson, solicitor in Inverness (1804-1868). He was "gold medallist of the Royal Academy in two successive years, and a graduate of the Universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh ... and Secretary of the New Spalding Club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Isabel Harriet |title=An Inverness Lawyer and His Sons, 1796-1878 |date=1900 |publisher=Aberdeen University Press |location=Aberdeen |page=244 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044081269292;view=1up;seq=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Isabel Harriet Grant Anderson, wrote a detailed family history, titled ''An Inverness Lawyer and His Sons, 1796-1878'', about their father, their uncles John and George Anderson, and of their grandfather, Peter Anderson (1768-1823), "Procurator Fiscal for the Burgh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Isabel Harriet |title=An Inverness Lawyer and His Sons, 1796-1878 |date=1900 |publisher=Aberdeen University Press |location=Aberdeen |page=1|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044081269292;view=1up;seq=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Librarianship and bibliographical activities==
Anderson was said to be indefatigable in his aim to make Aberdeen University library the best in the country.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; He was one of the founders, and the Secretary from the start, of the [[Spalding Club|New Spalding Club]] which published scholarly works about the history of Aberdeenshire.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;

==Philatelic writing==
Anderson was a prolific correspondent on matters philatelic, particularly in relation to literature, of which he seemed to possess, or have examined, a great deal. His first appearance in a philatelic journal was in ''[[The Stamp-Collector's Magazine]]'' of May 1869 when he would have been about sixteen years of age. He was a frequent contributor to ''[[The Philatelic Record]]'', being noted from 1880 when he wrote about the earliest appearances in philatelic literature of the early stamps of Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/philatelicrecord21880lond "The Bibliography of the Stamps of Mauritius."] Correspondence, ''The Philatelic Record'', Vol. 2, No. 21, October 1880, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 he wrote to the ''Record'' from the Aberdeen Conservative Club (as he often did) about discrepancies in the accounts of the use of British [[Impressed duty stamp|impressed]] newspaper stamps, comparing descriptions he had seen in different journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/philatelicrecord51883lond "Impressed Newspaper Stamps Before 1855."] Correspondence, ''The Philatelic Record'', Vol. 5, No. 52, May 1883, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Volume 6 he wrote about varieties of imitations of the [[Mulready stationery|Mulready Envelope]] and the numbers of stamps reported in different catalogues, and, beginning in Volume 7, about early English philatelic literature which series he subsequently turned into a book.

'''''Philoctetes''''' ({{lang-grc|Φιλοκτήτης}}) is a play by the [[Athens|Athenian]] poet [[Aeschylus]].  It was probably first produced during the 470s BCE.  It is now lost except for a few fragments.  Most of what we know of the plot is from the writings of 1st century orator [[Dio Chrysostom]], who compared the Philoctetes plays of Aeschylus, [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]].

==Fragments==
The few extant fragments from the play are not much use in reconstructing Aeschylus' treatment.&lt;ref name=fragments&gt;{{cite book|title=Euripides Fragments: Oedipus&amp;ndash;Chrysippus; Other Fragments|editor=Collard, C. |editor2=Cropp, M. J.|page=369|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674996311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One fragment mentions that Philoctetes' bow has been hung on a [[pine tree]].&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  Several are of Philoctetes commenting on the pain in his foot, including one in which he longs for death.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  We do know the broad outline of the plot from a comparison by [[Dio Chrysostom]] of the Aeschylus' ''Philoctetes'' with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Euripides)|Philoctetes]]'' (431 BCE) and [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'' (409 BCE).&lt;ref name=frag&gt;{{cite book|title=Aeschylus: Agamemnon, Libation-Bearers, Eumenides, Fragments|author=[[Herbert Weir Smyth|Smyth, H.W.]]|pages=464–467|year=1930|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;&lt;ref name=selected/&gt;

==Plot==
[[Philoctetes]] is mentioned briefly in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and his story was expanded on in [[Lesches]]' ''[[Little Iliad]]'' and [[Arctinus]]' ''[[Iliupersis]]''.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles' Philoctetes and the Great Soul Robbery|author=Austin, N.|pages=29–36, 77|year=2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299282745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greeks had abandoned Philoctetes on the island of [[Lemnos]] on their way to Troy because they could not stand his screams of pain and the odor from his wound after he was bitten by a poisonous snake.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  However, ten years into the [[Trojan War]] they found out that Philoctetes and his [[bow and arrows]] were required to conquer [[Troy]].&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;

In the original versions of the story, [[Diomedes]] was sent to recover Philoctetes and bring him back to Troy.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  However, in Aeschylus' play, [[Odysseus]], who was largely responsible for Philoctetes being marooned on Lemnos was sent to fetch him.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;&lt;ref name=selected&gt;{{cite book|title=Euripides: Selected Fragmentary Plays, Volume II|editor=Collard, C. |editor2=Cropp, M. J. |editor3=Gilbert, J.|chapter=Philoctetes|author=Collard, C.|page=2|year=2004|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips|isbn=9780856686214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to creating dramatic irony, the innovation of having Odysseus sent to fetch Philoctetes also has a benefit in that Odysseus is particularly known for his oratory skills, and oratory skills are particularly valuable in a Greek play.&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;  The plot point of having Odysseus being sent to recover Philoctetes after being responsible for his abandonment is a plot point that Euripides and Sophocles retained in their ''Philoctetes'' plays.&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;

Philoctetes did not recognize Odysseus at first as a result of the suffering Philoctetes endured for the prior ten years alone.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt; Odysseus gained Philoctetes' trust by falsely telling him that [[Agamemnon]], who was also responsible for Philoctetes' abandonment, had died and that Odysseus had been executed for committing a shameful crime.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  It is not known exactly how Odysseus ultimately secured Philoctetes bow and cooperation, or whether he took them by force as he attempted to do in Euripides' and Sophocles' versions.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;  Dio does tell us that Odysseus' pleas and lies were not inappropriate for someone of Odysseus' heroic stature.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;

According to [[Aspasius]], Aeschylus' and Sophocles' Philoctetes attempted to hide his pain at first, but eventually the pain was too great and he was forced to scream.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;

==Chorus==
The [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in the play is made up of men of Lemnos.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;&lt;ref name=clay/&gt;  In In Aeschylus' play, the men of Lemnos had not visited Philoctetes throughout his entire ten year time on the island.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;  Philoctetes told the chorus his backstory of being abandoned by the Greeks.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt; Dio considered Aeschylus' approach of having a chorus that had never visited Philoctetes but not apologizing for that more straightforward than Euripides' approach of an apologetic chorus.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;  In Sophocles' ''Philoctetes'', Lemnos is uninhabited, making the decision of the Greek commanders to maroon Philoctetes there even more heartless.&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;

==Reception==
Dio praised Aeschylus' version for its simplicity, dignity, grandeur and bold thought and language.&lt;ref name=frag/&gt;&lt;ref name=clay&gt;{{cite book|title=Philoctetes|author=Sophocles, Phillips, C. &amp; Clay, D.|chapter=Introduction|pages=9–11|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195136579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book|title=A Handbook of Classical Drama|author=Harsh, P.W.|pages=142&amp;ndash;143|year=1944|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804703802}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classics professor Norman Austin claims that Aeschylus' revisions to the original story actually make Aeschylus' story more Homeric.&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;

==Date==
The date of the original production of ''Philoctetes'' is unknown.&lt;ref name=clay/&gt;  However, it is generally believed that it was originally produced during the 470s BCE.&lt;ref name=selected/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles' Philoctetes and the Great Soul Robbery|author=Austin, N.|pages=6, 24|year=2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299282745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificial intelligence]] applications have been used in a wide range of fields including [[medical diagnosis]], [[stock trading]], [[robot control]], [[law]], scientific discovery and toys.  However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI:  "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/07/24/ai.bostrom/ AI set to exceed human brain power] CNN.com (July 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land?

To allow comparison with human performance, artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well-defined problems.  Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s.  Also, smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.

In his famous [[Turing test]], Alan Turing picked language, [[Animal language#Aspects of human language|the defining feature of human beings]], for its basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are many other useful abilities that can be described as showing some form of intelligence. This gives better insight into the comparative success of artificial intelligence in different areas.

In what has been called the [[Feigenbaum test]], the inventor of [[expert system]]s argued for subject specific expert tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward A.|date=2003|title=Some challenges and grand challenges for computational intelligence|journal=Journal of the ACM|volume=50|issue=1|pages=32–40|doi=10.1145/602382.602400|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] of [[Microsoft]] in 2003 suggested extending the Turing test to [[Speech recognition|speech understanding]], [[Speech synthesis|speaking]] and [[Outline of object recognition|recognizing objects]] and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Jim |year=2003|title=What Next?

Broad classes of outcome for an AI test may be given as:
* '''optimal''': it is not possible to perform better (note: some of these entries were solved by humans)
* '''super-human''': performs better than all humans
* '''high-human''': performs better than most humans
* '''par-human''': performs similarly to most humans
* '''sub-human''': performs worse than most humans

An expert poll around 2016, conducted by [[Katja Grace]] of the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] and associates, gave median estimates of 3 years for championship Angry Birds, 4 years for the World Series of Poker, and 6 years for StarCraft. On more subjective tasks, the poll gave 6 years for folding laundry as well as an average human worker, 7–10 years for expertly answering 'easily Googleable' questions, 8 years for average speech transcription, 9 years for average telephone banking, and 11 years for expert songwriting, but over 30 years for writing a New York Times bestseller or winning the [[Putnam competition|Putnam math competition]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;&lt;ref name=grace/&gt;

===Human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI)===
AI pioneer and economist [[Herbert A. Simon]] inaccurately predicted in 1965: "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". Similarly, in 1970 [[Marvin Minsky]] wrote that "Within a generation... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved."&lt;ref name=superintelligence&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199678112|language=en|title-link=Superintelligence (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median estimate among experts for when AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khatchadourian|first1=Raffi|title=The Doomsday Invention|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V. C., &amp; Bostrom, N. (2016). Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion. In Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence (pp. 555-572). Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grace poll around 2016 found results varied depending on how the question was framed. Respondents asked to estimate "when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers" gave an aggregated median answer of 45 years and a 10% chance of it occurring within 9 years. Other respondents asked to estimate "when all occupations are fully automatable. That is, when for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers" estimated a median of 122 years and a 10% probability of 20 years. The median response for when "AI researcher" could be fully automated was around 90 years. No link was found between seniority and optimism, but Asian researchers were much more optimistic than North American researchers on average; Asians predicted 30 years on average for "accomplish every task", compared with the 74 years predicted by North Americans.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Richard|title=How long will it take for your job to be automated?|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170619-how-long-will-it-take-for-your-job-to-be-automated|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=BBC|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite news|title=AI will be able to beat us at everything by 2060, say experts|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133188-ai-will-be-able-to-beat-us-at-everything-by-2060-say-experts/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=New Scientist|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grace&gt;Grace, K., Salvatier, J., Dafoe, A., Zhang, B., &amp; Evans, O.

{{History of Venezuela}}

[[Venezuela]] saw ten years of military dictatorship from 1948 to 1958. After the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état]] brought an end to a three-year experiment in democracy ("[[El Trienio Adeco]]"), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1952|presidential elections]]. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified and to one of the three leaders, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état]], which saw the advent of democracy with a transitional government under Admiral [[Wolfgang Larrazábal]] in place until the [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|December 1958 elections]]. Prior to the elections, three of the main political parties, [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Acción Democrática]], [[Copei|COPEI]] and [[Democratic Republican Union|Unión Republicana Democrática]], with the notable exclusion of the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]], signed up to the [[Punto Fijo Pact]] power-sharing agreement.

This period was characterised by the alternation of political power established in the Punto Fijo Pact; by the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1976 and the creation of [[PDVSA]], the national oil and gas company; and by the rise of new social elites. Internationally, Venezuela became a founding member of the [[OPEC|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). The 1980s in particular were characterised by the flowering of art and culture and by the artistic development of the nation, especially in television. Pioneering media like [[RCTV]] made Venezuela famous with soap operas such as ''[[Kassandra (TV series)|Kassandra]]''.

== Puntofijismo ==

===Betancourt administration (1959-1964)===
{{Main|Second Presidency of Rómulo Betancourt}}After a military ''coup d'état'' on 23 January 1958 sent General [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] into exile, Venezuela's three main political parties signed the [[Punto Fijo Pact]]. The ensuing elections brought [[Rómulo Betancourt]], who had been president [[El Trienio Adeco|from 1945 to 1948]], back to power. Betancourt's government halted grants to multinational oil companies, created a Venezuelan oil corporation, and helped establish OPEC in 1960, an initiative led by Development Minister [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]]. The administration also introduced a new constitution in 1961, dividing the government into executive, legislative, and judicial branches; pursued agricultural reform; and promoted an international doctrine in which Venezuela only recognised governments elected by popular vote.

The new order had its opponents. On 24 June 1960, Betancourt was wounded in an assassination attempt led by the [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869601,00.html|title=VENEZUELA: Trujillo's Murder Plot|date=18 July 1960|newspaper=Time|access-date=2015-12-31|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the left-wingers excluded from the Punto Fijo Pact began an armed invasion that was backed by the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] and its leader, [[Fidel Castro]].

=== Leoni and first Caldera term (1964-1974) ===
{{Main|Presidency of Raúl Leoni|First Presidency of Rafael Caldera}}In 1963, [[Raúl Leoni]] was elected to succeed Betancourt as president. Leoni's government became known for public works and cultural development, but was confronted with continuous [[guerrilla warfare]].

[[Rafael Caldera]] won the next election.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/americas/25caldera.html|title=Rafael Caldera, Ex-President of Venezuela, Dies at 93|date=24 December 2009|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2015-12-31|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he took office in 1969, the [[Rupununi Uprising]] broke out in neighboring [[Guyana]]. The border controversy was resolved with the [[Guayana Esequiba#Port of Spain Protocol|Port of Spain Protocol]] in 1970. Additionally, a truce with the guerrillas allowed their reintegration into political life.

=== First Carlos Andrés Pérez term (1974-1979) ===
{{Main|First Presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez}}[[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] took office in 1974, amid an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] that had begun the previous year and had increased the global price of oil from $3 per barrel to nearly $12 per barrel. Venezuela nationalised its iron industry in 1975 and its oil industry the following year.

===Herrera Campins and Lusinchi administrations (1979-1989)===
{{Main|Presidency of Luis Herrera Campins|Presidency of Jaime Lusinchi}}[[Luis Herrera Campins]] was elected to the presidency in 1979, with the country in deep debt and bound by [[International Monetary Fund]] demands. In 1983, the Venezuelan currency, the [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívar]], was devalued on what became known as Black Friday, unleashing an economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15287355|title=The weakening of the "strong bolívar"|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2015-12-31|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent government of [[Jaime Lusinchi]] did little to counter the crisis. Corruption increased, and the Caldas Corvettes crisis in 1987, sparked by a sovereignty dispute in the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], generated one of the biggest moments of [[Colombia–Venezuela relations|tension between Venezuela and Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/colombia-and-venezuela-the-border-dispute-over-the-gulf/|title=Colombia and Venezuela: The Border Dispute Over the Gulf|website=COHA|language=en-US|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Carlos Andrés Pérez term (1989-1993)===
{{Main|Second Presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez|Caracazo}}Pérez was elected again in 1988 and, looking to solve the recession, adopted economic measures that set off major protests, the biggest of which was the [[Caracazo]] wave of 1989. The same year, Venezuela held its first direct elections of governors and regional mayors.

In February and November 1992, [[Hugo Chávez]] led two ''coup d'état'' attempts, and in 1993, Congress ousted Pérez. [[Octavio Lepage]] served as acting president for about two weeks, at which point the historian and parliamentarian [[Ramón José Velásquez]] took over the interim role.

Pérez proved less generous with hand-outs than previously. Despite being elected after a populist, anti-[[neoliberal]] campaign during which he described the IMF as "a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing" and said that [[World Bank]] economists were "genocide workers in the pay of economic totalitarianism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/nov/09/1 |title=A beacon of hope for the rebirth of Bolívar's dream |accessdate=12 October 2008|last=Ali |first=Tariq|authorlink=Tariq Ali|date=9 November 2006|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had become a closet [[economic liberalism|liberalizer]] and [[globalisation|globalizer]]. His economic adviser was [[Moisés Naím]], today an influential journalist in the United States and the editor of the journal ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', and he defined the presidential economic agenda, which included no price controls, [[privatization]]s, and laws, or their elimination, to attract [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. Naím began at the lowest rung of economic liberalization, which was freeing controls on prices and a ten percent increase in that of gasoline,&lt;ref name="Jorge"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Joquera |first=Jorge|title=Venezuela: The Revolution Unfolding In Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUIiQCIygFcC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=carlos+andres+perez+liberalisation+petrol+prices+public+transport&amp;source=web&amp;ots=emRFJrzmBi&amp;sig=4jHacufo9S5KvGAOGX6sM7Q-bqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA1,M1|accessdate=12 October 2008|year=2003|publisher=Resistance Books |location=[[Chippendale, New South Wales]]|isbn=1-876646-27-6|page=10 |chapter=Neoliberalism, the erosion of consensus and the rise of a new popular movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Venezuela is sacrosantly very low. The increase in petrol price fed into a 30 percent increase in fares for public transport&lt;ref name="Jorge" /&gt; In February 1989, barely into his second term, Pérez faced a popular uprising, which he had the army crush with a death toll of 276, according to government officials. It is known as the "[[caracazo]]" (from "Caracas"), where the rioting and looting was on an unforeseen scale.

Pérez and Naím went on with their reforms, which had the full backing of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the Venezuelan economy started picking up, but only slightly and Venezuelans, who are not very keen on globalization, were resentful. Rightly or wrongly, Pérez, who after his first presidency was a rich man, was singled out as Mr. Corruption himself.

====1992 coup d'état attempts====
{{Main|1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts}}
The [[MBR-200]] officers started plotting seriously and [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|on 4 February 1992]] they struck. [[Hugo Chávez]] was a lieutenant-colonel, but other generals were also involved in the coup attempt. The plan involved members of the military overwhelming military locations and communication installations and then establishing [[Rafael Caldera]] in power once Perez was captured and assassinated.&lt;ref name=ENHfeb2015&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; They almost had him cornered in the presidential palace, but he managed to escape to the presidential residence and from there, loyal troops cornerered Chávez arrested him. In exchange for prompting his co-conspirators to lay down their arms, Chávez, fully uniformed and unbowed, was allowed to speak on television to the entire nation in a moment that captured Venezuela's attention and granted him a place on the nation's political stage.

On 27 November 1992, higher ranked officers tried to overthrow Pérez but the conspiracy was easily put down.

====Impeachment and transition====
Pérez's downfall came when a legal process was begun to force to him reveal how he had used a secret but legal{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} presidential fund, which he resolutely resisted. With the Supreme Court and Congress ranged against him, Pérez was imprisoned, for a while in a detention center, and then under house arrest. He handed the presidency in 1993 to [[Ramón José Velásquez|Ramón J. Velásquez]], an Adeco politician and historian who had been his presidential secretary. Though nobody has charged Velásquez with corruption, his son was involved in an illegal pardon for drug-traffickers, but was not charged. Velázquez oversaw the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1993|elections of 1993]], and these were familiar and unique.

===Second Caldera administration (1994-1999)===
{{Main|Second Presidency of Rafael Caldera}}

[[Rafael Caldera]], who had been candidate for the presidency six times and won once, wanted to have another go, but COPEI this time resisted, led by Herrera Campins, and Caldera founded his own brand-new political movement, called [[National Convergence|Convergencia]]. COPEI chose a mediocrity from within its ranks. The Adecos chose the pardo [[Claudio Fermín]]. Petkoff had seen the futility of trying again and backed Caldera. Even Velázquez got into the act. When the returns were in, Caldera won and in the process shattered the strict bipolarity thesis. Abstentions reached a record of 40%. The main reason Caldera, who was 86 years old, won was in essence the same as for Pérez's victory in 1973: everybody knew him and the middle classes, probably decisive for the only time in Venezuela's history, thought that he could do the miracle that had been expected of Pérez, that is, in some manner to get the country back on track to the "good old times".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Caldera assumed the presidency for the second time in 1994&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; and had to confront the [[Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994]]. He re-imposed exchange controls, which Pérez's administration had lifted as part of a general financial liberalisation (unaccompanied by effective regulation, which contributed to the banking crisis). The economy had suffered under the falling oil price, which led to a collapse in government revenues. The steel corporation [[Sidor]] was privatized, and the economy continued to plummet. Fulfilling an election promise, Caldera released Chávez and pardoned all the military and civilian conspirators during the Pérez regime. The economic crisis continued, and by the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998]] the traditional political parties had become unpopular;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} an initial front-runner for the presidency in late 1997 was [[Irene Saez]].

== Territorial organisation ==
The constitution of 1961 divided Venezuela into [[States of Venezuela|states]], a [[Capital District (Venezuela)|capital district]], [[Federal Territories of Venezuela|federal territories]], and [[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela|federal dependencies]]. Over the years, some territories have been elevated to the status of states, including [[Delta Amacuro]] in 1991 and [[Amazonas, Venezuela|Amazonas]] in 1994. Each state has a governor and a legislative assembly.

== Science and technology ==

Significant advances in the medical sciences took place during the Punto Fijo pact period. [[Jacinto Convit]] developed vaccines against [[leprosy]] and [[leishmaniasis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-people-convit-idUSKBN0DS1A720140512|title=Renowned Venezuelan expert on leprosy Jacinto Convit dies|date=12 May 2014|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Baruj Benacerraf]] was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1980 for his [[Immunology|immunological research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/us/03benacerraf.html|title=Dr. Baruj Benacerraf, Nobel Laureate, Dies at 90|last=Gellene|first=Denise|date=2 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2015-12-31|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of technology, [[Humberto Fernández Morán]] invented the [[diamond knife]] and contributed to the development of the [[electron microscope]].

== Culture ==
The 1980s and 1990s were also a golden age of television in Venezuela. A number of Venezuelan [[telenovela]]s became popular internationally: ''[[Leonela]]'' (1983), [[Cristal (telenovela)|''Cristal'']] (1984), [[Abigail (telenovela)|''Abigail'']] (1988), [[Kassandra (TV series)|''Kassandra'']] (1992), and ''[[Por estas calles]]'' (1992), all from [[RCTV]]; and ''[[Las Amazonas]]'' (1985), ''[[Ka Ina]]'' (1995), and ''[[El país de las mujeres]]'' (1998) from [[Venevisión]].

Several Venezuelans won international beauty contests: [[Maritza Sayalero]] (1979), [[Irene Sáez]] (1981), [[Bárbara Palacios Teyde]] (1986), and [[Alicia Machado]] (1996). Musicians like [[Franco de Vita]], [[Ricardo Montaner]], and [[Karina (Venezuelan singer)|Karina]] also became known on the international scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4470">'''Santiago Key Ayala''' (Caracas, April 25, 1874 – Caracas, August 21, 1959) was a historian, writer and diplomat, and is considered one of the most important [[Venezuelan]] intellectuals from the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelatuya.com/biografias/keyayala.htm Santiago Key Ayala - Venezuela Tuya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Santiago Key Ayala was born in Caracas on April 25, 1874. His parents were Fernando Key Rodríguez and Ana Ayala Anzola. He studied philosophy, math, and natural sciences at the [[Central University of Venezuela]]. At this time he began his literary career by writing for the journal ''El Cojo Ilustrado''. He then studied engineering and political science, and wrote articles for the magazine [[Cosmópolis]], a publication that helped spread [[modernismo]] in Venezuela. Although Key Ayala was at first influenced by the ideas of modernismo, he gradually moved away from the movement, finding his own voice in a prose more in line with his academic and classic spirit.

In the 1940s, Key Ayala collected all of the work he had written in a few volumes, which included monographs, articles, as well as research and discourse that had been previously published in the form of brochures and booklets. Alongside his intellectual work, he held various positions as an officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both in Venezuela and abroad. One of these positions was Venezuela's [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the United States in Italy in 1936. Another diplomatic function was to represent the country at the Plenipotentiary Conference for boundary issues with Colombia (1920-1921). He was also a delegate to the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]], the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and the [[Pan-American Conference]] in Havana. In 1914 he became a member of the [[Venezuelan Academy of Language]] and in 1916 he joined the National Academy of History. As a historian, he stands out for his research on [[Simon Bolivar]] and other Latin American figures. His books include: ''Vida ejemplar de Simón Bolívar'' (for which he obtained the Municipal Prize for Literature in 1942), ''Luz de Bolívar'' and ''Cuba y Marti''.

In addition to writing about historical figures, he was greatly interested in literary research and criticism, which prompted him to write the book ''Bajo el signo del Ávila'' (1949), about some contemporary writers of his time, including [[Manuel Díaz Rodríguez]], [[Pedro Emilio Coll]], [[Andrés Bello]], [[Aristides Rojas]] and [[Juan Antonio Pérez Bonalde]]. Since 1933 he wrote a series of books about Venezuelan history, including ''Series hemero-bibliográficas'', ''Aluvión hemerográfico'', ''Cateos de bibliografía''. In 1950 he was awarded the [[National Prize for Literature (Venezuela)|National Prize for Literature]]. His selected works were published in 1955 in a book titled "Obras Selectas" (Ediciones EDIME, 1245 pages).

Santiago Key Ayala published his work under the name "S. Key-Ayala" or "Santiago Key-Ayala", which were strictly not a pseudonyms but simply variants of his actual name.

Key Ayala died in Caracas on August 21, 1959.

[[File:Photo 2-plane side view1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Saqqara artifact.]]
The '''Saqqara Bird''' is a [[bird]]-shaped artifact made of [[sycamore]] wood, discovered during the 1898 [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the [[Pa-di-Imen tomb]] in [[Saqqara]], [[Egypt]]. It has been dated to approximately [[Common Era|200 BCE]], and is now housed in the [[Egyptian Museum|Museum of Egyptian Antiquities]] in [[Cairo]]. The Saqqara Bird has a wingspan of {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|39.12|g|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Messiha | first= Hishmat | title=[Saqqara Bird]| journal=Egypt Travel Magazine | publisher= Ministry of Tourism, Dept. of Publicity |location=Cairo| issue= 153 | year=1973 | issn=0013-2381| oclc=1567664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function is not understood because of a lack of period documentation.

==Conventional ideas==
Some think the Saqqara Bird may be a ceremonial object because the [[falcon]], the bird after which the Saqqara Bird is modeled, is the form most commonly used to represent several of the most important gods of [[Egyptian mythology]], most notably the falcon deity [[Horus]] and the sun deity [[Ra#Composites|Ra Horakhty]]. Others have posited it may have been a [[toy]] for an elite child, or that it could have functioned as a [[weather vane]]. Some have also speculated it may have been used as a sort of [[boomerang]], as such technology was common and well known in ancient Egypt in the form of a [[throwing stick]] used for hunting [[waterfowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Larry Orcutt | title=Model Airplane?  | url=http://www.catchpenny.org/model.html | work=Catchpenny Mysteries of Ancient Egypt | year=2001  | accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the most likely hypothesis is that this bird was positioned on the masthead of sacred boats used during the [[Opet Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/5811/opetfestivalboat2.gif Khonsu Temple relief with three sacred boats]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reliefs showing those boats are found in the [[Temple of Khonsu]] at [[Karnak]] and date to the late New Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''The Temple of Khonsu, Volume 1: Scenes of King Herihor in the Court'', The Epigraphic Survey. Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1979. {{ISBN|0-918986-20-6}}. Reproduction of the reliefs are visible at page 107 and following pages [http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/pubs/catalog/oip/oip100.html"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial ideas==
Some have suggested that the Saqqara Bird may represent evidence that knowledge of the principles of [[aviation]] existed many centuries before such are generally believed to have first been discovered. Egyptian physician, [[archaeologist]], [[parapsychologist]] and [[dowser]] Khalil Messiha has speculated that the [[ancient Egyptians]] developed the first [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name="messiha"&gt;{{cite book | last=Messiha  | first=Khalil | editor=Ivan van Sertima | title=Blacks in Science: Ancient and Modern | chapter=Aeronautics: African Experimental Aeronautics: A 2000-Year Old Model Glider |series=Journal of African Civilizations | volume=vol. 5, no. 1-2 | pages=92–99 | location=New Brunswick | publisher=Transaction Books | year=1991 | isbn=0-87855-941-8 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ea-dgkryq7AC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAfrican+Experimental+aeronautics:+A+2000-Year+Old+Model+Glider%E2%80%9D#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAfrican%20Experimental%20aeronautics%3A%20A%202000-Year%20Old%20Model%20Glider%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false | accessdate=2010-04-21|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that it "represents a diminutive of an original monoplane still present in Saqqara."&lt;ref name="messiha"/&gt; He also claimed that the Saqqara Bird could function as a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] if it had a horizontal [[tailplane]], which he "suppose[d] was lost,"&lt;ref name="messiha"/&gt; and noted that the Egyptians often placed miniaturized representations of their technology in their tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shaw  | first=Ian  |author2=Paul T. Nicholson  | title=British Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt | location=London | publisher=British museum press | year=1995 | isbn=0-7141-0982-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messiha contended that the Saqqara Bird differs significantly from other statues and models of birds housed in the [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo museum]]. According to Messiha, the Saqqara Bird has a [[vertical stabilizer]] which is unlike the generally horizontal shape of a real bird's tail. [[Richard P. Hallion]] described this fin as "shaped as if the bird had twisted its tail feathers."  &lt;ref name="Hallion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallion|first=Richard P.|title=Taking Flight: Inventing the Aerial Age, from Antiquity Through the First World War|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195160352|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YRqV_PayIKIC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=sakkara|authorlink=Richard P. Hallion|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also legless and has wings set at an angle Messiha sees as similar to that of modern aircraft, which he considered an attempt to create [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]].&lt;ref name="messiha"/&gt;

In spite of these claims, however, no ancient Egyptian aircraft have ever been found, nor has any other evidence suggesting their existence come to light. As a result, the theory that the Saqqara Bird is a model of a flying machine is not accepted by mainstream Egyptologists. Hallion notes that it is "far too heavy and unstable itself to fly."&lt;ref name="Hallion"/&gt;

===Attempts to prove the claim===

Aerodynamics expert Simon Sanderson tested a replica model in a wind tunnel without a tailplane and found that it produced “four times the glider’s own weight in lift.” In Liverpool University, Sanderson then subjected it with the data from wind tunnel and added a stabilizing tailplane to a flight simulator meant to replicate “the same trials as a modern fighter jet.” In virtual air streams and conditions in Egypt, the Saqqara Bird actually flew quite well. “Over 2,000 years after the ancient Egyptians carved this mysterious bird, modern technology has proved beyond doubt that it could have flown.” &lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | author=Doug Aamoth| title=Cryptids: The Saqqara Bird |publisher=Time   |date=June 9, 2010| url=http://techland.time.com/2010/06/09/cryptids-the-saqqara-bird/ | work=  | accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position of tailplane===
Messiha claims "The lower part of the tail is broken [i.e. flat] which I think may be an evidence that the tail was attached there." &lt;ref name="Messiha"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Khalil Messiha |author2=Guirguis Messiha |author3=Gamal Mokhtar |author4=Michael Frenchman  |last-author-amp=yes | title=African Experimental Aeronautics: A 2,000-Year-Old Model Glider | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ea-dgkryq7AC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAfrican+Experimental+aeronautics:+A+2000-Year+Old+Model+Glider%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GRQbBdwOKT&amp;sig=RhRwu-XE6gtLDLf8_R22mfgSj_c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJzOS5ahD4S8sgOzkuyuDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAfrican%20Experimental%20aeronautics%3A%20A%202000-Year%20Old%20Model%20Glider%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false | work=Blacks in Science: Ancient and Modern | year=1991 | accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the fall of 2007 early elections Sergey Sobolev joined the election race as part of [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] (at the time of the election, he was deputy chairman of a PRP-led group of experts at Kiev Ltd. "Central European agency"). In the sixth convocation he headed the subcommittee on cooperation with state agencies, local governments, enterprises, institutions and organizations of the Committee for Justice, a member of the Permanent Delegation to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]. Also, he was the first deputy head of the fraction.&lt;ref name=DATALiga/&gt;

On 20 February 2010 Sobolev became the leader of PRO. By that time he was the head of Zaporizhia Oblast party organization.&lt;ref name=DATALiga/&gt;

On 17 March 2010 – he became the head of the opposition of the Cabinet of Ministers, which is the de facto group of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]].

According to [[Arseny Yatsenyuk]] in October 2012, if he had won the democratic opposition forces in the parliamentary elections he would have become prime minister.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Since 12 December in the 7th Convocation he was national deputy of the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]], number 8 on the list. He was the first deputy head of the faction. He was a member of the Committee on Legal Policy. On 21 January 2013 he was elected Vice-President of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref name=DATALiga/&gt;

His party merged into [[Batkivshchyna]] in June 2013.&lt;ref name="mergeBatFoCROPJune2013"&gt;[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/sobolev-front-for-change-and-reform-and-order-party-to-join-batkivschyna/ Sobolev: Front for Change and Reform and Order Party to join Batkivschyna], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 June 2013)&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/front_for_change_reforms_and_order_to_dissolve_for_merger_with_batkivshchyna___sobolev_304988 Front for Change, Reforms and Order to dissolve for merger with Batkivshchyna - Sobolev], [[Ukrinform]] (11 June 2013))&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2014 Sobolev replaced Yatsenyuk as Batkivshchyna faction leader in parliament (due to Yatsenyuk's new position as prime minister in the [[First Yatsenyuk Government|Yatsenyuk Government]]).&lt;ref name="Batkivshchynanfl20314TSN"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tsn.ua/politika/sobolyev-ocholiv-batkivschinu-v-radi-340839.html Sobolev heads "Batkivshchyna" in the Rada], [[Televiziyna Sluzhba Novyn]] (20 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative initiatives ===

Following [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] Sobolev drafted a bill "On the rights and freedoms of citizens in the temporarily occupied territories" that postulated that [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]] should be regarded as "temporarily occupied by Russia". The original bill would permit entry and exit from the Crimea only with a special permit and punish "cooperation with the occupying state" with imprisonment. On 15 April 2014 the amended bill passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=50320&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silva rerum''' (from [[Latin]] ''silva rerum'' &amp;mdash; forest of things; plural: ''silvae rerum''), polonized '''sylwa''' or and sometimes described as a '''home chronicle''' was a specific type of a book, a multi-generational [[chronicle]], kept by many [[Szlachta|Polish]] and [[Bajorai|Lithuanian]] noble families from the 16th through 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="nied"&gt;J. Niedźwiedź, ''Sylwa, silva rerum'' in ''Słownik sarmatyzmu'' pod red. A. Borowskiego, Wydawnictwo Literackie, Kraków 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors of modern Polish [[postmodern literature]] try to create works similar to the silvae rerum of the past.&lt;ref name="prze"&gt;Przemysław Czapliński, [http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/07-12-01/pp-07-20-01.html Klucze do sylwy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618101441/http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/07-12-01/pp-07-20-01.html |date=2008-06-18 }}, Przegląd Polski on-line, 07-12-01&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical Poland it was written by members of the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) as a diary or memoir for the entire family, recording [[family traditions]], among other matters; they were not intended for a wider audience or printing (although there were a few exceptions); some were also lent to friends of the family, who were allowed to add their comments to them.&lt;ref name="nied"/&gt; It was added to by many generations, and contained various information: diary-type entries on current events, memoirs, letters, political speeches, copies of legal documents, gossips, jokes and anecdotes, financial documents, economic information (price of grain, etc.), philosophical musings, poems, genealogical trees, advice (agricultural, medical, moral) for the descendants and others.  The wealth of information in silva is staggering; they contain anything that their authors wished to record for future generations.&lt;ref name="nied"/&gt; Some silvae rerum were of truly enormous proportions, with thousands of pages (Gloger cites one of 1764 pages) although most common size is from 500 to 800 pages.&lt;ref name="nied"/&gt; They were written from 16th century (the earliest entries are from the times of the king [[Stefan Batory]]) to the mid-18th century (times of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] kings in Poland).&lt;ref name="nied"/&gt;

Silvae rerum were the source of our modern knowledge of poems by such writers as [[Andrzej Morsztyn]], and even long diaries, including the famous ''Chocim War'' by [[Wacław Potocki]] and the ''Diaries'' by [[Jan Chryzostom Pasek]].&lt;ref name="zygm"&gt;Zygmunt Gloger, ''Ksie̜ga rzeczy polskich'', 1886, Nakł. Macierzy Polskiej, [https://books.google.com/books?id=87oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA407&amp;vq=silva+rerum&amp;dq=%22silva+rerum%22+Poland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s Google Print, p. 407-410] (public domain)&lt;/ref&gt; They also contain a wealth of information about the customs of Polish nobility of the past centuries.&lt;ref name="zygm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Partyka, "Szlachecka silva rerum jako zrodlo do badan etnograficznych" (The nobility's "silva rerum" as a source for ethnographic research), Etnografia Polska (32) 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A major collection of silvas perished [[Polish culture during World War II|during the destruction of Polish libraries by Germans in World War II]].&lt;ref name="nied"/&gt;

In modern Poland, a type of postmodern literature tries to recreate the feeling of sylwa in their works.&lt;ref name="prze" /&gt;

Silva Rerum (2008-2016) is the title of a four part saga of internationally bestselling historical novels by Lithuanian writer [[Kristina Sabaliauskaite|Kristina Sabaliauskaitė]] about the noble Norvaiša family set in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1659-1795.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3991">The '''Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship''' ('''SMFS''') is an academic organization which "promotes the study of the Patristic Age, the Middle Ages, and the Early Modern era from the perspective of gender studies, women's studies, and feminist studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship Webpage|url=http://smfsweb.org/|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development followed the rise of the study of medieval women in the 1970s and 1980s, and sought to increase the number of and sponsor papers about medieval women, and feminist theory driven scholarship, at the largest international medieval studies conferences, [[International Congress on Medieval Studies|Kalamazoo]] and [[International Medieval Congress|Leeds IMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett, Judith|first=and Ruth Mazo Karras, eds.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe|year=2013|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199582174|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Diane, ed.|title=Medieval Women in their Communities|year=1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802042899|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The origins of SMFS lay in the ''Medieval Feminist Newsletter'', begun in 1986 by the organization's founders, E. Jane Burns, Roberta (Bonnie) Krueger, Elizabeth Robertson, and Thelma Fenster.

The group became SMFS in 1992, driven by a desire to establish more formal networks for communication, funding, and with a view to producing publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smfsweb.org/history/|title=Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship 'History'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, SFMS has produced ''Medieval Feminist Forum'', a peer-reviewed journal which became an online-only journal in 2009.

The organization is affiliated with the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and the [[American Historical Association|AHA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Historical Association: affiliated societies|url=http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/affiliated-societies/society-for-medieval-feminist-scholarship|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has sponsored sessions at annual meetings of these societies. SMFS has also sponsored sessions at other major international conferences, including the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], the [[International Medieval Congress]] at the [[University of Leeds]], the [[Medieval Academy of America]]'s annual meeting, and the [[Australia &amp; New Zealand Association for Medieval &amp; Early Modern Studies]].

==Services and prizes ==

SMFS provides a Mentoring Exchange at most major conferences where it has a presence. It also awards several annual prizes, including one for the Best Graduate Essay, Best First Article of Feminist Scholarship on the Middle Ages, and Best First Book of Feminist Scholarship on the Middle Ages. It also manages a Listserv, MEDFEM-L.

In 2014, SMFS hosted a [[Wikipedia:Meetup/MedievalFeminist|Wikipedia Write-In]] at the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies|49th Annual International Congress on Medieval Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Congress on Medieval Studies Program|url=http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/sessions.html|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], where members were encouraged to contribute their time and expertise to adding and editing articles in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Middle, "Medieval Feminist Wikipedia Write-In #medievalwiki #Kzoo2014: Why Individual Medievalists Should Think About Encyclopedic Data"|url=http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2014/05/v-behaviorurldefaultvmlo.html|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">'''Sten Hjalmar Lindroth''' (28 December 1914 in [[Lund]] &amp;ndash; 1 September 1980) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Swedish history of ideas|historian of learning and science]].

Lindroth was born in the university town of [[Lund]] in Southern Sweden, but grew up and went to school in [[Gothenburg]] after his father [[Hjalmar Lindroth]] had been appointed to the Chair of Nordic languages at [[Gothenburg University]]. After finishing school in Gothenburg at [[Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet|Göteborgs högre latinläroverk]], he matriculated at [[Uppsala University]] in 1933 and eventually became a student of [[Johan Nordström]], holder of the Emilia and Gustaf Carlberg Chair of the history of ideas and learning, the first of its kind at Uppsala. Lindroth eventually completed a monumental, 500-page dissertation on the history of [[paracelsianism]] in Sweden until the middle of the 17th century, defended in 1943. During his student years he was also active in the [[Juvenalorden]] and the liberal student society [[Verdandi (student society)|Verdandi]], for he which he also served as president.

He spent the next decade on a history of the mining and copper production at [[Stora Kopparberget]] and a biography of the physicist and inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], and several shorter publications on various scientific-historical topics. In 1957 he succeeded Nordström as Carlberg Professor. His later publications included a book on the early history of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (1967), of which he became a member in 1966, a history of Swedish learning from the Middle Ages until the Gustavian period (the fourth and last volume was left unfinished but completed and edited by his former student [[Gunnar Eriksson]]) and an overview of the history of Uppsala University (1976), published on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university.

Sten Lindroth was elected a Member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1968.

[[File:Independent Tartary Map 1850.png|thumb|388x388px| A map of Independent Tartary as of 1850 with its subdivisions shown]]

'''Tartary''' ([[Latin]]: ''Tartaria'') or '''Great Tartary''' ([[Latin]]: ''Tartaria Magna'') was a country in northern and central [[Asia]] stretching eastwards from the [[Caspian Sea]] and from the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], inhabited mostly by [[Turkic peoples]].

The vast country spanned much of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], [[Idel-Ural| Volga-Urals]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Siberia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Manchuria]].

== Geography and history ==

Tartary was often divided into sections with prefixes denoting the name of the ruling power or the geographical  location.  Thus, western Siberia was ''[[Muscovy|Muscovite]]'' or ''[[Russia]]n Tartary'', [[Xinjiang]] and Mongolia were ''Chinese'' or ''[[Cathay]] Tartary'', western Central Asia (later [[Russian Central Asia]]) was known as ''Central Tartary'', and Manchuria was ''[[East Tartary]]''.

As the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] expanded eastward and more of Tartary became known to Europeans, the term fell into disuse.
European areas north of the [[Black Sea]] inhabited by Tataric peoples were known as [[Little Tartary]].

The "[[Hami Desert|Komul Desert]] of the Tartary" was mentioned by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', as a "great far-reaching solitude".

East Tartary and Maritime Tartary are old names for the [[Manchu]]-inhabited territory extending from the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[River Amur]] with the [[River Ussuri]] to [[Sakhalin Island]]. This area is now the [[Primorsky Krai]] with [[Vladivostok]] as regional administrative center.

These lands were once occupied by the [[Mohe people|Mohe]] tribes and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nation; and also by various old kingdoms including [[Goryeo]], [[Balhae]], [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] kingdoms.

According to [[Sheng-Wu-Chi]]'s [[Ming dynasty]] chronicle ("Our dynasty is informed by military realizations"), in this land the [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] [[Weji]], [[Warka (tribe)|Warka]] and [[Kurka]] tribes were established. Later these were unified in Manchu [[Qing Empire]] with [[Nurhaci]] as their leader and founder. These lands were lost to Russia under the [[Treaty of Peking]].

Nearest this land lies the Ku-Ye-Dao ({{zh|c=庫頁島|p=Kùyèdǎo}}) or Fu-Sang ([[Hangul]]: 후상) island, better known as [[Karafuto]] or [[Sakhalin]]; in recent times Russian archaeologists have found here remains of ancient cities with walls and castles. These may correspond with the ancient Manchu nation, or possibly during [[Mongol]] or [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] times, or the [[Balhae kingdom]].

These lands were visited by Japanese explorers, [[Mamiya Rinzo]] and others, who reported on the various important cities and ports, such as [[Haishenwei]] (present day Vladivostok). From these lands and nearby [[Hulun Buir|Hulun]] (Amur area), the Japanese have claimed North Asian ancestors, who settled North Japan.

Other ancient cities in the region are: [[Tetyukhe]] (now [[Dalnegorsk]]) and probably [[Deleng]], an important commercial imperial post according to some records.

== Tartary in art ==

In the novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], Tartary is the name of a large country on the fictional planet of [[Antiterra]]. [[Russia]] is Tartary's approximate geographic counterpart on Terra, Antiterra's twin world apparently identical to "our" Earth, but doubly fictional in the context of the novel.

In [[Puccini]]'s last opera, ''[[Turandot]]'', Calaf's father Timur is the deposed King of the Tartars.

In [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' novels, the European main characters often express fear of Tartars, a term apparently referring to many Asian races, as the story takes place far from Mongolia.

In ''[[Macbeth]]'', by [[William Shakespeare]], the witches include Tartars' lips in their [[potion]].

In [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Dr. Frankenstein pursues the monster "amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track".

In ''[[Great Expectations]]'', by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Herbert Pocket]] describes [[Estella Havisham]] as a Tartar because she was "hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickens | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Dickens | title = Great Expectations | publisher = | date = | location = | pages = Chapter 22 | url = http://dickens.thefreelibrary.com/Great-Expectations/1-22 | doi = | id = | isbn = | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[David Copperfield]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], the ruthless boarding school headmaster, Mr. Creakle, describes himself as a Tartar.

In "[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]" by [[Robert Browning]], the Pied Piper mentions Tartary as one of his credentials in pest removal to the Mayor of Hamelin. "In Tartary I freed the Cham, last June, from his huge swarms of gnats".

In his short work with E. Hoffmann Price, "Through the Gates of the Silver Key", [[H. P. Lovecraft]] briefly mentions Tartary: "Upon their cloaked heads there now seemed to rest tall, uncertainly coloured mitres, strangely suggestive of those on certain nameless figures chiselled by a forgotten sculptor along the living cliffs of a high, forbidden mountain in Tartary".

"[[The Squire's Tale]]" from [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' is set in the royal court of Tartary.

In [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the eponymic hero refers to his travels in Tartary on two occasions, and suggests that the then modern geographers of Europe were "in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary".

[[L. Frank Baum]]'s origin story of [[Santa Claus]], ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'', features mythical antagonists from Tartary who oppose Santa's compassionate gift giving practices. They are described as the Three-Eyed Giants of Tartary.

In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem "Sohrab and Rustum", the poem begins with "And the first grey of morning fill'd the east, And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream. But all the Tartar camp along the stream Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep."

In [[Walter de la Mare]]'s poem "[[If I were lord of Tartary]]", Tartary is an imaginary land full of happiness.

In [[Washington Irving]]'s short story "[[Rip Van Winkle]]", the title character would "sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar's lance".

'''''The Restorers''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''The Restorers: Giving History a Future...''''') is a 2003 documentary film by Adam White about [[vehicle restoration|restoration]] of vintage war planes ranging from the [[F4U Corsair]] to the [[B-17]] "Yankee Lady".  White interviewed dozens of people who have dedicated much of their lives and thousands of dollars to restore planes for museums, [[air show]]s, or their own personal collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-restorers-290083|title=The Restorers|accessdate=January 1, 2010|work=[[Allmovie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjects range from people who restore planes in their own garages to major corporations; the end results range from planes that are used in exhibitions and air shows to planes that are restored as racing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411804/plotsummary|title=Plot Summary for The Restorers (2004) |accessdate=January 1, 2010|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, White earned a regional 2004 [[Emmy Award]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DDNB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=118015EBB772DAD0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=WSU Graduate's Tuskegee Airmen Documentary To Get Dayton Launch|accessdate=January 1, 2010|date=March 16, 2007|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|author=Larsen, Dave|page=GO29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film had been released July 18&amp;ndash;20, 2003 at the Neon Movies in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio in conjunction with the Vectren Dayton Air Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DDNB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FC3ED1F6F58272C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=5 Things You Need To Know This Week For Next Week|accessdate=January 1, 2010|date=July 11, 2003|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|author=|page=14, GO! section}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2004, the film was made available in both [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] format.

[[Image:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|right|thumb|King [[Philip II of Spain]], wearing the Spanish ''Tocado'', late 1500s. Painting by [[Sofonisba Anguissola]].]]
A '''toque''' ({{IPAc-en|t|oʊ|k}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toque|title=the definition of toque|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|t|ɒ|k}}) is a type of [[hat]] with a narrow [[Brim (hat)|brim]] or no brim at all.&lt;ref name="merriam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toque | title=Definition of Toque | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toques were popular from the 13th to the 16th century in Europe, especially France. The mode was revived in the 1930s. Now it is primarily known as the traditional headgear for professional [[cook (profession)|cooks]], except in Canada where the term is primarily used for [[knit cap]]s.&lt;ref name="merriam" /&gt;
[[File:Woman's Toque LACMA M.64.85.6.jpg|thumb|Woman's toque from England, c. 1860 at the collection of [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]

== Etymology ==
The word has been known in English since 1505. It came through the [[Medieval]] [[French language|French]] toque (15th century), presumably by the way of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''toca'' "woman's headdress", from Arabic *''taqa'' 'طاقة' for "opening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=toque | title=toque (n.) | publisher=Etymonline.com | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "طاقية" "taqia"  for "hat" originally for something "round" that has an opening. 

The word toque is [[Breton language|Breton]] for "hat".  The spelling with the "que" is Middle Breton, and Modern Breton is spelled tok.  Old Breton spells the word toc.  The word was borrowed into the French language both for the chef's uniform and the knit cap.

A '''''toque blanche''''' ([[French language|French]] for "white hat"), often shortened to toque, is a tall, round, pleated, starched white hat worn by [[chef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogmybrain.com/scrabble-word-finder/word/toque.htm | title=Definitions for: Toque | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toque most likely originated as the result of the gradual evolution of head coverings worn by cooks throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUdYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=toque+head+coverings | title=So, You Want to Be a Chef?: How to Get Started in the World of Culinary Arts | publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | author= Bedell, Jane | year=2013 | page=69 | isbn=1582704368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their roots are sometimes traced to the ''casque à meche'' (stocking cap) worn by 18th-century French chefs. The colour of the ''casque à meche'' denoted the rank of the wearer. Boucher, the personal chef of the French statesman [[Talleyrand]], was the first to insist on white toques for sanitary reasons.

The modern toque is popularly believed to have originated with the French chef [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] (1784&amp;ndash;1833), who stiffened  the ''casque à meche'' with cardboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/magazine/who-made-that-chefs-toque.html|title=Who Made That Chef’s Toque?|first=Daniel|last=Engber|date=28 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- and [[Auguste Escoffier]] (1846&amp;ndash;1935) --&gt;.

===Judicial===
* A toque, or sometimes touge, was the traditional headgear of various French [[magistrate]]s.
* A low type in black velvet, called ''[[mortar board|mortier]]'' (also rendered in English as [[mortarboard]]), was used by the ''[[président à mortier]]'', president of a ''[[parlement]]'' (the royal highest court in a French province), and of the members of two of the highest central courts, ''[[Court of Cassation (France)|cour de cassation]]'' and ''[[Cour des Comptes|cour des comptes]]''.
* A red toque is sometimes worn by German judges, primarily by justices on the [[Federal Constitutional Court]].

===Academic===
The pleated, low, round hat worn in French universities{{spaced ndash}} the equivalent of the [[mortarboard]] or [[tam (cap)|tam]] at British and American universities{{spaced ndash}} is also called a toque.

===Heraldic===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In the [[Napoleonic era]], the French first empire replaced the [[coronet]]s of traditional ("royal") [[heraldry]] with a rigorously standardized system (as other respects of "Napoleonic" [[coats of arms]]) of toques, reflecting the rank of the bearer. Thus a Napoleonic [[duke]] used a toque with seven [[ostrich]] feathers and three [[lambrequin]]s, a [[count]] a toque with five feathers and two lambrequins, a [[baron]] three feathers and one lambrequin, a [[knight]] only one ostrich feather (see [[Nobility of the First French Empire]]).

===Athletic===
Toque is also used for a hard-type hat or [[helmet]], worn for riding, especially in [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports, often black and covered with black [[velvet]].

[[File:RS Wearing a Toque.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a tuque.]]
In [[Canadian English|Canada]], ''[[tuque]]'' {{IPAc-en|t|uː|k}} is the common name for a knitted winter hat, or [[watch cap]] (sometimes called a beanie in other parts of the world); the spelling "touque", although not recognized by the [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]], is also sometimes seen in written English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/thousands-vote-on-correct-spelling-of-canadian-knit-cap-1.2457737, CBC News: Thousands vote on correct spelling of Canadian knit cap, Retrieved Dec. 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian English|Canadian-English]] term was assimilated from [[Canadian French language|Canadian-French]] ''[[wikt:tuque#French|tuque]]''. ''Toque'' first appeared in writing around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"toque" and "tuque" in Katherine Barber, ed. (2004), ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' (2nd ed.), Don Mills, Ontario: [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-541816-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tuque tuque]" at Dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toque toque]" and "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuque tuque]" at Merriam–Webster Online.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fashion is said to have originated with the ''[[coureurs de bois]]'', French and [[Métis]] fur traders, who kept their woollen nightcaps on for warmth during cold winter days. Such hats are known in other English-speaking countries by a variety of names, including ''beanie'', ''watch cap'' or ''stocking cap''; the terms ''tuque'' and ''toque'' are unique to Canada and northern areas of the United States close to the [[Canada–United States border]].

'''Viking coins''' are those [[coin]]s designed, minted and circulated as currency by [[Viking]] rulers during the [[Viking Age]] of northern [[Europe]].

The Viking kingdom of [[Jorvik]] (York) in northern [[England]], for example, employed skilled craftsmen and moneyers to produce coinage during the first half of the 10th century. Despite the fact that many coins minted for Scandinavian rulers across the Viking world were almost purely imitative of other contemporary Western European currencies, several of the York designs are nonetheless unique for their time, bearing realistic motifs that include a sword, bow and arrow, a standard, a bird (perhaps one of [[Odin]]'s ravens?) and [[Thor's Hammer]]. They implemented the method of currency by conquering many European countries and civilizing them which improved the economy for many places.
