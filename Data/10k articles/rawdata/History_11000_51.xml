{{Millenniumbox|-5}}{{Neolithic}}

The '''5th millennium BC''' spanned the years 5000 through 4001 BC. It saw the spread of [[agriculture]] from [[Western Asia]] throughout [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Central Europe]].

Urban cultures in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]] flourished, developing the [[wheel]]. [[Copper]] ornaments became more common, marking the beginning of the [[Chalcolithic]]. [[Animal husbandry]] spread throughout [[Eurasia]], reaching [[China]]. 

[[World population estimates|World population]] growth relaxes after the burst due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  World population is largely stable, at roughly 40 million, with a slow overall growth rate at roughly 0.03% p.a.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25, estimates 40 million at 5000 BC and 100 million at 1600 BC, for an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. over the Chalcolithic to Middle Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Ceramic Mesolithic]] / [[Eneolithic]]
{{see|Kurgan hypothesis}}
In North-Eastern Europe a "ceramic Mesolithic" can be distinguished,  found peripheral to the sedentary Neolithic cultures. It created a distinctive type of pottery, with point or knob base and flared rims, manufactured by methods not used by the Neolithic farmers.&lt;ref&gt;De Roevers, p.162-163&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest manifestation of this type of pottery may be in the region around Lake Baikal in Siberia, from as early as 7000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthony|first1=D.W.|editor1-last=Yanko-Hombach|editor1-first=V.|editor2-last=Gilbert|editor2-first=A.A.|editor3-last=Panin|editor3-first=N.|editor4-last=Dolukhanov|editor4-first=P.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
Prior to the [[5.9 kiloyear event]] (3900 BC) and the desiccation of the [[Green Sahara]],
Sub-Saharan Africa remains in the [[Later Stone Age|Paleolithic]].
The beginning of the  [[Pastoral Neolithic]] falls still into the late phase of the Green Sahara, in the 6th or 5th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford-Gonzalez, Diane. (2017) "Pastoralism in sub-Saharan Africa." In ''The Oxford Handbook of Zooarchaeology,'' pp. 396-413.&lt;/ref&gt; As the grasslands of the Sahara began drying after 3900 BC, herders would spread into the Nile Valley and by the mid 3rd millennium BC into eastern Africa.

'''Ali Al-Wardi''' ({{lang-ar|علي حسين محسن الوردي}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljadidah.com/2011/06/%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%8A/|title=aljadidah.com|work=aljadidah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] [[Social science|Social Scientist]] specialized in the field of [[Social history]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Kadhimiya]], [[Baghdad]] in 1913, to a religious and a very traditional family. He grew up defying his family's strict no-modern-education policy, where his father wanted him to learn a craft instead of reading books. Nevertheless, Al-Wardi grow up with a disliking for work and a strong liking for books.

He managed to finish his elementary and high school and awarded the number one student on the [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. He later was appointed as a teacher in many elementary and high schools across Iraq, before winning a [[scholarship]] to the [[American University of Beirut]] where he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1943. He was back to Iraq and was forced to be married by his father's orders.

However, in few years travelled to the [[United States]] to attain his Masters and Ph.D. degrees, he earned his [[Masters degree]] in 1948 from [[The University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]] and  his [[Ph.D.]] in 1950 from the same university. During that time he used to spend his [[summer]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] learning [[English language|English]] in available [[institutes]].
==Career==
He came back to Iraq to start his career in writing many of his books based on the [[theory]] of [[Ibn Khaldun]] about ''Al-Badwa'' ([[Nomadism|Nomadic society]]) vs ''Al-Hadhara'' ([[Civil society]]).

The question of the '''race of ancient Egyptians''' was raised historically as a product of the [[historical race concepts|early racial concepts]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of [[racial hierarchy]] primarily based on [[craniometry]], [[anthropometry]] and [[Human genetics|genetics]]. A variety of views circulated about the [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Sanders: ''The Hamitic hypothesis: its origin and functions in time perspective'', ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1969), pp. 521–532&lt;/ref&gt; These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] and [[Negroid race|Negroid]] racial categories. Some scholars argued that [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture was influenced by other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations in [[Northeast Africa]], the [[Maghreb]], or the [[Middle East]], while others pointed to influences from various [[Nubians|Nubian]] groups or populations in [[Europe]].

Mainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and present day Egyptians, applying modern notions of black or white [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] to ancient Egypt is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]].&lt;ref name="Egypt pg 162"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AClFWV6PE8wC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=brace,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&amp;q=brace%2C%20egyptian%2C%20race&amp;f=false |title=Black Athena Revisited |page=162 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=2016-05-28|isbn=9780807845554 |last1=Lefkowitz |first1=Mary R |last2=Rogers |first2=Guy Maclean |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt pg 329"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PG6HffPwmuMC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=bard,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&amp;q=race&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt |page=329 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780415185899 |last1=Bard |first1=Kathryn A |last2=Shubert |first2=Steven Blake |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Race pg 19"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pFrm19cZhugC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=race,+egypt,+anachronistic,+bard#v=snippet&amp;q=race&amp;f=false |title=Afrocentrism: Mythical Pasts and Imagined Homes |author=Stephen Howe |page=19 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9781859842287 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt.

In the last few years, the first credible, peer-reviewed genetic studies on Ancient Egyptians have been conducted, which show that a small but significant and consistent percentage of Ancient Egyptian ancestry came from sub-Saharan Africa. This ancestry is lowest in northern Egypt, and becomes increasingly large as one proceeds south through the populations of Middle and Upper (southern) Egypt. A 2017 genetic study of 83 mummies from northern Egypt (buried near modern-day Cairo), which constituted "the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods," showed that these persons were most closely related to the diverse modern populations of what is now the Arab world, particularly the southern Levant and Arabia, while also indicating smaller affinities to the neighboring southeastern European and sub-Saharan African (Nubian) populations. Though the mummies were much more closely related to Arab populations than European, they were actually slightly more closely related to southeastern Europeans than modern Egyptians, a fact publicized in the press coverage of the study; the genetic distance between Ancient and modern Egyptians reflects the much greater level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in modern Egyptians, who are heavily mixed with sub-Saharan Africans, and may also stem from a faulty comparison on the part of the study's authors, who compared Lower (northern) Egyptian mummies to the average genetic composition of all contemporary Egyptians (from both Upper and Lower Egypt). 

Nevertheless, all 83 mummies tested had significant levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry, although this ancestry was relatively distant. Specifically, the mummies contained between 6% and 15% sub-Saharan African ancestry, with this component getting increasingly large in the later eras of Ancient Egypt. The study's authors noted that this is much less than the percentage of sub-Saharan African ancestry in modern Egyptians, and emphasized the genetic distance between modern and Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzewski, Sonia (2007). "Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state". American Journal of Physical Anthropology. 132 (4): 501–9. doi:10.1002/ajpa.20569. {{PMID|17295300}}, retrieve at [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d97/908369cfee5b6b7431e508326f07b6cd492d.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors also cautioned that their findings might be unrepresentative of Ancient Egypt as a whole, anticipating that mummies from Upper (southern) Egypt would contain considerably greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry than the Lower Egyptian mummies they examined, and calling for more future research on the matter.

==History==
The earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in ''[[The New-England Magazine]]'' of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that "Herodotus was given as authority for their being negroes." They point out with reference to tomb paintings: "It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the [[Negro]] countenance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nwen;cc=nwen;rgn=full%20text;idno=nwen0005-4;didno=nwen0005-4;view=image;seq=00281;node=nwen0005-4%3A1|title=Original Papers: Ancient Egyptians |journal=The New-England Magazine|volume=0005|issue=4|date=October 1833|pages=273–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney]], wrote "The [[Copts]] are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians" due to their "jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips ... the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans".{{sfn|Chassebœuf|1862|p=131}}{{sfn|Chassebœuf|1787|p=74–77}}

Just a few years later, in 1839, [[Jean-François Champollion]] stated in his work ''Egypte Ancienne'' that the [[Egyptians]] and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and [[relief]]s, further suggesting that: "In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race."{{sfn|Jacques Joseph|1839|p=27}} Also in 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by [[Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac]], who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating "The opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible."{{sfn|Bandia|2009|p=215}}

The debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to abolish slavery in the United States, as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example, in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting "There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost.... Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian."{{sfn|Campbell|1851|p=10–12}} The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as the United States escalated towards civil war.{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105–108}} In 1854, [[Josiah C. Nott]] with George Glidden set out to prove: "that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and ''that the Egyptians were Caucasians.''"{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=108}} [[Samuel George Morton]], a physician and professor of anatomy, concluded that although "Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is [in the United States], that of servants and slaves."{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105}} In the early 20th century, [[Flinders Petrie]], a Professor of Egyptology at the [[University of London]], in turn spoke of a Nubian queen, Aohmes Nefertari, who was the "divine ancestress of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|XVIIIth dynasty]]". He described her physically as having "had an aquiline nose, long and thin, and was of a type not in the least prognathous".{{sfn|Petrie|1939|p=105, 155}}

Egypt was not a popular civilization with all African Americans at the time, because they often associated Egypt with slavery. Black spirituals such as Go Down Moses related the slavery of blacks in America to the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reinhardt.edu/history/thoughts-i-have-had-while-lecturing/&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1960s, Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders related the struggles of the Jews enslaved in Egypt to the struggles of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;https://stanfordfreedomproject.com/multi-media-essays-on-freedom/the-biblical-exodus-in-the-rhetoric-of-martin-luther-king/&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars who have studied ancient Egyptian culture and population history have responded to the controversy over the race of the ancient Egyptians in different ways.

At the [[UNESCO]] "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script" in [[Cairo]] in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with "profound" disagreement.&lt;ref name="Africa, Volume 2 p. 43 &amp; 44"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=onepage&amp;q=profound&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-06-02|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color.&lt;ref name="Africa, Volume 2 p. 46"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=onepage&amp;q=conclusion&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-06-02|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments for all sides are recorded in the UNESCO publication ''[[General History of Africa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings'', (Paris: 1978), pp. 3–134&lt;/ref&gt; with the "Origin of the Egyptians" chapter being written by [[Cheikh Anta Diop]].

Since the second half of the 20th century, most anthropologists have rejected the notion of [[Race (human classification)|race]] as having any validity in the study of human biology.&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm "American Anthropological Association Statement on Race"], ''American Anthropologist Volume 100.'' Arlington County: AAA, 1998 (Occasionally re-included in other volumes afterwards.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Aspects of Race"&gt;[http://physanth.org/about/position-statements/biological-aspects-race/ "Biological Aspects of Race"] ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology Volume 101.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Tyson Smith]] writes in the 2001 ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', "Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as 'black', while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Tyson Smith,(2001) ''The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt'', Volume 3. Donald Redford, Oxford University Press. p. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank M. Snowden]] asserts "Egyptians, Greeks and Romans attached no special stigma to the colour of the skin and developed no hierarchical notions of race whereby highest and lowest positions in the social pyramid were based on colour."&lt;ref&gt;Bard, in turn citing [[Bruce Trigger]], "Nubian, Black, Nilotic?", in ''African in Antiquity, The Arts of Nubian and the Sudan'', vol 1, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Snowden Jr., ''Bernal's 'Blacks' and the Afrocentrists'', ''Black Athena Revisited'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the mummy of [[Ramesses II]] was taken to France for preservation. The mummy was also forensically tested by Professor Pierre-Fernand Ceccaldi, the chief forensic scientist at the Criminal Identification Laboratory of Paris, who wrote: "Hair, astonishingly preserved, showed some complementary data - especially about pigmentation: Ramses II was a Red haired cymnotriche [[leukoderma|leucoderma]]", that is a [[light skin|fair-skinned]] person with wavy [[red hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Pierre |last= Ceccaldi |url=|title= Research on the Mummy of Ramasses II|year=1987|journal=Bulletin de l'Academie de Médecine|volume=171:1|page=119|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6445192d/f141.image|title=Bulletin de l'Académie nationale de médecine|website=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now largely agreed that Dynastic Egyptians were indigenous to the Nile area. About 5,000 years ago, the [[Sahara]] area dried out, and part of the indigenous Saharan population retreated east towards the Nile Valley. In addition, peoples from the [[Middle East]] entered the Nile Valley, bringing with them [[wheat]], [[barley]], sheep, goats, and possibly cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Ancient_Egypt |title=Ancient Egyptian Origins |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynastic Egyptians referred to their country as "The Two Lands". During the Predynastic period (about 4800 to 4300BC), the [[Merimde culture]] flourished in the northern part of Egypt ([[Lower Egypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bogucki |first=Peter I. |title=The origins of human society |year=1999 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-57718-112-5 |page=355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This culture, among others, has links to the [[Levant]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="ngm.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Ancient_Egypt |title=National Geographic Magazine - NGM.com |website=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josef Eiwanger: ''Merimde Beni-salame'', In: ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt''.

''Ma'adi and Wadi Digla''. in: ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt''. Compiled and edited by Kathryn A. Bard. London/New York 1999, 455–458&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern part of Egypt ([[Upper Egypt]]), the predynastic [[Badari culture|Badarian culture]] was followed by the [[Naqada culture]]. These people seem to be more closely related to the Nubians than to northern Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sonia |last=Zakrzewski|url=|title= Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20569|year=2007|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=132|pages=501–9|pmid=17295300|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/interactive/hierakonpolis/nubian.html |title=Interactive Dig Hierakonpolis - Nubian Pottery |website=Archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of ancient Egyptian skeletons and skulls in 2007 also suggests that there was in-migration to the Abydos region of the Nile Valley, particularly during the Early Dynastic Period and the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Population Continuity or Population Change: Formation of the Ancient Egyptian State, by Sonia R. Zakrzewski, Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highﬁeld, Southampton UK; Retrieve at [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d97/908369cfee5b6b7431e508326f07b6cd492d.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from [[Abusir|Abusir el-Meleq]] in the Cairo Governate. The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided "the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods". The study showed that Ancient Egyptians had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern (Arab, Levantine and Anatolian) populations, and had significantly more affinity with southeastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Nevertheless, there was a significant sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry of each mummy: "absolute estimates of African ancestry using these two methods in the three ancient individuals range from 6 to 15%." This level of sub-Saharan African ancestry is significantly lower than that of modern Egyptians from Abusir, who "range from 14 to 21%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study's authors cautioned that the mummies may be unrepresentative of the Ancient Egyptian population as a whole, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt, and contemporary genetic studies show much greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the current-day populations of southern as opposed to 
northern Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzewski, Sonia (2007). "Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state". American Journal of Physical Anthropology. 132 (4): 501–9. doi:10.1002/ajpa.20569. {{PMID|17295300}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific current-day controversies==
Today the issues regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians are "troubled waters which most people who write about ancient Egypt from within the mainstream of scholarship avoid."&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt pg 47"&gt;Ancient Egypt: anatomy of a civilization, by Barry J. Kemp, pg 47, view at [https://books.google.co.za/books?id=l-t5vWHAVN0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=barry+kemp,+race+of+egyptians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79sLR9P3XAhXICsAKHUwuA0kQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=troubled%20waters&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, therefore, takes place mainly in the public sphere and tends to focus on a small number of specific issues.

===Tutankhamun===
Several Afrocentric scholars, including [[Cheikh Anta Diop|Diop]], have claimed that [[Tutankhamun]] was black, and have protested that attempted reconstructions of Tutankhamun's facial features (as depicted on the cover of ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine) have represented the king as "too white". Among these writers was [[Chancellor Williams]], who argued that King Tutankhamun, his parents, and grandparents were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Chancellor|title=The Destruction of Black Civilization|year=1987|publisher=Third World Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-88378-030-5|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic artists and physical anthropologists from [[Egypt]], France, and the United States independently created busts of Tutankhamun, using a [[CT-scan]] of the skull. Biological anthropologist Susan Anton, the leader of the American team, said the race of the skull was "hard to call". She stated that the shape of the cranial cavity indicated an African, while the nose opening suggested narrow nostrils, which is usually considered to be a European characteristic. The skull was thus concluded to be that of a North African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/10/AR2005051001522.html |title=A New Look at King Tut |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts have argued that neither skull shapes nor nasal openings are a reliable indication of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com/pt/re/jcransurg/abstract.00001665-200903000-00061.htm;jsessionid=Jh5hhbQkjv93xhGQSCLy5MFzgL54nCLTrTS7ZTn8G2671lXLTNDv!1553038018!181195628!8091!-1 |title=Skull Indices in a Population Collected From Computed Tomographic Scans of Patients with Head Trauma |journal=Journal of Craniofacial Surgery |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=545–550 |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e31819b9f6e |pmid=19305252 |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2012-05-01|last1=Eskandary |first1=Hossein |last2=Nematollahi-Mahani |first2=Seyed Noureddin |last3=Zangiabadi |first3=Nasser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modern technology can reconstruct Tutankhamun's facial structure with a high degree of accuracy, based on CT data from his mummy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/anthology/unsolvedhistory/kingtut/face/facespin.html Discovery.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220012527/http://dsc.discovery.com/anthology/unsolvedhistory/kingtut/face/facespin.html |date=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/tutankhamun/index.asp |title=Science museum images |publisher=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527025639/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/tutankhamun/index.asp |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; determining his skin tone and [[eye color]] is impossible. The clay model was therefore given a coloring, which, according to the artist, was based on an "average shade of modern Egyptians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/05/0511_050511_kingtutface.html |title=King Tut's New Face: Behind the Forensic Reconstruction |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Garcia, ''National Geographic''{{'}}s executive vice president for mission programs, said, in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The big variable is skin tone. North Africans, we know today, had a range of skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.' We will never know for sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of his eyes with 100% certainty....

When pressed on the issue by American activists in September 2007, the Secretary General of the Egyptian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], [[Zahi Hawass]] stated "Tutankhamun was not black."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB6u3XEMp9IrJfl-kH6FHNgZCg_A |title=Tutankhamun was not black: Egypt antiquities chief |agency=AFP |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213002414/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB6u3XEMp9IrJfl-kH6FHNgZCg_A |archivedate=February 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2007 publication of ''[[Ancient Egypt (magazine)|Ancient Egypt]]'' magazine, Hawass asserted that none of the facial reconstructions resemble Tut and that, in his opinion, the most accurate representation of the boy king is the mask from his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptmagazine.com/ |title=Welcome to Ancient Egypt Magazine's Web Site |website=Ancientegyptmagazine.com\Accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] commissioned a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun, based on CT scans of a model of his skull, back in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tutmask.jpg |title=Photographic image : Wikimedia Commons|format=JPG |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/tutankhamun/ |title=Tutankhamun: beneath the mask |publisher=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the genomics company iGENEA launched a Tutankhamun DNA project based on genetic markers that it indicated it had culled from a Discovery Channel special on the pharaoh. According to the firm, the microsatellite data suggested that Tutankhamun belonged to the haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1a2]], the most common paternal clade among males in Western Europe. Carsten Pusch and Albert Zink, who led the unit that had extracted Tutankhamun's DNA, chided iGENEA for not liaising with them before establishing the project. After examining the footage, they also concluded that the methodology the company used was unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Tut Related to Half of European Men?

[[Diana Preston]] proposes that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been part Syrian, in line with the precedent of Persian and Syrian blood in the Ptolemaic line, continuing that Cleopatra "almost certainly had olive skin and dark eyes."{{sfnp|Preston|2009|pp=77}} [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] also argues that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been mixed Syrian and Greek, continuing that "certainly she was not an Egyptian," noting there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemaic king.{{sfnp|Grant|1992 [1972]|pp=4, 5}} He goes on to say Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she "would have described herself as Greek," adding that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate her "numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world."{{sfnp|Grant|1992 [1972]|pp=5}} [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] notes Cleopatra, having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian, was probably not dark skinned (he also notes Roman propaganda never mentions it), contending "fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry," and that she "was no more Egyptian culturally or ethnically than most residents of modern day Arizona are [[Apaches]]."{{sfnp|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=8, 127-128}} He further stresses that Cleopatra's native tongue was Greek, that it was in "Greek literature and culture she that was educated," that her worship of Isis was "strongly [[Hellenised]]," and that although she was presented in some statuary in the idealized Egyptian style, she was unlikely to have dressed like this outside of performing certain rites; instead Cleopatra "wore the headband and robes of a Greek monarch."{{sfnp|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=8}} [[Stacy Schiff]] concurs, Cleopatra was not dark-skinned, that "the Ptolemies were in fact Macedonian Greek, which makes Cleopatra approximately as Egyptian as [[Elizabeth Taylor]]", that her Ptolemaic relatives were described as "honey skinned", that she was part Persian, and that "an Egyptian mistress is a rarity among the Ptolemies."{{sfnp|Schiff|2011|pp=2, 42}} (Additionally, it interesting to note that Cleopatra's son with [[Mark Antony]], [[Alexander Helios]], was engaged to a Persian princess, further cementing the surmountable proof of the closeness of the Ptolemaic dynasty to the Persian nobility.&lt;ref&gt; "Ptolemaic Dynasty Affiliates". www.tyndalehouse.com. Archived from the original on 2011-07-16. Retrieved 2017-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;) 

Schiff continues that Cleopatra "faithfully held up the family tradition."{{sfnp|Schiff|2011|pp=2}} In essence, Cleopatra's loyalties were to her Ptolemaic Greek heritage. As noted by Donald R. Dudley, Cleopatra and her family were "the successor[s] to the native Pharaohs, exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley."{{sfnp|Dudley|1960|pp=57}} Cleopatra's official coinage (which she would have approved) and the three portrait busts of her considered authentic by scholars (which match her coins) portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman in style, including a Hellenistic diadem and Greek chignon.{{sfnp|Schiff|2011|pp=38, 39}}{{sfnp|Pina Polo|2013|pp=185–186}}{{sfnp|Kleiner|2005|pp=151–153, 155}} Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the "[[commons:Category:Bust of Cleopatra VII in the Altes Museum Berlin|Berlin Cleopatra]]" head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose.{{sfnp|Pina Polo|2013|pp=185–186}} [[Ernle Bradford]] writes that it is "reasonable to infer" Cleopatra had dark hair and "pale olive skin" by how she portrays herself as a "Eastern Mediterranean type" on her official coins, and that she challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman, "but as a civilized Greek."{{sfnp|Bradford|2000|pp=14, 17}}

The question was the subject of a heated exchange between [[Mary Lefkowitz]], who has referred in her articles to a debate she had with one of her students about the question of whether Cleopatra was black, and [[Molefi Kete Asante]], Professor of African American Studies at [[Temple University]]. In response to ''Not Out of Africa'' by Lefkowitz, Asante wrote the article "Race in Antiquity: Truly Out of Africa", in which he emphasized that he "can say without a doubt that Afrocentrists do not spend time arguing that either [[Socrates]] or Cleopatra were black."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asante.net/articles/19/race-in-antiquity-truly-out-of-africa/ |title=Race in Antiquity: Truly Out of Africa &amp;#124; Dr. Molefi Kete Asante |website=Asante.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[BBC]] documentary speculated that [[Arsinoe IV]], the half-sister of Cleopatra VII, may have been part North African and then further speculated that Cleopatra's mother, thus Cleopatra herself, might also have been part North African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Thür of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], who in the 1990s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BC tomb in [[Ephesus]] (modern [[Turkey]]), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull.

[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] wrote a dissenting essay criticizing the findings, pointing out that one, there is no surviving name on the tomb and that the claim the tomb is alleged to invoke the shape of the [[Pharos Lighthouse]] "doesn't add up"; second, the skull doesn't survive intact and  the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsinoe's (the bones said to be that of a 15-18 year old child, with Arsinoe being around her mid twenties at her death); and thirdly, since Cleopatra and Arsinoe were not known to have the same mother, "the ethnic argument goes largely out of the window." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/the-skeleton-of-cleopatras-sister-steady-on/ |title=The skeleton of Cleopatra's sister?

Ancient Egyptians referred to their homeland as ''[[Km (hieroglyph)|Kmt]]'' (conventionally pronounced as ''Kemet''). According to [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], the Egyptians referred to themselves as "Black" people or ''kmt'', and ''km'' was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa II: ''Ancient Civilizations of Africa''|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diop 1974" /&gt;{{rp|246–248}} A review of David Goldenberg's ''The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam'' states that Goldenberg "argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Molly Myerowitz|title=David M.

Turano et Paul Vandepitte, ''Pour une histoire de l'Afrique'', 2003, pp. 50 &amp;51&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that ''kmt'' was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people, which Diop claimed was black.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar 1990 21, 26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=21, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that the ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography.&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148" /&gt;

Mainstream scholars hold that ''kmt'' means "the black land" or "the black place", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil that was washed down from Central Africa by the annual [[Nile]] inundation. By contrast the barren [[desert]] outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called ''dšrt'' (conventionally pronounced ''deshret'') or "the red land".&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148"&gt;Shavit 2001: 148&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kemp|2006|p=21}} Raymond Faulkner's ''Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian'' translates ''kmt'' into "Egyptians",&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Faulkner, ''A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian,'' Oxford: Griffith Institute, 2002, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Gardiner|Gardiner]] translates it as "the Black Land, Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Gardiner | first= Alan | title= Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs | edition= 3 | publisher= Griffith Institute, Oxford | year=1957 | origyear= 1927 | isbn= 978-0-900416-35-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[UNESCO]] Symposium in 1974, Sauneron, Obenga, and [[Cheikh Anta Diop|Diop]] concluded that KMT and KM meant black.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar 1990 40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sauneron clarified that the adjective ''Kmtyw'' means "people of the black land" rather than "black people", and that the Egyptians never used the adjective ''Kmtyw'' to refer to the various black peoples they knew of, they only used it to refer to themselves.&lt;ref name="google40"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=snippet&amp;q=dynastic%20race&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=1 |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-06-02|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian art===
Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples contained thousands of paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal a great deal about the people of that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.&lt;ref name="egyptologyonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyonline.com/book_of_gates.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207072141/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/book_of_gates.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Booth, ''The Ancient Egyptians for Dummies'' (2007) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[Champollion]] states in his work ''Egypte Ancienne'' that the [[Egyptians]] and [[Nubians]] are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and [[relief]]s. University of Chicago scholars assert that Nubians are generally depicted with black paint, but the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range "from dark red to brown to black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nubia Gallery|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/nubia/huy.html|publisher=The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy, as well as Ramses II's temple at Beit el-Wali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=22–23, 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Snowden indicates that Romans had accurate knowledge of "negroes of a red, copper-colored complexion ... among African tribes".&lt;ref name="Snowden 1970 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snowden|first=Frank|title=Blacks in Antiquity|year=1970|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Najovits states "Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately, arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature."&lt;ref name="Egypt p. 318"&gt;''Egypt, Trunk of the Tree, A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land'', Vol. 2. by Simson Najovits p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He continues, "There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddish-brown Egyptians and black Nubians."&lt;ref name="Egypt p. 318"/&gt;

However, Manu Ampim, a professor at [[Merritt College]] specializing in African and African American history and culture, claims in the book ''Modern Fraud: The Forged Ancient Egyptian Statues of Ra-Hotep and Nofret,'' that many ancient Egyptian statues and artworks are modern frauds that have been created specifically to hide the "fact" that the ancient Egyptians were black, while authentic artworks that demonstrate black characteristics are systematically defaced or even "modified". Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence that "proves" that the ancient Egyptians were black, under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses "European" scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.&lt;ref&gt;"Ra-Hotep and Nofret: Modern Forgeries in the Cairo Museum?" pp. 207–212 in Egypt: Child of Africa (1994), edited by Ivan Van Sertima.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuampim.com/ |title=AFRICANA STUDIES |publisher=Manuampim.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampim has a specific concern about the painting of the "Table of Nations" in the Tomb of Ramses III (KV11). The "Table of Nations" is a standard painting that appears in a number of tombs, and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased.&lt;ref name="egyptologyonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/gate/gate20.htm |title=The Book of Gates: The Book of Gates: Chapter VI. The Gate Of Teka-Hra. The Fifth Division of the Tuat |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it described the "four races of men" as follows: (translation by E.A. Wallis Budge:&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt; "The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third are NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]."

The archaeologist Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien.'' In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section, called the "Ergänzungsband" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius's original work. One of them, plate 48, illustrated one example of each of the four "nations" as depicted in KV11, and shows the "Egyptian nation" and the "Nubian nation" as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Professor Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting, and that it "proves" that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the [[Nubians]], even though he admits no other examples of the "Table of Nations" show this similarity. He has further accused "Euro-American writers" of attempting to mislead the public on this issue.&lt;ref name="manuampim.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuampim.com/ramesesIII.htm |title=Africana Studies. Tomb of Rameses III |publisher=Manuampim.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late Egyptologist, Frank Yurco, visited the tomb of Ramses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Ergänzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a "pastiche" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius's notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Yurco, "Two Tomb-Wall Painted Reliefs of Ramesses III and Sety I and Ancient Nile Valley Population Diversity", in ''Egypt in Africa'' (1996), ed. by Theodore Celenko.&lt;/ref&gt; (Erik Hornung, ''The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity'', 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name="manuampim.com"/&gt;

At the [[UNESCO]] "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the [[Meroitic script]]" in [[Cairo]] in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with "profound" disagreement.&lt;ref name="Africa, Volume 2 p. 43 &amp; 44"/&gt; Most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color.&lt;ref name="Africa, Volume 2 p. 46"/&gt; The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see [[population history of Egypt]]).&lt;ref name="Egypt p. 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yurco Athena"&gt;Frank Yurco, "An Egyptological Review" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. pp. 62–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonia R. Zakrzewski 2003"/&gt;

===Asiatic race theory===
The [[Hamitic|Asiatic race theory]] holds that the ancient Egyptians were the lineal descendants of the biblical [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], through his son [[Mizraim]]. This theory was the most dominant view from the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 500 AD) all the way up to the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hamitic Hypothesis; Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective", Edith R. Sanders, ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, 1969, pp. 521–532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Egyptian Civilisation'', Edouard Naville, ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 37, 1907, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of Ham were traditionally considered to be the darkest-skinned branch of humanity, either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the [[Curse of Ham]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1969, pp. 521–523.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Cheikh Anta Diop|Diop]] cites [[Gaston Maspero]] "Moreover, the Bible states that Mesraim, son of Ham. brother of Chus (Kush) ... and of Canaan, came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile."&lt;ref name="Diop 1974" /&gt;{{rp|5–9}}

By the 20th century, the Asiatic race theory and its various offshoots were abandoned but were superseded by two related theories: the eurocentric [[Hamitic|Hamitic hypothesis]], asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing with them all advanced agriculture, technology and civilization, and the [[Dynastic race theory]], proposing that Mesopotamian invaders were responsible for the dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC). In sharp contrast to the Asiatic race theory, neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1969, pp. 524–527ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caucasian / Hamitic hypothesis===
In 1844, [[Samuel George Morton]] wrote that the Nile valley "was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race",&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian Race: A Political History of Racial Identity'' By Bruce Baum, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants.&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;{{cite book|first=Samuel George |last=Morton|authorlink=Samuel George Morton|title=Crania Ægyptiaca, Or, Observations on Egyptian Ethnography Derived from Anatomy, History and the Monuments|chapter=Egyptian Ethnography|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1MGAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA4,M1|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Gliddon]] (1844) wrote: "The Egyptians were white men, of no darker hue than a pure Arab, a Jew, or a Phoenician."&lt;ref&gt;George Robins Gliddon ''Ancient Egypt: Her monuments, hieroglyphics, history and archaeology'' 1844, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar [[Hamitic]] hypothesis, which developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the [[Ethiopid]] and [[Arabid]] populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted that these people were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1969, pp. 525–532.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] in his ''Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan'' (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.&lt;ref name=Selig1913&gt;C.G. Seligman, "Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan", ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 43 (July–December 1913), pp. 593–705.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian anthropologist [[Giuseppe Sergi]] (1901) believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African ([[Hamitic]]) branch of the [[Mediterranean race]], which he called "Eurafrican". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or "Eurafrican" contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean "proper" branch and the Nordic (depigmentated) branch.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mediterranean Race: a Study of the Origins of European Peoples'', 1901, pp. v–vi, "Preface", also p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Sergi maintained in summary that the [[Mediterranean race]] (excluding the depigmentated Nordic or 'white') is: "a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Sergi, 1901, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] modified the theory in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;"Concepts of Race in the Historiography of Northeast Africa", Wyatt MacGaffey, ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired "brown race",&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Egyptians and the origin of Civilization'', 1911, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  most closely "linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe",&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1911, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and not [[Negroid]].&lt;ref&gt;As according to Smith the hair of the "Proto-Egyptian was precisely similar to that of the brunet South European" and "presented no resemblance whatever to the so-called 'wooly' appearance and peppercorn-like arrangement of the Negro's hair". - Smith, 1911, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's "brown race" is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi's Mediterranean race.&lt;ref&gt;"Neither in Sergi's nor in Elliot Smith's scheme are Brown and Mediterranean equivalent terms." – MacGaffey, 1966, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 1960s and late 1970s and was supported notably by [[Anthony John Arkell]] and [[George Peter Murdock]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1969, pp. 531; MacGaffey, 1966, pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turanid race hypothesis===
The Egyptologist [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] (1846) proposed that the ancient Egyptians belonged to the [[Turanid race]], linking them to the [[Tatars]]. He was inspired by some ancient Egyptian paintings, which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said "From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow, like that of the Mongul Tartars, who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race.... The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars."&lt;ref&gt;''History of Egypt'', 1846, Part I, p. 3 "The Asiatic Origin of the Race.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynastic race theory===
{{Main|Dynastic race theory}}
In the early 20th century, [[Flinders Petrie]], one of the leading Egyptologists of his day, noted that the skeletal remains found at predynastic sites at [[Naqada]] in Upper Egypt showed marked differentiation. Together with cultural evidence such as architectural styles, pottery styles, cylinder seals, and numerous rock and tomb paintings, he deduced that a [[Mesopotamia]]n force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times, imposed itself on the indigenous Badarian people, and become their rulers. This came to be called the "[[dynastic race theory]]".&lt;ref name="Egypt p. 15"&gt;''Early dynastic Egypt'', by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black Athena Revisited|author1=Mary R. Lefkowitz|author2=Guy MacLean Rogers|page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=97jwg1Xwpj0C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%2B%22dynastic+race+theory%22,+%2Bpetrie#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%22dynastic%20race%20theory%22%2C%20%2Bpetrie&amp;f=false|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2016-06-02|isbn=9780807845554|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory further argued that the Mesopotamian-founded state or states then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the [[First Dynasty of Egypt]].

In the 1950s, the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship. Scholars such as the Senegalese Egyptologist [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], fought against the Dynastic Race Theory with their own "Black Egyptian" theory and claimed, among other things, that European scholars supported the Dynastic Race Theory "to avoid having to admit that Ancient Egyptians were black".&lt;ref&gt;Epic encounters: culture, media, and U.S. interests in the Middle East – 1945–2000 by Melani McAlister&lt;/ref&gt; Bernal proposed that the Dynastic Race theory was conceived by European scholars to deny Egypt its African roots.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Athena Revisited'', by Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scientists agree that Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see [[population history of Egypt]]).&lt;ref name="Yurco Athena"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonia R.

'''Cecilia Mary Ady''' (28 November 1881 – 27 March 1958) was an [[England|English]] writer, academic and historian. She worked at the [[University of Oxford]] and like [[Julia Cartwright Ady|her mother]] she was known for her knowledge of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. She came to notice after her colleagues supported her reinstatement after she was dismissed by her former friend from her college.

==Life==
Ady was born in [[Edgcote]] in Northamptonshire in 1881. Her father was a reverend whilst her mother was a biographer and an amateur expert of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Her mother's interest in Italy was influenced by her uncle [[William Cornwallis Cartwright]].&lt;ref name=odnbmum&gt;Rosemary Mitchell, ‘Cartwright , Julia Mary (1851–1924)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40620, accessed 13 Nov 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother took on her daughters education and with that Ady went to Oxford where she obtained a first degree at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's Hall]] in 1903. She was a protege of the historian [[Edward Armstrong (historian)|Edward Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=adyodnb/&gt; He was commissioned to create a book series called ''The States of Italy''. His plans were not fulfilled and only Ady's book ''History of Milan under the Sforza'' was one of only two that were published.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;Benjamin G. Kohl, ‘Armstrong, Edward (1846–1928)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30448, accessed 13 Nov 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 she joined her alma mater as a tutor where she had a close relationship with the college's principal, [[Eleanor Jourdain]]. Jourdain eventually turned against Ady, allegedly jealous of her popularity.&lt;ref name=adyodnb/&gt; Ady was sacked from her position in November 1923 at Jourdain's insistence for disloyalty. Jourdain felt that Ady had leaked information to the staff about her plans for a vice-principal at the college.&lt;ref name="Griffin1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Penny Griffin|title=St Hugh’s: One Hundred Years of Women’s Education in Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vOvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=30 June 1986|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-07725-0|pages=44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ady protested and a mass resignation followed including six of the college's council. The matter was a matter of some interest and Lord Curzon was asked to investigate. She was, in time, cleared and Jourdain died just before she was to be asked to resign. The inquiry resulted in improvements to the employment conditions of female tutors.&lt;ref name=jour&gt;Janet Howarth, ‘Jourdain, Eleanor Frances (1863–1924)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48446, accessed 13 Nov 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ady then became a tutor with the Society of Home Students and in 1929 her old college reemployed her as a research fellow.&lt;ref name=adyodnb/&gt;

In 1937 she was awarded the degree of Doctor of Literature after she published a monograph titled ''The Bentivoglio of Bologna: a Study in Despotism''.&lt;ref name=adyodnb&gt;Benjamin G. Kohl, ‘Ady, Cecilia Mary (1881–1958)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40619, accessed 13 Nov 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ady died in [[Oxford]] in 1958. Afterwards her collegaues and former research students put together a book of donated essays - ''Italian Renaissance Studies'' (1960).

[[File:Christian Ludwig Ideler.jpg|thumb|Christian Ludwig Ideler]]
'''Christian Ludwig Ideler''' (21 September 1766 – 10 August 1846) was a [[German people|German]] [[chronologist]] and [[astronomer]].

==Life==

He was born in Gross-Brese near [[Perleberg]]. His earliest work was the editing in 1794 of an astronomical almanac for the [[Prussia]]n government. He taught mathematics and mechanics in the school of woods and forests, and also in the military school. In 1821, he became professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and in 1829 became a foreign member of the [[Institute of France]]. From 1816 to 1822 he was tutor to the young princes William Frederick and Charles. He died in [[Berlin]] on 10 August 1846.

==Works==

He devoted his life chiefly to the examination of ancient systems of chronology. In 1825-1826 he published his great work, ''Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie'' (“Handbook of mathematical and technical chronology,” 2 vols.; 2nd ed., 1883), re-edited as ''Lehrbuch der Chronologie'' (“Textbook of chronology,” 1831); a supplementary volume, ''Die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen'' (“The reckoning of time by the Chinese”), appeared in 1839 in Berlin.

He wrote also ''Historische Untersuchungen über die astronomischen Beobachtungen der Alten'' (“Historical investigations on the astronomical observations of the ancients,” Leipzig, 1806), ''Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen'' (“Investigations on the origin and significance of the names of stars”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Ideler |title=Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedentung der Sternnamen |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gxLA4xSXWy8C&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=J. F. Weiss |date=1809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Über den Ursprung des Thierkreises'' (“Origins of the zodiac,” 1838). With Nolte he published handbooks on English and French language and literature.

His son, [[Julius Ludwig Ideler]] (1809-1842), wrote ''Meteorologia veterum Graecorum et Romanorum'' (1832).

'''Cold War espionage''' describes the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]] activities during the [[Cold War]] (circa 1947-1991) between the Western allies (chief US, UK and [[NATO]]) and the Eastern Bloc ([[Soviet Union|The Soviet Union]] and aligned countries of Warsaw Pact).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alphahistory.com/coldwar/espionage |title=Cold War espionage |accessdate=8 April 2014 |publisher=Alpha History }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because each side was preparing to fight the other, intelligence on the opposing side's intentions, military, and technology was of paramount importance. To gather information, the two relied on a wide variety of military and civilian agencies.

While several organizations such as the [[CIA]] and [[KGB]] became synonymous with [[Cold War]] espionage, many others played key roles in the collection and protection of the section concerning detection of spying, and analysis of a wide host of [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence disciplines]].

== Background Information ==
[[History of Soviet espionage in the United States|Soviet espionage in the United States]] during the Cold War was an outgrowth in [[World War II]] [[nuclear espionage]], and Cold War espionage was depicted in works such as the [[James Bond]] and [[Matt Helm]] books and movies.

During the [[Cold War]], information was a key commodity. It was vital to know what the adversary was up to, and the possibility of using the hi-tech surveillance that is used today was not around. Instead of trusting technology, we relied on spies: people who infiltrated enemy territory and tried to discover information while staying undetected.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulick|first=Michael|date=2015|title=Intelligence in the Cold War|url=https://www.afio.com/publications/SULICK_Michael_Guide_to_Intelligence_in_the_Cold_War_from_INTEL_WINTER2014-15_Vol21_No1.pdf|journal=The Intelligencer|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Espionage]] activities continued from prior to the beginning of the cold war in the late thirties- early forties, and all the way through the late 1960s and even continuing through today. These spies were decoding encrypted information, and using many skills to gain an advantage over other enemy countries.

The Cold War was all about gaining the advantage of information about the enemies' atomic weaponry.  The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II led by the United States (and the [[Western Bloc]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] (and the [[Eastern Bloc]]).  Although the two powers never engaged in a full out war, both countries were constantly preparing for an all-out nuclear war.  Thus the use of spies to gain insight into the knowledge of how far their enemies were advancing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Major spy rings ==
[[Cambridge Five]]: The Cambridge Five consisted of five members that were recruited from the [[University of Cambridge]] in the 1930s. There is debate surrounding the exact timing of their recruitment, but it is generally believed that they were not recruited as agents until after they had graduated.  The group included [[Kim Philby]] (cryptonym 'Stanley'), [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] (cryptonym 'Homer'), [[Guy Burgess]] (cryptonym 'Hicks'), [[Anthony Blunt]] (cryptonyms 'Tony', 'Johnson'), and [[John Cairncross]] (cryptonym 'Liszt').  There were many others that were accused of being a part of the Cambridge Spy Ring, but these five members were collectively known as the Cambridge Five.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations|last=Trahair|first=Richard|publisher=Enigma books|year=2012|isbn=9781936274260|location=New York|pages=489–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portland Spy Ring]]: The Portland Spy Ring operated in England, as a Soviet spy ring, from the 1950s until 1961 when the core of the network were arrested by [[British Security Service]]s.  This spy ring was unique because they did not use the cover of an [[embassy]] as the cover for their spies.  Its members included [[Harry Houghton]], [[Ethel Gee]], [[Gordon Lonsdale]], and most famously Morris and [[Lona Cohen]] (cryptonym Peter and Helen Kroger).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Ware Group]]: Sleeper spy ring in US headed by [[J. Peters]], first organized under [[Harold Ware]], inherited by [[Whittaker Chambers]] (under orders from Peters), and also included:  [[John Abt]], [[Marion Bachrach]] (Abt's sister), [[Lee Pressman]], [[Alger Hiss]], [[Donald Hiss]], [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]], [[Nathan Witt]], [[Henry Collins (official)|Henry Collins]], [[George Silverman]], [[John Herrmann]], [[Nathaniel Weyl]], and [[Victor Perlo]].  When Chambers defected in 1938, the Ware Group went dormant and then broke up.  [[Harry Dexter White]] (below) contributed materials to Chambers but not as part of the Ware Group.

[[Silvermaster spy ring]]: The Silvermaster Spy Ring was led by [[Harry Dexter White]], assistant secretary of the Treasury and the second most influential member of the Treasury department.  His job was to aid placement of Soviet spies within the United States Government. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury Department]] was successfully infiltrated by many Soviet spies, the most successful of which belonged to the Silvermaster Spy Ring.  [[Harold Glasser]], [[Elizabeth Bentley]], and [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster|Nathan Silvermaster]] were other major members of the Silvermaster Spy Ring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Atomic spies]]: While the Atomic Spies were not exactly a network of spies, the collective information that was obtained by this group of Soviet spies was critical to the Soviet Union's ability to build an atomic bomb.  Many of the members of the Atomic spies group worked for, or around, the [[Manhattan Project]], or the United States building of the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This group included:

*[[Klaus Fuchs]]: a German-born British theoretical physicist.  He worked with the British delegation on the Manhattan Project.
*[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]]: an American who gained insight to the plans from the secret laboratory at Los Alamos and delivered it to the designers of the Soviet atomic bomb.
*[[Harry Gold]]: an American who was a courier for Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass.
*[[David Greenglass]]: an American machinist at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. He gave crude schematics of lab experiments to the Russians.
*[[Theodore Hall]]: an American, and the youngest physicist at Los Alamos, gave a detailed description of the Fat Man plutonium bomb and several processes for purifying plutonium to the Soviets.
*[[George Koval]]: an American-born son of a Russian family.  He obtained information from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Dayton Project about the Urchin detractor used for the Fat Man plutonium bomb.
*[[Irving Lerner]]: an American film director who was caught photographing the cyclotron at the University of California in 1944.
*[[Alan Nunn May]]: a British physicist who worked for the British nuclear research and then in Canada on the Manhattan Project. His uncovering in 1946 was responsible for the United States [[McMahon Act|restricting sharing atomic secrets]] with the British.
*[[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]: Americans who were involved in the coordinating and recruiting of an espionage network. Ethel's brother was David Greenglass.
*[[Saville Sax]]: an American who acted as a courier for Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall.
*[[Morton Sobell]]: an American engineer who admitted to spying for the Soviets and uncovered how extensive the Rosenberg's recruiting network was.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== American Satellite Surveillance Systems ==
Weapons System 117L - Weapons System 117L was the first program designed to develop space-based reconnaissance satellite systems.  Several satellite systems would be developed through this program including Corona, the Satellite and Missile Observation System ([[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]]), and the Missile Detection Alarm System ([[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Report: Weapons System 117L|last=Rockefeller|first=Alfred|publisher=Western Development Division|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]] - SAMOS or the Satellite and Missile Observation system was one of the first of a series of short lived satellite systems developed by the United States, operated from October 1960 to November 1962.  The SAMOS satellite system was one of the first systems developed through the WS-117L program.  The system consisted of three primary components: visual reconnaissance, communications, and electronic intelligence gathering. Of the eleven launched attempted, 8 were successful.  The program was likely cancelled because of poor image quality.  The satellite could produce photos with 100 foot resolution.  It was also heavily overshadowed by the Corona system operated by the CIA.

[[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]] - MIDAS or the Missile Defense Alarm System was a satellite system operated by the United States between 1960 and 1966.  This system was designed to be made of twelve satellites, although only nine satellites were successfully launched.  The system was designed to provide early warning of Soviet missile launches.  The system was eventually cancelled because of the high price and because of the slow warning times.  This system, however, would be directly responsible for technologies used in its successors.

[[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] - Corona was among the first of a series of reconnaissance satellite systems developed through the WS-117L program.  The Corona program was headed by the Central Intelligence Agency along with the Air Force.  Corona satellites were used to photograph Soviet and other installations.  The first successful Corona mission began on August 10, 1963. The Corona satellite system was expedited largely in part to the U-2 incident in 1960. All of the Corona missions, with the exception of the KH-11 Kennan program, would make use of photographic film, which would have to survive re-entry through the atmosphere and be recovered.

[[Keyhole satellite|Keyhole]] - Keyhole was the designation for the initial Corona launches, which included KH-1, KH-2, KH-3, KH-4A, and KH-4B. The name was used because it is analogous to spying through the keyhole of a door. 144 satellites would be launched through this program, and 102 returned usable photos.

[[KH-5 Argon|Keyhole/Argon]] (KH-5) - Argon was the designation the surveillance satellites,manufactured by Lockheed, used by the United States from February 1961 to August 1964. Argon made use of photographic film in a way similar of the original Corona satellites.   Of the twelve known launches, seven were not successful for varying reasons.

[[KH-6 Lanyard|Keyhole/Lanyard]] (KH-6) - Lanyard was the designation for the first, albeit unsuccessful, attempt to establish a high resolution, optical satellite system.  This program would be led by the newly established National Reconnaissance Office, and operated from March–July 1963.  Because it was only able to achieve a resolution similar to that of the KH-4 satellites, it was discontinued after only 3 launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/k/kh-6.html|title=KH-6|website=www.astronautix.com|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KH-7 Gambit|Keyhole/Gambit]] (KH-7) - Gambit was the next of a series of satellites operated by the United States, by the National Reconnaissance Office, from July 1963 to June 1967.  It was among the first successful Corona missions as it produced some of the first high resolution photos.  These photos were typically of Soviet and Chinese missile emplacements. Gambit satellites would make use of a three camera system and missions would last typically up to eight days.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/GAMBHEX.html|title=NRO - Declassifed Records:  GAMBIT and HEXAGON Programs|website=www.nro.gov|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KH-8 Gambit 3|Keyhole/Gambit III]] (KH-8) - The Gambit III satellite system was amongst the longest serving satellite reconnaissance programs operated by the United States during the Cold War.  This satellite system would operate from July 1966 to April 1984.  Of the fifty-four launch attempts, only three would fail, all of which were attributed to rocket failure.  The average mission time of the Gambit III satellite systems were thirty-one days.  The Gambit III satellites would differ from the Gambit I satellites in that the Gambit III had a four camera system, which carried over twelve thousand feet of film, and were able to produce resolutions as small as four inches.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[KH-9 Hexagon|Keyhole/Hexagon]] (KH-9) - The Hexagon satellite system, commonly known as Big Bird, this satellite system was operated from 1971 and 1986. The Hexagon system was officially known as the Broad Coverage Photo Reconnaissance satellites. These satellites photographed large areas of the earth at a time with moderate resolution.  These satellites were also used for mapping missions, which were used in map making.  Three Hexagon missions also included electronic intelligence or ELINT gathering capabilities.  These were used to eavesdrop on soviet communications and on soviet missile launches.  Twenty launches were attempted, only one was unsuccessful.  These satellites operated for an increasing duration of time, with the longest mission lasting 275 days.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[KH-11 Kennen|Keyhole/Kennan]] (KH-11) - The KH-11 Kennan, which goes under the code name Crystal, was first launched in 1976, and missions are still ongoing to this day.  According to leaked documents, this program is currently operation under the code name Evolved Enhanced Crystal.  The Kennan satellite system was the first satellite system to use electro-optical imaging, which gives real time imaging capabilities.  The resolution of these satellites is estimated to be as low as 2 inches.  These satellites are unique in that they have been placed in sun-synchronous orbits, which allow them to use shadows to help discern ground features.  These satellites became famous in 1978 when a CIA employee tried to leak the design of the satellite to the Soviets.  He was tried and convicted of espionage.

Keyhole/Improved Crystal  (KH-12) – The later KH-11 satellites have been called KH-12 improved Crystal or Ikon satellites.  These satellites also had increased download times which allowed for faster processing of photos.  It is also suspected that these satellites may have stealth technology to avoid detection by other satellites.

[[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] - The Vela satellite system was developed to by the United States to ensure that the Soviet Union complied with the Partial Test Ban Treaty which was ratified in 1963.  The satellites were designed to monitor for nuclear explosions in space and in the atmosphere by measuring for neutrons and gamma rays.  A total of twelve Vela satellites were launched during the course of the Cold War.  The Vela satellites became publicly famous because of the Vela Incident which occurred on 22 September 1979.  It was theorized at the time that it was a nuclear test conducted by South Africa and Israel, but new evidence does not support this theory.  They have also been used in the study of [[Gamma-ray burst|Gamma-Ray Bursts]].


== American Surveillance Aircraft ==
U-2 – The U-2 aircraft, known as the "Dragon Lady", was developed by the [[Lockheed Skunk Works]], and was first flown on August 1, 1955. The aircraft was initially flown by the CIA, but control was later transferred to the Air Force. The aircraft was designed to fly at altitudes of 70,000 ft.  The U-2 was equipped with a camera which had a resolution of 2.5 feet at an altitude of 60,000 ft.  The first overflights of the Soviet Union by the U-2 began in May 1956.  The aircraft became publicly prominent after a U-2 aircraft flown by Francis Gary Powers was hit by an SA-2 missile and crash landed in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/|title=The Secret History of the U-2 - and Area 51|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SR-71 – The [[SR-71]] Blackbird is a long-range reconnaissance aircraft developed by Lockheed Skunk Works, and designed by Kelly Johnson.  The aircraft is known for setting speed and altitude records.  The SR-71 was equipped with optical and infrared imaging systems, electronic intelligence gathering systems, side looking airborne radar, and recorders for those systems which are listed.  The aircraft required two personnel to pilot it, one to pilot the aircraft, and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO) to operate the systems.

== Soviet Satellite Surveillance Systems ==
[[Zenit (satellite)|Zenit]] (Zenith) - The Zenith Satellite program, was a satellite program developed by the Soviet Union and used from 1961 to 1994.  During the course of its lifespan over 500 Zenith satellites were launched, making it the most used satellite system ever.  The Soviets concealed the nature of the system by giving the satellites the Kosmos designation.  The Zenith satellites had an advantage over the satellites developed by the United States, in that they could be reused.  A total of eight variants would be developed for a variety of mission types, ranging from high-resolution photography to ELINT to cartographic and topographic missions.

[[Yantar (satellite)|Yantar]] - The Yantar satellites, designed to replace the Zenit satellite system, are among the newest Russian satellites. Yantar satellites have been launched as recently as 2015.  Two variants of the satellite have been developed for high-resolution photography and for medium-resolution broad spectrum imaging.
==Historiography==
{{Further|History of espionage}}
After 1990s new memoirs and archival materials have opened up the study of espionage and intelligence during the Cold War. Scholars are reviewing how its origins, its course, and its outcome were shaped by the intelligence activities of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other key countries.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond L.  Garthoff, "Foreign intelligence and the historiography of the Cold War." ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 6.2 (2004): 21-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Hopkins, "Continuing debate and new approaches in Cold War history." ''Historical Journal'' 50.4 (2007): 913-934.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special attention is paid to how complex images of one's adversaries were shaped by secret intelligence that is now publicly known.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Maddrell, ed. ''The Image of the Enemy: Intelligence Analysis of Adversaries Since 1945'' (Georgetown UP, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union proved especially successful in placing spies in Britain and West Germany. It was largely unable to repeat its successes in the 1930s in the United States.  NATO, on the other hand, also had a few successes  of importance, of whom [[Oleg Gordievsky]] was perhaps the most influential. He was a senior KGB officer who was a double agent on behalf of Britain's MI6, providing a stream of high-grade intelligence that had an important influence on the thinking of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He was spotted by [[Aldrich Ames]] a Soviet agent who worked for the CIA, but he was successfully exfiltrated from Moscow in 1985.  Biographer Ben McIntyre argues he was the West's most valuable human asset, especially for his deep psychological insights into the inner circles of the Kremlin.  He convinced Washington and London that the fierceness and bellicosity of the Kremlin was a product of fear, and military weakness, rather than an urge for world conquest. Thatcher and Reagan concluded they could moderate their own anti-Soviet rhetoric, as successfully happened when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power, thus ending the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Macintyre, ''The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War'' (2018).

[[File:Consensus Tigurinus.jpg|thumb|Title page of 1551 Geneva edition]]
The '''''Consensus Tigurinus''''' or '''Consensus of Zurich''' was a document intended to bring unity to the [[Protestant]] churches on their doctrines of the [[sacraments]], particularly the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]. [[John Calvin]], who stood in between the [[Lutheran]] view of [[Real Presence]] and the [[Zwingli]]an view of pure symbolism,  wrote the first draft of the document in November 1548, with notes by [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. It taught:

:that the Sacraments are not in and of themselves effective and conferring [[divine grace|grace]], but that God, through the [[Holy Spirit]], acts through them as means; that the internal effect appears only in the [[predestination|elect]]; that the good of the Sacraments consists in leading us to [[Christ]], and being instruments of the grace of God, which is sincerely offered to all; that in [[baptism]] we receive the remission of sins, although this proceeds primarily not from baptism, but from the blood of Christ; that in the Lord's Supper we eat and drink the body and blood of Christ, not, however, by means of a carnal presence of Christ's human nature, which is in heaven, but by the power of the Holy Spirit and the devout elevation of our soul to  heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.ii.ix.html |title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes |volume=I |author=[[Philip Schaff]] |chapter=The Consensus of Zurich. A.D. 1549 |pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin sent the document to the Swiss churches, but the Synod at [[Berne]] opposed Calvin's view strongly and continued to do so until after Calvin's death. In May 1549, Calvin met with [[William Farel]] and Bullinger in [[Zurich]], and the three revised the document into its final form, which was published in Zurich and [[Geneva]] in 1551. It attempted to coalesce the Calvinist and the advanced Zwinglian doctrines while standing opposed to [[transubstantiation]], the [[Roman Catholic]] view, and [[sacramental union]], the Lutheran view. It was accepted by the churches in Zurich, Geneva,  [[Saint Gall]], [[Schaffhausen]], the [[Grisons]], [[Neuchâtel]], and eventually by [[Basel]], and brought them into harmony with one another. It was "favorably received" in France, England, and parts of Germany, but while [[Melancthon]] said that he understood the Swiss for the first time and would no longer write against them, it was attacked by the [[Gnesio-Lutheran]] [[Joachim Westphal (of Hamburg)|Joachim Westphal]] and "became the innocent occasion of the second sacramental war."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, pp. 472–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Яворницький Д.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Dmytro Yavornytsky in 1885.]]

'''Dmytro Ivanovych Yavornytsky''' or '''Dmitry Ivanovich Yavornitsky''' ({{lang-uk|Дмитро́ Іва́нович Яворни́цький}}, {{lang-ru|Дмитрий Иванович Яворницкий}}) (November 6, 1855, [[Kharkov Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] – August 5, 1940, [[Dnipro|Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Soviet Union]]) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[USSR|Soviet]] academician, [[historian]], [[archeologist]], [[Ethnography|ethnographer]], [[folklorist]], and [[Lexicography|lexicographer]]. Yavornytsky was a member of Moscow Archaeological Society (from 1885), of St. Petersburg Russian Archaeological Society (from 1886) and academician of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (from 1929).

He was one of the most prominent researchers of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] from the time of the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]], and the author of their first general history. In recognition of his many contributions to the preservation of Zaporozhian history and culture, he is widely known as "the father of the Zaporozhians".

== Education and career ==
Yavornytsky was educated at [[Kharkov University]], [[Kazan University|Kazan]], and [[Warsaw University|Warsaw]] universities but his academic career was repeatedly interrupted for political reasons. Both as a student and later as a teacher, he was wrongly accused of "Ukrainian separatism" and dismissed from his position. In the 1890s, he was compelled to go to Russian Turkestan in order to find employment. In 1897, the Russian historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] helped him to obtain a position as lecturer on the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] at Moscow University. In 1902, when he was offered a position as Director of the [[Dnipro|Ekaterinoslav]] Historical Museum in modern-day central [[Ukraine]], he gladly accepted and remained there to the end of his life.

== Historian ==
[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin - Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks - Yorck.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of Turkey]]'' (1880-91). Yavornytsky is pictured as the secretary in the centre of the painting.]]
As a historian, Yavornytsky displayed a romantic-antiquarian approach to his subject and was a conscious follower of his predecessor [[Nikolay Kostomarov]]. He was an enthusiast who avidly sought out documents and material artifacts, as well as stories and the songs of the elderly, concerning the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and he wrote his histories on the basis of this material. He was a pioneer of Zaporozhian history and was the first to compile an extensive archive of materials on their entire history — from their origins, to their demise. He published much of this material in various collections, often at his own expense.

Yavornytsky's major work was the ''History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' which was published in Russian in three volumes between 1892 and 1897. He planned, but never completed, a fourth volume. In this and in his other works, he portrayed the Zaporozhians as representatives of Ukrainian liberty. Later Ukrainian historians criticized him as being uncritical and unsystematic in his collection of source materials ([[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]) and lacking an appreciation for Ukrainian statehood ([[Dmytro Doroshenko]]), but Yavornytsky wrote at a time when political circumstances and the Imperial Russian censors were extremely oppressive&lt;ref name="umoloda"&gt;''"Літописець Запорозької Січі - Минуло 150 років від дня народження Дмитра Яворницького", Ukraina Moloda, November 2011'', {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any synthesis of Ukrainian history which displayed an enthusiasm for the subject, let alone political independence, was highly suspect.&lt;ref name="umoloda" /&gt; His ''History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' was a pioneering work which did display such an enthusiasm.

== Other scholarly interests ==
Yavornytsky was a pioneer in the fields of [[ethnography]], [[folkloristics]], and [[lexicography]]. He made numerous contributions to the historical geography of the Zaporozhian lands, and mapped in detail the [[Dnieper River]] rapids with the locations of the various [[Zaporozhian Sich]]es, or fortified headquarters. He published a large collection of Ukrainian [[folksong]]s (1906; partly reprinted, 1990) as soon as the censor would permit it, contributed to [[Borys Hrinchenko]]'s great Ukrainian dictionary, and after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] began publication of one of his own (1920).

He increased the holdings of the Yekaterinoslav Museum from 5,000 to 80,000 items. Yavornytsky commissioned the best Ukrainian and Russian artists of his time ([[Opanas Slastion]], [[Serhii Vasylkivsky]], Nikolai Samokish, and [[Ilya Repin]]) to illustrate his various books, which were sometimes works of art in themselves. Especially notable in this regard is his ''From Ukrainian Antiquity'' (1900; reprinted in Ukrainian translation, 1991) which was lavishly illustrated in full colour and contained parallel texts in Russian and French so that it could be read abroad.

== Legacy ==
During the [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|repressions]] of the 1930s under [[Joseph Stalin]], Yavornytsky was prevented from publishing and had to keep a very low profile. During the [[Holodomor]] (the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33), he felt compelled to give away artifacts from his collections to obtain food for starving local peasants and others.

His death passed unnoticed both in the [[USSR]] and in the wider world. The Yekaterinoslav (today [[Dnipro]]) Museum was eventually renamed in his honour, and he was partially [[Rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] during the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Petro Shelest]] eras. Materials about him began to appear, and in the early 1970s a four volume collection of his works was prepared for publication. Political circumstances again prevented this from happening, but with the advent of the [[Perestroika]] reforms in the late 1980s, new materials began to appear and his major works were republished. At that time, his ''History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' was reprinted both in Russian and in Ukrainian (1990–91). The Ukrainian edition contains numerous additional illustrations. In 2004, the first volume of his ''Collected Works in Twenty Volumes'' was published.  The first ten volumes of this collection will be dedicated to his historical, geographical, and archaeological works, while the second ten volumes will contain his works on folklore, ethnography, and language.

Today, Yavornytsky is still widely revered as "the father of the Zaporozhians".

==Trivia==
[[File:Yavornitskii.gif|thumb|right|Detail of ''[[The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of Turkey|The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' (1880-91) in which Yavornytsky is pictured as the secretary.]]

Yavornytsky is portrayed on the painting of [[Ilya Repin]]'s "[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks|The Satirical Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of Turkey]]" as the [[secretary]] penning the letter to the Sultan. Repin consulted Yavornytsky during his work on the painting and made use of several artifacts from the historian's collection to use as accurate models.

The '''Doliskana inscriptions''' ({{lang-ka|დოლისყანას წარწერები}}) are the [[Georgian language]] inscriptions written in the Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script on the [[Doliskana|Doliskana Monastery]], located in the historical [[medieval]] Georgian [[Kingdom of Tao-Klarjeti]] (modern-day [[Artvin Province]] of [[Turkey]]). The inscriptions mention Georgian prince and titular king [[Sumbat I of Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastmond, Antony, Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia, 1998, pp. 224-226&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are dated to the first half of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Shoshiashvili, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominic Pace''' (1851–1907) was a Maltese [[theologian]] and minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in Aristotelico-Thomist [[Scholasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Pace was born at [[Vittoriosa, Malta]], on December 17, 1851. He joined the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in 1867 at almost 16 years of age. He accomplished his institutional studies in philosophy with the Dominicans at [[Rabat, Malta]], and his theological ones with the Dominicans at [[Vittoriosa]]. Due to the [[colera]] epidemic which hit the [[Maltese islands]] in those days, Pace was sent to [[Florence, Italy]], at the convent of Saint Maximin, to pursue his theological studies there. In 1874 he acquired his colour in philosophy and theology.

Back in [[Malta]], Pace was ordained a priest, and chosen as the [[Master's degree|Master]] of [[Dominican order|Dominican]] Students at [[Rabat, Malta]]. Here, from 1874 onwards, he also taught philosophy at the Dominican [[Studium Generale]]. In recognition of his publication ''Difesa della Dottrina di S. Tommaso d’Aquino'' in 1877, Pace was made member of the Philosophical-Medical Academy of [[Bologna, Italy]]. Later, he was also awarded the title [[General Preacher]] by the [[Order of Preachers]] in [[Rome, Italy]].

Pace died at [[Vittoriosa]] on June 29, 1907. Though his funeral was held at [[Vittoriosa]], he was buried within the church of the Dominicans at [[Rabat, Malta]].

==Work==
Pace’s only extant work, '''''Difesa della Dottrina di S. Tommaso d’Aquino''''' (A Defence of the Doctrine of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. I, pp. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1877 (Tipografia E. Laferla, [[Malta]]), was composed as a response to a book published by a priest, Francis Reale, in 1873 in which, while discussing the [[Bible]], he attributed to [[Aquinas]] certain theories considered erroneous by Pace. Reale went so far to suggest that [[Aquinas]] was a [[Heresy|heretic]].

Since Reale also proposed that most [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] do not agree with [[Aquinas]]’ doctrine on humans’ natural disposition to know [[God]], Pace counters such a proposition. Accordingly, his pamphlet, which is made up of just 25 pages, deals mainly with humans’ natural knowledge of [[God]], and the natural disposition of pagans to believe in [[Jesus Christ]]. Of course, the source of Pace’s teachings is [[Aquinas]] himself. Nevertheless, many [[biblical]] references and citations are included too. Pace philosophically maintains that [[Aquinas]] is correct in what he teaches, and that all [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] subscribed to his point of view.

Understanably, the ''Difesa'' is a polemical work. Though Pace recognises that philosophy should have no authority except reason, he submits that [[Aquinas]] is a clear and authoritative reflection enough of natural reason.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7071">'''Dynastic cycle''' ({{zh|t=朝代循環|s=朝代循环|p=Cháodài Xúnhuán|first=t}}) is an important political theory in [[History of China|Chinese history]]. According to this theory, each [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] rises to a political, cultural, and economic peak and then, because of moral corruption, declines, loses the [[Mandate of Heaven]], and falls, only to be replaced by a new dynasty. The cycle then repeats under a surface pattern of repetitive motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin O. Reischauer, “The Dynastic Cycle,” in John Meskill, ''The Pattern of Chinese History'', (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1965), pp. 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

It sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties, implying that there is little basic development or change in social or economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5tKw11K8YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dillon+dictionary+chinese+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sIlKVM3WGLLesATzu4HwDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dynastic%20cycle&amp;f=false Dynastic cycle]," in {{cite book |last = Dillon, Michael  |year = 1998 |title = China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary |publisher = Curzon| location = Richmond, Surrey |isbn = 978-0700704392 |ref = none}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[John K. Fairbank]] expressed the doubts of many historians when he wrote that "the concept of the dynastic cycle... has been a major block to the understanding of the fundamental dynamics of Chinese history."&lt;ref&gt;John K. Fairbank and Edwin O. Reischauer, ''East Asia: The GreatTradition''(Boston, 1960), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cycle==
The  cycle appears as follows:{{sfnb|Fairbank|1979| p= 102}}

#A new ruler unites China, founds a new dynasty, and gains the [[Mandate of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"&gt;Ching, Frank. Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1974. p 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
#China, under the new dynasty, achieves prosperity.
#The population increases.
# Corruption becomes rampant in the imperial court, and the empire begins to enter decline and instability.
#A natural disaster wipes out farm land. The disaster normally would not have been a problem; however, together with the Corruption  and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], it causes famine.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The famine causes the population to rebel and a civil war ensues.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The ruler loses the Mandate of Heaven.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The population decreases because of the violence.&lt;ref name="Wills, John E p. 35"&gt;Wills, John E. Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994- p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
#China goes through a warring states period.&lt;ref name="Wills, John E p. 35"/&gt;
#One state emerges victorious.
#The state starts a new empire.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The empire gains the Mandate of Heaven.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
:::(The cycle repeats itself.)

The Mandate of Heaven was the idea that the Emperor was favored by Heaven to rule over China. The Mandate of Heaven explanation was championed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mencius]] during the [[Warring States period]].&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;

It has 3 main phases:
#The first is the beginning of the dynasty.
#The second is at the middle of the dynasty's life and is the peak of the dynasty.
#The last period is the decline of the dynasty, both politically and economically, until it finally collapses.

==Significance==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

Chinese history is traditionally represented in terms of dynastic cycles. Through its long history, the Chinese have been ruled not by one dynasty, but by a succession of different dynasties. The first dynasty in China to be described in ancient historical records such as [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and [[Bamboo Annals]] is the [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]], which was succeeded by the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], although concrete existence of the Xia is yet to be archaeologically proven.

Among these dynasties the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] are often considered as particularly strong periods, although other dynasties are famous for cultural and other achievements (for instance, the [[Song dynasty]] is sometimes associated with rapid economic development). Han and Tang, as well as other long, stable dynasties were followed by periods of disorder and the break-up of China into small regimes.

Out of disorder a leader eventually arose who unified the country and imposed strong central authority. For example, after the Han various dynasties ruled parts of China until [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Yang Jian]] reunited the country and established the [[Sui dynasty]]. The Sui set the scene for the long and prosperous Tang. After the fall of Tang, China again saw a period of political upheaval.

There is a famous Chinese proverb expressed in the 16th century novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] that says "After a long split, a union will occur; after a long union, a split will occur" (分久必合，合久必分). Each of these rulers would claim the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule.

Although this well-known dynastic periodization of China is more or less based on traditional Sinocentric ideology, it also applies to non-native rulers who sought to gain the Mandate of Heaven. While most ruling dynasties in Chinese history were founded by native Chinese, there were also non-native or [[Conquest Dynasties]] established by non-Han Chinese people beyond the traditional border of central part of China dominated by Han Chinese people (also known as [[China proper]]). These include the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] founded by [[Mongol]]s and the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] founded by [[Manchu]]s, who later conquered the central part of China and assumed the title of [[Emperor of China]].

[[File:Fasti Praenestini Massimo n2.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Fasti Praenestini]]'' for the month of April (''[[Aprilis]]''), showing the letters of the nundinal cycle (an eight-day market week) on the left edge]]

Some historical calendars had '''"[[week]]s" of eight days'''.

==Burma==
{{further|Burmese zodiac#Weekdays}}
In the Burmese version of Theravada Buddhism, the week has eight days. Wednesday is divided into Wednesday proper (midnight to noon) and Rahu (noon to midnight). Each day is associated with a compass direction, a planet, and a totem animal.

==Nundinum==
{{Main article|Nundinae}}
The ancient [[Etruscans]] developed an eight-day market week known as the [[nundinum]] around the 8th or 7th century [[Anno Domini|BC]]. This was passed on to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] no later than the 6th century BC. As Rome expanded, it encountered the seven-day week and for a time attempted to include both. The popularity of the seven-day rhythm won and the eight-day week disappeared.

The cycle of seven days, named after the sun, the moon, and the five planets visible to the naked eye, was already customary in the time of [[Justin Martyr]], who wrote of the Christians meeting on the Day of the Sun (Sunday).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvii.html Apology, chapter LXVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] eventually established the seven-day week in the [[Roman calendar]] in AD 321.&lt;ref&gt;

==Celtic calendar==
{{Further|Celtic calendar}}
The [[Celts]] used periods of darkness such as night and winter to begin their calculations of time.  This meant that the first period of time in a "week" was a night, followed by a day. Further, they also counted the ending night period, giving rise to periods of time with more nights than days.  In Irish, the term ''nómad'' is used to signify a small number of days and is exactly the length of the nine night week as in ''co cend nomaide'' - a period of time with nine nights bracketing eight days. The nine nights divided nicely into a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] of 27 nights.  In Welsh a similar word ''wythnos'' meaning "a week" literally means "an eight-night" since it started and ended with a period of night bracketing seven days.  Similarly a fortnight ''pythefnos'' means "a fifteen night".&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:L'instruction d'un jeune prince, par Georges Chastelain.jpg|thumb|[[Charles the Bold]] accepting book from Georges Chastellain, miniature in ''L'instruction d'un jeune Prince.'']]
'''Georges Chastellain''' (c. 1405 or c. 1415 &amp;ndash; 20 March 1475), [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] chronicler and poet, was a native of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] in [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Georges Chastellain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chastellain's historical works are valuable for the accurate information they contain. As a poet he was famous among his contemporaries. He was the great master of the school of ''[[grands rhétoriqueurs]]'', whose principal characteristics were fondness for the most artificial forms and a profusion of Latinisms and graecisms.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Georges Chastellain derived his surname from the fact that his ancestors were [[burgrave]]s or [[châtelain]]s of the town; his parents, who belonged to illustrious Flemish families, were probably the Jean Chastellain and his wife Marie de Masmines mentioned in the town records in 1425 and 1432. A copy of an epitaph originally at [[Valenciennes]] states that he died on 20 March 1474-5 aged seventy. But since he states that he was so young a child in 1430 that he could not recollect the details of events in that year, and since he was an ''ecolier'' at [[Leuven|Louvain]] in 1430, his birth may probably be placed nearer 1415 than 1405.

He saw active service in the Anglo-French wars and probably elsewhere, winning the surname of L'adventureux. In 1434 he received a gift from [[Philip the Good]], duke of Burgundy, for his military services, but on the conclusion of the peace of Arras in the next year he abandoned soldiering for diplomacy. The next ten years were spent in France, where he was connected with [[Georges de la Trémoille]], and afterwards entered the household of [[Pierre de Brézé]], at that time [[seneschal]] of [[Poitou]], by whom he was employed on missions to the duke of Burgundy, in an attempt to establish better relations between [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] and the duke.

During these years Chastellain had ample opportunity of obtaining an intimate knowledge of French affairs, but on the further breach between the two princes, Chastellain left the French service to enter Philip's household. He was at first pantler, then carver, titles which are misleading as to the actual nature of his services, which were those of a diplomatist; and in 1457 he became a member of the ducal council. He was continually employed on diplomatic errands until 1455, when, owing apparently to ill-health, he received apartments in the palace of the counts of [[French Hainaut|Hainaut]] at Salle-le-Comte, Valenciennes, with a considerable pension, on condition that the recipient should put in writing ''choses nouvelles et morales'', and a chronicle of notable events. That is to say, he was appointed Burgundian historiographer with a recommendation to write also on other subjects not strictly within the scope of a chronicler.

===Mid-life===
From this time he worked hard at his ''Chronique'', with occasional interruptions in his retreat to fulfil missions in France or to visit the Burgundian court. He was assisted, from about 1463 onwards, by his disciple and [[continuator]], [[Jean Molinet]], whose rhetorical and redundant style may be fairly traced in some passages of the ''Chronique''. [[Charles, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] maintained the traditions of his house as a patron of literature, and showed special favor to Chastellain, who, after being constituted ''indiciaire'' or chronicler of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], was himself made a [[knight]] of the order on 2 May 1473. He died at Valenciennes in 1475, on 13 February (according to the treasury accounts), or on 20 March (according to his epitaph). He left an illegitimate son, to whom was paid in 1524 one hundred and twenty [[French livre|livres]] for a copy of the ''Chronique'' intended for [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]'s sister Mary, queen of Hungary. Only about one third of the whole work, which extended from 1419 to 1474, is known to be in existence, but manuscripts carried by the [[Habsburg]]s to [[Vienna]] or [[Madrid]] may possibly yet be discovered.

Among his contemporaries Chastellain acquired a great reputation by his poems and occasional pieces now little considered. The unfinished state of his ''Chronique'' at the time of his death, coupled with political considerations, may possibly account for the fact that it remained unprinted during the century that followed his death, and his historical work was only disinterred from the libraries of Arras, Paris and Brussels by the painstaking researches of Jean Alexandre Buchon in 1825.

Chastellain was constantly engaged during the earlier part of his career in negotiations between the French and Burgundian courts, and thus had personal knowledge of the persons and events dealt with in his history. A partisan element in writing of French affairs was inevitable in a Burgundian chronicle. This feature appears most strongly in his treatment of [[Joan of Arc]]; and the attack on [[Agnès Sorel]] seems to have been dictated by the [[Dauphin of France|dauphin]] (afterwards [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]), then a refugee in Burgundy, of whom he was afterwards to become a severe critic.

== Legacy ==

Among his most sympathetic portraits are those of his friend Pierre de Brézé and of [[Jacques Coeur]]. His French style, based partly on his [[Latin]] reading, has, together with its undeniable vigour and picturesqueness, the characteristic redundance and rhetorical quality of the Burgundian school. Chastellain was no mere annalist, but proposed to fuse and shape his vast material to his own conclusions, in accordance with his political experience. The most interesting feature of his work is the skill with which he pictures the leading figures of his time. His characters are the fruit of acute and experienced observation, and abound in satirical traits, although the 42nd chapter of his second book, devoted expressly to portraiture, is headed ''Comment Georges escrit et mentionne les louanges vertueuses des princes de son temps''.

The known extant fragments of Chastellain's ''Chroniques'' with his other works were edited by Kervyn de Lettenhove for the Brussels Academy (8 vols., Brussels, 1863–1866) as ''L'Oeuvre de Georges Chastellain''. This edition includes all that had been already published by [[Jean Alexandre Buchon|Buchon]] in his ''Collection de chroniques'' and'' Choix de chroniques'' (material subsequently incorporated in the ''Panthéon littéraire''), and portions printed by Renard in his ''Trésor national'', vol. i. and by [[Jules Etienne Joseph Quicherat|Quicherat]] in the ''Procès de la Pucelle'' vol. iv. Kervyn de Lettenhove's text includes the portions of the chronicle covering the periods September 1419 to October 1422, January 1430 to December 1431, 1451–1452, July 1454 to October 1458, July 1461 to July 1463, and, with omissions, June 1467 to September 1470; and three volumes of minor pieces of considerable interest, especially ''Le Temple de [[Boccaccio|Boccace]]'', dedicated to [[Margaret of Anjou]], and the ''Déprécation'' for Pierre de Brézé when imprisoned by Louis XI. In the case of these minor works the attribution to Chastellain is in some cases erroneous, notably in the case of the ''Livre des faits de [[Jacques de Lalaing]]'', which is the work of Lefebvre de Saint-Remi, Herald of the Golden Fleece. In the allegorical ''Oultr d'amour'' it has been thought a real romance between Pierre de Brézé and a lady of the royal house is concealed.

'''Gyula Juhász''' ([[Biatorbágy|Bia]], September 11, 1930 – [[Budapest]], April 13, 1993) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] historian, a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (1985). He was the brother of the Hungarian poet [[Ferenc Juhász (poet)|Ferenc Juhász]].&lt;ref name="bia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biatorbagy.hu/hiressegek/juhasz_gyula|title=Juhász Gyula|publisher=Biatorbágy Város Önkormányzatának hivatalos honlapja|language=Hungarian|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyula Juhász was born in a peasant family. He graduated from a military school, but in 1956 he left the army protesting against the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In 1958, he graduated from the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Budapest with a degree in history. For the following decades, up to 1985 he has been working for the Historical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. From 1985 up to his death in 1993 he was the director of [[National Széchényi Library]]. In 1985, he was elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="bia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-gyula-juhasz-2324938.html|title=Obituary: Professor Gyula Juhasz|last=Peter|first=Laszlo|date=May 24, 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His main research fields were the general history of the [[diplomacy]], and the Hungarian [[politics]] between the World Wars (1930s-1940s). As from 1963 until his death he was teaching history of diplomacy at [[Marx Károly University of Economics]]. He  served as editor of the ''[[Történelmi Szemle]]'' (Historical Review) between 1972–1985, and as member of the board of the [[World Association of the Hungarians]] after 1986.

Juhász is best known to the general audience by his two books: ''The Dominant Ideas in Hungary'' (1983) studied ideas popular with Hungarian intellectuals during [[World War II]], and ''The War and Hungary'' 1938-45 (1986) summarizes Hungarian politics during the war.&lt;ref name="peter"/&gt;

'''Henri de Boulainvilliers''' ({{IPA-fr|də bulɛ̃vilje|lang}}; 21 October 1658, [[Saint-Saire]], [[Normandy]] – 23 January 1722, [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] nobleman, writer and historian. He was educated at the [[college of Juilly]], he served in the army until 1697.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Primarily remembered as an early modern historian of the [[France|French State]], Boulainvilliers also published an early French translation of [[Spinoza|Spinoza's]] ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' and wrote on topics as diverse as astrology, physics, philosophy and theology.

The [[Count|Comte]] de Boulainvilliers traced his lineage to the [[House of Croÿ]], to Jean de Croÿ, sire de Clery et de Boulainviller, who died in the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)]].  At the time of his birth, however, the family's fortune had declined significantly.  Much of Boulainvilliers' historical work and political life centered on the decline of the [[nobility]].{{sfn|Doumic|1913}}

== Education ==

In 1669, Henri de Boulainvilliers went to study at the Collège de Juilly, one of the most famous schools of the [[Congregation of the Oratory]] of [[Philip Neri]]. [[Exact science]]s, [[history]] and [[geography]] were taught there. 
The philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] being one of the great educators at the Oratory, [[cartesianism]] was allowed reference in the classroom from 1662 till 1675 when it was banned by Royal arrest. 
In 1673, Henry studied rhetoric with his teacher [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], who was excluded from the Oratory (1678) because of his critical Bible studies.

The education at Juilly had great impact on Boulainvilliers: a special accent on critical history had been introduced into the Oratory by [[Caesar Baronius]] and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], and through the science classes he became familiar with the works of [[Jean Baptist van Helmont]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Edme Mariotte]].

Since he had also received private lessons in the German language, it is not inconceivable that he was able to read van Helmont in [[Middle Dutch]] that author used as a critical means to an accessible reading of [[medicine]] in the [[Low Countries]], and which so fluently worded his rich independence of mind.

== Physics ==

In 1683 Boulainvilliers wrote " ''l'Idée d'un Système Général de la Nature''" based on his reading of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] and [[Robert Boyle]], followed by "''Archidoxes de [[Paracelsus]], avec une préface sur les principes de l'art chimique''".

By 1715-1720, he wrote his "''Traité d'astronomie physique''" using the Cartesian method, commenting on the nature of gravity and the movement of planets and drawing on sources such as [[Jean-Baptiste du Hamel]] and [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]].

He described his method as experimental philosophy and closely preceded the Dutch experimentalists led by [[Anthony Leeuwenhoek]] (Nieuwentijt, [[Herman Boerhaave|Boerhave]], Volder)

He retained affection for [[astrology]], for which he was famous in Court gossip.

== Critical history ==

In a "''Lettre à Mlle Cousinot sur l'histoire de France et le choix des historiens''" he explained why the writing of history was to be more than the "amateur" collection of dates and anecdotes related to old coins ([[numismatics]]) and stones: The knowledge of history pertained to a distinct moral character of society. Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 [[Battle of Crécy]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], could be instructive on related measures in the present&amp;nbsp;— how to do things better or worse. Sometimes we want to know not only what a historical figure has done, but by what right he might have done so differently.

He stressed in his writings the corruption absolutism played in the fall of France when he contrasts the role English and French historians were able to investigate history. For instance, when stressing the importance of [[Primary source|sources]] in developing fact, he contrasted [[Thomas Rymer]]'s way of access to the London [[archive]]s to that of his own where he had to bribe the keepers of the French archives. For his neutral reasoning, his works were cited by subsequent writers whose works would prove influential in the development of Western political thought and historical research.

== Philosophy ==

Parallel to his historical studies ran an untiring interest in philosophy which he wrote down in ''Considérations abrégées des operations de l'entendement sur les idées'' on the model borrowed from the famous ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' by [[Antoine Arnauld]]: psychology of the mind, logic, and method; to which he added [[ontology]]. His influences, apart from the [[Scholastics|Schola]] of his early education, were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and Spinoza.

== Spinoza ==

Boulainvilliers's translation of Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was not published until 1907 by Colonna d'Istria from an unsigned manuscript at Lyon.

Boulainvilliers's study of Spinoza, as captured in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous way in which he let his opponent use his own voice.

In the ''Essay de Métaphysique dans les principes de B...de Sp...'' he translated Spinoza's "geometrical method" into an accessible French, closely following its original meaning without incisive criticism.

In the ''Exposition du système de Benoit Spinosa et sa defense contre les objections de M. Régis'' he voiced the defense of Spinoza against his cartesian critic [[Pierre-Sylvain Régis]]. The comte Boulainvilliers was no blind follower of Descartes; he knew how to make use of his method, but he could equally well criticise him on metaphysical points.

This unusual way of writing philosophy led to the gossip that he was a Spinozist and therefore an [[atheist]]. Yet in his persistent criticism of Spinoza's [[monism]] (through the concept of the "unity of substance"), in writings inaccessible to the multitude, his independent judgement remained unspoilt. After his death his name was frequently used to circulate anti-religious treatises, leading to still more confusion about his intellectual identity.

With [[Matthieu Marais]] he shared a friendship with another great student of Spinoza, [[Pierre Bayle]].

== Molinos ==

Less well known but as important in his time was the similar treatment he gave to the mysticism of [[Miguel de Molinos|Molinos]] in : ''Extrait du livre du ministre [[Pierre Jurieu]] touchant les dogmes des mystiques et particulièrement contre Messieurs de Cambray et de Méaux.'' By the time the reader finished his lecture he had a complete survey of the works of Molinos, thus recapitulating the famous disagreements over [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]].

Such are the traits that can make one regret the criticism&amp;nbsp;— amply justified in retrospect&amp;nbsp;— that Boulainvilliers, elsewhere, brought over himself by his brutal stance on [[feudalism]]; traits for which he equally deserves to be known to a larger circle of students.

== Bibliography ==
Boulainvilliers wrote a number of historical works (published after his death), of which the most important were the following:
* ''Histoire de l'ancien gouvernement de la France'' (La Haye, 1727)

'''Johan Huizinga''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈjoːɦɑn ˈɦœy̯zɪŋɣaː|lang}}; 7 December 1872 – 1 February 1945) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[historian]] and one of the founders of modern [[cultural history]].

==Life==

[[File:Leiden318.JPG|thumb|Huizinga plaque at [[Leiden University]] ]]

Born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] as the son of Dirk Huizinga, a professor of [[physiology]], and Jacoba Tonkens, who died two years after his birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/huizin.htm |title=Johan Huizinga |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/huizin.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he started out as a student of [[Indo-European languages]], earning his degree in 1895. He then studied [[comparative linguistics]], gaining a good command of [[Sanskrit]]. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the role of the [[jester]] in [[India]]n drama in 1897.

It was not until 1902 that his interest turned towards [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] history. He continued teaching as an Orientalist until he became a Professor of General and Dutch History at [[Groningen University]] in 1905. In 1915, he was made Professor of General History at [[Leiden University]], a post he held until 1942. In 1916 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001026 |title=J. Huizinga (1872 - 1945) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, he spoke critically of his country's German occupiers, comments that were consistent with his writings about [[Fascism]] in the 1930s. He was held in detention by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] between August and October 1942. Upon his release, he was banned from returning to Leiden. He subsequently lived at the house of his colleague [[Rudolph Cleveringa]] in [[De Steeg]] in [[Gelderland]], near [[Arnhem]], where he died just a few weeks before Nazi rule ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hugenholtz|first= F.W.N.|title=Huizinga, Johan (1872-1945)|work= Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/huizinga |date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lies buried in the graveyard of the Reformed Church at 6 Haarlemmerstraatweg in [[Oegstgeest]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Ditzhuijzen, Jeannette (September 9, 2005). ''Bijna vergeten waren ze, de rustplaatsen van roemruchte voorvaderen''. Trouw (Dutch newspaper), p. 9 of supplement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Huizinga had an aesthetic approach to history, where art and spectacle played an important part.  His most famous work is ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') (1919).

Worthy of mentioning are also ''[[Erasmus]]'' (1924) and ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' (1938). In the latter book he discussed the possibility that play is the primary formative element in human culture. Huizinga also published books on American history and Dutch history in the 17th century.

Alarmed by the rise of [[National Socialism]] in Germany, Huizinga wrote several works of cultural criticism. Many similarities can be noted between his analysis and that of contemporary critics such as [[Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Oswald Spengler]]. Huizinga argued that the spirit of technical and mechanical organisation had replaced spontaneous and organic order in cultural as well as political life.

The [[Huizinga Lecture]] (Dutch: ''Huizingalezing'') is a prestigious annual lecture in the Netherlands about a subject in the domains of cultural history or philosophy in honour of Johan Huizinga.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/huizinga-lezing/over-huizinga-lezing/over-1.html | publisher = Universiteit Leiden | title = Huizinga-lezing | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725204113/http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/huizinga-lezing/over-huizinga-lezing/over-1.html | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Huizinga's son Leonhard Huizinga became a well-known writer in the Netherlands, especially renowned for his series of tongue-in-cheek novels on the Dutch aristocratic twins {{il|Adrian and Oliver|nl|Adriaan en Olivier}} ("Adriaan en Olivier").

'''John William Earnshaw''' (1900–82) was a self-taught [[Australian]] [[engineer]], and [[inventor]]. He also conducted research into [[Australian history]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Eric (1983). The modest engineer. Biblionews, 8(1), p. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnshaw was born in [[Randwick, New South Wales]], the son of a noted [[Sydney]] [[horse trainer]] and [[Melbourne Cup]] winner. He served with the [[Royal Engineers]] in [[France]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, Earnshaw undertook many dangerous travels in [[Papua New Guinea]].

Earnshaw set up a business, Reilax Engineering, which specialised in [[production-line]] problems. The business prospered for over 30 years in [[North Sydney, New South Wales]], until he retired in 1969. He invented a number of machines for filling metal and glass containers for the food, [[cosmetics]], chemical and [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturing industries. For the Red Cross Blood Bank, Earnshaw devised an [[oscillator]] for separating [[Blood plasma|plasma]] from blood. He was a pioneer of industrial [[chromium plating]] in Sydney. His oil-free compressor was widely used on tractors, [[grader]]s, [[road roller]]s and similar [[earthmoving equipment]].

Earnshaw's spare time was filled with research into forgotten aspects of Australian history, uncovering new information about the [[Scottish Martyrs]],&lt;ref&gt;Earnshaw, John (1959).

He authored several biographies for the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

In 1944, Earnshaw was a co-founder of the [[Book Collectors Society of Australia]], and a lifelong supporter of the society. He was also very active in the [[Society of Australian Genealogists]].

'''John Glover Jackson''' (April 1, 1907 – October 13, 1993) was an American [[Pan-Africanist]] historian, lecturer, teacher and writer. He promoted ideas of [[Afrocentrism]], and [[Jesus Christ in comparative mythology]].

==Early life and education==
Jackson was born in [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]], South Carolina, on April 1, 1907, and raised [[Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Christianity Before Christ|page=xiii|last1=Jackson|first1=John G.|publisher=American Atheist Press|year=1985|ISBN=0-910309-20-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15 he moved to [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]], New York, where he enrolled in [[Stuyvesant High School]]. During this time, he became interested in African-American history and culture and began writing essays on the subject. They were so impressive that in 1925, while still a high school student, Jackson was invited to write for [[Marcus Garvey]]'s newspaper, ''[[Negro World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africawithin.com/jgjackson/jgjackson_bio1.htm AfricaWithin], short biography.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720114439/http://www.africawithin.com/jgjackson/jgjackson_bio1.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1930 onwards, Jackson became associated with a number of [[Pan-African]] historians, activists and writers, including [[Hubert Harrison]], [[Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Willis Nathaniel Huggins]] and [[Joel Augustus Rogers]]. He also authored a number of books on African history, promoting a Pan-African and [[Afrocentrist]] view, such as ''Man, God, and Civilization'' (1972) and ''Introduction to African Civilizations'' (1974). He also became interested in the idea of Christianity's origins in the Egyptian religion. A staunch [[atheist]], he authored a number of books on the idea, including ''The African Origin of Christianity'' (1981) and ''Christianity before Christ'' (1985), as well as writing the foreword to ''[[Gerald Massey]]'s Lectures'' (1974). He also wrote the controversial text, ''Was Jesus Christ a Negro?'' (1984), which argued that [[race of Jesus|Jesus may have been a black man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africawithin.com/jgjackson/jgjackson_biblio.htm Africa Within], bibliography.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418072309/http://www.africawithin.com/jgjackson/jgjackson_biblio.htm |date=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Jackson wrote a biographical article about Hubert Harrison for [[American Atheists]] entitled "Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates". In it, he praised not only Harrison's [[agnostic atheism]], but also his educational and civil rights achievements. It was later published as a seven-page pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John G.|first=Jackson|title=Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates|work=American Atheists|publisher=www.atheists.org|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates|publisher=www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life, Jackson also served as Associate Director of the [[Edward Wilmot Blyden|Blyden Society]] and lectured at many colleges and universities throughout the United States. He died on October 13, 1993.

'''Khirbet et-Tibbâneh''' (''Hurvat Tibneh'' / ''Kh. Tibna'')({{lang-ar|خربة التبانة}}),&lt;ref&gt;In the 1928–1947 Jaffa:Survey of Palestine map published by the [[National Library of Israel]], [http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nli/hebrew/digitallibrary/pages/viewer.aspx?presentorid=NLI_MAPS_JER&amp;DocID=NNL_MAPS_JER002367636#|FL21693604 See Map], Map no. 15-12 (at Grid number 154/122) is called ''Kh. et Tabbâna'', but in the [[Survey of Western Palestine|SWP]] Map number 17 published by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], the same site is called ''Tibna''.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to by [[historical geographers]] as the '''''Timnah of Judah''''' ({{Lang-he-n|'''תמנה'''}}), is a small ruin situated on a high ridge in the [[Judaean Mountains|Judaean mountains]], in the ''Sansan Nature Reserve'', {{convert|622|m|ft|}} above sea level, about 3 kilometers east of [[Aviezer]] and ca. 7 kilometers southeast of [[Bayt Nattif]]. The site is thought to have formerly borne the name Timnath, distinct from the [[Timnah|Tel Batash-Timnah]] site associated with the biblical story of [[Samson]] in the lower foothills of Judea along the [[Nahal Sorek|Sorek valley]]. ''Kh. et-Tibbaneh'' (Timnah) is perched upon a high mountain ridge rising up from the [[Elah valley]] and is where the episode of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] is thought to have taken place.

==Etymology==
Orientalists, [[Clermont-Ganneau]] and [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]], have made a point in showing the etymological Hebrew origins of certain Arabic place-names, saying that the Hebrew place-name Timnah was to be recognised in the Arabic corruption, ''Tibneh'' or ''Tibna''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine During the Years 1873–1874'' (vol. II), [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]: London 1896, pp. 67–68, 214, where he wrote: (p. 214) "''Tibneh'', 'chopped straw', one would swear was Arabic, but it is beyond a doubt that it is the name of the town ''Timnah'', brought into that shape by one of those popular etymologies which are as dear to the peasantry of Palestine as to those of our European countries." On pp. 67–68 he wrote: "One has to beware, however, of these appellations that appear to be of purely Arabic origin, they are often ancient Hebrew names converted by a process of popular etymology into words familiar to the Arabs. In many cases slight phonetic changes assist the process. These , by the bye, are not arbitrary, but are subject to real laws. Thus, for instance, the name of the Bible town of Thimnah has become in [[Peasant|fellâh]] speech ''Tibneh'', 'chopped straw'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Robinson, ''Biblical Researches in Palestine and in the Adjacent Regions'', II, Boston 1860, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[John William McGarvey]] (1881) who quotes [[C. R. Conder|Conder]] on the linguistic evidence of the name says that, in Arabic, "the substitution of B for M is so common (as in Tibneh for [[Timnah]])..."&lt;ref&gt;McGarvey, 2002, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UxlR49W76CgC&amp;pg=PA246 246-247]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[E. H. Palmer]], ''The Survey of Western Palestine: Arabic and English Name Lists Collected During the Survey'', London 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/330 330], s.v. ''Tibna''&lt;/ref&gt; Both names have been preserved in the respective sites.

==Site and identification==
In ancient Jewish classical literature, two distinct sites in the land of Judah bore the name Timnath (Timnah).&lt;ref&gt;A. Neubauer, ''Géographie du Talmud'', Paris 1868, pp. 102–103; Isaiah Press (ed.), ''A Topographical - Historical Encyclopedia of Palestine'' (vol. 4), Rubin Mass: Jerusalem 1955, p. 974 (s.v. '''תמנה א''')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaJudaica1971&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (vol. 15), Jerusalem 1971, p. 1147 (s.v. Timnah)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Joshua]] records the names of two towns, both in the tribal inheritance of Judah and having the identical name of Timnath; the one Timnath &lt;small&gt;(Josh. 15:10)&lt;/small&gt; being transcribed alongside the name of [[Beit Shemesh]], while the other Timnath &lt;small&gt;(Josh. 15:57)&lt;/small&gt; being transcribed alongside the name of Gibeah (of Judah), a town said to be [[Jab'a]].&lt;ref&gt;An opinion expressed by [[Historical geography|historical geographer]] [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]], ''Eretz Yehudah'' (the Land of Judah), Tel-Aviv 1939, p. 198, and by [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]] explorers Conder and Kitchener (SWP, III, 53). Jab'a, southeast of [[Bayt Nattif]], is not far situated from ''Khirbet et-Tibbaneh''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Sotah'' 1:8) relates the following tradition: "[[Abba Arika|Rav]] has said: There were two Timnaths; one mentioned in connection with [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]], and the other mentioned in connection with [[Samson]]."&lt;ref&gt;Same quote cited in [[Midrash Rabba]] (Genesis Rabba § 85 and Numbers Rabba 9:24) and in the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 10a). The 14th-century [[Midrash Hagadol]] brings down this tradition under a variant name: "[[Judah ha-Nasi|Rebbe]] has said," etc., instead of "Rav has said."&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmudic exegetes have explained that Samson, who lived in the hilltop town of [[Zorah]] near Beit Shemesh, is said to have 'gone down' to Timnath,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0714.htm Judges 14:1]&lt;/ref&gt; but Judah is said to have 'gone up' to Timnath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0138.htm#13 Genesis 38:13]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kh. et-Tibbâneh'' is thought to be the Timnath (Timnah) mentioned in connection with Judah and Tamar &lt;small&gt;(Genesis 38: 13, 14)&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George L. Kelm]] &amp; [[Amihai Mazar]], p. 58 in: {{cite journal |last=Kelm |first=George |title=Timnah: A Biblical City in the Sorek Valley |journal=Archaeology |accessdate=20 August 2018 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=58-59, 78-79|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41729127 |date=1984|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F.M Abel|F.M. Abel]], ''Géographie de la Palestine'' (vol. II), Paris 1938, p. 481, s.v. Thimna (1), citing Conder &amp; Kitchener's SWP, III, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]], ''Eretz Yisrael: Geography of Israel for High Schools and for the People'' (Heb. ארץ ישראל -- גיאוגרפיה של ארץ ישראל לבתי ספר תיכוניים ולעם), Vienna 1922, p. 42 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; although this view remains inconclusive.&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaJudaica1971 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[H.B. Tristram]], ''Bible Places: or, The Topography of the Holy Land: a Succinct Account of All the Places, Rivers, and Mountains of the Land of Israel'', London 1897, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bibleplacesortop00tris#page/66/mode/2up 66]. who thought that it was one and the same place, where Samson had gone to take his wife, near the Sorek Valley.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khirbet et Tibbaneh'' (''Tibna'') was visited by [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] explorers, [[C. R. Conder|Conder]] and [[HH Kitchener|Kitchener]], in the late 19th-century, where they described the ruin as follows: "Timnah - A town of Judah &lt;small&gt;(Josh.  XV. 57)&lt;/small&gt;, mentioned with Gibeah. There is a ruin called ''Tibna'' near [[Jab'a|Jeb'a]], in the higher hills of ʾArkûb, distinct from Tibneh &lt;small&gt;(Sheet XVI)&lt;/small&gt;, which represents the Timnah of Joshua XV.10."&lt;ref&gt;Conder &amp; Kitchener, ''Survey of Western Palestine - Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology'' (vol. III), London 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/52 53]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are unsure of its identification, since the site has yet to be fully excavated.&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land'' (ed. A. Negev &amp; S. Gibson), New York / London 2001, p. 509 [s.v. ''Timnah (c)''] {{ISBN|0-8264-1316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site's description===
The ancient ruin sits on a high mountain ridge about 2 kilometers west of ''Khirbet Sanasin''. On its site is found the remnant of a square Iron Age fortress which apparently offered security along the route from the [[valley of Elah]] to [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]] and to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaMapa2000&gt;''Encyclopaedia Mapa - A Comprehensive Gazetteer of Israel Today'' (vol. 7), Tel-Aviv 2000, p. 213 {{ISBN|965-7009-92-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the fortress is 30 x 30 meters (98 x 98 feet), where two walls made of [[fieldstone|fieldstones]] and ashlar masonry still remain, whose hollowed spaces were filled-in with smaller stones.&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaMapa2000 /&gt; [[Amihai Mazar]] suggests that the structure served as either a fortress or an administrative center, and most likely manned by a garrison to secure the roads between the major towns of the [[Shephelah]] and the string of settlements along the edge of the hill region.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amihai Mazar|A. Mazar]], "Abu Tuwein, Khirbet", pub. in: ''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'', ed. E. Stern (vol. 1), [[Israel Exploration Society]]: Jerusalem 1993, p. 16 {{ISBN|965-220-209-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mound is almost entirely strewn with razed boulders, and ancillary walls, partially standing, are to be seen on the ruin.  On its eastern side is a steep declivity, descending down into the valley below, ''Wadi Tibbaneh'' (''Wadi Tibna''), where it joins Etzion Valley (''Wady el Jindy'') to its south at a drop of about {{convert|200|m|ft|}}. The valley seemed to have been used for horticulture in ages past. Sherds dot the landscape, with occasional [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]] trees, [[Quercus palaestina|oaks]] and [[Rhamnus lycioides|buckthorns]]. Near the site is a modern-day quarry and two ancient cisterns.&lt;ref name=EncyclopaediaMapa2000 /&gt; In close proximity to ''Khirbet et-Tibbaneh'' is the old military patrol road, leading from [[Tzur Hadassah]] to [[Aviezer]].

==History==
''Khirbet et-Tibbaneh'' (''Tibna'') is thought to be the "Tapuna" mentioned in the list of [[Thothmes III]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H.B. Tristram]], ''Bible Places: or, The Topography of the Holy Land: a Succinct Account of All the Places, Rivers, and Mountains of the Land of Israel'', London 1897, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bibleplacesortop00tris#page/82/mode/2up 83]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Israeli archaeologist [[Michael Avi-Yonah|Avi-Yonah]] also thinks the site to have been the ''Timnah'' (Thamnatha) mentioned in the ''[[First Book of Maccabees]]''&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. 9, 50–52&lt;/ref&gt; (and later mentioned by [[Josephus]]),&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (13.1.3)&lt;/ref&gt; one of several places fortified by [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] in ca. 160 BCE after the death of [[Judas Maccabeus]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Avi-Yonah, ''Historical Geography of Palestine'', Jerusalem 1963, p. 37 (note 7); M. Avi-Yonah, ''The Holy Land from the Persian to the Arab Conquests (536 B.C. to A.D. 640) – A Historical Geography'', Grand Rapids 1977, p. 53 {{ISBN|0-8010-0010-6}}. (I. Roll agrees to this view. See: I Roll, "Bacchides' Fortifications and the Arteries of Traffic to Jerusalem in the Hellenistic Period", ''Eretz-Israel'' 25 (1996, pp. 509–514 [Hebrew]); M. Avi-Yonah, ''Gazetteer of Roman Palestine'', Jerusalem 1976, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that the account in ''Maccabees'' may refer to another Timna (Thamnatha), that called ''[[Khirbet Tibnah|Kh. Tibne]]'' in south-western Samaria, in Mount Ephraim, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) northwest of [[Bethel]].&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Kallai, ''Northern Boundaries of Judah, from the Settlement of the Tribes Until the Beginning of the Hasmonaean Period'', Jerusalem 1960, p. 96 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' (ed. David Noel Freedman &amp; Allen C. Meyers), p. 1312&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally accepted that the Mishnaic scholar, [[Simeon of Timnah]], was born and raised in one of the two Timnahs during the waning years of the Second Temple period, based on the vowels assigned to his name, ({{lang-he|שמעון התִּימְנִי|translit=Shimon HaTimni}}). He is noted for saying: "A [[Mamzer|bastard]] is anyone who is born from an [illegal] union for which his progenitors are liable to extirpation at the hands of heaven" &lt;small&gt;([[Mishnah]] ''Yebamot'' 4:13; Babylonian Talmud, ''Yebamot'' 49a)&lt;/small&gt;, and which teaching comes to exclude a single parent who gave birth to a child outside of wedlock, and whose child is often wrongly called "[[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]]" under common law.

==Archaeological finds==
As of 2018, the site at ''Kh. Tibbaneh'' has yet to be excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli archaeologist, [[Ze'ev Safrai]], ''Correspondence''&lt;/ref&gt; A cursory review of the site has revealed late Iron II sherds.&lt;ref&gt;Amihai Mazar, "The Excavations of Khirbet Abu et-Twain and the System of Iron Age Fortresses in Judah", ''Eretz-Israel'' 15 (1981), p. 246 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tone|date=March 2016}}
The title '''King of the Gypsies''' has been claimed or given over the centuries to many different people. It is both culturally and geographically specific. It may be inherited, acquired by acclamation or action, or simply claimed. The extent of the power associated with the title varied; it might be limited to a small group in a specific place, or many people over large areas. In some cases the claim was clearly a public relations exercise. As the term [[wikt:gypsy|Gypsy]] is also used in many different ways the ''King of the Gypsies'' may be someone with no connection with the [[Romani people]]. In the early 1970s, it was decided, at the First Annual Romani Meeting that the term Gypsy would no-longer be used to describe themselves. They voted for the term Roma to be used.

It has also been suggested that in places where they were persecuted by local authorities the "King of the Gypsies" is an individual, usually of low standing, who places himself in the risky position of an ad hoc liaison between the Romani and the gadje (non-Romani). The arrest of such a "King" limited the harm to the Romani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/09/3roma.cfm |title=Human Rights Brief Human Rights Brief |website=Wcl.american.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John (Johnnie) Faa===
{{main|John Faa}}
Johnnie Faa of Dunbar was leader of the 'Egyptians', or Gypsies, in Scotland. Faa was granted a letter under the [[Privy Seal]] from [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] in February 1540, which was renewed in 1553. It was addressed to "oure louit Johnne Faw, lord and erle of Litill Egipt" establishing his authority over all Gypsies in Scotland and calling on all [[sheriffs]] in the country to assist him "in executione of justice upoun his company and folkis", who were to "conforme to the lawis of Egipt".

He is resurrected in fiction in S. R. Crockett's ''The Raiders'' and in Philip Pullman's trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]''.

===Johnne Wanne===
Son and successor of Johnnie Faa, Johnne Wanne was granted Royal authority over all "Egyptians" in Scotland in May 1540. Records showed that by 1612 the Faa family had extended as far as [[Shetland]]. However, the initial tolerance of Gypsies did not last. In 1623 eight leaders of the Gypsies were hanged on the Burgh Muir, six of whom were of the Faa line. In the 1650s they were amongst those [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/roma/gft/index.htm |title=Gypsy Folk Tales Index |website=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patrick Faa ===
Patrick was the first recorded Gypsy King at [[Kirk Yetholm]].

King William I, known as 'Gleed Nickit Wull' because of a twist in the shape of his throat, was born about 1700, and died at Coldingham in 1784, aged around 84. He fathered 24 children by three wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/will.html|title=Will Faa, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His death at Colingham is recounted by William Smith, the Baillie at Kelso, who states that "When old Will Faa was upwards of eighty years of age, he called on me in Kelso, in his way to Edinburgh, telling me that he was going to Edinburgh to see the laird... before he died,"  and also that after successfully completing this visit "he only got the length of Colingham, when he was taken ill and died."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Waverley Anecdotes: Illustrative of the Incidents, Characters, and Scenery, Described in the Novels and Romances, of Sir Walter Scott|last=Scott|first=Walter|publisher=J.

===William Faa II===
Will Faa, "King of the Gypsies", died in [[Kirk Yetholm]] on 9 October 1847, aged 96. He was the son of William Faa I. William Faa was an innkeeper (owned "The Queen") and footballer who lived at "The Gypsy Palace" off the Green, and entertained visitors there. The ''Kelso Mail'' carried his obituary entitled "Death of a Gypsy King", which said he was "always accounted a more respectable character than any of his tribe, and could boast of never having been in gaol during his life." His house continued to be a tourist attraction, and there was reportedly an "Old Palace" on the other side of Kirk Yetholm Green. William died without issue in 1847 when the 'Crown' passed to his sister Esther's husband Charles Blythe (1775-1861). Charles was an educated man who did much to live up to his role. On his death in 1861 there was a tussle between his many children for the right to be monarch.  The role went to his daughter Esther Faa Blythe who reigned until 1883 when the gypsy culture was in serious decline. Following a gap of several years in 1898 one of her sons Charles Rutherford was persuaded to accept the office and a ceremonial Gypsy Coronation was held in 1898.  By this stage the role was largely an attempt to boost tourism.
Charles died in 1902 and the title has not been re-established. An Edinburgh housewife is now thought to be the present 'Queen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovertheborders.co.uk/places/212.html |title=The Gypsy Palace, Kirk Yetholm, Scotland |website=Discovertheborders.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/ |title=The Scottish Gypsies of Scotland |website=Scottishgypsies.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘’Journal Gypsy Lore Soc.’’ 3rd ser.ii 370-1 quoted in ‘’English Genealogy’’ A.

=== Charles Faa Blythe I ===
Charles Faa Blythe was a brother-in-law to William Faa II, and when he died without issue the title of King of the Gypsies was passed to Charles, husband of his sister, Esther.  Charles was born in 1775 and died in 1861.  He was crowned King, by the local blacksmith, George Gladstone, on 25 October 1847, aged at least 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/charles.html|title=Charles Blyth I, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was succeeded by his daughter, Esther Faa Blythe, who was born in the early years of the 1800s and died on 12 July 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/esther3.html|title=Esther Faa Blythe, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Faa Blyth II ===
Born around 1825, Charles Rutherford (known as Charles Faa Blythe II), was a son to Esther Faa Bythe, the Gypsy Queen.  Between the death of Esther Faa Blyth in 1883 and the accession of Charles II in 1898, there was no Gypsy royalty crowned at Kirk Yetholm.  His coronation ceremony was really a pageant, with all the locals dressing up for the benefit of the photographers. Many photographs of the occasion still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/charles22.html|title=Charles Faa Blyth II, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===William (Billy) Marshall===
William (Billy) Marshall (1672-1792) died aged 120, lived in Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, South West Scotland. Caird of Barullion, King of the Gypsies of the Western Lowlands for 89 years. Served as a soldier at the Battle of the Boyne for William of Orange, Battle of Blenheim. Returned to Scotland where he had an army of 200 followers who ruled the land between Ayr and Dumfries and fought battles at Newton of Ayr, Brig O Doon and Alloway. He was a Protestant, Covenanter, and Leveller. He and his army would champion, the poor, the dispossessed, and steal, disrupt, and organize smuggling activities in cattle, sheep, horses, brandy, whisky, tea, against Jacobites, Landlords, and those that were not locals who were known to him. He was an accomplished craftsman of horn spoons, cups, pots. He is buried in the graveyard at St Cuthbert's Church in [[Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Marshall - the Scottish King of the Gypsies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/education/beyond/factsheets/makhist/makhist10_prog7c.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214200506/http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/beyond/factsheets/makhist/makhist10_prog7c.shtml|archivedate=14 December 2004|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florent Léglise===
Often referred as the Ecclesiast, his origins remain unknown but research indicates that he lived around the french territories of the South Gironde. Admired for his famous mystical beard, he became one of the central symbolic representations of authority for french gypsies, as many tales and legends were created and put together from diverse episodes taken from his life (e.g. Catherine's street hidden Church, the Ecclesiast and the last Gitardise, The drummer and the prince, the good, the bad and the Church, etc.). He was nominated by his predecessor, Joni Ali, in 1993 after the battle of the Golden Veal of Bazas, and was crowned after the death of its mentor on the 5th of may of the following year (Joni Ali's Day).

===Leaders identified in Martin Markall===
The short book ''Martin Markall, [[Beadle]] of the [[Bridewell]]'' was published in London in 1610. The author is given as "S.R.", who is usually identified as [[Samuel Rid]] the author of ''The Art of Jugling or Legerdemaine'', a later book of rogue literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It will be seen that in reality few had anything to do with Gypsies, but they are indicative of the context in which some of the Kings of the Gypsies were identified.

====John Mendall====
aka [[Jack Cade]], aka John Mortimer, who led a rebellion of men from Kent who camped at Blackheath outside London in 1450. After his rebellion a reward was offered for him, and he was captured and killed in Kent.

====Bluebeard and Hugh Roberts====
Both soldiers who had served in France. Bluebeard was captured and executed shortly after being made "their captain".  Roberts then gathered about 100 "rakehells and vagabonds" in Kent who were joined by 400 "masterless men". Together they joined Jack Cade and entered [[Southwark]]. After the end of Cade's rebellion Roberts took to the woods with a small group living by theft, according to set rules of their own.  After a year living like this these "Roberdsmen" dispersed throughout England, vowing to meet every three years, and joining other "commotions and rebellions". Roberts also went "roving" and "kept his court" until he was killed in 1461.

====Jenkin Cowdiddle====
Was chosen by the remaining "Roberdsmen" at "their wonted place of meeting" "by general assent". He was "a wandering rogue", "much given to swearing, drunkenness and lechery . . . stout of stomach, audacious and fierce". He claimed ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', and ordained that all beggars spent their weekly earnings in full every Saturday night. Rid says that he fought with "300 tattered knaves" in the rebellion in the South West of England against [[Edward IV]] and was killed at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] (1471). Unlike Roberts, who may have been a real character, this Cowdiddle seems to have been a complete fiction.

====Spising====
Not deterred, the remaining "Roberdsmen" "hie them to their rendezvous . . . and there, with the full consent of the whole company, they chose one Spising to be his successor". Spising is given no first name. He is credited with ordering that all begging wanderers be "stalled as a rogue" by "the Chief Commander then being", paying a fee in beer, though this was excused if his father and grandfather had been rogues. Spising joined the larger rebellion by Thomas Neville, the [[Bastard of Fauconberg]]. He led a band attacking [[Aldgate]], and was nearly successful, until parts of his group were trapped by the fall of the [[portcullis]].  Spising is reputed to have ruled 11 years before being hanged for a murder in [[Wombourn]], [[Staffordshire]], having escaped the same fate earlier by seeking [[sanctuary]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. There is a historical record of a Spising as leader of an [[Essex]] contingent of Neville's uprising, but he was executed after it, and his head exhibited on Aldgate.

====Puff Dick====
Was the next elected, an expert at cheating with [[loaded dice]], and excelled in "all manner of vice". He repeated Cowdiddle's requirement for thieves and beggars to spend their ill-gotten gains and not save them. Rid says he ruled for 8 years before dying of "the [[French pox|[French] pox]] and Neapolitan scurf". Like Cowdiddle, Dick seems to have been wholly fictional.

====Laurence Crossbiter (aka Long Laurence)====
Laurence Crossbiter was the next elected leader, a serving man aged 50–60. His art was "crossbiting"; theft from the customers of whores. He is also reported to have died "his bowels . . . eaten out with the pox while he was yet alive". Rid described him as cowardly and slavish for failing to come to the aid of the rebel [[Perkin Warbeck]].

====Richard Skelton====
Was one of Warbeck's counsellors, "a noted knave". He was next "led to the wonted place of meeting, and there solemnly stalled a rogue and made their general". He is described as formerly having been a [[tailor]] in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]] "of proud and haughty disposition", and have "lived in this new government" until 1501. A Skelton was recorded by [[Sir Francis Bacon]] as a counsellor to Warbeck, but he says nothing of his activities after the rebellion.

====Cock Lorel====
Was elected his successor "by the General Council". Cock Lorel was "the most notorious knave that ever lived" who ruled until 1533. He professed the trade of a tinker to cover his thefts. Rid says that his knaveries are recorded in an old manuscript kept as "Maunders’ Hall", giving the rogue community a similar structure of that of the trade [[guilds]].
Cock Lorel was the great mythical leader of Tudor rogues. His name means just that, "cock" being leader, and "lorel" or losel" meaning rascal. He first appears about 1500 in "Cock Lorel's Boat", and is mentioned in [[Robert Copland]]'s ''The Highway to the Spitalhouse'' (1535). He is credited with approving John Awdesley's ''The Fraternity of Vagabonds'', (1561), in which he is given as the creator of the Twenty Five Orders of Knaves, reproduced in [[Thomas Harman]]'s ''Warning for Common Cursitors'' and many other works of rogue literature. There is no record of any real individual on whom he was based.
Cock Lorel is credited with having held a meeting with the leader of the Egyptians, Giles Hather, at their base at [[Peak Cavern|The Devils Arse Apeak]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Rid claims that at this meeting they devised a new and secret language [[Thieves' Cant]], "to the end that their cozenings, knaveries, and villainies might not so easily be perceived and known".&lt;ref&gt;Rid, Samuel (1610). ''Martin Markall, the Beadle of Bridewell''. as quoted in {{cite book

|date=Apr 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giles Hather====
Became head of the regiment or fellowship of Egyptians in the north about 1528. These, Rid says, travelled in groups of more than a hundred men and women, with horses, their faces blacked, and practised [[legerdemain]] and [[fortune telling]] by [[palmistry]], delighting the common people with their clothes.

====Kit Callot====
"the Queen of the Egypties" accompanied Giles Hather, according to Rid. These names were traditional; Hather is mentioned by Thomas Awdesley (1561). "Kit" and "Callot" as names can be traced back to [[Piers Plowman]]. Although Tudor government, both local and national, took a close interest in the Egyptians there is no record of the names in their records.

===Other leaders===
====Boswells====
The Boswells were for centuries one of England's largest and most important Gypsy families. The Boswell clan were a large extended family of [[Romani people|Travellers]], and in old [[Nottinghamshire dialect]] the word ''bos'll'' was used as a term for Travellers and Romani in general.

=====Haniel Boswell=====
Was the son of Francis Boswell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/family/hodgkins.html |title=The Romani Line - Boswell, Sherriff &amp; Hodgkins or Hodgkinson |website=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jacob Rewbrey=====
"Alias king of the Gypsies", from the St Margaret's [[Westminster]], was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] on 28 August 1700 for theft with violence and highway robbery. It was alleged he had robbed "one Rebecca Sellers, near the High way, . . . taking from her 3 Gold-rings, and 9 s. in Money" in January of that year. The Jury found him Guilty of theft, but not Robbery, as "It appeared that he juggled [tricked] her out of it." He was sentenced to [[Penal transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Old Bailey|defendant=Jacob Rewbrey|trialdate=28 August 1700|id=t17000828-63|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====James Boswell=====
Is buried in [[Rossington]], near [[Doncaster]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Langdale's "Topographical Dictionary of Yorkshire" (1822), says:
"In the church yard, was a stone, the two ends of which are now remaining, where was interred the body of James Bosvill the King of the Gypsies, who died January 30, 1708. For a number of years, it was a custom of Gypsies from the south, to visit his tomb annually, and there perform some of their accustomed rites; one of which was to pour a flagon of ale upon the grave."
This is similar to the ritual of "stalling the rogue" mentioned by [[Thomas Harman]] and in ''The Beggars Bush'' and by [[Bampfylde Moore Carew]].

A tradition was reported of annual visits to the grave of Charles Boswell near Doncaster for more than 100 years into the 1820s, including a rite of pouring a flagon of hot ale into the tomb. This may be same person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donny.co.uk/Doncaster/news/index.php3?ID=376 |title=Doncaster News and Features: Bizarre Doncaster: Ghosts and Hauntings, on Donny Online |website=Donny.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald]] Gypsies of Britain, The Country Book Club, 1951, quoting Edward Miller History and Antiquities of Doncaster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wainwright, History and Antiquities of Doncaster and Consborough, Sheffield, Basil Blackwell., 1829&lt;/ref&gt; the grave is situated by the main door leading to the church, shaded by a dark oak tree. It is now covered in moss, but is still readable. The words "King Of The Gypsies" will lie there for ever more, whereas the mystery of the black cat is still unsolved. – information on the grave by A. Needham&amp;nbsp;– P. Needham, of St. Michaels church.''

=====Henry Boswell=====
"King of the Gypsies" died in 1760 at the age of 90 and was buried at [[Ickleford]] near [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]] at the church of St. Catherine, as were his wife and granddaughter.

=====Edmund Mashiter=====
aka "Old Honey", died in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]] in 1811 aged 90. He was reported to have been "justly entitled the King of Beggars", having been on the road for 70 years. He was reported to have been the son of a schoolmaster, and well educated, but to have taken to the road by choice, and maintained a wandering life until he became bedridden.

=====Louis Boswell=====
Louis Boswell was buried at [[St. Laurence and All Saints Church, Eastwood|Eastwood church]], [[Southend-on-Sea]] in 1835.

=====Xavier Petulengro/ Smith =====
Was described as the King of the Gypsies, in an account of a Romani wedding at [[Baildon]] in [[Yorkshire]] in 1937 between his son Leon Petulengro/ Smith and Illeana Smith both of Colchester Essex. According to the caption of a photograph [[Xavier Petulengro]] cut the hands of the couple to mingle their blood during the ceremony. After their wedding the couple went north to Blackpool.

The [[UN]] Economic and Social Council visited him in 1999 when preparing a report on Racism and Intolerance and described him as devoting himself to economic activity to support community projects, and exerting "[[moral authority]]" and having "some influence" as a councillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=36003|title=MAR - Data - Chronology for Roma in Romania|date=28 August 2004|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=8 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040828191802/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=36003|archivedate=28 August 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentinaction.org/newspages/index/64.php|title=Development in Action - The thorny issues surrounding the practice of child marriage – cultural tradition or economic necessity?|date=26 December 2004|website=Developmentinaction.org|accessdate=8 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226114518/http://www.developmentinaction.org/newspages/index/64.php|archivedate=26 December 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/health/focus/roma/articles_publications/articles/underground_20060727/sibiu_20060711.pdf |title=Open Society Foundations |publisher=Soros.org |date=2016-11-22 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurence Gardner''' (17 May 1943 – 12 August 2010) was a British author and lecturer. He wrote on subjects such as the [[Jesus bloodline]], anti-gravity and the cloning of Adam and Eve.

''Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark: Amazing Revelations of the Incredible Power of Gold''. {{ISBN|0-00-714295-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His books also included theories about [[Freemasons|Freemasonry]], the [[Knights Templar]], [[The Holy Grail]] and proposed connections between [[Atenism]] and [[Judaism]].

Gardner [[False titles of nobility|referred to himself]] as "Chevalier Labhran de Saint Germain", and "Presidential Attache to the European Council of Princes" (the existence of which cannot be verified&lt;ref name=Picknett&gt;{{cite book|last=Picknett|first=Lynn|title=The Sion Revelation : The Truth about the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline.|year=2006|publisher=Touchstone books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=9780743263030|pages=281–84|author2=Prince, Clive }}&lt;/ref&gt;) also "Prior of the Celtic Churches Sacred Kindred of Saint Columbia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entropic-art.com/book.html Entropic Fine Art Inc – Book&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505103651/http://www.entropic-art.com/book.html |date=5 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to be [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Historiographer Royal of the [[House of Stuart|Royal House of Stewart]]. He was an endorser of [[Michael Lafosse]], in particular his claims to be descended from the [[House of Stuart]], which Gardner claimed was descended from [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name="king"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,308415,00.html The man who would be king]—from The Guardian, 24 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpheus.org/html/reviews/esoteric_history/rev_gardner.htm Two reviews] of Gardner's book ''Bloodline of the Holy Grail''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and scholars regard him as a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]],&lt;ref&gt;Damian Thompson, ''[[Counterknowledge]]'' (2008), Clive Cheeseman, Jonathan Williams, ''Rebels, Pretenders &amp; Impostors'' (2000), Kevin McClure, ''Gullible's Travels'', reviewing Gardner's book ''The Shadow of Solomon'' for ''[[Fortean Times]]'' No 203 (November 2005); and ''Time for Suspension of Belief'', reviewing Gardner's book ''The Magdalene Legacy'' for ''Fortean Times'' No 198 (July 2005), stating that Gardner doesn't respond to inquiries relating to the contents of his books.&lt;/ref&gt; and treat his work as [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; Michel Lafosse's claims have been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/lafosse.htm, Report on the Pedigree of Michel Lafosse, Styled Prince Michael of Albany&lt;/ref&gt;

It is described as "a biographical exploration of the deiform character variously known as Yahweh, Allah, or simply The Lord.

==Outlawing of communist monuments==
{{main|Fall of the monument to Lenin in Kiev|Decommunization in Ukraine}}

===Early attempts===
On 6 October 2009, addressing participants of the Second Ecumenical Week held in [[Ukrainian Catholic University]], (then) [[First Lady of Ukraine|First Lady]] [[Kateryna Yushchenko]] called on all [[Ukrainians]] to pull down monuments to the Communist past. According to her, the [[Ukrainian SSR|Communist regime]] had been consistently active in destroying the [[Ukrainian church]]. "Having destroyed age-long belief in Christ, the Communists proposed their own idols instead; the culture and [[Religion in Ukraine|faith of Ukrainians]] was deformed and are in need of renovation", according to Kateryna Yushchenko.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/western-information-agency-first-lady-calls-to-pul-50208.html], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pulling down of monuments===
The removal or destruction of Lenin monuments and statues gained particular momentum during the [[EuroMaidan]] movement in the beginning of 2014. Under the motto "Ленінопад" (Leninopad, translated into English as "Leninfall"), activists pulled down a dozen monuments in the Kiev region, Zhytomyr, Khmelnitsky, and elsewhere, or damaged them.&lt;ref&gt;http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/leninopad-trivaye-vozhdya-skinuli-v-kanevi-mikolayevi-hersoni-336067.html&lt;/ref&gt; In other cities and towns, monuments were removed by organised heavy equipment and transported to scrapyards or dumps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25225395.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 25, 2014 an estimate ran of over 90 statues and monuments being pulled down, removed or relocated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/leninopad-falling-lenins-statues-ukraine_n_4847364.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://expres.ua/digest/2014/02/24/102431-leninopad-komunistychnogo-vozhdya-zvilneno-vzhe-90-mist-ukrayiny&lt;/ref&gt; Since February 2014 and mid-April 2015, more than 500 statues of Lenin were dismantled in Ukraine, and nearly 1,700 were still standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150411/1020751334.html#ixzz3e08kD1yp rasing Own History: Soviet-Era Monuments Torn Down in Ukraine (VIDEO)], [[Sputnik News]] (11 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maungapohatu''' is a settlement in the [[Bay of Plenty Region]] of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. Located in a remote area of the [[Te Urewera|Urewera]] bush country about {{convert|20|km}} north of [[Lake Waikaremoana]], it was founded by [[Rua Tapunui Kenana]] in 1907 and was substantially rebuilt twice during the next two decades. At its peak more than 500 people lived there but today it is once more a very sparsely populated place.

It lies at the foot of the 1366 metre mountain of the same name, which is sacred to the [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe]] ''[[iwi]]''.&lt;ref name=Binney353/&gt;

[[Te Urewera]] is a thickly forested hill country to the northeast of [[Lake Taupo]]. It is the historical home of the [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe]], an ''[[iwi]]'' known for their stance on [[Māori sovereignty]]. Today, much of the land is contained within [[Te Urewera National Park]], which has an area of {{convert|2,126|km2|sqmi}} and which in 2013 had a population of only 2,133.&lt;ref&gt;[https://teara.govt.nz/en/bay-of-plenty-places/page-13 "Bay of Plenty places: Page 13 Inland Urewera"]. ''Te Ara''. Retrieved 5.01.2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand State Highway 38|State Highway 38]] is the only major arterial road that crosses it, running from [[Waiotapu]] near [[Rotorua]] via [[Murupara]] to [[Wairoa]].

Because of its isolation and dense forest, Te Urewera remained largely untouched by British colonists until the early 20th century; in the 1880s it was still in effect under Māori control and few [[Pākehā]] were prepared to risk entering the area.&lt;ref name=MKing&gt;King (2003) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Premier [[Richard Seddon]]’s visit to Te Urewera in 1894 the Tūhoe chief Tutakangahau requested  a [[Union Flag]] from the government. This flew at the Maungapohatu marae from at least 1897. The words “Kotahi Te Ture/Mo Nga Iwi E Rua/ Maungapōhatu” (One law/for both peoples/Maungapōhatu) were stitched onto it and it had been created as a sign of a peaceful relationship with the Crown.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;[http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/your-museum/about-us/blog/2014/the-maungapohatu-flag "The Maungapōhatu flag"]. Auckland Museum. Retrieved 3.01.2018&lt;/ref&gt; The words were chosen to affirm “the important principle that the dominant culture should not pass laws discriminating against Māori.”&lt;ref&gt;Binney (2009) p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rua Tapunui Kenana ==
[[File:Rua Kenana Mihaia 1908.jpg|thumb|[[Rua Tapunui Kenana|Rua Kenana]] in 1908]]
Rua Tapunui Kenana, a grandson of Tutakangahau, was a Māori prophet, [[faith healer]] and [[land rights]] activist. He claimed to have been born in 1869 at Maungapohatu, although this is disputed.&lt;ref name=Binney353&gt;Binney (1983) p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Binney1/&gt; His father was killed fighting for [[Te Kooti]], a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter and the founder of the [[Ringatū]] religion.&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"/&gt;

Brought up amongst the Tūhoe&lt;ref name=Binney1/&gt; Rua left in 1887 and worked on sheep stations in the [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Bay of Plenty]] districts.&lt;ref name=McLintock&gt;McLintock, A. H. (1966) [https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/rua-tapunui-hepetipa-or-kenana-rua-hepetipa "Rua Tapanui Hepetipa, or Kenana Rua Hepetipa"] ''Te Ara''. Retrieved 13 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; After a mystical experience on the mountain of Maungapohatu, Rua claimed to be the successor to Te Kooti and the Māori brother of Christ. On 12 April 1906 he prophesied that on 25 June he would "ascend the throne" and that [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] would arrive at Gisborne. When the King failed to appear, Rua announced: "I am really that King. Here I am, with all my people."&lt;ref name=Binney1&gt;Binney (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Rua then returned to Maungapohatu where he set himself up as a [[prophet]] and announced his plan for the creation of the City of God at Maungapohatu.&lt;ref name=Binney1/&gt; 

The construction of Maungapohatu was to be a conscious recreation of the biblical city of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Binney353/&gt; The population called themselves the ''Iharaira'', the Israelites, and Rua took the name "Moses". The construction of the community was to mark the beginning of their trials and a test their faithfulness. Maungapohatu was their "City of Redemption. Here, one day, the promises would all be completed and the confiscated lands and the autonomy of the people restored".&lt;ref name=Binney353/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binney1/&gt;

==Settlement history==
===Early years===
[[File:Maungapohatu, city of the mist 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Maungapohatu in 1908]]
Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter of 1907 set in. During the first year the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. At least fifty people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of typhoid which came from the valley camps, and a measles epidemic which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but [[Huhu beetle|huhu]], and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. Nonetheless, from this inauspicious beginning the community struggled on to a first summer of plenty.  Two groups had come together to build ''te pa tapu o te atua'', the sacred [[pā (Māori)|pā]] of the Lord; about half the entire Tuhoe tribe; and the [[Te Whakatōhea|Whakatohea]], who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the "House of the Lord", ''Hiruharama Hou'', built with two gables. One side was for the Tuhoe and the other for the Whakatohea.&lt;ref name=Binney45&gt;Binney ''et al'' (1979) pp. 45–56&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built between 1907-1908, Maungapohatu "was an impressive settlement with its own courthouse, bank, and council room. The streets were lit with oil lamps and it had its own water system, with separated pools for washing and cooking. The families set up their own rules of conduct, which were enforced through a council of elders and their prophet leader. In these first years, about 500 or 600 people lived at Maungapohatu."&lt;ref name=Binney353/&gt;  Rua attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage with a strong communal basis but which also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. 

The concepts of ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu and noa]]'' were central to the design, with different sections to reflect these two ideas. The sacred area, which included the civic amenities and sleeping houses was called the ''wahi tapu'' and fenced off from the surrounding ''noa'' area where buildings for the preparation of food and other mundane activities were built. The [[Bible]] was also a significant influence. The ''Hiruharama Hou'' was inspired by the instructions [[David]] had been given for [[Solomon]]'s House as described in the [[Books of Chronicles]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown (2007) pp. 25-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 3:4, 7, 15-17 &amp; 1 Kings 6:3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hīona.jpg|thumb|The Hiona]]
A two-storied structure called the Hīona (Zion) was constructed that became the parliament from where community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house was decorated with a design of blue clubs (Rua's personal symbol) and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's “Council Chamber and Court House” – also known as “Rua's Temple”. Rua thought it was modelled on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day [[Dome of the Rock]] on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site. The internal design with its two doors, winding staircase and "windows of narrow lights" was more solidly based on the biblical record. The unique cylindrical shape was a radical departure from traditional North Island Maori architecture.&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngaituhoe.com/Folders/TipunaProfiles.html|title=Prophet Rua Kenana|publisher=ngaituhoe.com}} Retrieved 5.01.2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

However, the authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the [[Tohunga Suppression Act]] of 1907, which banned traditional Māori healers from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine.&lt;ref name=Apology&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503462&amp;objectid=10945036 "Church apology after 99 years"]. (2006-09-18) ''Hawkes Bay Today: New Zealand Herald''. Retrieved 6.01.2018.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the Tuhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] intervened in an attempt to curb the prophet's influence.&lt;ref name=Binney45/&gt;

===Second phase===
By the close of 1913, Maungapohatu had declined. The Whakatohea had left and it had become a community of about 30 families. In 1914 the  community broke up of its own accord and 20,000 acres which the Tuhoe had set aside in 1907, to be “a habitation for God and man”, were partitioned. Rua left and the Hiona was abandoned and became used as a hay store. In 1914 a new meeting house in a more traditional style was built -''Tane Nui A Rangi'' - ‘Great [[Tāne]] of the Heavens’.&lt;ref name=Binney354&gt;Binney (1983) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, controversy was seldom far away. Rua was fined for [[Sly-grog shop|sly grogging]] in 1910 and in 1915 served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his return from prison he attempted to reconstruct Maungapohatu. The pa, abandoned circa 1913, was rebuilt with the help of hundred men who worked for three hours each day for three days, "a ritual resurrection of a new and more perfect community".&lt;ref&gt;Binney (1983) p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; This came in tandem with a relaxation of various ''tapu'' observances including the dismantling of the fence between the ''tapu'' and ''noa'' areas.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;
[[File:Towards East Cape.jpg|thumb|The [[The bush|bush country]] of [[Te Urewera]]]]
Rua attempted to persuade the Tuhoe to boycott military service during the [[WW1|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair (1969) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken by the establishment as [[sedition]] and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against him and the Maungapohatu community. On 2 April 1916, seventy heavily armed police officers arrived to arrest Rua. Because the village was so remote, the police  came well-equipped, using wagons and pack-horses, and camped on the way. 

There are conflicting versions of what took place when the police arrived. There was no violent resistance from Rua personally&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"/&gt;  but he refused to submit to arrest, and his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police. In this exchange, Rua's son Toko and a Māori bodyguard were killed and two Māori and four constables were wounded. When the hostilities ceased, Rua was arrested and transported to [[Rotorua]]. He was eventually found not guilty of sedition but guilty of “moral resistance” to the police&lt;ref&gt;Binney ''et al'' (1979) pp. 119-124&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 12 months hard labour to be followed by 18 months imprisonment.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; He served 9 months in [[Mt Eden Prison]], Auckland.&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"/&gt;

===Third and final phase===
The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungapohatu. Although the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungapohatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of April 1916, the behaviour of the police there and the subsequent intimidation of witnesses, no compensation was ever offered.&lt;ref&gt;Binney ''et al'' (1979) pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Rua returned to the Urewera, the settlement was divided, the lands overgrown and much of the community had relocated.  The Presbyterian Mission under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungapohatu and was teaching [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Christianity and pākehā value systems. Rua had banned pākehā schools from the original community but a circular schoolhouse, described as being “in the most isolated spot where any school is maintained in New Zealand”&lt;ref&gt; Binney (1983) p. 362 quoting Laughton&lt;/ref&gt; was still in active use in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; Possibly as part of a ritual purification Rua had both the ''Hiruharama Hou'' and the ''Hiona'' destroyed.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; A typhoid epidemic broke out at in the community in early in 1925 and after Laughton left in 1926 Rua organised the construction of a whole village for the third and final time.&lt;ref name=Binney358/&gt; The new design reflected Rua Kenana's transition from a style of [[Old Testament]] prophet to that of [[New Testament]] pacifist.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Houses of slab and shingle with galvanised iron roofs were built. There were two main streets and the houses were grouped carefully along them.&lt;ref name=Binney358&gt; Binney (1983) pp. 358-60&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed this rebuilding was to prepare for the end of the world but when this failed to happen he blamed his followers. Eventually he moved downstream to Matahi in the eastern Bay of Plenty, where he lived until his death in 1937."&lt;ref name=Binney1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; 

Nonetheless, the community continued to thrive for a while, facilities including two tennis courts and an open-air dance floor. Between 1927 and 1929 Maungapohatu had a population of about 150 and this period was remembered fondly by those who lived there.&lt;ref&gt;Binney (1983) p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1936 the population had declined to 21 families.&lt;ref&gt; Binney (1983) p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Binney (1983) notes that the main reasons for the long term decline of the settlement included the difficulties of finding paid work while living at such a remote location, the nature of the terrain, which is "fiercely daunting for farming", and the community's inability to find any sources of capital for redevelopment. "The poor had subsidised the state, but the state had remained substantially indifferent to them."&lt;ref&gt;Binney (1983) pp. 365, 366, 387&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s two botanists, the "Tramping Girls of Auckland", [[Lucy Cranwell]] and [[Lucy Moore (botanist)|Lucy Moore]] conducted a field trip to research the flora of Mt. Maungapohatu. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outsidethesquare.org.nz/lucy-cranwell "Lucy Cranwell"] Outsidethesquare. Retrieved 7.01.2018&lt;/ref&gt; Cranwell wrote "we set off at 3 am in a PDW truck back to the Papatotara Saddle and from there trudged the deep-worn horse track across three steep ridges to Rua's Pa at the base of our mountain ... an almost vertical surveyer's route took us to the flattish summit just as the sun was setting. When dawn came the mountain plants were covered with a delicate layer of frost."&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Ewen K.

===Modern day===
Ngāi Tūhoe had donated 16,000ha of land to the government in 1922 so that roads could be built to connect Maungapohatu with the eastern Bay of Plenty and [[Ruatahuna]] but they were not constructed. In 1964 a road was finally built to the tiny settlement by a timber company and more than 1500 people attended the opening celebrations. For a few years the milling operations brought "modest prosperity to this isolated and impoverished area, which had never recovered from the exodus of most of its inhabitants" after the close of Rua's experiments in collective living. Little now remains of Maungapohatu, the population of which was estimated at only 15 in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/opening-first-road-maungapohatu "Opening of first road to Maungapōhatu"]. New Zealand History. Retrieved 3.01.2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the annual synod of the [[Diocese of Waiapu]] passed a motion apologising for the [[Anglican Church]]'s role in the 1907 Tohunga Suppression Act and in May of that year Archbishop [[Brown Turei]] and other church members made a pilgrimage to Maungapohatu. The church also announced plans to contribute to the rebuilding of the Maungapohatu marae.&lt;ref name=Apology/&gt; In 2014 the Maungapōhatu flag, which had been removed by the police in 1916 at the time of Rua Kenana's arrest, was returned by [[Auckland Museum]] to the Tūhoe as part of "the Museums’&lt;!--sic--&gt; commitment to addressing historic ownership issues associated with [[taonga]]."&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;

[[File:Otger cataló.png|thumb|Otger Cataló in a painting of [[Claudi Lorenzale|Claudio Lorenzale]]]]
'''Otger Cataló''' (or '' 'Catalon' '') is a legendary character who with the [[Nine Barons of Fame]] would have conquered [[Catalonia]] from the [[Saracen]]s sometime in the 8th century AD. According to some old theories{{by whom|date=June 2018}}, the name of Catalonia would have derived from its surname. In any case, the oldest written references to this character that have survived are from the fifteenth century, much later than any contemporaneous source. The legend was recovered mainly from [[XIX]] with the appearance of [[Catalans|Catalan]] and by the works of the authors of the Catalan ''[[Renaixença]]'': [[Víctor Balaguer]], [[Antoni Ferrer i Codina]] and [[Jacinto Verdaguer]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{GEC|0047965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend is based on events that occurred in three different generations. Otger agrees in the name and on the date of death with Otger (671-735), '' Arcomte de Catalanum '' (710-735), Duke of Aquitaine, who died in the battle for the reconquest of [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] and was buried in the Monastery of the island of Ré. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0047965.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3527">'''Pedro Armillas''' Garcia (9 September 1914 – 11 April 1984)&lt;ref&gt;see Freeman 1986 for birth/death dates.&lt;/ref&gt; was Spanish academic [[anthropologist]], [[archaeologist]], and an influential [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] scholar of the mid-20th century. As an archaeologist he was known both for his [[fieldwork]] and excavations at numerous sites in central and northern [[Mexico]], and his contributions in [[archaeological theory]]. His study of how [[Mesoamerican agriculture]] and [[list of subsistence techniques|subsistence modes of production]] influenced the development of Mesoamerican cultures was a pioneering one, and he was one of the earliest to investigate pre-Columbian irrigation and hydraulic systems.

== Biography ==

Armillas was born on 9 September 1914 in [[San Sebastián, Spain]].  In 1932 he received a bachelor's degree from the [[Instituto Balmes]] in [[Barcelona]].  With the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the Loyalist forces but upon their defeat left Spain for [[Mexico]], with his wife the painter Angeles Gil Sala whom he married in 1937.

In Mexico he was a land surveyor and associated with the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] people.  Armillas later taught at Mexico City's anthropological institute.

In the 1940s Armillas conducted several seasons of excavations at the major site of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]], following on from earlier investigations by [[George Clapp Vaillant|George Vaillant]], [[Eduardo Noguera]], and [[Sigvald Linné]].

From the 1960s on he taught at various universities in the [[United States]] including the [University of Illinois at Chicago]. He died in Chicago on 11 April 1984. At the time of his death, he was an anthropology professor at the University Illinois Chicago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16941">'''Richard Stockton MacNeish''' (April 29, 1918 – January 16, 2001), known to many as "Scotty", was an American [[archaeologist]].  His fieldwork revolutionized the understanding of the development of agriculture in the [[New World]] and the [[prehistory]] of several regions of Canada, the United States and Central and South America.  He pioneered new methods in fieldwork and materials analysis and brought attention to the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.  His legacy has influenced generations of archaeologists.

== Early life and education ==

Richard Stockton MacNeish was born April 29, 1918 in [[New York City]].  His interest in archaeology started at a young age, sparked by a hastily created report on the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] for an art history class when he was twelve.  A year later he wrote to prominent Maya [[archaeologist]] Dr. [[A.V. Kidder]] asking for a job at his dig at [[Chichen Itza]].  Although his request was gently refused, Kidder encouraged MacNeish to study hard and become an archaeologist.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, pp.2–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, MacNeish started his university career at Colgate College (now [[Colgate University]]) and participated in several archaeological field schools in New York and Arizona where he learned important [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] skills that he would later modify to create his own excavation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this time, MacNeish writes: “My energy was boundless: I dug, I hiked, I climbed cliffs, I learned, I went to dances, I mixed cement by hand, I caught rattlesnakes, I packed mules.  Most important, I did and talked archaeology morning, noon, and night – and loved every moment of it”.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.6)&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to be influenced by Dr. [[A.V. Kidder|Kidder]], and refined his field archaeology methods under [[George Brainerd]], eventually forming his personal excavation technique [[La Perre]].

At the urging of several Southwestern archaeologists, MacNeish prepared to transfer to the [[University of Chicago]] to study under [[Fay-Cooper Cole]].  Before doing so, however, he had an unrelated feat to achieve.  As a child, his mother enrolled him in boxing lessons and he had become quite accomplished.  Now, he wanted to win a [[Golden Gloves]] championship.  He did so in New York in 1938, wearing a kilt in the final bout as a tribute to his Scottish ancestry.  This skill continued to provide him with spending money during his student years.&lt;ref&gt;Rolett (2003, xiii–xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
At the [[University of Chicago]], he participated in field schools that exposed him to the methods and theories of [[James A. Ford]], William Haag, Jesse D. Jennings, John Cotter, Glen Black, Tom Lewis, and Madeline Kneberg.  In addition, he was heavily influenced by Julian Steward’s ''Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned his B.A. in 1940, his M.A. in 1944 and his Ph.D. in 1949.  That same year, while working in the [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]], Mexico, MacNeish discovered primitive [[teosinte]] [[corncobs]] in context with human habitations dating back several thousand years.  This achievement spurred his lifelong interest in the origins of [[agriculture]] and society that would take him throughout Central and South America, eventually to China and, nearly, to Turkey.  This last trip was put on hold when doctors ordered him to rest after a mild heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Rolett (2003, xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;  After a long, varied and influential career, Richard MacNeish at age 83 died on January 16, 2001 in a car accident while touring Pre-Columbian Maya sites in Belize.

== Academic career ==

Shortly before his transfer to Chicago, during continued fieldwork in Arizona, MacNeish set out his future goals.  “First I would learn to dig well and skillfully, then I would become able to analyze archaeological findings, and finally I would become a theoretician”.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from MacNeish (1978, p.7).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during his fieldwork as an undergraduate and graduate student that he worked on his first goal.  At field schools across the United States, MacNeish absorbed the knowledge and techniques of anyone he worked with.  Synthesis of this knowledge came to fruition during fieldwork in the state of [[Tamaulipas]] in [[Mexico]].  Here MacNeish made one of his important contributions to the field methods of archaeologists, fulfilling his first goal.  He pioneered a method of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] caves that involved the stripping the strata off alternate squares from a vertical profile.  This allowed for greater detail and more meaningful divisions of an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].  Where many previous methods involved digging by arbitrary levels, the new method &amp;mdash; dubbed the [[La Perre]] technique after the cave in which it was first developed &amp;mdash; dug each distinct strata, or floor, separately.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.10)&lt;/ref&gt;

His discovery in these caves of very early [[maize]] domestication evidence also brought home to him the importance of interdisciplinary studies as he struggled to get dating and identification information on his samples.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1967, p.3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He realized that in getting an education archaeologists, “…spend much of their time learning phonemics, personality and culture, esoteric kinship systems, strange customs of primitive peoples, and so forth and do not have time for fields like [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[pollen analysis]], soils, and [[geology]] – all disciplines they will have to use”.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.22)&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to rectify this, MacNeish began to involve experts outside of archaeology in many of his field studies.  This policy was very well demonstrated in his excavations in the [[Tehuacán Valley|Tehuacan]] Valley and [[Ayacucho]], Peru which resulted in multi-volume publications which analyzed the sites “utilizing the skills of all appropriate scientific fields”.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1967, p.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, MacNeish went to work for the [[National Museum of Canada]].  With this he began a system of spending his summers surveying and [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] in Northern and Western Canada and his winters searching for evidence of the origins of agriculture across Central America.  “MacNeish enjoyed saying ‘I have as much sense as a duck – I fly south in the winter’”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rolett (2003, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;  Realizing that a random search for sites over these huge swathes of territory would be difficult and inefficient, he pioneered a five-step process that was based on making and then testing hypotheses about ancient environments and human behavior in them.  These steps were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Initial background preparation on area to be surveyed
# Preliminary hypothesis…based on background materials and cultural sequential generalizations…
# Testing hypothesis in the field, modifying and setting up new hypotheses, testing them, and so on.
# Field analysis of artifacts from sites to establish preliminary chronology…and to determine potential stratified sites or sites with special features.
# Resurvey for contextual data and special problems.&lt;ref&gt;See MacNeish (1978, p.15).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using this process, he discovered hundreds of new sites and gained a reputation for “lucky” finds, while actually advancing the scientific foundation of archaeology.

MacNeish added to the understanding and analysis of archaeological materials through the championing of the interdisciplinary approach.  In addition, his work on the standardization and computerization of [[Stone tool|lithic]]-attribute terminology enabled more sophisticated statistical analysis and generalization of the results.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.39)&lt;/ref&gt;  His ceramic analysis helped to reevaluate the prehistory of the [[Iroquois]], disputing the idea that they had developed elsewhere and then migrated into their historic territory.  His method of analysis demonstrated continuity between historic period groups and prehistoric complexes in the same areas.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, pp.35–36)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the field and lab work MacNeish has been a professor at [[Boston University]] and the [[University of Calgary]], where he helped to found their Department of Archaeology.  He was the [[Whidden Lecturer]] at [[McMaster University]], [[Senior Archaeologist]] at the [[National Museum of Canada]], and was the director of the [[Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology]] in Andover, Massachusetts.  When he left the museum in 1983, instead of retiring, he established the [[Andover Foundation for Archaeological Research]] (AFAR), named himself Director of Research and continued his work in the American Southwest and China.

===Coxcatlan Cave===
In the 1960s, MacNeish discovered the [[Coxcatlan Cave]] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]]. This was a very important site of early maize domestication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/g/coxcatlan_cave.htm Coxcatlan Cave (Mexico)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404182650/http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/g/coxcatlan_cave.htm |date=2015-04-04 }} archaeology.about.com&lt;/ref&gt;

It is due to his extensive study that much of the historical and cultural record there was established, especially from the Archaic period when the cave was most active. The cave produced domesticated plants dated between 5,000 and 3,400 BC, including maize.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Austin, Bruce F. Benz, Douglas J. Donahue, AJ T. Jull, and Lawrence J. Toolin. [https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1236 ''First direct AMS dates on early maize from Tehuacán, Mexico.''] Radiocarbon 31, no. 3 (1989): 1035-1040.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the people and animals living in [[Tehuacán Valley|Tehuacan]] Valley divided their time between small hunting encampments and large temporary villages.

== Awards and honors ==

MacNeish was awarded honorary degrees from the [[Universidad de San Cristobal de Huamanga]] in Ayacucho, Peru and [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia, Canada.  He was elected to the [[National Academy of Science]], [[British Academy of Science]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].  He served as President of the [[Society for American Archaeology]] and has received numerous awards, including the Kidder Medal from the [[American Anthropological Association]], the Spinden Medal for Archaeology from the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and the Fiftieth Anniversary Award for Outstanding Contributions to American Archaeology from the Society for American Archaeology.  In 1977 he was awarded the [[Cornplanter Medal]] for his work in [[Iroquois]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fenton |first=William N. |authorlink=William N. Fenton |date=April 1980 |title=Frederick Starr, Jesse Cornplanter and the Cornplanter Medal for Iroquois Research |jstor=23169465 |journal=New York History |publisher=New York State Historical Association |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition he has been honored by institutions for his work in Mexico and China.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

MacNeish’s ultimate goal was to make archaeology more of a science.  He was a [[processual archaeology|processual archaeologist]] who championed the necessity of [[experimental archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.44)&lt;/ref&gt; and hypothesis testing&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.233)&lt;/ref&gt; in the exploration of human [[cultural ecology]].  By adopting, creating or championing methods that made archaeological results more generalizable and amenable to hypothesis testing MacNeish was attempting to learn, and teach, about the broader patterns of social change that can inform our choices in the future; he wished to use archaeology to improve the human condition.  “…laws of cultural change may be of use not only in explaining the past, but more important, in predicting the future or at least indicating the steps in cultural change we might take in the future”.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from MacNeish (1978, xi).&lt;/ref&gt;  His ultimate legacy, the sum total of all of his individual accomplishments in methodology and theory, was his commitment to archaeology as a science that could produce laws and theories to aid humanity in the future. In his autobiographical discussion of American archaeology (1978), MacNeish writes, “We are still fumbling along, perfecting techniques as well as improving methodology, and our field – as well as I – have a long way to go”.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeish (1978, p.45)&lt;/ref&gt;

MacNeish was constantly calling for others to question his conclusions and improve his methods to further advance the science of archeology and its ability to speak to society’s needs.  As a result, his greatest legacy is probably his influence on and encouragement of students, other archaeologists and professionals he worked with.  One of these students, [[Barry Rolett]], recalls how “MacNeish encouraged and invested his time in students like me because he loved to share the excitement of archaeology” and “led by example and he used his considerable influence more to help others than for his own personal gain”.&lt;ref&gt;Rolett (2003, xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Published works ==

By his own accounting, Richard MacNeish “spent 8,071 days in the field and wrote more than 9 million words”.&lt;ref&gt;As recounted by Flannery and Marcus (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; His many publications include:  
*For information on his life and on American archaeology: The Science of Archaeology?, 1978

'''Roderic O'Flaherty''' ({{lang-ga|Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh}}; 1629–1718 or 1716) was an Irish historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB| wstitle= O'Flaherty, Roderic|last= Gilbert |first= John Thomas|authorlink= John Thomas Gilbert |volume= 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in [[County Galway]] and inherited Maigh Cuilinn ([[Moycullen]]) Castle and estate.

Ó Flaithbheartaigh was the last ''de jure'' Lord of [[Iar Connacht]], and the last recognised chief of the [[O'Flaherty]] clan. He lost the greater part of his ancestral estates to [[Plantations of Ireland#Cromwellian land confiscation (1652)|Cromwellian confiscations]] in the 1650s. The remainder was stolen through deception, by his son's father-in-law, Richard ''Nimble Dick'' Martin of Ross. He died in poverty at Park, near [[Bearna]].

Uniquely among the Ó Flaithbheartaigh family up to that time, Ruaidhri became a highly regarded historian and collector of Irish manuscripts. His friends and associates included his teacher [[Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh]]; [[Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin]]; Dr. [[John Lynch (Irish historian)|John Lynch]]; [[Edward Lluyd]]; [[Samuel Moleneaux]] and his father [[William Molyneux|William]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656–1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His published works included ''Ogyia'' and ''Iar Connacht''.

He is perhaps most often associated with his elaborate history of Ireland, ''Ogygia'', published in 1685 as ''Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia &amp; etc.'', in 1793 translated into English by Rev. James Hely,  as
:"Ogygia, or a Chronological account of Irish Events (collected from Very Ancient Documents faithfully compared with each other &amp; supported by the Genealogical &amp; Chronological Aid of the Sacred and Profane Writings of the Globe"

[[Ogygia]] is the island of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], used by O'Flaherty as an allegory for Ireland. Drawing from numerous ancient documents, ''Ogygia'' traces Irish history back to the ages of mythology and legend, before the 1st century. The book credits [[Milesius]] as the progenitor of the [[Goidelic]] people. O'Flaherty had included in his history what purported to be an essay on the understanding of the ancient [[Ogham]] alphabet. Based on the 1390 ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'', he stated that each letter was named after a tree, a concept widely accepted in 17th century Ireland.

''Ogygia'' was immediately criticised for its scholarship by Sir [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie]] of Rosehaugh (1636–91), Dean of Faculty (1682) at [[Aberdeen]]. The arguments about O'Flaherty's continued well into the 18th century, culminating in the 1775 ''The Ogygia Vindicated'' by the historian [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor]], in which he adds explanatory footnotes to the original work.

Dr. Thomas Molyneux visited Ó Flaithbheartaigh on Wednesday 21 April 1709 and left the following eye-witness account- "''I went to vizit old Flaherty, who lives, very old, in a miserable condition at Park, some 3 hours west of Gallway, in Hiar or West-Connaught. I expected to have seen here some old Irish manuscripts, but his ill fortune has stripp'd him of these as well as his other goods, so that he has nothing now left but some few of his own writing, and a few old rummish books of history printed. In my life I never saw so strangely stony and wild a country. I did not see all this way 3 living creatures, not one house or ditch, not one bit of corn, nor even, I might say, a bit of land, for stones: in short nothing appear'd but stones and sea, nor could I conceive an inhabited country so destitute of all signs of people and art as this is.''"&lt;ref&gt;Journey to Connaught, April 1709 by Aquilla Smith, in The Miscellany of the Irish Archaeological Society. Volume 1, Dublin, [[Irish Archaeological Society]] (1846), pp. 161–178&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his daughters, and a son, [[Micheal Ó Flaithbheartaigh]].

'''Rudrani''' is the [[shakti]] and consort of [[Rudra]] (Shiva). She later came to be identified as a manifestation of [[Durga]]. Rudrani is the divine will and power related to Lord Shiva (Rudra). She is also a [[Matrika]] known as [[Maheshwari]].

In accordance with traditions, a [[Devi]] will gain an epithet from her consorts name.
[[Saraswati]], the consort of [[Brahma]], has the epithets [[Brahmani]]/[[Brahmi]].
[[Lakshmi]], the consort of [[Vishnu]]/[[Narayana]], has the epithets [[Vaishnavi (Matrika goddess)|Vaishnavi]].

Similarly, [[Parvati]], the consort of [[Rudra]]/[[Shiva]], has the epithets '''Rudrani'''/Shivani.

Although all the female versions of all male deity's names are epithets for [[Devi]], these specific epithets such as Brahmani, Narayani, Rudrani, etc are included in another separate group of Devis, the [[Matrikas]].
They also possess the traditional symbols associated with their consorts. Rudrani possesses a trident, damru, crescent moon, snake etc which are usually attributed to Shiva.

[[Parvati]] is a mild manifestation of [[Devi]], and the name '''Rudrani''' (from its root Rudra, roughly meaning ferocious/angry) denotes a more ferocious disposition.
Hence, it makes more sense to associate the epithet Rudrani with a form of Parvati which is well-known to be ferocious, [[Kali]].

Outside the [[Matrikas]] pantheon, '''Rudrani''' barely has an independent worship and dedicated temples,  apart from the usual mention during rituals.

'''Sanusi Pane''' (14 November 1905 – 2 January 1968) was an Indonesian writer, journalist, and historian.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}} He was highly active in literary media, sitting on the editorial boards of several publications. He has also been described as the most important dramatist from before the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].

==Biography==
Pane was born in [[Muara Sipongi]], [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]], [[Dutch East Indies]], on 14 November 1905 to a Muslim family.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}} He began his education in two primary schools in [[Sibolga]], before continuing to middle school, first in [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], then in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (modern day Jakarta).{{sfn|Jassin|1963|p=267}} While in Jakarta, Pane published his first poem, "Tanah Air" ("Homeland"), in the magazine ''Jong Soematra''.{{sfn|Siregar|1964|p=114}} After graduating in 1922, he attended the Gunung Sari Teachers' College until 1925; upon graduation, he taught at the college for several years{{sfn|Jassin|1963|p=267}} and took a year to study law.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}}

In 1929, Pane moved to India, where he spent a year studying the [[culture of India]].{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}} After his return to the Indies in 1930, Pane became a member of the editorial staff of ''Timboel'' magazine as well as a teacher.{{sfn|Jassin|1963|p=267}} In 1933, his younger brother [[Armijn Pane|Armijn]] called on him to work on the new literary magazine, ''[[Poedjangga Baroe]]''; Pane accepted.{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|pp=19–21}} In 1934 he was fired as a teacher due to his membership in the [[Indonesian National Party]].{{sfn|Jassin|1963|p=267}}

Pane continued to be active in literary circles, joining the editorial board of ''Panorama'' in the early 1930s, together with [[Liem Koen Hian]], [[Amir Sjarifuddin]] and [[Mohammad Yamin]].&lt;ref name="van Klinken 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Klinken|first1=Geert Arend|title=Minorities, Modernity and the Emerging Nation: Christians in Indonesia, a Biographical Approach|date=2003|publisher=KITLV Press|location=Leiden|isbn=9789067181518|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fuOwhUwUgScC&amp;dq=Minorities,+Modernity+and+the+Emerging+Nation:+Christians+in+Indonesia&amp;hl=id&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dieleman, Koning &amp; Post 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dieleman|first1=Marleen|last2=Koning|first2=Juliette|last3=Post|first3=Peter|title=Chinese Indonesians and Regime Change|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9004191216|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=r8cYIDMAppYC&amp;dq=Dieleman,+Koning+%26+Post+(2010)&amp;hl=id&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Panorama'' was a newspaper belonging to Siang Po Press, a publishing house owned by the Dutch-educated jurist and politician [[Phoa Liong Gie]].&lt;ref name="Chan (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Faye|title=Chinese women's emancipation as reflected in two Peranakan journals (c.1927-1942)|journal=Archipel|date=1995|volume=49|issue=1|pages=45–62|doi=10.3406/arch.1995.3035|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1995_num_49_1_3035|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1936, together with his colleagues Liem, Sjarifuddin and Yamin, Pane started another newspaper, ''Kebangoenan'' (1936–1941), which was also published by Phoa's Siang Po Printing Press.&lt;ref name="van Klinken 2003" /&gt;{{sfn|Siregar|1964|p=114}}{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}}

Together with Armijn, [[Adam Malik]], and Sumanang, on 13 December 1937 Pane founded the news agency [[Antara (news agency)|Antara]]; after independence, Antara became Indonesia's official news agency.{{sfn|Setiyardi 2002, In deep water}} From 1941 to 1942, Pane edited the magazine ''Indonesia'', published by the state-owned publisher [[Balai Pustaka]].{{sfn|Siregar|1964|p=114}}{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}} While working with Balai Pustaka, Pane would refuse [[employee benefit]]s such as free rice and a shuttle service, instead choosing to walk to work and buy his own rice.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}}

After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese invaded the Indies]], Pane became the head of the Central Cultural Office.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}}

Pane died in Jakarta on 2 January 1968.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sanusi Pane}} Before he died, he requested that his body be treated in a Hindu manner; however, his family did not grant the request as they felt it would be against Islamic teachings.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}}

==Style==
Pane's poems used everyday language, including foreign [[loanword]]s. He limited his use of the local languages of Indonesia, including his native language [[Batak languages|Batak]]. Structurally, his poems resembled the old Malay form ''[[pantun]]'', although he also wrote several sonnets.{{sfn|Siregar|1964|p=115}} Many of his poems dealt with philosophical issues.{{sfn|Sutherland|1968|pp=120–122}} Indonesian writer and literary critic [[Muhammad Balfas]] calls Pane the "first [Indonesian poet] who used his poetry to reveal his inner self".{{sfn|Balfas|1976|p=45}}

==Views==
Pane viewed Western cultures as being too [[materialism|materialistic]], focusing on the physical aspects of life; Eastern cultures, on the other hand, he viewed as being more [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualistic]]. He saw this as influencing the way in which humans interacted with nature, with Westerners seeking to conquer it and Easterners preferring to adapt to it.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}} In one polemic in response to fellow ''Poedjangga Baroe'' editor [[Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana]], who was decidedly pro-Western, Pane compared the West to [[Faust]], who sold his soul to the devil for worldly pleasure and knowledge, and the East to [[Arjuna]], who searched for a spiritual truth. Pane did, however, admit that Western technology could bring a positive change.{{sfn|Sutherland|1968|pp=120–122}}

==Personal life==
Pane was elder brother to writer Armijn Pane and [[Lafran Pane]], the latter of whom founded the Indonesian [[Muslim Students' Association (Indonesia)|Muslim Students' Association]]. With his wife, Pane had six children.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}} Pane's religious views have been described as being a "composite of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Javanese philosophy".{{sfn|Balfas|1976|p=46}}

Pane was reportedly very modest, telling J. U. Nasution&amp;nbsp;– who at the time was in the midst of writing a biography on Pane&amp;nbsp;– that he was nothing and should not be interviewed. On another occasion, he refused a Satya Lencana Kebudayaan award from President [[Sukarno]], stating that Indonesia had given him everything but he had done nothing for it.{{sfn|Ministry of Education 2009, Sanusi Pane}}

Balfas called Pane the most important Indonesian dramatist from before the [[Indonesian National Revolution|national revolution]].{{sfn|Balfas|1976|p=66}}

[[File:Sede Storia Patria.jpg|thumb|Savona, Boselli's home: the location of the Society]]

The '''Società Savonese di Storia Patria''' ('''SSSP''') is a non-profit historical society founded in 1885. Its registered location is in [[Savona]]: its statutory interests are directed towards historical [[Liguria]], and so they cover an area wider than the current homonym Italian region.

== History ==
The Società Savonese di Storia Patria was founded in 27 December 1885 with the name of Società storica savonese by a group of intellectuals at the request of [[Paolo Boselli]], the future Prime Minister. In 1916 it assumed its present name.

== Social activities and library ==
[[File:Paolo Boselli Storia Patria.jpg|thumb|Society's entrance hall with the portrait and the bust of Boselli]]
[[File:Sala conferenze Storia Patria.jpg|thumb|Conference room]]

The social activity is coordinated by a board of council members and it is mainly expressed in the publication of an annual volume of ''Atti e memorie'' and other publishing activities (magazine ''Sabazia'', editorial series ''Zetesis'' and ''Novecento''). The non-publishing activities are very intense and they include historical conferences, also organized with other institutions, and interventions more closely linked to the cultural life. The Society owns a specialized library of more than 50,000 titles.

== Historical Toponymy Project == 
The main ongoing research of the society is represented by the Progetto Toponomastica Storica (Historical Toponymy Project) that collects and studies historical place names; the project began in 2011 and up to now has published over 50,000 pre–19th century toponyms, related to Liguria and Piedmont.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10847">'''Technopolis GS''' is a project to create a modern electronics industrial park in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaliningrad region]] of [[Russia]].

==Project background==

In 2007, in [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gusev]], for the first time in Russia, was established a production of set-top boxes for receiving satellite and terrestrial television broadcasts. Several months later, the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]] started building a plant in Gusev to manufacture household electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis.gs/concept/|title=Технополис GS. Цель и задачи проекта...|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the mayor of Gusev, [[Nikolay Tsukanov]], and the president of the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]], Andrey Tkachenko, was signed in 2008, in order to create a modern [[Science park|industrial park]] in the city. The idea was approved by local authorities and was presented at the International Investment Forum "[[Sochi]]-2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|title="Технополис GS" представлен на международном инвестиционном форуме "Сочи-2008″|accessdate=2010-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150944/http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to locate the new production facilities in Gusev, according to Andrey Tkachenko, was made for two reasons. 
First, the experience of the first similar plant that had been working in Gusev as part of the [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zone]] - the official residence of the Corporation - was successful. Second, the administration of the city took a great interest in cooperation for the creation of Technopolis and in a comprehensive solution to the problem of the territory development.&lt;ref name="spbref"&gt;{{cite web|author=Алексей Писарев.|date=5 June 2008|url=http://www.spbit.ru/news/n49693|publisher=SPBIT|title=Технополис от "Дженерал Сателайт"|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two plants, JSC NPO Digital Television Systems (DTS) and Prankor, Ltd., were run - their products have no analogues in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 August 2009|url=http://www.spbit.su/news/n64146/|publisher=ITSZ.ru|title="Корпорация Дженерал Сателайт" строит российский Тайвань|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants produce set-top boxes for receiving the satellite and terrestrial TV broadcasts, and the production conveyor ensures a complete production cycle: starting with the motherboard and all the way up to the case and the satellite antennas as well.  Formerly, most of these devices in the Russian market were imported, usually from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 March 2009|url=http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009/04/14/344244|publisher=CNews|title=Это возможно: выпуск электроники в РФ дешевле, чем в Китае|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824043856/http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009%2F04%2F14%2F344244|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Project==
The market observers, in general, welcomed the General Satellite initiative and the investment prospects. "Industrial parks development, on one hand, is very expensive, and on the other – it is extremely knowledge-intensive”, - Pavel Zhavoronkov, an analyst at the investment firm Sovlink, said, while making a comment on the General Satellite Corporation plans. - “Based on the payroll size, 1500 to 2400 million rubles will be spent till the year 2011. The average payroll should be 1.95 billion, which will "swallow" almost 40% of the capital raised. The establishment of such an Industrial Park is possible only if stringent standards and practices are observed in the construction and cash flow. From the perspective of the country, it is an invaluable contribution to the development and science."&lt;ref name="spbref" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While implementing such projects, developers are often faced with many difficulties, of which the most serious are legislation "gaps" and official circumlocution6. In this case, the local officials led by [[Georgi Boos]] – the Kaliningrad region Governor – proved to be a considerable support for the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Василий Одарущенко.|date=6 September 2010|url=http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|title=Штефан Штайн: "Покидаю Гусев в приподнятом настроении"|publisher=ZDT-gusev|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226191706/http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
'''Transnational governance''', within a [[European Union]] framework, is both a subset of [[governance]] in general and an application of it to situations outside its usual limits of corporate or governmental hierarchies, whether regional or national. When such disparate hierarchies within the EU find common goals, typically within a conterminous geographic area, they seek to achieve them by integrating their various policies and activities. The goals of transnational governance, especially for areas previously divided by the [[Iron Curtain]] or pre-EU barriers to [[free trade]] and movement of peoples, is to foster economic and [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transnational Governance: Institutional Dynamics of Regulation | url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/45038/excerpt/9780521845038_excerpt.pdf | work= | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Edited by Marie-Laure Djelic and Kerstin Sahlin-Andersson | accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[economic development]] could be defined as the increased of [[wealth]] of a country or a region and the social development could be loosely defined as the improvements of quality of living for the population. Economic and social are, or at least should be, inseparable concepts. Why reach a high economic development if the inhabitants living in the area don’t see any benefits of that improvement?

In the current global political and economic landscape, particularly within the backdrop of [[globalization]], there is an increase in [[privatization]]. This means that business has started to play an important role in the international order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business and Global Governance|last=Ougaard|first=Morten|last2=Leander|first2=Anna|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415493369|location=London|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related phenomenon called [[public-private partnerships]] (PPPs) is seen as an offshoot of this development. 

Critics, however, cite that a dominance of the private sector and the global capital in the world today is dangerous since it tends to undermine international cooperation and equity among states.&lt;ref&gt;Ougaard &amp; Leander, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There is global consensus, therefore, regarding the need for transnational governance that can regulate and address the gaps on global issues and crises like poverty, climate change, disease, terrorism, and financial crises, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking the Future of Europe: A Challenge of Governance|last=Schepers|first=Stefan|last2=Kakabadse|first2=Andrew|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349438426|location=New York|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-centric [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] international order is unable to cope with these transnational threats, calling for multilateral collaboration that does not only involve states but also other international actors such as non-governmental organizations and multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emerging Transnational (In)security Governance: A Statist-Transnationalist Approach|last=Aydinli|first=Ersel|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=0415563607|location=London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and economic impact===
Reach social and economic developments are already a challenging but it’s even more challenging in a transnational area such as the greater region. Some projects were created in order to foster these developments. The operational program Interreg IV A, “grande region” has for main objectives to make the greater region more attractive, encourage innovation, improve the numbers of high quality jobs, etc.

The improvement of the economic and social situation could be analysed through the example of the Vienna-Bratislava-Györ triangle which is a cross border area including three countries ([[Slovakia]], [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]]) that were once part of the same empire. [[Good governance]] could lead to the adoption of a common identity which could lead to mutual support between people, companies or authorities sharing this common identity. Concretely, we observe a high amount of [[Foreign direct investment]]s (FDI) coming from Austria in order to develop the general situation of Slokia and Hungary. This is very well descriptor in this citation of Tatzberger (2007) : “Foreign direct investments (FDI) play an important role in restructuring and improving the [[competitiveness]] of [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]] by helping to raise [[productivity]] and to expand [[export]]s. It has been one of the driving forces behind industrial restructuring in Hungary and Slovakia”.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Tatzberger, Territorial Cohesion and the European Model of Society (Book), The Vienna-Bratislava-Györ Triangle The European Model of Society in Action, edited by Andreas Faludi&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has to be said to huge economic and social disparities could be seen a real threat to the process leading to the creation of a common identity. For instance, the migration of workers stays underdeveloped because of Austrian fears and restrictions. On one side workers mobility is seen as an important force in enhancing [[economic integration]] of the region but on the other side it could lead to real changes in the social structure especially in Austria due to the migration of very low qualified workers. An important [[brain drain]] could also appear which will make highly decrease the number of educated people who could have been able to develop and teach regional strategic development plan.

The '''two-stage theory''' (or ''stagism'') a [[Marxist-Leninist]] political theory which argues that underdeveloped countries, such as [[Tsarist]] Russia, must first pass through a stage of [[capitalism]] before moving to a socialist stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#stagism MIA: Encyclopedia of Marxism: Glossary of Terms, ''Stagism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The two-stage theory was applied to countries worldwide which had not passed through the capitalist stage.

The discussion on stagism focuses on the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. However, [[Maoist]] theories, such as [[New Democracy]], tend to apply a two-stage theory to struggles elsewhere. In the Soviet Union the two-stage theory was opposed by the Trotskyist theory of [[permanent revolution]].

==Theory==
In Marxist–Leninist theory under Stalin the theory of two stages gained a revival. More recently, the [[South African Communist Party]] and [[Socialist Alliance (Australia)]] have re-elaborated the two-stage theory, although the Socialist Alliance differentiates their position from the Stalinist one.&lt;ref&gt;
Doug Lorimer [http://links.org.au/node/141 In Defence of Lenin's Marxist Policy of a Two-Stage, Uninterrupted Revolution] Links | International journal of socialist renewal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The two-stage theory is often attributed to Marx and Engels, but critics such as [[David McLellan (academic)|David McLellan]]&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, David, ''The thought of Karl Marx'', pp134ff&lt;/ref&gt; and others dispute that Marx and Engels envisaged the strict application of this theory outside of the actually existing Western development of capitalism.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Although all agree that [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] argue that Western capitalism provides the technological advances necessary for socialism and the "grave diggers" of the capitalist class in the form of the working class, critics of the two-stage theory, including most trends of [[Trotskyism]], counter that Marx and Engels denied that they had laid down a formula to be applied to all countries in all circumstances. McLellan and others cite Marx's ''Reply to Mikhailovsky'':

{{quote|"[Mikhailovsky] feels he absolutely must metamorphose my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into a historico-philosophic theory of the general path every people is fated to tread, whatever the historical circumstances in which it finds itself ... but I beg his pardon. (He is both honouring and shaming me too much.)"|Karl Marx, ''Reply to Mikhailovsky''&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Selected Writings, ed D McLellan, (Oxford, 1977), pp 571 f. (1877) [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol01/no04/marx.htm Text in MIA]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Preface to the Russian edition of the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' of 1882, Marx and Engels specifically outline an alternative path to socialism for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeaval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West? The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development." Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party, Preface to Russia edition of 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the [[Menshevik]]s believed the two-stage theory applied to Tsarist Russia. They were criticised by Trotsky in what became the theory of [[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]] in 1905. Later when the two-stage theory re-appeared after the death of Lenin in the Soviet Union, the theory of [[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]] was supported by the [[Left Opposition]]. The Permanent Revolution argues that the tasks allotted in the two-stage theory to the capitalist class can only be carried out by the working class with the support of the poor peasantry, and that the working class will then pass on to the socialist tasks and expropriate the capitalist class. The revolution cannot pause here, however, and must remain "permanent" in the sense that it must seek worldwide revolution to avoid isolation and thus move towards international socialism.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">'''White's law''', named after [[Leslie White]] and published in 1943, states that, other factors remaining constant, "[[culture]] evolves as the amount of [[energy]] harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of the instrumental means of putting the energy to [[Mechanical work|work]] is increased".&lt;ref name="American Materialism"&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/material.htm American Materialism]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Earthlights dmsp 1994–1995.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Composite image of the [[Earth]] at night, created by [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]]. The brightest areas of the Earth are the most urbanized, but not necessarily the most populous. Even more than 100 years after the invention of the electric light, some regions remain thinly populated and unlit.]]
White spoke of [[culture]] as a general human phenomenon, and claimed not to speak of ‘cultures’ in the plural. His theory, published in 1959 in ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'', rekindled the interest in [[social evolutionism]] and is counted prominently among the [[neoevolutionism|neoevolutionists]]. He believed that culture – meaning the sum total of all human cultural activity on the planet – was evolving. White differentiated between three components of culture: technological, sociological and ideological, and argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution. White's materialist approach is evident in the following quote: "man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment".&lt;ref name="American Materialism" /&gt; This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White’s argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:&lt;ref name="mnsu.edu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100531202615/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/anthropology/White.html Leslie White (The United States, 1900-1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Technology is an attempt to solve the problems of survival.
# This attempt ultimately means capturing enough energy and diverting it for human needs.
# Societies that capture more energy and use it more efficiently have an advantage over other societies.
# Therefore, these different societies are more advanced in an evolutionary sense.

For White “the primary function of culture” and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to “harness and control energy.” White's law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture ([[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]). White differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula 

: &lt;math&gt; 
C = ET, 
&lt;/math&gt; 

where E is a measure of energy consumed [[per capita]] per year, T is the measure of efficiency of [[Industrialisation|technical factors utilising the energy]] and C represents the degree of cultural development. In his own words: “''the basic law of cultural evolution''” was “''culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vguXcrAyInwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Evolution of Culture: THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIZATION TO THE FALL OF ROME| isbn=9781598741445| last1=White| first1=Leslie A.| date=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore "we find that progress and development are affected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/material.htm American Materialism].&lt;/ref&gt; Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like [[technological utopians]] do, his theory treats technological factor as the most important factor in the [[evolution of society]] and is similar to the later works of [[Gerhard Lenski]], the theory of [[Kardashev scale]] of Russian astronomer, [[Nikolai Kardashev]] and to some notions of [[technological singularity]].

{{Main|Women in Algeria}}
{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women''' fulfilled a number of different functions during the '''[[Algerian War]]''' (1954–1962), [[Algeria|Algeria's]] [[Algerian War of Independence|war for independence]].  The majority of [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]] who became active participants did so on the side of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN). The [[France|French]] included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as their Algerian sisters.  The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.&lt;ref name=degroot247&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists a distinction between two different types of women who became involved: urban and rural.  Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord. Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand (the remaining eighty percent), became involved due to geographical proximity to FLN operations paired with force, although some of them did join out of compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural women combatants in the Algerian War were referred to as the mujahidat and "left their homes and families to join the FLN armed guerrilla bands, the Armée Libération Nationale (ALN)".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seferdjeli|first=Ryme|title=RETHINKING THE HISTORY OF THEMUJAHIDATDURING THE ALGERIAN WAR|url=https://www-tandfonline-com-s.acces-distant.sciences-po.fr/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369801X.2012.687902?needAccess=true|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=238–255|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2012.687902|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tended to be young, unmarried, and prepared to join the resistance "with or without the approval of their families".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The mujahidat also were "social assistants to the rural population in the zones in which they were posted and would give local female peasants advice on topics such as hygiene and education".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; They also had important political responsibilities as many of these female combatants promoted the FLN by "organizing political meetings with local women".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The urban women combatants were referred to as the fidayat and largely "engaged in paramilitary activities in the urban centres".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Roles==

Women operated in various areas during the course of the rebellion.  Meredith Turshen claims, “Women participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks.”&lt;ref&gt;Turshen, Meredith. “Algerian Women in the Liberation Struggle and the Civil War: From Active Participants to Passive Victims”. Social Research Vol. 69 No. 3 (Fall 2002) p. 889-911, p.890&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard De Groot adds, “women assisted the male fighting forces in areas like transportation, communication and administration.”&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles.  While the majority of the tasks that women undertook centered on the realm of the non-combatant, those that surrounded the limited number that took part in acts of violence were more frequently noticed. The reality was that “rural women in maquis [rural areas] support networks”&lt;ref&gt;Vince, Natalya “Transgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion and ‘Fracaises Musulmannes during Algerian War of Independence.” French Historical Studies. Vol. 33 No. 3 (Summer 2010) p. 445-474, p.445&lt;/ref&gt; contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated.  This is not to marginalize those women who did engage in acts of violence, but simply to illustrate that they constituted in the minority.

==Women combatants==

Despite the fact that destruction of civilian and military targets by women through paramilitary activities included less than seventy women, or about 2% of the total females in the military arm of the FLN,&lt;ref&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; it was these acts, especially during the [[Battle of Algiers (1957)]], which received most of the attention given to women in this conflict.

A reason for such attention was that included in the women who perpetrated direct violence against the French were Djamila Boupacha and [[Djamila Bouhired]], combatants in the Battle of Algiers.  Eventually captured, the trials of these women, specifically Bouhired, gained recognition from international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Macmaster, Neil. Burning the Veil. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009 p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason is that the violent nature of such activities, especially when carried out by women, were much more sensational than feeding and nursing FLN soldiers.

== Oral Testimonies ==
As a result of mujahidat and fidayat not having many written accounts about them, oral testimonies have been the main source in understanding the significance of women's roles in the FLN-ALN and their contributions to the Algerian War. While these important pieces of testimony give a voice to women who were often "excluded from the history and memory of the Algerian War as well as victimized in postcolonial Algeria,"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; there remain many omissions in the oral accounts of women combatants.

Some particularly difficult issues that are often excluded from oral testimonies relate to "marriages in the maquis and the FLN-ALN's control of women's sexuality in the maquis."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; As noted by scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, "In two interviews with mujahidat (Layla Ettayeb and [[Danièle Djamila Amrane-Minne|Djamila Amrane]]) who married in the maquis, they categorically refused to speak about the circumstances in which they got married; nor would they make any comment on it".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example of why testimonies of rape and torture of the women combatants in Algeria do not come to light can be seen in the story of a mujahida named [[Louisette Ighilahriz]]. When Ighilahriz "published her story admitting to having been tortured and raped during the Algerian War, she received little support from other mujahidat."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This can be accounted for by the fact that revealing such violence, especially of a sexual nature, is considered a taboo and reliving such trauma can be extremely difficult for survivors of sexual violence.

Therefore, few women combatants are prepared to publicly admit personal stories of the torture and rape that took place during the war. Further, by revealing accounts of sexual violence and subjugation during the war, mujahidat would be seen as victimized women rather than courageous fighters who were absolute members of the ALN.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  During and after the war, the FLN rhetoric was very much focused on spreading a heroic image of the mujahidat, "in order to achieve public recognition"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and as a form of revolutionary propaganda, which may have influenced the oral testimonies of the mujahidat. In an interview with an unnamed mujahida she acknowledged that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is difficult to write history. There are things we will never be able to tell. I have to admit that I would have difficulties in invoking certain points or details."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In another interview with a mujahida named Houria, when the interviewer and historian Chérifa Bouatta, "asked about the nature of the affective and sexual relationships" with Houria's first husband, she immediately answered, "No, we don't talk about that."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Covert operations==

In addition to general support tasks, women possessed gender-specific abilities that allowed them to carry out clandestine tasks that would have proved difficult for men.  Though women used these capabilities in both the urban and rural arenas of the war, it was the nature of the urban dimension of the war that contained the highest concentration, both in number and frequency, of covert activities by females.  The best documented example of this is in the Battle of Algiers.  In this battle male FLN operatives, driven underground by the French, stayed out of the public realm, avoiding detention and interrogation, while the women who helped to keep them hidden were able to move about freely and smuggle weapons and other sensitive materials as a result of their manipulation of personal appearance.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;  The manner in which women did this was twofold; first by the religious practice of wearing the veil, which the French saw as above suspicion, or, adopting a European appearance seeming to demonstrate their adherence to French values and way of life.&lt;ref name=degroot247/&gt; Women like Djamila Bouhired, due to the incapacitation of men, were also charged with carrying out terrorist attacks ordered by FLN leadership and did so by again using changes in dress to their advantage.

The desire to pull off the veil by the French manifested because the Algerian woman was a target of French male lust.&lt;ref name="Alessandrini2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony C.

==FLN and women==
"Some historians argue that the leaders and male combatants generally accepted the presence of women in the maquis, seeing them as sisters in combat. Others claim that they were on the whole hostile to the presence of women in military units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;"

Externally the FLN pursued policies that highlighted women in the Algerian War. ''[[El Moudjahid]]'', a publication of the FLN, sought to create the ‘myth’ of the female warrior and to idolize her as a martyr and linchpin in the war.&lt;ref name="lazreg130"&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Articles published, including contributions by women to a series ‘Diary of a Guerilla’, cast the female in a heroic light highlighting her bravery and contributions to the war effort.  The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]] also lent themselves to FLN propaganda because he championed the idea that by simply participating in the war women were engaging in an act of liberation.&lt;ref name="degroot244"&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN was then able to formulate a motivation for women based on an “abstract notion of ‘freedom’” linked with strong nationalism as opposed to a goal of social progress,&lt;ref name="lazreg130" /&gt; avoiding the need to engage in a discussion of women’s issues because they equated it to freedom from colonial rule.  Publicly, the FLN identified the contributions of women, but avoided promising specific rewards as a result.&lt;ref name="degroot244" /&gt;

Internally FLN attitudes towards women are described in a statement by an FLN commander Si Allal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“it is forbidden to recruit djoundiates [female soldiers] and nurses without the zone’s authorization.  In independent Algeria, the Muslim woman’s freedom stops at the door of her home. Woman will never be equal to man” &lt;ref&gt;Vince, Natalya “Transgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion and ‘Fracaises Musulmannes during Algerian War of Independence.” French Historical Studies. Vol. 33 No. 3 (Summer 2010) p. 445-474, p.467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There existed obstacles precluding the involvement of women, including desire by some men to not subject women to any additional danger outside of the significant risks of simply living in Algeria at this time; the dramatic change, which many FLN members were not convinced could occur, that would be required of women going from secluded home life to active participation;&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Barbara The Political Roles of Islamic Women: A Study of Two Revolutions - Algeria and Iran. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1987 p. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; and a general lack of trust in women, especially their ability to keep FLN secrets if captured.&lt;ref&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entry into the resistance there were additional requirements as well, an investigation of adultery that carried a penalty of death,&lt;ref&gt;Vince, Natalya “Transgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion and ‘Fracaises Musulmannes during Algerian War of Independence.” French Historical Studies. Vol. 33 No. 3 (Summer 2010) p. 445-474, p.464&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible test of her virginity.  The involvement of women, especially those who were literate and had proactive tendencies, sometimes made their often-illiterate male counterparts uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Macmaster, Neil. Burning the Veil. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009 p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this and other factors the FLN enacted a deportation to surrounding countries of these progressive female elements, a large percentage of which were removed from Algeria by 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Macmaster, Neil. Burning the Veil. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009 p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, "Women have been reluctant to address the question of marriages in the maquis".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While marriages did occur during the war, whether or not marriages were ever forced has not been entirely determined. Many interviewed women combatants were evasive in regards to the topic of marriage within the maquis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further, within "a few wilayat the FLN strongly encouraged mujahidat to marry"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and many mujahidat "who joined the ALN during the war ended up marrying"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the male combatants in the maquis. The ALN "authorized or forbade marriages"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; depending on the wilaya and if at the time the ALN found marriages to be problematic or beneficial.

Historian and former combatant Djamila Minne, who interviewed many former women combatants, explains that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Beyond those feelings of suspicion and hostility, or admiration and glorification, deep bonds of affection were established, which were the result of long periods spent together and dangers faced together. During the interviews, it struck me that out of 47 women militants who married during or after the war, 38 are married with men militants. Now, for a fighter, to get married with a women fighter is the best proof of accepting the fight she engaged in and of esteem for what she has been".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==France and women==

By 1957, largely through torture of captured women, the French came to acknowledge the different roles played by female FLN members including their terrorist actions.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Barbara The Political Roles of Islamic Women: A Study of Two Revolutions - Algeria and Iran. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1987 p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Around this time the French initiated a campaign of ‘emancipation’ directed at Muslim women that sought to draw them away from the FLN.  This included the Plan de Constantine aimed at increasing female education,&lt;ref&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Ordonnance 59-274 giving women more say in their marital status, public unveiling of female Algerians by French women,&lt;ref&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; extension of the vote to women in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Todd. The Invention of Decolonization. Sage House: Cornell University Press, 2006 p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; and the symbolic installation of Muslim women in public office,&lt;ref&gt;Vince, Natalya “Transgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion and ‘Fracaises Musulmannes during Algerian War of Independence.” French Historical Studies. Vol. 33 No. 3 (Summer 2010) p. 445-474, p.452&lt;/ref&gt; among others.  Unfortunately for the French this campaign, while it did have some successes, was largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Seferdjeli, Ryme. “French ‘Reforms’ and Muslim Women’s Emancipation During the Algerian War”. Journal of North African Studies. Vol. 9 No.4 (Winter 2004) p. 19-61 p. 19-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==After war==

Women in Algeria, regardless of their involvement and contributions to the conflict, nevertheless remained in their pre-war subservient position afterward as a result of the prevailing societal, religious, and cultural conditions.&lt;ref name="SjobergGentry2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Laura Sjoberg|author2=Caron E.

[[Image:Gypsy-Cove.jpg|thumb|250px|Penguins at Gypsy Cove in Yorke Bay]]
[[Image:Malouines-Est.jpg|thumb|250px|Early mapping of Yorke Bay (Dom Pernety, 1769)]]

'''Yorke Bay''' is a bay on [[East Falkland]] in the [[Falkland Islands]]. It is located half a mile north of [[Port Stanley Airport]], four miles to the northeast of the [[capital city]] of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], on a peninsula connected to the mainland by the Boxer Bridge and a narrow [[isthmus]] known as "The Neck". Gypsy Cove is a smaller bay located on the west side of Yorke Bay. Most cruise ships pass Yorke Bay and Gypsy Cove on the way to dock in [[Stanley Harbour]]. It faces northwards into [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]], with [[Canopus Hill]] to the south, and is known internationally as a breeding site for the threatened [[Magellanic penguin]].

==Minefields==
[[Image:Blanco Bay.png|thumb|350px|left|Map of the Stanley area, showing Yorke Bay and Gypsy Cove]]
Because of Yorke Bay's strategic position as one of only three bays close to both Stanley and the airport with beaches capable of supporting an expected [[amphibious landing]] on the east coast of East Falkland (the others being Surf Bay and Rookery Bay due east of Stanley), Yorke Bay beach was heavily mined with hundreds of anti-personnel and anti-tank [[minimum metal mine]]s during the [[Falklands War|1982 Argentine occupation of the Falkland Islands]]. The British forces eventually marched on Stanley from the landward side to the west instead, but the minefields around the airport remained and were never removed.&lt;ref&gt;Falkland Islands Navigational Charts &amp; Minefield Map; pg. 15-16, 2011 Harbor Info Brochure. http://www.falklandislands.com/shopimages/imagelibrary/pdfs/harbour-info-basic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the war, Yorke Bay was a popular summer swimming and recreation site for local residents, but the entire northern coast of the Port Stanley Airport peninsula (including Yorke Bay) have been fenced and marked as strictly off-limits since a tractor and bulldozer were destroyed by an anti-tank mine while attempting to lay a pipeline in the area in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;CNN. "Penguins Stay Snug and Secure in Minefield". Sep 27, 2005. Reprinted at http://www.npboards.com/index.php?p=/discussion/4735/penguins-stay-snug-and-secure-in-minefield&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cranfield University]] assessment dismissing the feasibility of [[demining]] Yorke Bay noted that the [[sand dunes]] had expanded considerably since 1982, burying the mines too deeply for advanced detection equipment and disrupting the orderly lines in which they were originally laid. At the same time, however, any large storm could potentially cause large numbers of mines to suddenly resurface. To recover them all would thus require mass excavation of the entire beach area with armored digging equipment, a task that would be expensive, dangerous, unlikely to definitively succeed, and certain to do severe damage to the "internationally important" Magellanic penguin rookeries.&lt;ref&gt;field survey report, Cranfield University, 9 July 2007. pg. 44, 101. {{cite web|url=http://www.apminebanconvention.org/fileadmin/pdf/mbc/MSP/8MSP/day1/8MSP-Item10-18Nov2007-Cranfield-IV-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222034513/http://www.apminebanconvention.org/fileadmin/pdf/mbc/MSP/8MSP/day1/8MSP-Item10-18Nov2007-Cranfield-IV-en.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents and officials have also expressed opposition to the idea: [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Falklands Governor]] [[Howard Pearce]] stated that the high probability that "only 95 percent" of the mines would end up being accounted for would actually "bring a sense of complacency to the community and increase rather than reduce the chance of injury."&lt;ref&gt;CNN. "Penguins Stay Snug and Secure in Minefield". Sep 27, 2005. Reprinted at http://www.npboards.com/index.php?p=/discussion/4735/penguins-stay-snug-and-secure-in-minefield&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the bay is likely to remain permanently impassable for humans; on the positive side, the penguins have benefited from their undisturbed control of the beaches (being too small and too light to set off the mines), resulting in an unplanned, man-made [[wildlife refuge]] where tourists can view the penguins safely from a distance without disrupting their habitat.

'''Yusuf ibn al-Sayrafi''' (died c. 557/1161) was a historian from [[Al-Andalus]], and secretary of the [[Almoravid]] sultan [[Tashfin ibn Ali]] (1143–45).

al-Sayrafi was born in [[Granada]].  He wrote a chronicle on the Almoravids, ''Al-Anwar al-Jalliya fi akhbar al-dawla al-Murabitiyya'' in which he dealt with the history of al-Andalus and the Maghreb in general and of his native Granada. Almost nothing of this work has survived, but it is quoted by other historians such as [[Ibn al-Khatib]] and [[ibn Idhari]] (especially in his ''al-Ihata fi akhbar gharnata'').&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Messier, ''The Almoravids and the Meanings of Jihad'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Regierung und Verwaltung des vorderen Orients in islamischer Zeit'', Brill, 1988, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;
