'''Alastair Charles Ralphs''' (born May 22, 1977) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and former [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''A-1''' (alternatively spelled '''A1''' or '''A-One'''). He is best known for his appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2004 to 2007 as part of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]].

==Early life==
Ralphs was born in [[Placentia Bay]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and relocated to [[Dunnville, Ontario|Dunnville]], [[Ontario]] at the age of five. He later moved to [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] to attend the [[University of Windsor]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Border City Wrestling (2001–2005)===
Alastair Ralphs was trained by [[Scott D'Amore]] in the Can-Am Wrestling School, and debuted in D'Amore's [[Border City Wrestling]] promotion in 2001. After spending three years as an [[job (professional wrestling)|undercard talent]], Ralphs became A-1, a cocky, arrogant [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], forming an alliance with [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]]. He defeated [[D'Lo Brown]] for the BCW Heavyweight Championship on December 12, 2004, in [[Belleville, Michigan]] at "[[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu]]".

On January 23, 2005, at New Year's Revolution, Ralphs interrupted the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, complaining that he was being overshadowed by older wrestlers. Scott D'Amore responded with a jibe aimed at Ralph's previous career as a [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], leading to a brawl between Ralphs and D'Amore. Following a distraction from Jade, A-1 was able to powerbomb D'Amore through a table. Ralphs went on to retain the heavyweight title in a match with [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]], using Abyss's own chain to knock him unconscious.

Ralphs lost the BCW Heavyweight Championship to [[Bobby Roode]] on July 22, 2005. In the course of his reign as champion he faced well-known veterans such as [[Jim Neidhart]] and [[King Kong Bundy]].

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2007)===
On July 16, 2004, Ralphs appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], losing to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. He reappeared on March 13, 2005 as a member of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]], replacing the injured [[Johnny Devine]] at [[Destination X (2005)|Destination X 2005]] and teaming with Bobby Roode, [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] and [[Petey Williams]] to face [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]], [[James Storm]], [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]] and [[Konnan]]. He wrestled on [[TNA Impact!]] throughout April and May 2005, [[tag team|teaming]] with other members of Team Canada or accompanying them to the ring. At [[TNA Hard Justice|Hard Justice]] on May 15, Ralphs took part in the [[Gauntlet for the Gold]]. He entered at number six and was eliminated by [[Monty Sopp|The Outlaw]] and B.G. James. On the May 11, 2006, episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', [[Larry Zbyszko]] asked Team Canada coach [[Scott D'Amore]] for assistance in his feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. D'Amore eventually agreed to help Zbyszko rid TNA of Raven, and nominated A-1 to face Raven in a match at [[TNA Sacrifice#2006|TNA Sacrifice 2006]] in May 2006, a match that A-1 lost. On the June 29, 2006, episode of ''Impact!'', TNA Management Director [[Jim Cornette]] disbanded Team Canada.

A-1 soon began wrestling sporadically, facing Ron Killings in the pre-show of the Hard Justice pay-per-view and against Eric Young at the No Surrender pay-per-view, losing both times. He also took part in the Kevin Nash Open Invitational X-Division Gauntlet Battle Royal at Bound For Glory, despite not being a part of the X-Division. He was eliminated by both [[Matt Bentley|Maverick Matt]] and [[Frankie Kazarian|Kazarian]].

A-1 was released by TNA in February 2007.

===Independent circuit (2007–present)===
Since leaving TNA, A-1 has wrestled on the independent circuit in Canada and the United States.

At [[Impact One Night Only]]: Canadian Clash in February 2018, A-1 returned to [[Impact Wrestling]] for the first time in over 11 years, unsuccessfully challenging [[Eli Drake]] for the [[Impact Global Championship]]. He returned to Impact Wrestling once again at the following month's One Night Only: March Breakdown PPV, where he teamed with [[Allie (wrestler)|Allie]] in a victory over [[Braxton Sutter]] and KC Spinelli. He is also currently a member of the [[Border City Wrestling]] roster.

'''Amir Hossein Khozeimé-Alam''' (c. 1919 – 2002) was the eldest son of Amir Ma'soum Khan Khozeiméh (Hessamodolleh III), the last ruling [[Amir]] of Qaenat and [[Sistan]], in what is now south-eastern [[Iran]]. He was a cousin of Amir [[Asadollah Alam]] and was married to Fatemé Alam, the eldest daughter of Amir Ebrahim Alam (Shokat ol-molk II), who was also his great-uncle. 

Subsequently, he became Under-secretary for Agriculture in [[Tehran]].

'''Animal attacks''' are a cause of human injuries and [[Death|fatalities]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|title=Animal bites|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to five million people in the U.S. are attacked by cats and dogs each year.&lt;ref name="yep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/animal-bites-beyond-the-basics|title=Patient education: Animal bites (Beyond the Basics)|publisher=UpToDate|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of animal attacks varies with [[geographical]] location. In the United States, a person is more likely to be killed by a domesticated dog than they are to die from being [[lightning strike|hit by lightning]] according to the [[National Safety Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Injury Facts Chart | publisher=National Safety Council| url = http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx
| accessdate = 2015-04-09
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal attacks have been identified as a major [[public health]] problem. "Unprovoked attacks occur when the animal approaches and attacks a person(s) who is the principle attractant, for example, predation on humans..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Angelici | first = Francesco | title = Problematic wildlife : a cross-disciplinary approach | publisher = Springer | location = Cham | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-319-22246-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WHObites&gt;{{cite web | publisher = World Health Organization | title =  Animal bites |date = February 2013 | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/| accessdate = 2017-02-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, it was estimated that up to 2 million [[animal bites]] occur each year in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Injuries caused by animal attacks result in thousands of [[death|fatalities]] worldwide every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warrell|first1=D.A.|title= Venomous bites and stings in the tropical world|journal=Med J Aust|date=1993|volume=159|issue=11–12|pages=773–779|pmid=8264466}}&lt;/ref&gt; All causes of death are reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] each year. Medical injury codes are used to identify specific cases.&lt;ref name=Langley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langley|first1=Ricky L.|last2=Morrow|first2=William E.|title=Deaths resulting from animal attacks in the United States|journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine|date=1997|volume=8|issue=1|pages=8–16|pmid=11990139|doi=10.1580/1080-6032(1997)008[0008:drfaai]2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] uses identical coding, though it is unclear whether all countries keep track of fatalities caused by animals.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Though animals, excluding some tigers, do not regularly hunt humans, there is concern that these incidents are " ...bad for many species 'public image'.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-animals-like-to-eat-humans |title=What animals like to eat humans? |publisher=Quora |date= |accessdate=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some pets will feed on people if they die, are sick or unconscious, this is not characterized as an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashaumer/cats-eat-your-face-after-you-die |title=Horrifying Stories Of Animals Eating Their Owners |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date=2015-01-08 |accessdate=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Injuries and infections ==
Bite injuries are often the consequences of an animal attack, including those instances when a human attacks another human. Human bites are the third most frequent type of bite after dog and cat bites.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases&amp;nbsp;– Animal and Human Bites, Morven S. Edwards  | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4557-1177-2|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog bites]] are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html |title= Dog Bite Statistics |author= Kenneth M. Phillips |date= 2009-12-27 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, amputation was required in one third of cases in which treatment was delayed for 24 hours or longer.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014 /&gt;

== Epidemiology and treatment ==
Animal bites are the most common form of injury from animal attacks. The US estimated annual count of animal bites is 250,000 human bites, 1 to 2 million dog bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 45,000 bites from snakes. Bites from skunks, horses, squirrels, rats, rabbits, pigs, and monkeys may be up to 1 percent of bite injuries. Pet ferrets attacks that were unprovoked have caused serious facial injuries. Non-domesticated animals, though assumed to be more common especially as a cause of rabies infection, make up less than one percent of reported bite wounds. When a person is bitten, it is more likely to occur on the right arm, most likely due to defensive reactions when the victims uses her or his dominant arm. Estimates are that three quarters of bites are located on the arms or legs of humans. Bites to the face of humans constitutes only 10 percent of the total. Two thirds of bite injuries in humans are suffered by children aged ten and younger. The subsequent treatment for those who have been attacked (if they survive) depends on the injuries. Though trauma may be addressed first, subsequent infections are also treated with appropriate antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014 /&gt;

Up to three fourths of dog bites happen to those younger than 20 years-old. In the United States, the costs associated with dog bites are estimated to be more than $1 billion annually. The age groups that suffer most from dog bites are children 5 to 9 years-old. Often, bites go unreported and no medical treatment given. As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal bites. This is more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog bites are then admitted to the hospital. Bites typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Girls are bitten more frequently by cats than they are by dogs. Boys are bitten by dogs two times more often than girls.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014 /&gt;

== Medical codes for animal attacks ==
Injuries resulting from encounters with animals occur with sufficient frequency to require the use of [[medical codes]] by clinicians and [[insurance company|insurance companies]] to document such encounters. The [[ICD-10-CM]] Diagnosis Codes are used for the purpose of clearly identifying [[disease]]s, their causes, [[injury|injuries]] in the United States. [[Clinician]]s use these codes to quantify the medical condition and its causes and to bill insurance companies for the treatment required as a result of encounters with animals.

== African buffalo ==
In the early 1990s one African village suffered at least one human death and more than one attack from buffalo in the area of their village. The attacks stopped after a fence was built around the village to protect it.&lt;ref&gt;"Outcomes of a Community Controlled Wildlife Utilization Program in a Zambezi Valley Community", Gordon Edwin Matzke and Nontokozo Nabane; Human Ecology, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Mar., 1996), pp. 65-85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arthropods ==

[[Bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[scorpion]]s and other stinging or biting [[arthropod]]s cause human fatalities but these are not as often characterized as 'attacks'. It may be difficult to characterize some of these encounters as offensive or defensive. An arthropod 'attack' instead of causing tissue [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] such as cutting, lacerating, crushing or the severing of body parts may instead cause a [[physiological]] reaction that results in human death. These effects are [[toxic]] effects and [[allergic]] effects.

Listing deaths due stings and allergic reactions from arthropods is not practical but some of the more unusual cases include:

=== Ants ===
In 2006 a 68-year-old [[South Carolina]] woman died after being attacked by [[fire ants]] while gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beware of the Bugs: Fire Ants Can Kill Americans|publisher=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Health/story?id=2143091|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents in nursing homes have been attacked.&lt;ref&gt;deShazo RD, Kemp SF, deShazo MD, Goddard J. (2004) Fire ant attacks on patients in nursing homes: an increasing problem. Am J Med. 116(12):843-6. {{PMID|15178500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scorpions ===
{{Main|Scorpion sting}}
Although about 2000 species exist, only about 25-40 species can deliver enough venom to cause serious or lethal damage to humans. One of the more venomous or potentially dangerous species, especially for infants, young children, and the elderly in the United States is Centruroides exilicauda or bark scorpion. Most scorpion stings vary from small swelling to medically significant lesions in severity, with only a few able to cause severe allergic, neurotic or necrotic reactions. Only two species of scorpions can inflict stings which result in death of normal healthy humans: the Israeli deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and the Brazilian yellow scorpion (Tityus serrulatus).

=== [[Grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear]]s ===
{{Main|List of fatal bear attacks in North America}}

=== Polar bears ===
Polar bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, as humans generally do not live near their habitats.  Polar bear attacks can happen in captivity like [[Binky (polar bear)|Binky]] at the [[Alaska Zoo]] when he mauled an Australian tourist Kathryn Warburton when she jumped over two safety rails to get a close-up photograph of Binky in his enclosure but stuck his head through the bars and grabbed her and she suffered a broken leg and bite wounds. Six weeks later, Binky was involved in another mauling. Drunken local teenagers approached the bear's enclosure, apparently hoping to swim in its pool, and one 19-year-old was hospitalized with leg lacerations after he was mauled.

== Birds ==

=== Cassowaries ===
When a cassowary attacks, it will charge and kick and even jump on top of the person. Cassowaries are described as being able to use their legs to kick in a forward and downward motion. They are also able to head-butt and charge. The most common injuries that are sustained by those who are attacked consist of puncture wounds, lacerations and bone fractures. The severity of the injuries are increased if someone is crouching or lying flat. The large birds will attack dogs and cats. Dogs attack cassowaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/how-dangerous-are-cassowaries-really/ |title=How Dangerous Are Cassowaries, Really? - Scientific American Blog Network |publisher=Blogs.scientificamerican.com |date=2016-06-08 |accessdate=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kofron1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kofron|first1=Christopher P.|title=Attacks to humans and domestic animals by the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius johnsonii) in Queensland, Australia|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=249|issue=4|year=1999|pages=375–381|issn=0952-8369|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1999.tb01206.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jzo.1999.249.issue-4/issuetoc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogs ===
{{Main|Dog bite}}{{See|Dog bite prevention}}
Larger dogs are responsible for most animal bites overall and are the most common type of dog that bites with a fatal outcome. In the United States, there are 10 to 20 fatal human attacks annually. Not one breed is responsible for most of the bites, but at least 25 breeds of dogs were identified in the 238 fatalities in the past 25 years.

Most of the time, the victim is known by the owner of the dog. On fewer occasions, the bites suffered by the victim are from their own dog. Only about ten percent of dog bites are from strays.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014 /&gt; The National Health and Human Services agency in the United States reports that 9.9% of deaths caused by animals were from dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Alligators]] ===
{{Main|List of fatal alligator attacks in the United States by decade}}
Alligators are capable of killing humans but fatal attacks are fairly rare and uncommon. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection. As human populations increase, and as they build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, incidents are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians in less than a week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970. In contrast, alligator attacks are rare because they target prey animals that are smaller than adult humans. Their normal prey includes fish, birds, other reptiles and small mammals. Unfortunately, children are about the same size as these animals, so they can become targets.

*On July 24, 1976 at [[Kings Island]], a lion mauled a 20-year-old park employee to death. His body was found 15 to 20 feet from his vehicle, which was protected by iron bars, in a section of the park's 1000-acre wildlife preserve where about 50 lions lived. The ranger had a history of violating park rules. Investigators believed the ranger left the vehicle to relieve himself.
*On May 26, 1982 at Kings Island, a lion attacked a 34-year-old park employee who was cleaning in the area. After climbing to a rooftop, he was rescued and taken to a hospital where he was treated for a punctured trachea and other cuts.

== Primates ==
Some studies cite encroachment as the cause of attacks by primates resulting in injuries and deaths to humans. Many African states offer government sponsored insurance programs that will dispense payments to those who are attacked (unprovoked) or killed by large primates. In some instances "...local people feel that the needs or values of wildlife are given priority over their own needs..." Gorillas often raid the crops of some villages. Villagers are sometimes hurt or killed defending their crops against gorillas. Women and children are more likely to be attacked by a raiding gorilla than men.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03725.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic animals are also attacked by gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/ssc-op-037.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===

Two game rangers fired warning shots at the rhinoceros while the tourists hid in a dense bush. Both of the Crozier brothers had severe wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/rogue-rhino-attacks-brothers-in-game-reserve-105857|title=Rogue rhino attacks brothers in game reserve – IOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosrhino.org/news/rhinonews/rhinonews050803.php]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seals and sea lions ==
{{see also|Walrus attack}}
Seal and sea lion attacks are rare on humans, but coming to close to them can be very unsafe. Many seals and sea lions attack to protect themselves or their young because they feel threatened even if the humans around them have no intention of harming them. Human presence and human recreational activities can cause sea lions to engage in violent and aggressive actions. When humans come closer than 15 meters of a sea lion, the sea lions' vigilance increases because of the disturbance of humans. These disturbances can potentially cause sea lions to have psychological stress responses that cause the sea lions to retreat, sometimes even abandon their locations, and decreases the amount of time sea lions spend hauling out.

* 1985 – Gareth Wood was bitten twice on his leg by a leopard seal.
* 2003 – Kirsty Brown was dragged underwater by a leopard seal.
* 2007 – a sea lion attacks a 13-year-old-girl surfing behind a speedboat in Australia. The sea lion appeared to be preparing for a second attack when the girl was rescued. An Australian marine biologist suggested that the sea lion may have viewed the girl "like a rag doll toy" to be played with.
* 2015 – a sea lion attacks a 62-year-old man who was boating with his wife in San Diego. The attack left the man with a punctured bone.
* 2017 – a sea lion dragged a small girl by her dress into the water while she was sitting on a pier side around the time tourists in British Columbia were illegally feeding the sea lions. She was pulled out of the water with minor injuries and received antibiotic prophylactic treatment for seal finger infection from the superficial bite injury.

== Snakes ==
{{further|List of fatal snake bites in the United States}}

The World Health Organization has determined that up to five million people get bitten by snakes yearly with 94,000 to 125,000 deaths. Other consequences include infection, tetanus, scarring, psychoses, and 400,000 amputations. Other severe health consequences occur such as infection, tetanus, scarring, contractures, and psychological sequelae. Snake bites occur most frequently in South-East Asia and Africa among those who live in less affluent areas, farming communities.&lt;ref name= WHObites /&gt; The National Health and Human Services agency in the United States reported 66 fatalities between 1979 and 1990 from snakes.&lt;ref name="Langley, p.9"&gt;Langley, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Stingray injuries are caused by the [[venom]]ous tail spines, stingers or [[dermal denticle]]s of [[Batoidea|rays]] in the order [[Myliobatiformes]], most significantly those belonging to the families [[Dasyatidae]], [[Urotrygonidae]], [[Urolophidae]], and [[Potamotrygonidae]]. [[Stingray]]s generally do not attack aggressively or even actively defend themselves. When threatened, their primary reaction is to swim away. However, when attacked by predators or stepped on, the stinger in their tail is whipped up. This is normally ineffective against [[shark]]s, their main [[predator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.caribbeanmag.com/search/articles/Cayman_Islands/Stingray_city___diving___snorkeling_grand_cayman.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008050907/http://www.caribbeanmag.com/search/articles/Cayman_Islands/Stingray_city___diving___snorkeling_grand_cayman.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-10-08 | title = About Stingrays | publisher = Caribbean Magazine}}{{rs|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the size of the stingray, humans are usually stung in the lower limb region.&lt;ref name="eMedicine Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stingray Injury|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/stingray_injury/article_em.htm|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=23 July 2012|author=DuBois, David MD, MS, FAAEM, FACEP|year=2012|quote="People who step on a stingray most frequently are injured on their feet and lower legs."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stings usually occur when swimmers or divers accidentally step on a stingray,&lt;ref name="Slaughter"/&gt; but a human is less likely to be stung by simply brushing against the stinger. Surfers and those who enter waters with large populations of stingrays have learned to slide their feet through the sand rather than taking steps, as the rays detect this and swim away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/round_stingray|title=Round Stingray (Round Ray)|last=Pacific|first=Aquarium of the|date=|website=www.aquariumofpacific.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests.

The '''Bakri Balloon''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cookmedical.com/wh/dataSheet.do?id=4487&lt;/ref&gt; is a medical device invented by Younes Bakri, an obstetrician-gynecologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakri|first=Younes|date=|year=1999|title=Balloon device for control of obstetrical bleeding.|url=|journal=Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol|volume=86.12: S84.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/3|title=UpToDate|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufactured by Cook Medical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=421700382&amp;targetid=profile&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstetrical balloon is a 24 [[French catheter scale|French]], 54 cm-long, silicone catheter with a filling capacity of 500 mL. The device is used for the temporary control and reduction of [[postpartum hemorrhage]] (PPH).

The '''Brain''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]] commonly as a frequent enemy of the [[Doom Patrol]].  He is a [[France|French]] mastermind and criminal genius.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Brain | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 60  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Brain first appeared in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' #86 and was created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Bruno Premiani]]. Drake later commented, "I used that same concept in a [[The Adventures of Jerry Lewis|Jerry Lewis comic book]], and in a [[The Adventures of Bob Hope|Bob Hope comic]] I had a [[totem pole]] that talked to him. Often times, I wrote the same storylines for the comedy stuff that I wrote for the serious stuff. I just turned it on its head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browning|first=Michael|title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Arnold Drake|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |page=41|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
As a scientist, the Brain performs experiments on animals to raise their intelligence. One of these is on a gorilla, who he names [[Monsieur Mallah]] and educates for almost a decade before making him his personal assistant. His colleague, [[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]] grows jealous of his work and arranges for the Brain to get caught in an explosion, which destroys his body. Only the brain survives, which Caulder plans on putting into a robotic body. Mallah rescues the Brain, transferring him to a computer network that keeps him functioning.

The Brain and Mallah form the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] in hopes of conquering the world and getting revenge on Caulder. Caulder, now known as the "Chief", through a series of other accidents that he manipulated, forms the Doom Patrol. (Caulder's involvement in the events which transformed the Doom Patrol, and the Brain, was a [[retcon]] decades after the creation of the Doom Patrol and the Brain; originally the incidents were genuine accidents.) The Brain, Mallah, and their Brotherhood's criminal activities also pit them against the [[Teen Titans]]. The Brotherhood go against the newly formed Justice League, with the Brain using a genetic splicer to take the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]'s legs, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]]'s [[Power ring (DC Comics)|ring]], [[Black Canary (comics)|Black Canary]]'s vocal chords, and the [[Martian Manhunter]]'s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Year One'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; The Brain is defeated by the League and the Doom Patrol, the League using cybernetic implants created by Niles Caulder to compensate for their lost powers. [[Aquaman]] is thrown to the Brain, overpowers his control of the ring, and separates the Brain from his makeshift body.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Year One'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Grant Morrison]]'s Doom Patrol run, Mallah places the Brain in Robotman's new body (Robotman's brain had been removed from it due to it malfunctioning). In his new body, the Brain confesses to Mallah he is in love with him. When Mallah reveals he feels the same way, the two kiss. However, Robotman's body, having developed sentience and vowed never to be enslaved by a brain again, triggers a self-destruct mechanism, and explodes as they kiss.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

The two later resurface (the Brain back to floating in a jar), with no explanation of how they survived the explosion. The Brotherhood begin raiding genetic research facilities to unlock the secrets of cloning and create a new body for the Brain, so he and Monsieur Mallah can resume their romance.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #34 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #35 (June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #36 (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After a short while the Brain's new clone body begins to break down, so he has Mallah rip off his head and put his brain back into another jar.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #37 (August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' storyline, Brain and Monsieur Mallah appear amongst the villains that were sent to the planet Cygnus 4019. An altercation between Monsieur Mallah and [[Gorilla Grodd]] ends with Grodd beating Monsieur Mallah to death with Brain's chassis, also killing Brain in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation Run'' #1-7 (January–July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In an alternate future of this new timeline, Brain and Monsieur Mallah assist Gorilla Grodd in taking over the remains of Central City at the time when The Black had taken over most of the world. They capture [[Animal Man]] and the heroes that are with him. Animal Man's group is saved by [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] and his Patchwork Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Man'' Vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt;
He appears in [[DC Rebirth]] Titans.

==Powers and abilities==
One of the most formidable villains ever encountered by the Doom Patrol, or even in DC Comics, The Brain is more of a cerebral opponent but all the more dangerous for it. A former polymath, The Brain has a genius level IQ which he puts to use as a criminal mastermind and is more than capable of plotting out perfect crimes. The Brain is completely single-minded, and motivated almost entirely towards domination of others, the committing of even more perfect crimes, and ultimate revenge against Niles Caulder.

Adept in psychology, he is also a master of coercion, deceit and manipulation, being able to persuade almost anybody to do his dirty work for him, even to the point where his agents are under the illusion that they are not actually committing evil or immoral acts. This has however on occasion been hinted to be a result of mind control by the use of telepathy on the part of The Brain. It was through these vast cerebral abilities that The Brain was able to unite various villains under his leadership, and form the Brotherhood of Evil.

Although others often act as brawn to his brain, most notably his assistant–partner Monsieur Mallah, The Brain has occasionally used agile robotic bodies to give him mobility. The different contraptions which have been seen to hold his brain were designed by The Brain himself (also a master in biology and robotics) and have proved time and time again to be durable and even nigh-indestructible. On the rare occasion when The Brain has been caught vulnerable without robotic protection or assistance from other villains, he has protected himself by attacking opponents through telekinesis.

Except for the times when he has possessed robot bodies as mentioned above, the Brain is normally portrayed as an ordinary human brain, albeit housed within what could be described as a life-sized chess piece which contains the equipment required to keep him alive; it is this portrayal that was adapted in the animated versions of the Brain as mentioned in this article. In the original Doom Patrol series, he was regularly portrayed as a disembodied brain, bobbing inside a sealed dome filled with a nutrient bath, hooked up with numerous machines, including a loudspeaker to convey his voice.

During a confrontation with the newly-formed Justice League and the Doom Patrol, the Brain used genetics equipment provided by the mysterious Locus organization to 'steal' the Martian Manhunter's eyes, Black Canary's vocal chords, the Flash's legs and Green Lantern's right arm, granting him access to the Manhunter's vision abilities, Canary's sonic scream, the Flash's speed, and Green Lantern's power ring. However, during this time he was only ever shown using the ring, and was caught off-guard by its vulnerability to yellow, with Aquaman eventually managing to overpower the Brain's will and use the ring to sever him from his makeshift body.

==Other characters named Brain==
DC Comics previously had another villain named the Brain during the Golden Age of Comics. He was an ordinary criminal who earned his nickname for his cleverness, and was not literally just a brain. He alongside [[Captain Bigg]], [[Hopper (comics)|Hopper]], False-Face and [[Rattler (DC Comics)|Rattler]] were one of five small-time villains hired by [[Black Star (comics)|Black Star]] to commit a bank robbery. They were all foiled by the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Leading Comics]]'' #2 (Spring 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Smallville===
In [[Smallville season 11]], The Brain appears on the back of Monsieur Mallah, robbing the [[Musée du Louvre]]. They are both taken down by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Superman]], and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]. In this version, Brain and Mallah are revealed to be lovers.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Brain appears as the main antagonist of the fifth and final season of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]] in a computer-altered voice. His appearance is very similar to a [[Dalek]], major antagonists in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series [[Doctor Who]], and indeed the producers of Teen Titans mentioned the British show in interviews about Season Five. When interviewed at the unofficial [[Transformers]] convention TFCon, [[Derrick J. Wyatt]] stated that the Brain was a "Total Dalek", claiming that he even talked like one, and the resemblance was intentional. Like Mallah, his sexuality was not mentioned due to the targeted young audience. Considered the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], he (like his comic counterpart) is a [[brain]] preserved in a robotic jar. The Brain seems to do very little during the series, and acts behind the scenes coordinating the villain attacks. When he appears in his secret base, he is frequently seen playing [[chess]] with Mallah and comparing it to the game of wits he considers himself to be playing against [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the rare instances where he himself fights, he appears to possess limited telekinetic and telepathic abilities. He is otherwise defenseless and an easy target several times in the series, not even able to defend against a slap on the back from [[Beast Boy]]. As a result of his defenselessness from a physical standpoint, he relies almost entirely on his evil subordinates to carry out his plans. With himself providing the strategy and intelligence, this reliance proves mostly justified in the episode "Calling All Titans." In this episode, the Brain uses a stolen Teen Titans communicator (Robin's, to be precise, who gave it to [[Madame Rouge]] thinking she was [[Hot Spot (comics)|Hot Spot]]) to track down and capture every honorary Teen Titan by sending villains to capture them. In most cases, the Brain is able to provide exactly the evil opponent (or more than one opponent) needed to capture any hero (e.g. overpowering the hero [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] with the villain [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], who can block all of Speedy's arrows with her superior reflexes, and sending the shape-shifting Madame Rouge to capture the physical fighter Robin.) However, the Brain's over-reliance on his subordinates also eventually proves to be his undoing due to several key mistakes belying his usual intelligence; he sends the [[Kardiak]] monster to capture Beast Boy, but Beast Boy wins the fight; he sends both Atlas and Adonis to overpower [[Pantha]], but Pantha defeats them both; he sends Cinderblock and Johnny Rancid to capture [[Mas y Menos]], but the two villains only manage to capture Menos, and Mas escapes; he sends Fang and Private H.I.V.E. to take down [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]], but Jericho is victorious; he sends [[Warpath (comics)|Warp]] and See-More to capture [[Herald (comics)|Herald]], but Herald successfully fights off both of them. The Brain seems unable to adapt to any possible holes in his plan, and this flaw costs him dearly in the very next episode "Titans Together" as the remaining heroes (plus [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]], and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], who while not victorious in their respective ambushes still managed to escape capture) infiltrate his base to free the captured heroes. In a last-ditch effort to escape when the tables turn, he detaches the skull jar from the rest of his body, simultaneously turning it into a fusion device to blow up his base so he could escape (saying that sometimes the best strategy is to "clear the field"), which he immediately activates. As he gets alarmingly close to leaving the now-ravaged Brotherhood base, the Brain is knocked off the scafford by Beast Boy, which Robin retrieves seconds before the jar smashes onto the ground, and is subsequently flash-frozen by a smirking Beast Boy (who jokes about "brain freeze", to everyone's disgust).
* Brain appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Journey to the Center of the Bat!", voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in a French accent. He controls [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] and uses him to attack a [[Bialya]]n city. Brain later has a cameo in the episode of "Deep Cover for Batman!". He joins [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and other villains in the following episode, but is defeated in a [[psychic]] battle against an alternate universe version of Batman. Unlike in his ''Teen Titans'' appearance, the Brain shows emotion, and openly mocks Batman as he attempts to fight him. Besides his psychic powers, he displays a variety of weapons mounted on extendable robot arms. In "The Last Patrol!", he and Monsieur Mallah target the Chief, noting his old rivalry with him, only to end up fighting Batman. He and Monsieur Mallah are later defeated on [[General Zahl]]'s ship.
* Brain appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]] in the first appearance and by [[Corey Burton]] in all subsequent appearances with both voice actors using a French accent. In "Revelation", it is revealed that Brain is L-6 of [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]] ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors). In "Summit", Brain and Monsieur Mallah join the Light in a summit with the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]] within the caves of Santa Prisca. During a three-way fight between the Team, the Light, and the Reach, [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] defeats Brain by disarming him of his weapons.
* Brain appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "Brian", voiced by [[Scott Menville]]. He captures the Teen Titans in order to steal their powers and fuel his Project B.R.I.A.N. (Brain's Robotic Indestructible Armor Nexus). A recurring gag in that episode is that the Teen Titans thought that Brain's name is Brian. This causes the little buddies of the Teen Titans to end up saving the Teen Titans and defeating Brain. The Brain returns in the episode “40%40%20%”, wielding a new four-armed spider mech body. In the episode, he captures the other Titans while Cyborg is trying to break his addiction/dependence on his favorite song, “The Night Begins to Shine". During Cyborg's song-induced fantasy, the Brain tries to stop him using a giant stone mech and an army of flying punk zombies. With Monsieur Mallah's help, the Brain is able to destroy Cyborg's tape, rendering him powerless, but the other Titans sing the song for Cyborg to give him his strength back, allowing him to defeat Mallah and the Brain.
* Brain appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "The Brain Buster", voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Justice League Action |title=The Brain Buster}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alongside Batman, [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]], Lex Luthor, and [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] are abducted by [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] posing as a cosmic being to see who is the more intellectual of the group by having them partake in three challenges.

===Video games===
* Brain appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Leif Anders]].
* Brain appears as a final boss in the DS Version of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame]]''.
* The Brain has a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. He is seen in the Insurgency Level where he is placed next to [[Lex Luthor]]'s battlesuit.
* The Brain (Along with Monsieur Mallah) appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''. He is shown with Monsieur Mallah when the player plays as him.

===Miscellaneous===
* Brain made an appearance in issue #29 and a cameo in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic book series.
* Although he never appeared in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' himself, a version of the Brain from this continuity appeared in a comic story based on the series, where the League faked an elaborate 'auction' to lure all of their villains into one place. When the Brain realizes what is happening, he attempts to deduce which members of the auction are actually League members in disguise, but his deductions are thwarted by the assumption that Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman were not among the League members (being seemingly frozen in time by [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]]) and he only had to track down Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter, when in reality even Chronos's role was faked (Chronos being a disguised Batman) and the League capture the villains. Brain and Mallah were both taken out after Wonder Woman, disguised as [[Catwoman]], threw them into [[Metallo]].

About 70 to 80% of people undergoing chemotherapy experience [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]]. Nausea and vomiting may also occur in people not receiving treatment, often as a result of the disease involving the [[gastrointestinal tract]],&lt;ref name=Naeim-2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.15.9533 |title=Evidence-Based Recommendations for Cancer Nausea and Vomiting |year=2008 |last1=Naeim |first1=A. |last2=Dy |first2=S.

The strategies of management or therapy of nausea and vomiting depend on the underlying causes.&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt; Medical treatments or conditions associated with a high risk of nausea and/or vomiting include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and malignant bowel obstruction.&lt;ref name=Ripamonti /&gt; Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may also occur.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt; Nausea and vomiting may lead to further medical conditions and complications including: [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], [[malnutrition]], and a decrease in [[quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt;

Nausea may be defined as an unpleasant sensation of the need to vomit.&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt; It may be accompanied by symptoms such salivation, feeling faint, and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]].&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt; Vomiting is the forceful ejection of stomach contents through the mouth.&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt; Although nausea and vomiting are closely related, some patients experience one symptom without the other and it may be easier to eliminate vomiting than nausea.&lt;ref name=Warr /&gt; The vomiting reflex (also called emesis) is thought to have evolved in many animal species as a protective mechanism against ingested [[toxins]]. In humans, the vomiting response may be preceded by an unpleasant sensation termed nausea, but nausea may also occur without vomiting. The [[central nervous system]] is the primary site where a number of emetic [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (input) are received, processed and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent signals]] (output) are generated as a response and sent to various effector organs or tissues, leading to  processes that eventually end in vomiting.&lt;ref name=Hesketh-2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/nejmra0706547 |title=Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting |year=2008 |last1=Hesketh |first1=Paul J. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=23 |pages=2482–94 |pmid=18525044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of emetic stimuli, the central processing by the brain and the resulting response by organs and tissues that lead to nausea and vomiting are referred to as the emetic pathway or emetic arch.

==Causes==
Some medical conditions that arise as a result of cancer or as a complication of its treatment are known to be associated with a high risk of nausea and/or vomiting. These include malignant bowel obstruction (MBO), chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV), and radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (RINV).

=== Malignant bowel obstruction===
{{main|Bowel obstruction}}
[[Malignant]] bowel obstruction (MBO) of the gastrointestinal tract is a common complication of advanced cancer, especially in patients with bowel or gynaecological cancer.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most feared side effects of chemotherapy&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.12-9-1143 |title=Guidelines for Antiemetic Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Past, Present, and Future Recommendations |year=2007 |last1=Jordan |first1=K. |last2=Sippel |first2=C. |last3=Schmoll |first3=H.-J. |journal=The Oncologist |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1143–50 |pmid=17914084}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is associated with a significant deterioration in quality of life.&lt;ref name=Navari-2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40265-013-0019-1 |title=Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting |year=2013 |last1=Navari |first1=Rudolph M. |journal=Drugs |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=249–62 |pmid=23404093}}&lt;/ref&gt; CINV is classified into three categories:&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt;  
* early onset (occurring within 24 hours of initial exposure to chemotherapy)
* delayed onset (occurring 24 hours to several days after treatment)
* anticipatory (triggered by taste, odor, sight, thoughts, or anxiety)

Risk factors that predict the occurrence and severity of CINV include sex and age, with females, younger people and people who have a high pretreatment expectation of nausea being at a higher risk, while people with a history of high alcohol consumption being at a lower risk.&lt;ref name=Hesketh-2008 /&gt; Other person-related variables, such as chemotherapy dose, rate and route of administration, hydration status, prior history of CINV, emesis during pregnancy or motion sickness, tumour burden, concomitant medication and medical conditions also play a role in the degree of CINV experienced by a person.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdq194 |title=Guideline update for MASCC and ESMO in the prevention of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: Results of the Perugia consensus conference |year=2010 |last1=Roila |first1=F. |last2=Herrstedt |first2=J. |last3=Aapro |first3=M. |last4=Gralla |first4=R.

===Anticipatory===
A common consequence of cancer treatment is the development of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV).&lt;ref name=Roscoe-2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0980-0 |title=Anticipatory nausea and vomiting |year=2010 |last1=Roscoe |first1=Joseph A. |last2=Morrow |first2=Gary R. |last3=Aapro |first3=Matti S. |last4=Molassiotis |first4=Alexander |last5=Olver |first5=Ian |journal=Supportive Care in Cancer |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1533–8 |pmid=20803345 |pmc=3136579}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of nausea is usually elicited by the re-exposure of the patients to the clinical context they need to attend to be treated.&lt;ref name=Rodrigues-2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00502 |title=Individual differences in chemotherapy-induced anticipatory nausea |year=2013 |last1=Rodríguez |first1=Marcial |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=4 |pmid=23950751 |pages=502 |pmc=3738859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 20% of people undergoing chemotherapy are reported to develop anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Once developed, ANV is difficult to control by pharmacological means. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are the only drugs that have been found to reduce the occurrence of ANV but their efficacy decreases with time.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt; Recently, clinical trials suggests that cannabidiolic acid suppresses conditioned gaping (ANV) in shrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bph.12043 |title=Cannabidiolic acid prevents vomiting in Suncus murinus and nausea-induced behaviour in rats by enhancing 5-HT1A receptor activation |year=2013 |last1=Bolognini |first1=D |last2=Rock |first2=EM |last3=Cluny |first3=NL |last4=Cascio |first4=MG |last5=Limebeer |first5=CL |last6=Duncan |first6=M |last7=Stott |first7=CG |last8=Javid |first8=FA |last9=Parker |first9=LA |last10=Pertwee |first10=RG |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=168 |issue=6 |pages=1456–1470 |pmid=23121618 |pmc=3596650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ANV is widely believed to be a [[Classical conditioning|learned response]], the best approach is to avoid the development of ANV by adequate [[prophylaxis]] and treatment of acute vomiting and nausea from the first exposure to therapy.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roscoe-2011 /&gt;  Behavioral treatment techniques, such as [[systematic desensitization]],  [[progressive muscle relaxation]] and [[hypnosis]] have been shown to be effective against ANV.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roscoe-2011 /&gt;

=== Radiation therapy===
The incidence and severity of radiation therapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) depends on a number of factors including therapy related factors such as irradiated site, single and [[Absorbed dose|total dose]], [[Radiation therapy#fractionation|fractionation]], irradiated volume and radiotherapy techniques. Also involved are person related factors such as gender, general health of the person, age, concurrent or recent chemotherapy, alcohol consumption, previous experience of nausea, vomiting, anxiety as well as the tumor stage. The emetogenic potential of radiotherapy is classified into high, moderate, low and minimal risk depending on the site of irradiation:&lt;ref name=Feyer&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0950-6 |title=Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV): MASCC/ESMO guideline for antiemetics in radiotherapy: Update 2009 |year=2010 |last1=Feyer |first1=Petra Christine |last2=Maranzano |first2=Ernesto |last3=Molassiotis |first3=Alexander |last4=Roila |first4=Fausto |last5=Clark-Snow |first5=Rebecca A. |last6=Jordan |first6=Karin |journal=Supportive Care in Cancer |volume=19 |pages=S5–14 |pmid=20697746}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* High risk: [[total body irradiation]] (TBI) is associated with a high risk of RINV
* Moderate risk: radiation of the upper [[abdomen]], half body irradiation and upper body irradiation 
* Low risk: radiation of the [[cranium]], spine, head and neck, lower thorax region and pelvis
* Minimal risk: radiation of extremities and breast

== Pathophysiology  ==
Nausea and vomiting may have a number of causes in people with cancer.&lt;ref name=ACS2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Nausea and Vomiting|url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003200-pdf.pdf|website=American Cancer Society|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While more than one cause may exist in the same person stimulating symptoms via more than one pathway, the actual cause of nausea and vomiting may be unknown in some people. The underlying causes of nausea and vomiting may in some cases not be directly related to the cancer. The causes may be categorized as disease-related and treatment-related.&lt;ref name=Keeley-2009&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul W |last1=Keeley |pmid=19445763 |year=2009 |title=Nausea and vomiting in people with cancer and other chronic diseases |volume=2009 |pmc=2907825 |journal=Clinical Evidence |pages=2406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stimuli which lead to emesis are received and processed in the brain. It is thought that a number of loosely organized [[neuronal network]]s within the [[medulla oblongata]] probably interact to coordinate the emetic reflex.&lt;ref name=Hesketh-2008 /&gt; Some of the [[brain stem]] [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] which have been identified as important in the coordination of the emetic reflex include the [[Reticular formation|parvicellular reticular formation]], the [[Bötzinger complex]] and the [[nucleus tractus solitarii]].&lt;ref name=Sanger&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.009 |title=Treatment of nausea and vomiting: Gaps in our knowledge |year=2006 |last1=Sanger |first1=Gareth J. |last2=Andrews |first2=Paul L.R. |journal=Autonomic Neuroscience |volume=129 |pages=3–16 |pmid=16934536 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nuclei coordinating emesis had formerly been referred to as the vomiting complex, but it is no longer thought to represent a single anatomical structure.&lt;ref name=Hesketh-2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt;

Efferent outputs which transmit the information from the brain leading to the motoric response of retching and vomiting include vagal efferents to the [[esophagus]], stomach and intestine as well as spinal [[Somatomotor system|somatomotor neurones]] to the abdominal muscles and  phrenic [[motor neurones]] (C3–C5) to the [[Diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]. Autonomic efferents also supply the heart and airways (vagus), salivary glands ([[chorda tympani]]) and skin and are responsible for many of the [[prodromal]] signs such as salivation and skin pallor.&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt;

Nausea and vomiting may be initiated by various stimuli, through different neuronal pathways. A stimulus may act on more than one pathway.&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt; Stimuli and pathways include:
*Toxic substances in the gastrointestinal tract: [[toxic]] substances (including [[Anticancer agents|drugs]] which are used in the treatment of cancer) in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract stimulate vagal afferent nerves in the gut mucosa which communicate to the nucleus ''tractus solitarii'' and the [[area postrema]] to initiate vomiting and nausea.&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt;  A number of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on the terminal ends of the vagal afferent nerves have been identified as being involved in this process, including the  [[5-HT3 receptor|5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3)]], [[Neurokinin1 receptor|neurokinin-1]], and [[Cholecystokinin receptor|cholecystokinin-1]] receptors.&lt;ref name=Hesketh-2008 /&gt; Various local mediators located in [[enterochromaffin cells]] of the gut mucosa play a role in stimulating these receptors. Of these  [[5-hydroxytryptamine]] seems to play the dominating role. This pathway has been postulated to be the mechanism by which some anti-cancer drugs such as [[cisplatin]] induce emesis.&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt;
*Toxic substances in the blood: toxic substances which have been absorbed into the blood (including [[cytostatics]]) or [[endogenous]] toxic (waste) material released by body or cancer cells into the blood can be detected directly in the [[area postrema]] of the brain and trigger the emetic reflex. The area postrema is a structure located on the floor of the [[fourth ventricle]] around which the [[blood-brain barrier]] is permeable, thus allowing for the detection of [[Hormone|humoral]] or pharmacological stimuli in the blood or [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. This structure contains receptors which form a [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]]. Some of the receptors and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of this emetic pathway include [[Dopamine receptor D2|dopamine type D2]], [[Serotonin receptor|serotonin]] types 2–4 (5HT2–4), [[Histamine receptor|histamine]] type 1(H1), and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|acetylcholine]] (muscarinic receptors type 1 to 5, M1–5). Some other receptors such as [[substance P]], [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|cannabinoid]] type 1 (CB1) and the [[endogenous opioids]] may also be involved.&lt;ref name=Glare-2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/CIA.S13109 |title=Treating nausea and vomiting in palliative care: A review |year=2011 |last1=Glare |first1=Paul |last2=Miller |first2=Jeanna |last3=Nikolova |last4=Tickoo |journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging |pages=243–59 |pmid=21966219 |first3=T |first4=R |volume=6 |pmc=3180521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pathological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract: diseases and [[Pathological anatomy|pathological conditions]] of the GIT may also lead to nausea and vomiting through direct or indirect stimulation of the above named pathways. Such conditions may include malignant [[bowel obstruction]],&lt;ref name=Roeland-2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11912-009-0042-2 |title=Current concepts in malignant bowel obstruction management |year=2009 |last1=Roeland |first1=Eric |last2=Von Gunten |first2=Charles F. |journal=Current Oncology Reports |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=298–303 |pmid=19508835}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[hypertrophic pyloric stenosis]] and [[gastritis]]. Pathological conditions in other organs which are linked to the above named emetic pathways may also lead to nausea and vomiting, such as the [[myocardial infarct]] (through stimulation of cardiac vagal afferents) and [[renal failure]].&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt;
*Stimulation of the central nervous system: certain stimuli of the central nervous system may induce the emetic reflex. These include [[fear]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]], [[brain trauma]] and increased [[intra-cranial pressure]].&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt; Of particular relevance to cancer patients in this regard are the stimuli of fear and anticipation. Evidence suggests that cancer patients may develop the side effects of nausea and vomiting in anticipation of chemotherapy. In some patients, re-exposure to cues such as smell, sounds or sight associated with the clinic or previous treatment may evoke anticipatory nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name=Rodrigues-2013 /&gt;
*Pathological conditions of the vestibular system: a disturbance of the [[vestibular system]] such as in [[motion sickness]] or [[Meniere's disease]] can induce the emetic reflex.&lt;ref name=Sanger /&gt; Such disturbances of the vestibular system could also be cancer related such as in cerebral or vestibular secondaries ([[metastasis]]), or cancer treatment related such as the use of opioids.&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt;

== Management ==
The strategies of management or prevention of nausea and vomiting depend on the underlying causes, whether they are reversible or treatable, stage of the illness, the person's prognosis and other person specific factors. Anti emetic drugs are chosen according to previous effectiveness and side effects.&lt;ref name=ACS2016/&gt;

=== Medication ===
Drugs that are used in the prophylaxis and therapy of nausea and vomiting in cancer include:
*[[5-HT3 antagonist]]s: 5-HT3 antagonists produce their anti emetic effect by blocking of the amplifying effect of [[serotonin]] on peripheral and central [[5-HT3 receptor]]s located on the various [[Vagus nerve stimulation|vagal]] afferent nerve endings and the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]]. They are effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of [[Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting|CINV]] as well as in malignant bowel obstruction and renal failure which are associated with elevated serotonin levels.&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt; These substances include [[Dolasetron]], [[Granisetron]], [[Ondansetron]], [[Palonosetron]], and [[Tropisetron]]. They are often used in combination with other anti emetic drugs in people with high risk of emesis or nausea and are recommended as the  most effective anti emetics in the prophylaxis of acute CINV.&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt;
*[[Corticosteroids]]: such as [[Dexamethasone]] are used in the treatment of emesis as a result of chemotherapy, malignant bowel obstruction, raised intracranial pressure and in the chronic nausea of advanced cancer, though their exact mode of action remain unclear.&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt;  Dexamethason is recommended for use in the acute prevention of highly, moderately, and low emetogenic chemotherapy and in combination with aprepitant for the prevention of delayed emesis in highly emetogenic chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt;
*[[NK1 receptor antagonist]]s: such as [[Aprepitant]] block the NK1 receptor in the brainstem and gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt; Their antiemetic activity when added to a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist plus dexametasone has been shown in several phase II double-blind studies.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt;
*[[Cannabinoids]]: are a useful adjunct to modern anti emetic therapy in selected patients. They show a combination of weak anti emetic efficacy with potentially beneficial side effects such as sedation and euphoria. However, their usefulness is generally limited by the high incidence of toxic effects, such as dizziness, dysphoria, and hallucinations. Some studies have shown that cannabinoids are slightly better than conventional anti emetics such as [[metoclopramide]], [[phenothiazines]] and [[haloperidol]] in the prevention of nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt; Cannabinoids are an option in affected people who are [[Drug intolerance|intolerant]] or refractory to 5-HT3 antagonists or steroids and aprepitant&lt;ref name=Jordan-2007 /&gt; as well as in refractory nausea and vomiting and rescue anti emetic therapy.&lt;ref name=Roila-2010 /&gt;
*Prokinetic agents such as [[Metoclopramide]]&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt; 
*[[Dopamine receptor antagonist]]s such as Phenothiazines ([[Prochlorperazine]] and [[chlorpromazine]]), [[haloperidol]], [[olanzapine]], and [[Levomepromazine]], block [[D2 receptors]] found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt; 
*[[Antihistaminic|Antihistaminic agents]] like [[Promethazine]] block [[H1 receptor]]s in the vomiting center of the medulla, the vestibular nucleus, and the chemoreceptor trigger zone&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt;
*[[Anticholinergic]] agents such as [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|Scopolamine]] (Hyoscine) are used as anti emetics as they relax smooth muscle and reduce gastrointestinal secretions by blockade of [[muscarinic receptors]]. They may be useful in the management of terminal bowel obstruction&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt; 
*[[Somatostatin]] analoga such as [[Octreotide]] are used for the palliation of malignant bowel obstruction, especially when there is high output vomiting not responding to other measures&lt;ref name=Glare-2011 /&gt;
*[[Cannabidiol]] is used as a  '''palliative treatment''' (non-curative symptomatic treatment) and improves numerous symptoms that  frequently appear during chemotherapy like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, physical pain or insomnia. Due to the large number of cannabinoid receptors ( CB1 and CB2 ) distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract ( GI ) , these substances can help to control and treat many GI diseases where vomiting and nausea are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kalapa-clinic.com/en/nausea-vomiting-medical-marijuana-uk/|title=Treating Nausea and Vomiting with Medical Marijuana{{!}} Kalapa Clinic|website=www.kalapa-clinic.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===
Other non-drug measures may include:
*Diet: Small palatable meals are normally tolerated better than big meals in people affected by nausea and vomiting in cancer. Carbohydrate meals are better tolerated than spicy, fatty and sweet foods. Cool, fizzy drinks are found to be more palatable than still or hot drinks.&lt;ref name=Calixto-Lima&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22566305 |year=2012 |last1=Calixto-Lima |first1=L |last2=Martins De Andrade |first2=E |last3=Gomes |first3=AP |last4=Geller |first4=M |last5=Siqueira-Batista |first5=R |title=Dietetic management in gastrointestinal complications from antimalignant chemotherapy |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=65–75 |doi=10.1590/S0212-16112012000100008 |journal=Nutricion Hospitalaria |url=http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0212-16112012000100008&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|doi-broken-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palliative surgery ===
[[Palliative care]] is the active care of people with advanced, progressive illness such as cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems (such as nausea or vomiting), physical, psychosocial, and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlin|first1=Constance|title=Advanced Practice Palliative Nursing|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190204747|page=373|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dad5CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA373|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is possible or necessary to provide relief for cancer caused nausea and vomiting through palliative surgical intervention. Surgery is however not routinely carried out when there are poor prognostic criteria for surgical intervention such as intra-abdominal carcinomatosis, poor performance status and massive [[ascites]].&lt;ref name=Ripamonti /&gt;  The surgical approach proves beneficial in affected people with operable lesions, a life expectancy greater than 2 months and good performance status.&lt;ref name=Roeland-2009 /&gt; Often a malignant bowel obstruction is the cause of the symptoms in which case the purpose of palliative surgery is to relieve the symptoms of bowel obstruction by means of several procedures including:

{{short description|Processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome }}
[[File:brokechromo.jpg|frame|right|DNA damage resulting in multiple broken chromosomes]]
'''DNA repair''' is a collection of processes by which a [[cell (biology)|cell]] identifies and corrects damage to the [[DNA]] molecules that encode its [[genome]]&lt;ref name="Jackson-Bartek-2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nature Reviews Series: DNA damage|journal=[[Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology]]|date=5 Jul 2017|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/hwnqqcstyj|accessdate=7 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In human cells, both normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] activities and environmental factors such as [[radiation]] can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 [[million]] individual [[molecular lesion]]s per cell per day.&lt;ref name="lodish"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J |year=2004 |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |page=963 |publisher=WH Freeman |location=New York |edition=5th }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell's ability to [[Transcription (biology)|transcribe]] the [[gene]] that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful [[mutation]]s in the cell's genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes [[mitosis]]. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure.  When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular [[apoptosis]] does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur, including double-strand breaks and [[Crosslinking of DNA|DNA crosslinkages]] (interstrand crosslinks or ICLs).&lt;ref name="acharya"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acharya | first1 = PV | title = The isolation and partial characterization of age-correlated oligo-deoxyribo-ribonucleotides with covalently linked aspartyl-glutamyl polypeptides | journal = Johns Hopkins Medical Journal.

The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors, including the cell type, the age of the cell, and the extracellular environment. A cell that has accumulated a large amount of DNA damage, or one that no longer effectively repairs damage incurred to its DNA, can enter one of three possible states:
# an irreversible state of dormancy, known as [[senescence]]
# cell suicide, also known as [[apoptosis]] or [[programmed cell death]]
# unregulated cell division, which can lead to the formation of a [[tumor]] that is [[cancer]]ous

The DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism. Many genes that were initially shown to influence [[life expectancy|life span]] have turned out to be involved in DNA damage repair and protection.&lt;ref name="browner"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.06.033 | last1 = Browner | first1 = WS | last2 = Kahn | first2 = AJ | last3 = Ziv | first3 = E | last4 = Reiner | first4 = AP | last5 = Oshima | first5 = J | last6 = Cawthon | first6 = RM | last7 = Hsueh | first7 = WC | last8 = Cummings | first8 = SR. | year = 2004 | title = The genetics of human longevity | url = | journal = Am J Med | volume = 117 | issue = 11| pages = 851–60 | pmid = 15589490 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.556.6874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA damage==
{{further|DNA damage (naturally occurring)|Free radical damage to DNA}}
DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes inside the cell, occurs at a rate of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day.&lt;ref name="lodish" /&gt; While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as [[tumor suppressor gene]]s) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of [[tumor]] formation and contribute to [[tumour heterogeneity]].

The vast majority of DNA damage affects the [[primary structure]] of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike [[protein]]s and [[RNA]], DNA usually lacks [[tertiary structure]] and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, [[supercoil]]ed and wound around "packaging" proteins called [[histone]]s (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.

===Sources===
DNA damage can be subdivided into two main types:

# [[endogenous]] damage such as attack by [[reactive oxygen species]] produced from normal metabolic byproducts (spontaneous mutation), especially the process of [[oxidative deamination]]
## also includes [[DNA error|replication errors]]
# exogenous damage caused by external agents such as
## ultraviolet [UV 200–400 [[nanometre|nm]]] [[radiation]] from the sun
## other radiation frequencies, including [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s
## [[hydrolysis]] or thermal disruption
## certain [[plant]] [[toxin]]s
## human-made [[mutagen|mutagenic chemicals]], especially [[aromatic]] compounds that act as DNA [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating agents]]
## [[virus]]es&lt;ref name="pmid10547702"&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid = 10547702
| doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.577
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The replication of damaged DNA before cell division can lead to the incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones. Daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which the original DNA sequence is unrecoverable (except in the rare case of a [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]], for example, through [[gene conversion]]).

===Types===
There are several types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes:
# ''[[DNA oxidation|oxidation]]'' of bases [e.g. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)] and generation of DNA strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species,
# ''[[alkylation]]'' of bases (usually [[methylation]]), such as formation of [[7-methylguanosine]], 1-methyladenine, [[6-O-Methylguanine]]
# ''[[hydrolysis]]'' of bases, such as [[deamination]], [[depurination]], and depyrimidination.
# [[DNA adduct|"bulky adduct formation"]] (i.e., benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-dG adduct, aristolactam I-dA adduct)
# ''mismatch'' of bases, due to errors in [[DNA replication]], in which the wrong DNA base is stitched into place in a newly forming DNA strand, or a DNA base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted.
# Monoadduct damage cause by change in single nitrogenous base of DNA
# Diadduct damage

Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms. Some examples are:
# ''[[UV light|UV-B light]]'' causes crosslinking between adjacent cytosine and thymine bases creating ''[[pyrimidine dimers]]''. This is called [[direct DNA damage]].
# ''[[UV light|UV-A light]]'' creates mostly free radicals. The damage caused by free radicals is called [[indirect DNA damage]].
# ''[[Ionizing radiation]]'' such as that created by radioactive decay or in ''[[cosmic rays]]'' causes breaks in DNA strands.  Intermediate-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and cancer.
# ''Thermal disruption'' at elevated temperature increases the rate of [[depurination]] (loss of [[purine]] bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination is seen in the [[thermophilic bacteria]], which grow in [[hot springs]] at 40–80&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | year=2006|vauthors=Madigan MT, Martino JM | edition=11th |page=136 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-196893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toshihiro"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3123/jemsge.28.56 |last1=Ohta |first1=Toshihiro |last2=Shin-ichi |first2=Tokishita |last3=Mochizuki |first3=Kayo |last4=Kawase |first4=Jun |last5=Sakahira |first5=Masahide |last6=Yamagata |first6=Hideo |year=2006 |title=UV Sensitivity and Mutagenesis of the Extremely Thermophilic Eubacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 |journal=Genes and Environment |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of depurination (300 [[purine]] residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an [[adaptive]] response cannot be ruled out.
# ''Industrial chemicals'' such as [[vinyl chloride]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], and environmental chemicals such as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphotriesters and [[crosslinking of DNA]], just to name a few.

UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage. Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base, deamination, sugar [[ring pucker]]ing and tautomeric shift.

===Nuclear versus mitochondrial===
In human cells, and [[eukaryotic]] cells in general, DNA is found in two cellular locations&amp;nbsp;— inside the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and inside the [[mitochondria]]. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as [[chromatin]] during non-replicative stages of the [[cell cycle]] and is condensed into aggregate structures known as [[chromosomes]] during [[cell division]]. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called [[histones]]. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria [[organelles]], exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), or [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], byproducts of the constant production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) via [[oxidative phosphorylation]], create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is [[superoxide dismutase]], which is present in both the mitochondria and [[cytoplasm]] of eukaryotic cells.

===Senescence and apoptosis===
Senescence, an irreversible process in which the cell no longer [[mitosis|divides]], is a protective response to the shortening of the [[telomeres|chromosome ends]]. The telomeres are long regions of repetitive [[noncoding DNA]] that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division (see [[Hayflick limit]]).&lt;ref name="braig"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4006 | last1 = Braig | first1 = M | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = CA. | year = 2006 | title = Oncogene-induced senescence: putting the brakes on tumor development | url = | journal = Cancer Res | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 2881–2884 | pmid = 16540631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[G0 phase|quiescence]] is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage (see [[cell cycle]]). Senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism,&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/dna.2006.25.69 | last1 = Lynch | first1 = MD. | year = 2006 | title = How does cellular senescence prevent cancer? | url = | journal = DNA Cell Biol | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 69–78 | pmid = 16460230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as a "last resort" mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro-growth [[cellular signaling]]. Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor (see [[cancer]]), which is potentially lethal to an organism. Therefore, the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered to be part of a strategy of protection against cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid17667954"&gt;{{cite journal

===Mutation===
It is important to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of error in DNA. DNA damage and mutation are fundamentally different. Damage results in physical abnormalities in the DNA, such as single- and double-strand breaks, [[8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine]] residues, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired if redundant information, such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome, is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented, and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked.  Replication may also be blocked or the cell may die.

In contrast to DNA damage, a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.

Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these errors are a major source of mutation.

Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation, it can be seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.&lt;ref name="nDNA"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Best |first= Benjamin P | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging

==Mechanisms==

Cells cannot function if DNA damage corrupts the integrity and accessibility of essential information in the [[genome]] (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending on the type of damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister [[chromatid]] as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as [[DNA repair#Translesion synthesis|translesion synthesis]] as a last resort.

Damage to DNA alters the spatial configuration of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind at or near the site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.

===Direct reversal===
Cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of the four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of [[pyrimidine dimer]]s upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The [[photoreactivation]] process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme [[photolyase]], whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from [[electromagnetic spectrum|blue/UV light]] (300–500&amp;nbsp;nm [[wavelength]]) to promote catalysis.&lt;ref name="Sancar"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr0204348 | last1 = Sancar | first1 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors | url = | journal = Chem Rev | volume = 103 | issue = 6| pages = 2203–37 | pmid = 12797829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photolyase, an old enzyme present in [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and most [[animals]] no longer functions in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution of Mutation Rates: Phylogenomic Analysis of the Photolyase/Cryptochrome Family|first=José Ignacio Lucas-Lledó|last=Michael Lynch|date=19 February 2009|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=26|issue=5|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp029|pages=1143–1153|last2=Lynch|first2=M.|pmid=19228922|pmc=2668831}}&lt;/ref&gt; who instead use [[nucleotide excision repair]] to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called [[ogt]]. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is [[stoichiometric]] rather than [[catalytic]].&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann A, Levine M, Losick R |year=2004 |title=Molecular Biology of the Gene |publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings; CSHL Press |edition=5th |at=Ch. 9, 10 |oclc=936762772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the [[adaptive response]] and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes.&lt;ref name="Volkert"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Volkert MR |title=Adaptive response of Escherichia coli to alkylation damage |journal=Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=241–55 |year=1988 |pmid=3278898 |doi=10.1002/em.2850110210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.

===Single-strand damage===
[[File:Uracil base glycosidase.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Structure of the base-excision repair enzyme [[uracil-DNA glycosylase]] excising a hydrolytically-produced uracil residue from DNA. The uracil residue is shown in yellow.]]
When only one of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand can be used as a template to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of [[excision repair]] mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;

===Double-strand breaks===
Double-strand breaks, in which both strands in the double helix are severed, are particularly hazardous to the cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements. It was noted in some studies that double-strand breaks and a "cross-linkage joining both strands at the same point is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair. The cell will die in the next mitosis or in some rare instances, mutate."&lt;ref name="acharya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bjorksten"/&gt; Three mechanisms exist to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs): [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ), [[microhomology-mediated end joining]] (MMEJ), and [[homologous recombination]] (HR).&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16012167"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang L, Deng L, Chen Y, Li GC, Shao C, Tischfield JA |title=Modulation of DNA end joining by nuclear proteins |journal=J.

Homologous recombination requires the presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as a template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for [[chromosomal crossover]] during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister [[chromatid]] (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a [[homologous chromosome]] as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the [[replication fork]] and are typically repaired by recombination.

MMEJ starts with short-range end resection by [[MRE11]] nuclease on either side of a double-strand break to reveal microhomology regions.&lt;ref name=Truong&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Truong LN, Li Y, Shi LZ, Hwang PY, He J, Wang H, Razavian N, Berns MW, Wu X |title=Microhomology-mediated End Joining and Homologous Recombination share the initial end resection step to repair DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells |journal=Proc.

There is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of [[flap structure-specific endonuclease 1]] (FEN1) to remove overhanging flaps.  This is followed by recruitment of [[XRCC1]]–[[LIG3]] to the site for ligating the DNA ends, leading to an intact DNA.

The [[extremophile]] ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' has a remarkable ability to survive DNA damage from [[ionizing radiation]] and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]]. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] regions through a moving [[D-loop]] that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is [[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]] by means of [[RecA]]-dependent [[Homologous recombination#RecBCD pathway|homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="MRadman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zahradka K, Slade D, Bailone A |title=Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans |journal=Nature |volume=443 |issue=7111 |pages=569–73 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17006450 |doi=10.1038/nature05160|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Topoisomerase]]s introduce both single- and double-strand breaks in the course of changing the DNA's state of [[supercoil]]ing, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.

===Translesion synthesis===
Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the [[DNA replication]] machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as [[thymine dimer]]s or [[AP site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19258535"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters LS, Minesinger BK, Wiltrout ME, D'Souza S, Woodruff RV, Walker GC |title=Eukaryotic Translesion Polymerases and Their Roles and Regulation in DNA Damage Tolerance |journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=134–54 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19258535 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00034-08 |url= |pmc=2650891}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves switching out regular [[DNA polymerase]]s for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication [[processivity]] factor [[PCNA]]. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, [[DNA polymerase eta|Pol η]] mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by [[ultraviolet|UV irradiation]], whereas [[POLI|Pol ι]] introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the [[Pyrimidine dimers#Mutagenesis|T^T photodimer]] using [[Base pair|Watson-Crick base pairing]] and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using [[Hoogsteen base pair]]ing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of [[point mutation]]s during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized [[polymerases]] either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, G[8,5-Me]T, although it can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid18616294"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LC Colis |author2=P Raychaudhury |author3=AK Basu |title=Mutational specificity of gamma-radiation-induced guanine-thymine and thymine-guanine intrastrand cross-links in mammalian cells and translesion synthesis past the guanine-thymine lesion by human DNA polymerase eta |journal=Biochemistry | volume= 47 | issue=6| pages=8070–8079| year= 2008 | pmid= 18616294| doi=10.1021/bi800529f | pmc=2646719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu&lt;ref name="pmid21302943"&gt;{{cite journal |author=P Raychaudhury|title=Genetic requirement for mutagenesis of the G[8,5-Me]T cross-link in Escherichia coli: DNA polymerases IV and V compete for error-prone bypass |journal=Biochemistry | volume= 50 | issue=12| pages=2330–2338| year= 2011 | pmid= 21302943| doi=10.1021/bi102064z |last2=Basu |first2=Ashis K. | pmc=3062377}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in ''Escherichia coli'' by replicating a G[8,5-Me]T-modified plasmid in ''E. coli'' with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.
A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by [[Proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At a site of [[lesion]], PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/[[RAD18]] [[proteins]] to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.chem.psu.edu/sjbgroup/projects/translesion.htm |title=Translesion Synthesis |publisher=Research.chem.psu.edu |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310104318/http://research.chem.psu.edu/sjbgroup/projects/translesion.htm |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first1=Z|title=Translesion synthesis by the UmuC family of DNA polymerases|journal=Mutat.

This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, as in the case of Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; [[DNA polymerase#Polymerases Rev1 and ζ (zeta)|Pol ζ]]. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.

==Global response to DNA damage==
Cells exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], [[ultraviolet light]] or chemicals are prone to acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other [[biomolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[RNA]]. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the [[replication fork]]s, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage.&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;Friedberg EC, Walker GC, Siede W, Wood RD, Schultz RA, Ellenberger T. (2006). DNA Repair and Mutagenesis, part 3. ASM Press. 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or [[apoptosis]]. The common features of global response are induction of multiple [[gene]]s, [[cell cycle]] arrest, and inhibition of [[cell division]].

===Initial steps===

The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into [[chromatin]] presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action.  To allow DNA repair, the chromatin must be [[chromatin remodeling|remodeled]].  In eukaryotes, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] dependent [[chromatin remodeling]] complexes and [[histone-modifying enzymes]] are two predominant factors employed to accomplish this remodeling process.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu B, Yip RK, Zhou Z |title=Chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair and aging |journal=Curr.

Checkpoint activation pauses the cell cycle and gives the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the [[G1 phase|G1]]/[[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]]/[[mitosis|M]] boundaries. An intra-[[S phase|S]] checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master [[kinase]]s, [[ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]] and [[Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related|ATR]]. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakkenist CJ, Kastan MB |title=DNA damage activates ATM through intermolecular autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation |journal=Nature |volume=421 |issue=6922 |pages=499–506 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12556884 |doi=10.1038/nature01368}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled [[replication fork]]s. These kinases [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] downstream targets in a [[signal transduction]] cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including [[BRCA1]], [[MDC1]], and [[53BP1]] has also been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA Repair, Genetic Instability, and Cancer |last=Wei |first=Qingyi |author2=Lei Li|author3=David Chen |year=2007 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-270-014-8 }}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.

'''DNA damage checkpoint''' is a [[signal transduction pathway]] that blocks [[cell cycle]] progression in G1, G2 and [[metaphase]] and slows down the rate of S phase progression when [[DNA]] is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide.

Checkpoint Proteins can be separated into four groups: [[phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase]] (PI3K)-like [[protein kinase]], [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses is a pair of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM ([[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated]]) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the [[chromosome]]s at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.

An important downstream target of ATM and ATR is [[p53]], as it is required for inducing [[apoptosis]] following DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Checkpoint Controls and Cancer |last=Schonthal |first=Axel H. |year=2004 |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=978-1-58829-500-2 }}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor]] [[p21]] is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating [[cyclin]]/[[cyclin-dependent kinase]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gartel AL, Tyner AL |title=The role of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in apoptosis |journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12479224 |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12479224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The prokaryotic SOS response===
The [[SOS response]] is the changes in [[gene expression]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The [[prokaryotic]] SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: [[LexA]] and [[RecA]]. The LexA [[homodimer]] is a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al [[repressor]] that binds to [[operator (biology)|operator]] sequences commonly referred to as SOS boxes. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes.&lt;ref name="Janion"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janion | first1 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Some aspects of the SOS response system-a critical survey | url = | journal = Acta Biochim Pol. | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 599–610 | pmid = 11833768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SOS response is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the [[Spirochetes]].&lt;ref name="Erill"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2007.00082.x | last1 = Erill | year = 2007 | first1 = I | last2 = Campoy | first2 = S | last3 = Barbé | first3 = J | title = Aeons of distress: an evolutionary perspective on the bacterial SOS response | url = | journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev. | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 637–656 | pmid = 17883408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled [[replication fork]]s or double-strand breaks, which are processed by [[DNA helicase]] to separate the two DNA strands.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt; In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an [[ATP hydrolysis]] driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA auto[[protease]] activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.

In ''Escherichia coli'', SOS boxes are 20-nucleotide long sequences near promoters with [[palindromic]] structure and a high degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome.&lt;ref name="Erill"/&gt; The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr0404951 | last1 = Schlacher | first1 = K | last2 = Pham | first2 = P | last3 = Cox | first3 = MM | last4 = Goodman | first4 = MF. | year = 2006 | title = Roles of DNA Polymerase V and RecA Protein in SOS Damage-Induced Mutation | url = | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 406–419 | pmid = 16464012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.

===Eukaryotic transcriptional responses to DNA damage===
[[Eukaryotic]] cells exposed to DNA damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, [[cell cycle checkpoint]] control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental [[shock response]] indicates that a general global stress response pathway exist at the level of transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the [[heterogeneity]] of [[mammalian]] cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.&lt;ref name="Fry, Begle, Samson 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fry | first1 = RC | last2 = Begley | first2 = TJ | last3 = Samson | first3 = LD | year = 2004 | title = Genome-wide responses to DNA-damaging agents | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 357–77 | doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.59.031805.133658 | pmid=16153173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general global response to DNA damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for [[postreplication repair]], homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, [[DNA damage checkpoint]], global transcriptional activation, genes controlling mRNA decay, and many others. A large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision: undergo apoptosis and die, or survive at the cost of living with a modified genome. An increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations. Yeast Rev1 and human polymerase η are members of [Y family translesion DNA [[polymerase]]s present during global response to DNA damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to DNA damage in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;

===Pathological effects of poor DNA repair===
[[File:Dnarepair1.png|frame|DNA repair rate is an important determinant of cell pathology]]

Experimental animals with genetic deficiencies in DNA repair often show decreased life span and increased cancer incidence.&lt;ref name="nDNA"/&gt; For example, mice deficient in the dominant NHEJ pathway and in telomere maintenance mechanisms get [[lymphoma]] and infections more often, and, as a consequence, have shorter lifespans than wild-type mice.&lt;ref name="espejel"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400127 | last1 = Espejel | first1 = S | last2 = Martin | first2 = M | last3 = Klatt | first3 = P | last4 = Martin-Caballero | first4 = J | last5 = Flores | first5 = JM | last6 = Blasco | first6 = MA. | year = 2004 | title = Shorter telomeres, accelerated ageing and increased lymphoma in DNA-PKcs-deficient mice | url = | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 503–9 | pmid = 15105825 | pmc = 1299048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar manner, mice deficient in a key repair and transcription protein that unwinds DNA helices have premature onset of aging-related diseases and consequent shortening of lifespan.&lt;ref name="deboer"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1070174 | year = 2002 | last1 = De Boer | first1 = J | last2 = Andressoo | first2 = JO | last3 = De Wit | first3 = J | last4 = Huijmans | first4 = J | last5 = Beems | first5 = RB | last6 = Van Steeg | first6 = H | last7 = Weeda | first7 = G | last8 = Van Der Horst | first8 = GT | last9 = Van Leeuwen | first9 = W | last10 = Themmen | first10 = A.

If the rate of DNA damage exceeds the capacity of the cell to repair it, the accumulation of errors can overwhelm the cell and result in early senescence, apoptosis, or cancer. Inherited diseases associated with faulty DNA repair functioning result in premature aging,&lt;ref name="nDNA"/&gt; increased sensitivity to carcinogens, and correspondingly increased cancer risk (see [[DNA repair#Medicine and DNA repair modulation|below]]). On the other hand, organisms with enhanced DNA repair systems, such as ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', the most radiation-resistant known organism, exhibit remarkable resistance to the double-strand break-inducing effects of [[radioactivity]], likely due to enhanced efficiency of DNA repair and especially NHEJ.&lt;ref name="kobayashi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = Y | last2 = Narumi | first2 = I | last3 = Satoh | first3 = K | last4 = Funayama | first4 = T | last5 = Kikuchi | first5 = M | last6 = Kitayama | first6 = S | last7 = Watanabe | first7 = H. | year = 2004 | title = Radiation response mechanisms of the extremely radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans | url = | journal = Biol Sci Space | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 134–5 | pmid = 15858357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and caloric restriction===
[[File:Dnadamage.png|frame|right|Most life span influencing genes affect the rate of DNA damage]]
A number of individual genes have been identified as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms. The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment, in particular, on the organism's diet. [[Caloric restriction]]  reproducibly results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms, likely via [[nutrient sensing]] pathways and decreased [[metabolic rate]]. The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear (see&lt;ref name="spindler"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.016 | last1 = Spindler | first1 = SR. | year = 2005 | title = Rapid and reversible induction of the longevity, anticancer and genomic effects of caloric restriction | url = | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 126 | issue = 9| pages = 960–6 | pmid = 15927235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for some discussion); however, the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction. Several agents reported to have anti-aging properties have been shown to attenuate constitutive level of [[mTOR]] signaling, an evidence of reduction of [[metabolic activity]], and concurrently to reduce  constitutive level of [[DNA damage]] induced by endogenously generated reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23363784 | doi=10.18632/aging.100521 | volume=4 | issue=12 | title=Potential anti-aging agents suppress the level of constitutive mTOR- and DNA damage- signaling | pmc=3615161 | year=2012 | journal=Aging (Albany NY) | pages=952–65 | last1 = Halicka | first1 = HD | last2 = Zhao | first2 = H | last3 = Li | first3 = J | last4 = Lee | first4 = YS | last5 = Hsieh | first5 = TC | last6 = Wu | first6 = JM | last7 = Darzynkiewicz | first7 = Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For example, increasing the [[gene dosage]] of the gene SIR-2, which regulates DNA packaging in the nematode worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', can significantly extend lifespan.&lt;ref name="tissenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35065638 | last1 = Tissenbaum | first1 = HA | last2 = Guarente | first2 = L. | year = 2001 | title = Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends life span in Caenorhabditis elegans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = 6825| pages = 227–30 | pmid = 11242085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mammalian homolog of SIR-2 is known to induce downstream DNA repair factors involved in NHEJ, an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen HY, Miller C, Bitterman KJ, Wall NR, Hekking B, Kessler B, Howitz KT, Gorospe M, de Cabo R, Sinclair DA | title = Calorie restriction promotes mammalian cell survival by inducing the SIRT1 deacetylase | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5682 | pages = 390–2 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15205477 | doi = 10.1126/science.1099196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caloric restriction has been closely linked to the rate of base excision repair in the nuclear DNA of rodents,&lt;ref name="cabelof"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1568-7864(02)00219-7 | last1 = Cabelof | first1 = DC | last2 = Yanamadala | first2 = S | last3 = Raffoul | first3 = JJ | last4 = Guo | first4 = Z | last5 = Soofi | first5 = A | last6 = Heydari | first6 = AR. | year = 2003 | title = Caloric restriction promotes genomic stability by induction of base excision repair and reversal of its age-related decline | url = | journal = DNA Repair (Amst.) | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 295–307 | pmid=12547392}}&lt;/ref&gt; although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial DNA.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = JA | last2 = Karahalil | first2 = B | last3 = Hogue | first3 = BA | last4 = Souza-Pinto | first4 = NC | last5 = Bohr | first5 = VA. | year = 2004 | title = Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA base excision repair are affected differently by caloric restriction | journal = FASEB J | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 595–7 | pmid = 14734635 | doi = 10.1096/fj.03-0890fje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''C. elegans'' gene AGE-1, an upstream effector of DNA repair pathways, confers dramatically extended life span under free-feeding conditions but leads to a decrease in reproductive fitness under conditions of caloric restriction.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35012693 | last1 = Walker | first1 = DW | last2 = McColl | first2 = G | last3 = Jenkins | first3 = NL | last4 = Harris | first4 = J | last5 = Lithgow | first5 = GJ. | year = 2000 | title = Evolution of lifespan in C. elegans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6784| pages = 296–7 | pmid = 10830948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation supports the [[pleiotropy]] theory of the [[senescence#Theories of aging|biological origins of aging]], which suggests that genes conferring a large survival advantage early in life will be selected for even if they carry a corresponding disadvantage late in life.

==Medicine and DNA repair modulation==
{{Main|DNA repair-deficiency disorder}}

===Hereditary DNA repair disorders===
Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for several genetic disorders, including:

* [[Xeroderma pigmentosum]]: hypersensitivity to sunlight/UV, resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging
* [[Cockayne syndrome]]: hypersensitivity to UV and chemical agents
* [[Trichothiodystrophy]]: sensitive skin, brittle hair and nails

Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders, suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons.

Other DNA repair disorders include:

* [[Werner's syndrome]]: premature aging and retarded growth
* [[Bloom syndrome|Bloom's syndrome]]: sunlight hypersensitivity, high incidence of [[malignant|malignancies]] (especially [[leukemia]]s).
* [[Ataxia telangiectasia]]: sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents

All of the above diseases are often called "segmental [[progeria]]s" ("[[accelerated aging disease]]s") because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging-related diseases at an abnormally young age, while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age.

Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include [[Fanconi anemia]], hereditary [[breast cancer]] and hereditary [[colon cancer]].

==Cancer==
Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite news

|oclc= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are at least 34 [[Inherited human DNA repair gene mutations that increase cancer risk]].  Many of these mutations cause DNA repair to be less effective than normal.  In particular, [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] (HNPCC) is strongly associated with specific mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway. ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', two important genes whose mutations confer a hugely increased risk of breast cancer on carriers,&lt;ref name="pmid17683622"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenson B | title = The BRCA1/2 pathway prevents hematologic cancers in addition to breast and ovarian cancers | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 152 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17683622 | pmc = 1959234 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-7-152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are both associated with a large number of DNA repair pathways, especially NHEJ and homologous recombination.

Cancer therapy procedures such as [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] work by overwhelming the capacity of the cell to repair DNA damage, resulting in cell death. Cells that are most rapidly dividing&amp;nbsp;– most typically cancer cells&amp;nbsp;– are preferentially affected. The side-effect is that other non-cancerous but rapidly dividing cells such as progenitor cells in the gut, skin, and hematopoietic system are also affected. Modern cancer treatments attempt to localize the DNA damage to cells and tissues only associated with cancer, either by physical means (concentrating the therapeutic agent in the region of the tumor) or by biochemical means (exploiting a feature unique to cancer cells in the body). ...; in the context of therapies targeting DNA damage response genes, the latter approach has been termed 'synthetic lethality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gavande NS, VanderVere-Carozza PS, Hinshaw HD, Jalal SI, Sears CR, Pawelczak KS, Turchi JJ |title=DNA repair targeted therapy: The past or future of cancer treatment? |journal=Pharmacol.

Perhaps the most well-known of these 'synthetic lethality' drugs is the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 ([[PARP1]]) inhibitor [[olaparib]], which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for the treatment in women of BRCA-defective ovarian cancer. Tumor cells with partial loss of DNA damage response (specifically, [[homologous recombination]] repair) are dependent on another mechanism – single-strand break repair – which is a mechanism consisting, in part, of the PARP1 gene product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant HE, Schultz N, Thomas HD, Parker KM, Flower D, Lopez E, Kyle S, Meuth M, Curtin NJ, Helleday T |title=Specific killing of BRCA2-deficient tumours with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase |journal=Nature |issue=7035 |pages=913–7 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15829966 |doi=10.1038/nature03443 |volume=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olaparib]] is combined with chemotherapeutics to inhibit single-strand break repair induced by DNA damage caused by the co-administered chemotherapy. Tumor cells relying on this residual DNA repair mechanism are unable to repair the damage and hence are not able to survive and proliferate, whereas normal cells can repair the damage with the functioning homologous recombination mechanism.

Many other drugs for use against other residual DNA repair mechanisms commonly found in cancer are currently under investigation. However, synthetic lethality therapeutic approaches have been questioned due to emerging evidence of acquired resistance, achieved through rewiring of DNA damage response pathways and reversion of previously-inhibited defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldstein M, Kastan MB |title=The DNA damage response: implications for tumor responses to radiation and chemotherapy |journal=Annu Rev Med |volume=66 |pages=129–43 |date=2015 |pmid= 25423595 |doi=10.1146/annurev-med-081313-121208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epigenetic DNA repair defects in cancer===
Classically, cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and chromosomal aberrations. However, it has become apparent that cancer is also driven by
[[Epigenetics|epigenetic alterations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baylin SB |title=Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer – a mechanism for early oncogenic pathway addiction? |journal=Nat. Rev. Cancer |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=107–16 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16491070 |doi=10.1038/nrc1799 |url=|last2=Ohm |first2=Joyce E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetic alterations refer to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in [[DNA methylation]] (hypermethylation and hypomethylation) and [[histone modification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanwal R, Gupta S |title=Epigenetic modifications in cancer |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=303–11 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22082348 |pmc=3590802 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2011.01809.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as [[HMGA2]] or [[HMGA1]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldassarre G, Battista S, Belletti B |title=Negative regulation of BRCA1 gene expression by HMGA1 proteins accounts for the reduced BRCA1 protein levels in sporadic breast carcinoma |journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=2225–38 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12640109 |pmc=150734 |doi=10.1128/MCB.23.7.2225-2238.2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes caused by [[microRNA]]s. Each of these epigenetic alterations serves to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. These changes usually remain through [[cell division]]s, last for multiple cell generations, and can be considered to be epimutations (equivalent to mutations).

While large numbers of epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, appear to be particularly important.  Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the [[Genome instability|genetic]] instability characteristic of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacinto FV, Esteller M |title=Mutator pathways unleashed by epigenetic silencing in human cancer |journal=Mutagenesis |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=247–53 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17412712 |doi=10.1093/mutage/gem009 |url=|last2=Esteller |first2=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lahtz C|title=Epigenetic changes of DNA repair genes in cancer |journal=J Mol Cell Biol |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=51–8 |date=February 2011 |pmid=21278452 |pmc=3030973 |doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjq053 |url=|last2=Pfeifer |first2=G.

Reduced expression of DNA repair genes causes deficient DNA repair. When DNA repair is deficient DNA damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation. Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in [[DNA mismatch repair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Narayanan L, Fritzell JA, Baker SM, Liskay RM, Glazer PM |title=Elevated levels of mutation in multiple tissues of mice deficient in the DNA mismatch repair gene Pms2 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=3122–7 |date=April 1997 |pmid=9096356 |pmc=20332 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.7.3122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hegan DC, Narayanan L, Jirik FR, Edelmann W, Liskay RM, Glazer PM |title=Differing patterns of genetic instability in mice deficient in the mismatch repair genes Pms2, Mlh1, Msh2, Msh3 and Msh6 |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2402–8 |date=December 2006 |pmid=16728433 |pmc=2612936 |doi=10.1093/carcin/bgl079}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tutt AN, van Oostrom CT, Ross GM, van Steeg H, Ashworth A |title=Disruption of Brca2 increases the spontaneous mutation rate in vivo: synergism with ionizing radiation |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=255–60 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11850397 |pmc=1084010 |doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=German J |title=Bloom's syndrome.

Higher levels of DNA damage not only cause increased mutation, but also cause increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB |title=Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e1000155 |year=2008 |pmid=18704159 |pmc=2491723 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuozzo C, Porcellini A, Angrisano T |title=DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e110 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17616978 |pmc=1913100 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause increased risk of cancer.  Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]) have an increased risk of cancer, with some defects causing up to a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malkin D |title=Li-fraumeni syndrome |journal=Genes &amp; Cancer |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=475–84 |date=April 2011  |pmid=21779515 |pmc=3135649 |doi=10.1177/1947601911413466}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fearon ER |title=Human cancer syndromes: clues to the origin and nature of cancer |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5340 |pages=1043–50 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9353177 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5340.1043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes===

Deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes are occasionally caused by a newly arising somatic mutation in a DNA repair gene, but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. For example, when 113 colorectal cancers were examined in sequence, only four had a [[missense mutation]] in the DNA repair gene [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]], while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halford S, Rowan A, Sawyer E, Talbot I, Tomlinson I |title=O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase in colorectal cancers: detection of mutations, loss of expression, and weak association with G:C&gt;A:T transitions |journal=Gut |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=797–802 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15888787 |pmc=1774551 |doi=10.1136/gut.2004.059535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five different studies found that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shen L, Kondo Y, Rosner GL |title=MGMT promoter methylation and field defect in sporadic colorectal cancer |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=97 |issue=18 |pages=1330–8 |date=September 2005  |pmid=16174854 |doi=10.1093/jnci/dji275|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Psofaki V, Kalogera C, Tzambouras N |title=Promoter methylation status of hMLH1, MGMT, and CDKN2A/p16 in colorectal adenomas |journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=16 |issue=28 |pages=3553–60 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20653064 |pmc=2909555 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v16.i28.3553|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee KH, Lee JS, Nam JH |title=Promoter methylation status of hMLH1, hMSH2, and MGMT genes in colorectal cancer associated with adenoma-carcinoma sequence |journal=Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery |volume=396 |issue=7 |pages=1017–26 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21706233 |doi=10.1007/s00423-011-0812-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amatu A, Sartore-Bianchi A, Moutinho C |title=Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT predicts clinical response to dacarbazine in a phase II study for metastatic colorectal cancer |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=2265–72 |date=April 2013 |pmid=23422094 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3518|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mokarram P, Zamani M, Kavousipour S |title=Different patterns of DNA methylation of the two distinct O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O6-MGMT) promoter regions in colorectal cancer |journal=Molecular Biology Reports |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=3851–7 |date=May 2013 |pmid=23271133 |doi=10.1007/s11033-012-2465-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene [[PMS2]] expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner [[MLH1]] was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Truninger K, Menigatti M, Luz J |title=Immunohistochemical analysis reveals high frequency of PMS2 defects in colorectal cancer |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=128 |issue=5 |pages=1160–71 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15887099 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.056|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the [[microRNA]], [[miR-155]], which down-regulates MLH1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valeri N, Gasparini P, Fabbri M |title=Modulation of mismatch repair and genomic stability by miR-155 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=107 |issue=15 |pages=6982–7 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20351277 |pmc=2872463 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1002472107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian, colorectal and head and neck).

Red-highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers.  When these genes have low or absent expression, DNA damages can accumulate.  Replication errors past these damages (see [[DNA repair#translesion synthesis|translesion synthesis]]) can lead to increased mutations and, ultimately, cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in '''accurate''' DNA repair pathways appear to be central to [[carcinogenesis]].

The two gray-highlighted genes ''[[RAD51]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', are required for [[homologous recombination]]al repair.  They are sometimes epigenetically over-expressed and sometimes under-expressed in certain cancers.  As indicated in the Wikipedia articles on [[RAD51]] and [[BRCA2]], such cancers ordinarily have epigenetic deficiencies in other DNA repair genes. These repair deficiencies would likely cause increased unrepaired DNA damages. The over-expression of ''RAD51'' and ''BRCA2'' seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory ''RAD51'' or ''BRCA2'' over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages.  In those cases where ''RAD51'' or ''BRCA2'' are under-expressed, this would itself lead to increased unrepaired DNA damages. Replication errors past these damages (see [[DNA repair#translesion synthesis|translesion synthesis]]) could cause increased mutations and cancer, so that under-expression of ''RAD51'' or ''BRCA2'' would be carcinogenic in itself.

Cyan-highlighted genes are in the [[microhomology-mediated end joining]] (MMEJ) pathway and are up-regulated in cancer.  MMEJ is an additional error-prone ''inaccurate'' repair pathway for double-strand breaks.  In MMEJ repair of a double-strand break, an homology of 5–25 complementary base pairs between both paired strands is sufficient to align the strands, but mismatched ends (flaps) are usually present. MMEJ removes the extra nucleotides (flaps) where strands are joined, and then ligates the strands to create an intact DNA double helix. MMEJ almost always involves at least a small deletion, so that it is a mutagenic pathway.&lt;ref name=Liang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Liang L, Deng L, Chen Y, Li GC, Shao C, Tischfield JA |title= Modulation of DNA end joining by nuclear proteins |journal= J.

=== Genome-wide distribution of DNA repair in human somatic cells ===
Differential activity of DNA repair pathways across various regions of the human genome causes mutations to be very unevenly distributed within tumor genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Supek|first=Fran|last2=Lehner|first2=Ben|date=7 May 2015|title=Differential DNA mismatch repair underlies mutation rate variation across the human genome|journal=Nature|volume=521|issue=7550|pages=81–84|doi=10.1038/nature14173|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4425546|pmid=25707793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Christina L.|last2=Wang|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Chung|first3=Jongsuk|last4=Moslehi|first4=Homayoun|last5=Sanborn|first5=J.

==Evolution==
The basic processes of DNA repair are highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] among both [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]] and even among [[bacteriophage]]s ([[virus]]es which infect [[bacteria]]); however, more complex organisms with more complex genomes have correspondingly more complex repair mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Cromie"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00419-1 | last1 = Cromie | first1 = GA | last2 = Connelly | first2 = JC | last3 = Leach | first3 = DR | year = 2001 | title = Recombination at double-strand breaks and DNA ends: conserved mechanisms from phage to humans | url = | journal = Mol. Cell | volume = 8 | issue = 6| pages = 1163–74 | pmid = 11779493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of a large number of protein [[structural motif]]s to catalyze relevant chemical reactions has played a significant role in the elaboration of repair mechanisms during evolution. For an extremely detailed review of hypotheses relating to the evolution of DNA repair, see.&lt;ref name="obrien"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr040481v | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = PJ. | year = 2006 | title = Catalytic promiscuity and the divergent evolution of DNA repair enzymes | url = | journal = Chem Rev | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 720–52 | pmid = 16464022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fossil record]] indicates that single-cell life began to proliferate on the planet at some point during the [[Precambrian]] period, although exactly when recognizably modern life first emerged is unclear. [[Nucleic acid]]s became the sole and universal means of encoding genetic information, requiring DNA repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor. The emergence of Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere (known as the "[[oxygen catastrophe]]") due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms, as well as the presence of potentially damaging [[free radical]]s in the cell due to [[oxidative phosphorylation]], necessitated the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms that act specifically to counter the types of damage induced by [[oxidative stress]].

===Rate of evolutionary change===
On some occasions, DNA damage is not repaired, or is repaired by an error-prone mechanism that results in a change from the original sequence. When this occurs, [[mutation]]s may propagate into the genomes of the cell's progeny. Should such an event occur in a [[germ line]] cell that will eventually produce a [[gamete]], the mutation has the potential to be passed on to the organism's offspring. The rate of [[evolution]] in a particular species (or, in a particular gene) is a function of the rate of mutation. As a consequence, the rate and accuracy of DNA repair mechanisms have an influence over the process of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Maresca"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maresca | first1 = B | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = JH | year = 2006 | title = Sudden origins: a general mechanism of evolution based on stress protein concentration and rapid environmental change | url = | journal = Anat Rec B New Anat | volume = 289 | issue = 1| pages = 38–46 | pmid = 16437551 | doi = 10.1002/ar.b.20089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA damage protection and repair does not influence the rate of adaptation by gene regulation and by recombination and selection of alleles.  On the other hand, DNA damage repair and protection does influence the rate of accumulation of irreparable, advantageous, code expanding, inheritable mutations, and slows down the evolutionary mechanism for expansion of  the genome of organisms with new functionalities. The tension between evolvability and mutation repair and protection needs further investigation.

==Technology==
A technology named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (shortened to [[CRISPR]]-Cas9) was discovered in 2012.  The new technology allows anyone with molecular biology training to alter the genes of any species with precision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/crispr-dna-gene-editing-1.3339346 "CRISPR gene-editing tool has scientists thrilled — but nervous" CBC news. Author Kelly Crowe. November 30, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is cheaper, more efficient, and more precise than other technologies. With the help of CRISPR–Cas9, parts of a genome can be edited by scientists by removing, adding, or altering parts in a DNA sequence.

On 4 July 2011, [[Otto von Habsburg]], also known as Otto of Austria, former head of the [[House of Habsburg]] and [[wikt:sovereign|Sovereign]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (1922–2007) and former [[Crown Prince]] (1916–1918) and, by [[pretender|pretence]], [[Emperor-King]] (from 1922), of [[Austria-Hungary]]—or formally, of [[Emperor of Austria|Austria]], [[King of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia, Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia, Lodomeria]] and [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Illyria]], and of [[King of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] etc. etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francois R. Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/royalstyle.htm#austria |title=Royal Styles |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;—died at 98 years of age.

The following day, a 13-day period of mourning started in several countries formerly part of Austria-Hungary. Otto was entombed in the [[Imperial Crypt]] under the Capuchin Church in Vienna on 16 July and [[Heart-burial|his heart buried]] in [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] in Hungary on 17 July. Multiple [[requiem]]s were celebrated. Many foreign dignitaries—among them reigning or former monarchs [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], [[King Michael I of Romania]], [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria]], [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein]], and Fra' [[Matthew Festing]]—attended the Requiem Mass in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral on 16 July, presided over by Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]], which was followed by the entombment in the Imperial Crypt. Commemorations were also held in [[Bavaria]].

This was the most recent burial of a royal Habsburg in the Imperial Crypt—following a centuries-old ceremony—where 145 other members of the House of Habsburg, among them many [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and Austrian Emperors, have been entombed since 1633.&lt;ref group="f"&gt;Otto was the penultimate person to be buried in the Imperial Crypt, because the Crypt is almost full. After Otto's entombment, there is only one remaining place, which is reserved for [[Archduchess Yolande of Austria]], the wife of his brother who was buried there in 2008. Yolande was born in 1923, when Austria-Hungary no longer existed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1,000 invited guests and 100,000 members of the public attended the funeral in Vienna, which was broadcast live by [[ORF (broadcaster)|Austrian Television]]. A funeral procession over one kilometer long brought Otto's coffin from St. Stephen's Cathedral to the Imperial Crypt. The ceremonies led to large parts of central Vienna being closed down for public traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.at/news/oesterreich/wien/Otto-Habsburgs-letzter-Weg-Tausende-nehmen-Abschied;art931,579443 |title=Otto Habsburgs letzter Weg: Tausende nehmen Abschied |publisher=Heute.at |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eldest son of Charles I, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones of Austria, Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. With his father's ascent to the thrones in 1916, he was himself likely to become the Emperor. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful Emperor-King. Forced to live in exile with his family after 1918, Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, as an early proponent of European integration and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism. After the Second World War, he was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the [[International Paneuropean Union]], and served as a Member of the [[European Parliament]]. He played a central role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries.

He has been described as "the last Emperor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/kultur/article13492692/Der-letzte-Kaiser.html |title=Der letzte Kaiser |language=de |publisher=Welt.de |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the last Habsburg".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Michael Fleischhacker|title=Der letzte Habsburger|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/675163/Der-letzte-Habsburger|newspaper=Die Presse|date=2011-07-04|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his statement, Barroso pointed out that Otto had "made a central contribution to the opening of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the peaceful reunification of our continent that had been divided for too long".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Agence France Presse|title=04/07/2011EU, Austria mourn death of Otto Habsburg|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-news/eu-austria-mourn-death-of-otto-habsburg_160850.html|newspaper=Expatica|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Austria}} [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] – The main funeral ceremony took place in Vienna. The requiem was celebrated in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] on 16 July 2011 from 15:00, and was presided over by Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]], assisted by seven bishops from the various nations of Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jahn |first=George |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/oldest-son-of-austrias-1019916.html |title=Oldest son of Austria's last emperor buried |publisher=ajc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A message from Pope Benedict XVI, addressed to His Imperial Highness, Archduke Karl of Austria, was read by the papal [[nuncio]], Archbishop Peter Zurbriggen. The requiem was followed by a funeral procession through [[Innere Stadt]] and the entombment (following [[#Entombment ceremony|the traditional ceremony]]) of Otto and his wife, Regina, in the Imperial Crypt. Cardinal Schönborn said that the collection which was taken was given to the victims of the [[2011 Horn of Africa drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20110715_OTS0074/habsburg-requiem-kollekte-fuer-duerreopfer-in-afrika |title= Habsburg-Requiem: Kollekte für Dürreopfer in Afrika  |publisher=ots.at |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the lying in repose on 15 July, guards in traditional uniform stood in honour on either side of the two coffins, draped in the imperial yellow-black flag. Thousands of people paid their respect, and visitors were able to write into books of condolence. In front of the coffins, a number of [[Order (honour)|orders]], honours and decorations that Otto received throughout his life were laid out on velvet cushions. They include the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary]], Grand Cross of the [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold]], [[Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]], [[Order of Saint Januarius]], [[Order of Saint Hubert]], Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]], Grand Cross of the [[Legion of Honour]], Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit]], Sovereign Military Order of Malta Grand Cross Bailiff of Grace and Devotion, Grand Cross of the [[Order of Charles III]], Grand Cross of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]], and many others (for a list see [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lying_in_repose_Otto_von_Habsburg_Capuchin_Church_Vienna_3933.jpg  here]).

=== Entombment ceremony ===

A traditional ceremony during the funeral is when the procession of mourners arrives at the gates of the Capuchin Church, under which the Imperial Crypt lies, and the Herald knocks on the door. A [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] then asks "who demands entry?" The Herald responds with the name and title of the deceased. The Capuchin then responds "we don't know him/her." The same procedure is repeated once. Only on the third attempt, when the Herald responds with "a sinful, mortal human being", are the gates opened and the dead Habsburg admitted into the Crypt. In 1989, Otto's mother, [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Zita]], was first introduced with all her titles, and the second time introduced as "Zita, Her Majesty the Empress and Queen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/1308680797958/Viel-Pomp-auf-dem-Weg-in-die-Kapuzinergruft |title=Viel Pomp auf dem Weg in die Kapuzinergruft  |publisher=[[Der Standard]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulrich-Walter Lipp, a friend of the family, was chosen to be the Herald in 2011. Otto was first introduced as "Otto of Austria; former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary; Prince Royal of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia|Croatia, Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia, Lodomeria]], and [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Illyria]]; Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Grand Duchy of Cracow|Cracow]]; Duke of [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], of [[Duchy of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] and [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukowina]]; Grand Prince of [[Grand Principality of Transylvania|Transylvania]], Margrave of [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]]; [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia|Duke of Silesia]], [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]], [[Duchy of Parma|Parma, Piacenza]], [[Duchy of Guastalla|Guastalla]], [[Duchy of Auschwitz|Auschwitz]] and [[Duchy of Zator|Zator]], [[Duchy of Teschen|Teschen]], [[Duchy of Friuli|Friuli]], [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Zadar]]; Princely Count of [[House of Habsburg#History#Counts of Habsburg|Habsburg]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]]; Prince of [[Trento|Trent]] and [[Brixen]]; Margrave of [[Upper Lusatia|Upper]] and [[March of Lusatia|Lower Lusatia]] and [[March of Istria|Istria]]; Count of [[Hohenems]], [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], [[County of Bregenz|Bregenz]], [[Waldburg-Sonnenburg|Sonnenburg]] etc.; Lord of [[Trieste]], [[Kotor]] and the [[Windic March]], Grand Voivod of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar|Voivodeship of Serbia]] etc. etc."&lt;ref name="kathweb-introduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diepresse-introduction"/&gt; The traditional [[Emperor of Austria#Titles of the Emperor|Habsburg claims to Jerusalem and Austria]] were omitted.

The second time he was introduced as "Dr. Otto von Habsburg" and a number of his civic achievements, notably as President of the [[Paneuropean Union]] and [[Member of the European Parliament]], mentioned. "Otto Habsburg-Lothringen", the name Austrian authorities use when referring to him, was not used.&lt;ref name="kathweb-introduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diepresse-introduction"/&gt;

The third time he was introduced as "Otto, a mortal, sinful human being!"&lt;ref name="kathweb-introduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathweb.at/site/nachrichten/database/40470.html |title= Habsburg-Begräbnis mit Anklopf-Zeremonie an Wiener Kapuzinergruft |publisher=Kathweb.at |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diepresse-introduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/zeitgeschichte/677366/Klopfzeremonie_Wer-begehrt-Einlass?direct=674867&amp;_vl_backlink=/home/politik/index.do&amp;selChannel=624 |title=Klopfzeremonie: 'Wer begehrt Einlass?' |publisher=Diepresse.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benjamin Greschner |url=http://kathnews.de/cms/cms/front_content.php?idart=1065 |title= Vor Gott zählen nur Glaube und Gute Werke: Wortlaut und Sinn der 'Anklopf-Zeremonie' an der Wiener Kapuzinerkirche |publisher=Kathnews.de |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capuchin opening the gates, finally exclaiming "So he may come in", was Father Gottfried Undesser, the custodian of the Imperial Crypt, born in 1933 and a Capuchin since 1951. It was also Father Gottfried who opened the gates for Empress-Queen Zita in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatterhoelzl.at/joomla/files/Pfarrblatt/Archiv/Sommer-2006.pdf Gatterhölzner Pfarrnachrichten, No. 101/2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The Capuchins have been in charge of building and maintaining the Imperial Crypt since 1622.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.at/news/oesterreich/wien/Pater-Gottfried-oeffnet-Otto-Habsburg-die-Pforte-zur-Kapuzinergruft;art931,576840 |title= Pater Gottfried öffnet Otto Habsburg die Pforte zur Kapuzinergruft |publisher=heute.at |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/zeitgeschichte/678145/Der-Waechter-der-Kaisergruft |title= Der Wächter der Kaisergruft |publisher=diepresse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/chronik/art58,669975 |title= ChronikGottfried Undesser: Der Hüter der Kapuzinergruft |publisher=nachrichten.at |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart burial===
[[File:Pannonhalma - Bencés apátság.jpg|thumb|His heart was laid to rest in [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] in Hungary]]
On Sunday 17 July 2011, Otto's heart was buried in the Benedictine [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]], following a ceremony with [[vespers]] in Latin, and an [[ecumenical]] prayer. Archabbot Asztrik Várszegi, Reformed Bishop [[Gusztáv Bölcskei]], Lutheran Bishop Tamás Fabinyi, and Chief Rabbi Zsolt Markovics participated, together with around hundred members of the House of Habsburg and Deputy Prime Minister [[Zsolt Semjén]] with his wife representing the Hungarian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.hu/20110718/heart-of-otto-von-habsburg-interred-in-pannonhalma/ |title=Heart of Otto von Habsburg interred in Pannonhalma |publisher=Politics.hu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816220238/http://www.politics.hu/20110718/heart-of-otto-von-habsburg-interred-in-pannonhalma/# |archive-date=16 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A silver urn containing his heart was surrounded by a wreath of flowers and leaves in the colours of the [[Hungarian flag]]—red, white and green. His sons Karl (Károly in Hungary) and Georg (György) finally carried the urn to the crypt, where it was buried under a marble slab.&lt;ref name="bbc14181800"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell |first=Bethany |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14181800 |title=Habsburg funeral sparks nostalgia and admiration |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 18 July 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Albin, one of the monastery's monks, said that "Hungary never expelled him personally, and he wanted to be buried in a country which still loves him."&lt;ref name="bbc14181800"/&gt;

With the burial of his heart, 12 days of commemoration and funeral ceremonies in several countries were concluded.

His heart urn lists his name and titles as:

In April 1962, Vietti came back to the United States and visited with her family in Houston and [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16344907/st_louis_postdispatch/|title=Dr. Teresa J.

Burial options the company offers are Earth-orbit and then reentry burnup, lunar burial, and deep-space burial beyond the [[Solar System]]. The company was the first to offer burial on the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name=Fortune-2015-08-24&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://fortune.com/2015/08/24/elysium-space-lunar-burial/ |title= This company is offering the first ever lunar burial |author= Michal Addady |date= 24 August 2015 |publisher= Fortune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysium Space was founded by Thomas Civeit in 2013.&lt;ref name=SN-2017-05-16&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spacenews.com/a-cubesat-packed-with-cremated-remains-slotted-for-spacex-rideshare-mission/ |title= A cubesat packed with cremated remains slotted for SpaceX rideshare mission |author= Debra Werner |date= 16 May 2017 |publisher= SpaceNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a launch aboard a USAF [[Super Strypi]] rocket failed to reach orbit. The remains will be reflown in the second launch. The remains were to have orbited for 2 years before reentering and going out in a blaze.&lt;ref name=TC-2017-05-16&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/elysium-space-to-launch-the-first-ever-memorial-spacecraft-via-spacex/ |title= Elysium Space to launch the first ever ‘memorial spacecraft’ via SpaceX |author= Darrell Etherington |date= 16 May 2017 |publisher= Tech Crunch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will offer a service to launch the ashes of dead people into space aboard a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] rocket that will launch from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[California]], United States. This rocket rideshare will launch ashes into a [[Sun-synchronous orbit]] about the Earth. The Earth orbiting ashes will eventually have its orbit decay and return to Earth as a shooting star.&lt;ref name=TC-2017-05-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Geek.com-2017-05-20&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.geek.com/tech-science-3/spacex-will-launch-human-remains-later-this-year-1700184/ |title= SpaceX Will Launch Human Remains Later This Year |author= Daniel Starkey |date= 20 May 2017 |publisher= Geek.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial spacecraft==
Elysium Space launches the cremated remains aboard their '''Elysium Star''' space [[mausoleum]] satellites, a series of 1U [[cubesat]]s. The Earth-orbiting satellites are designed to remain in space for 2 years before orbital decay brings them back to Earth as a [[Meteoroid|shooting star]], burning up in a blazing [[reentry]].&lt;ref name=Wired-2017-05-16&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/spacex-elysium-rocket |title= You can now send your loved one's ashes into orbit on a SpaceX rocket |author= Abigail Beall |date= 16 May 2017 |publisher= Wired UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18442">'''Eugenio Berríos Sagredo''' (November 14, 1947 &amp;ndash; 1992) was a [[Chile]]an [[biochemist]] who worked for the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] intelligence agency. 
Berríos was charged with carrying out ''[[Proyecto Andrea]]'' in which [[Pinochet]] ordered the production of [[sarin gas]], a [[chemical weapon]] used by the DINA. Sarin gas leaves no trace and victims' deaths closely mimic [[heart attack]]s.&lt;ref name=Clarin/&gt; Other [[biochemical weapons]] produced by Berríos included [[anthrax]] and [[botulism]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;Jonathan Franklin, [https://www.theguardian.com/chile/story/0,,1818137,00.html Pinochet 'sold cocaine to Europe and US'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 11, 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berríos also allegedly produced [[cocaine]] for Pinochet, who then [[illegal drug trade|sold it to Europe and the United States]].&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt; In the late 1970s, at the height of [[Beagle conflict|Beagle Crisis]] between Chile and Argentina, Berríos is reported to have worked on a plan to poison the [[Water supply network|water supply]] of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=González |first=Mónica |date=October 19, 2002 |title=En 1978, la DINA planeó envenenar el agua de Buenos Aires |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/10/19/i-03104.htm |newspaper=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |location= |access-date=February 2, 2016 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=October 19, 2002 |title=Chile planeó un ataque biológico en 1978 |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/442030-chile-planeo-un-ataque-biologico-en-1978 |newspaper=[[La Nación]] |location= |access-date=February 2, 2016 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanted by the Chilean authorities for involvement in the [[Letelier case]], he escaped to Uruguay in 1991, at the beginning of the [[Chilean transition to democracy]], and what has been identified as his corpse was found in 1995 near [[Montevideo]].

== DINA agent ==

Known in the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] under his alias "Hermes", for which he began to work in 1974, Berríos was connected to the creation of the explosive used for [[Orlando Letelier]]'s car-bombing assassination in Washington, D.C. in 1976.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In April 1976, Berríos synthesized [[sarin]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} He was also suspected, along with DINA agent [[Michael Townley]], of the torture and assassination of the Spanish citizen [[Carmelo Soria]]. 

In 1978, Townley, in a sworn but confidential declaration, stated that sarin gas was produced by the DINA under Berríos' direction. He added that it was used to assassinate the real state archives custodian [[Renato León Zenteno]] and the [[Chilean Army]] Corporal [[Manuel Leyton]].&lt;ref name=SarinB&gt;''Townley reveló uso de gas sarín antes de ser expulsado de Chile'', ''[[El Mercurio]]'', September 19, 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former head of DINA [[Manuel Contreras]] declared to Chilean justice officials in 2005 that the CNI, successor of DINA, handed out monthly payments between 1978 and 1990 to the persons who had worked with Townley in Chile, all members of the [[far-right]] group ''[[Patria y Libertad]]'': [[Mariana Callejas]] (Townley's wife), [[Francisco Oyarzún]], [[Gustavo Etchepare]] and Berríos.&lt;ref name="Tercera"&gt;[http://www.cctt.cl/din/?q=node/view/784 Contreras dice que Pinochet dio orden "personal, exclusiva y directa" de asesinar a Prats y Letelier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045431/http://www.cctt.cl/din/?q=node%2Fview%2F784 |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''[[La Tercera]]'', May 13, 2005, mirrored on CC.TT. website {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]'', Berríos also worked with drug traffickers and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents.&lt;ref name=Sanhueza&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050924/pags/20050924223646.html El coronel que le pena al ejército] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312003922/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050924/pags/20050924223646.html |date=2007-03-12 }}, ''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]'', September 24, 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frei Montalva ==

Questioned in March 2005 by Judge [[Alejandro Madrid]] about ex-Chilean Christian Democrat President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]]'s death, DINA agent [[Michael Townley]] acknowledged links between [[Colonia Dignidad]], led by [[List of living Nazis|ex-Nazi]] [[Paul Schäfer]], and DINA on one hand, and the [[Laboratorio de Guerra Bacteriológica del Ejército]] (Army Biological Warfare Laboratory) on the other hand. It is suspected that the toxin that killed Frei Montalva in a Santa Maria clinic in 1982 was created there. This new laboratory in Colonia Dignidad would have been, according to him, the continuation of the laboratory that the DINA had in Via Naranja de lo Curro, where he worked with Eugenio Berríos in the clandestine unit ''Quetropilla''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Townley would also have testified on biological experiments made upon the prisoners in Colonia Dignidad with the help of the two above-mentioned laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20050330/pags/20050330114755.html Michael Townley fue interrogado por muerte de Frei Montalva] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404100951/http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cooperativa.cl%2Fp4_noticias%2Fsite%2Fartic%2F20050330%2Fpags%2F20050330114755.html |date=2006-04-04 }}, ''[[Radio Cooperativa]]'', 30 March 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriaviva.com/culpables/criminales%20c/covarrubias_valenzuela_eugenio.htm Confirman prisión de generales (R) en caso Berríos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607072920/http://www.memoriaviva.com/culpables/criminales%20c/covarrubias_valenzuela_eugenio.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}, ''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]'' (mirrored by ''Memoria viva''), 12 January 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year before the "[[terror archives]]" were found in Paraguay, Eugenio Berríos was escorted from Chile to Uruguay by the Special Unity of the [[DINE]] (Army's Intelligence agency), in order to escape testifying before a Chilean court in the [[Letelier case]] and in the other case concerning the 1976 assassination of the Spanish diplomat and [[CEPAL]] civil servant [[Carmelo Soria]].&lt;ref name=Periodista&gt;[http://www.elperiodista.cl/newtenberg/1620/article-59927.html Caso Berríos - La guerra secreta entre un espía y un abogado], ''[[El Periodista]]'', N°59, 8 April 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soria&gt;[http://www.memoriaviva.com/culpables/criminales%20c/covarrubias_valenzuela_eugenio.htm Rechazan libertad para ex uniformados en caso Berríos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607072920/http://www.memoriaviva.com/culpables/criminales%20c/covarrubias_valenzuela_eugenio.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}, ''[[La Tercera]]'' (mirrored by ''Memoria viva''), 12 January 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had just been indicted by the magistrate Adolfo Bañados in charge of the Letelier case.&lt;ref name=Clarin/&gt;

This is known as "Operation Silencio", which started in April 1991 in order to impede investigations by Chilean judges concerning crimes committed during [[Chile under Pinochet|Pinochet's dictatorship]], with the spiriting away of Arturo Sanhueza Ross, linked to the murder of [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Jecar Neghme]] in 1989. According to the [[Rettig Report]], Jecar Neghme's death was carried out by Chilean intelligence agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriaviva.com/Ejecutados/Ejecutados%20N/nehgme_cristi_jecar_antonio.htm Neghme Jecar Antonio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823160857/http://www.memoriaviva.com/Ejecutados/Ejecutados%20N/nehgme_cristi_jecar_antonio.htm |date=2007-08-23 }}, ''Memoria Viva'', {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1991, Carlos Herrera Jiménez, who killed trade-unionist [[Tucapel Jiménez]], flew away, before Berríos who followed in October 1991.&lt;ref name=Sanhueza/&gt; Berríos then used four different passports, Argentinian, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Brazilian, lifting concerns about [[Operation Condor]] still being in place. In Uruguay, he was protected by members of the Chilean and Uruguayan military intelligence as part of ''La cofradia'', alleged to be the direct heir of Operation Condor. 

In Uruguay, Berrios was hidden in the house of the Uruguayan Colonel Eduardo Radaelli, using the alias of "Tulio Orellana".&lt;ref name=Casella_involucra&gt;[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/lr3/larepublica/2007/02/05/politica/245452/casella-involucra-al-general-aguerrondo-en-el-caso-berrios/ Casella involucra al general Aguerrondo en el caso Berríos], ''[[La Republica (Uruguay)|La Republica]]'', 5 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berríos, however, escaped from Radaelli's home and presented himself on 15 November 1992 to a local police office in order to claim he had been kidnapped.&lt;ref name=Den/&gt; Uruguayan military officers Tomas Casella and Eduardo Radaelli then went to the police office to request the police to hand over Berríos, which was done. He was then never seen again.&lt;ref name=Casella_involucra/&gt;

In February 1993, Pinochet travelled to Uruguay, and the Uruguayan Tomas Casella was appointed as his [[aide-de-camp]].&lt;ref name=Casella_involucra/&gt; Casella, Radaelli and Washington Sarli (another Uruguayan military officer) then travelled, the same year, to Chile, to attend intelligence courses, although the courses were then cancelled (according to Casella, because some countries' intelligence officers could not attend) and they were invited to pass some days, with costs paid, in the [[Termas de Puyehue]].&lt;ref name=Casella_involucra/&gt; In a 2007 interview, Casella stated that he had first entered into contact with Berríos in March 1992 under the requests of a Chilean intelligence officer, and that he had immediately informed General [[Mario Aguerrondo]], then head of the [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]] Uruguayan military intelligence agency (now retired), who allegedly ordered him to remain in contact with the Chileans.&lt;ref name=Casella_involucra/&gt;

In June 1993, an anonymous letter sent to various Uruguayan deputies denounced Berríos' presence in the country, leading them to request of President [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]]'s government immediate investigations.&lt;ref name=Clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/05/26/agente.html Los restos son de Berríos], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', 26 May 1995 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacalle immediately, on June 6, 1993, dismissed the police chief of [[Canelones, Uruguay|Canelones]], Ramón Rivas, on charges of not having informed him of what had occurred. Three days later official investigations were initiated concerning the Berríos case. On June 9, 1993, 14 Army Generals met with the [[Minister of Defence (Uruguay)|Minister of Defence]] [[Mariano Brito]], and two days later, General [[Mario Aguerrondo]] was dismissed.&lt;ref name=Nizkor&gt;Andrés Capelán, [http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/uruguay/doc/capelan2.html Caso Berríos: la justicia uruguaya entre la espada y la pared.], [[Equipo Nizkor]], 20 June 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a corpse, identified by the Uruguayan justice as that of Berrios, was found in April 1995 in a beach of El Pinar, near [[Montevideo]], with two gunshots in the back of the neck, his murderers having tried to make the identification of his body impossible. However, [[forensic dentistry]] immediately led to his identification as Berríos. Furthermore, [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]] was also done several years later.

According to the daughter of [[Carmelo Soria]], the Spanish diplomat assassinated in 1976, Chilean Eduardo Aldunate Hermann, second-in-command of the [[MINUSTAH]] United Nations force in Haiti, was also involved in the assassination of Eugenio Berríos.&lt;ref name=Herman&gt;[http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20051011/pags/20051011122922.html Familia de Carmelo Soria pidió que se interrogue a militar a cargo de tropas en Haití]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Radio Cooperativa]]'', 11 October 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations concerning Berríos' disappearance ==

In July 2006, after having denounced [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s involvement in the cocaine trade, former DINA director [[Manuel Contreras]] asserted in a judicial document handed to Judge Claudio Pavez, presiding over the investigation concerning the 1992 assassination of Colonel [[Gerardo Huber]], that Berríos was in fact alive and now worked for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]].&lt;ref name="ContrerasBerrios"/&gt; Contreras' lawyer, Fidel Reyes, alleged that the corpse discovered in El Pinar belonged in reality to a foreigner, and that Berríos allegedly had in 2004 attended the funeral, in Chile, of one of his close relative.&lt;ref name=ContrerasBerrios/&gt; According to Contreras' deposition, the cocaine (which was "[[black cocaine]]" especially made to be undetectable) was produced by Berríos in a military installation in [[Talagante]], and both Pinochet's son, [[Marco Antonio Pinochet]], and the businessman [[Edgardo Bathich]] were involved in the drug trade.&lt;ref name=ContrerasBerrios/&gt; The money from the trade was allegedly directly put in Pinochet's bank accounts abroad.&lt;ref name=ContrerasBerrios/&gt;

Manuel Contreras' allegations concerning Berríos' alleged survival have been flatly denied by the Uruguayan judge in charge of investigating his assassination, who claims that she is "99% sure" of the identification of the corpse found in 1995, and added that [[DNA]] analysis had been made a few years later.&lt;ref name=Den&gt;[http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20060712/pags/20060712095721.html  Jueza uruguaya descartó que Eugenio Berríos esté vivo, como afirmó Contreras]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Radio Cooperativa]]'', 12 July 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==

The Uruguayan film director Esteban Schroeder produced a movie, ''Matar a todos'', loosely based on Berríos' murder. The movie was adapted from the book ''99 por ciento asesinado'' written by the Uruguayan writer Pablo Vierci, and was presented in the [[Donostia-San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastián International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/lr3/larepublica/2007/08/28/cultura/272675/filme-uruguayo-matar-a-todos-participara-en-san-sebastian/ Filme uruguayo "Matar a todos" participará en San Sebastián], [[La Republica (Uruguay)|La Republica]], 28 August 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related idea of [[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasil]] and other islands in [[Celtic mythology]] are sometimes conflated with the Greek sense of islands in the western Mediterranean: [[Sicily]], the [[Aeolian Islands]], the [[Aegadian Islands]] or other smaller islands of Sicily. Later on the islands were said to lie in the [[Oceanus|Western Ocean]] near the encircling River [[Oceanus]]; [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[the Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Bermuda]], and the [[Lesser Antilles]] have sometimes been cited as possible matches.

==Legend==
According to Greek mythology, the islands were reserved for those who had chosen to be reincarnated thrice, and managed to be judged as especially pure enough to gain entrance to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] all three times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 2. 57 ff&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of the fortunate islands is the connection with the god [[Cronus]]; the cult of Cronus had spread and connected to Sicily, in particular in the area near [[Agrigento]] where it was revered and in some areas associated with the cult of the Phoenician god Baal.{{citation needed|reason=Without citations, I believe this to be a reference to the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan. I don't believe it is grounded in historical myth. |date=September 2015}}

==Accounts==
[[Philostratus|Flavius Philostratus]]' ''[[Apollonius of Tyana|Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' (v.2) says, "And they also say that the Islands of the Blessed are to be fixed by the limits of [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] where they rise towards the uninhabited promontory." In this geography Libya was considered to extend westwards through [[Mauretania]] "as far as the mouth of the river Salex, some nine hundred [[Stadia (length)|stadia]], and beyond that point a further distance which no one can compute, because when you have passed this river Libya is a desert which no longer supports a population".

[[Plutarch]], who refers to the "fortunate isles" several times in his writings, locates them firmly in the Atlantic in his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of [[Sertorius]].  Sertorius, when struggling against a chaotic civil war in the closing years of the [[Roman Republic]], had tidings from mariners of certain islands a few days' sail from [[Hispania]]:
{{quotation|...where the air was never extreme, which for rain had a little silver dew, which of itself and without labour, bore all pleasant fruits to their happy dwellers, till it seemed to him that these could be no other than the Fortunate Islands, the Elysian Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', ch. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was from these men that Sertorius learned facts so beguiling that he made it his life's ambition to find the islands and retire there.
{{quotation|The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie 10,000 [[furlong]]s ( 2,000 kilometers / 1,250 miles ) from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed. [...]

Moreover an air that is salubrious, owing to the climate and the moderate changes in the seasons, prevails on the islands. The North and East winds which blow out from our part of the world plunge into fathomless space and, owing to the distance, dissipate themselves and lose their power before they reach the islands, while the South and West winds that envelop the islands sometimes bring in their train soft and intermittent showers, but for the most part cool them with moist breezes and gently nourish the soil. Therefore a firm belief has made its way, even to the barbarians, that here are the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] and the abode of the Blessed of which [[Homer]] sang.}}

[[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' adds to the obligate description—that they "abound in fruit and birds of every kind"—the unexpected detail "These islands, however, are greatly annoyed by the putrefying bodies of monsters, which are constantly thrown up by the sea".

The Isles are mentioned in Book II of ''[[A True History]]'' by the Greek satirist [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]. The author makes fun of the heroes residing there by giving an account of their petty squabbles as presented to the court of the magistrate, [[Rhadamanthus]]. He goes on to describe other observations of how the residents occupy their time, using every opportunity to satirise both contemporary life and Greek mythology.

[[Ptolemy]] used these islands as the reference for the measurement of geographical [[longitude]] and they continued to play the role of defining the [[prime meridian]] through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = John Kirtland | year = 1923 | title = Notes on the Knowledge of Latitudes and Longitudes in the Middle Ages | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–98 | publisher =  | jstor = 223599 | doi=10.1086/358121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern geography names these islands as [[Macaronesia]].

[[Lucio Russo]], in ''L'America dimenticata'',&lt;ref&gt;Lucio Russo, ''[https://www.amazon.it/LAmerica-dimenticata-rapporti-civilt%C3%A0-Tolomeo/dp/8861843085 L&amp;apos;America dimenticata]. I rapporti tra le civiltà e un errore di Tolomeo'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; puts forward the bold hypothesis (supported by means of statistical methods) that the Fortunate Isles were actually the [[Lesser Antilles]] and that [[Hipparchus]] knew their longitude with remarkable precision.

'''''Gallop and Ride''''' is a video game developed by Austrian studio Sproing Interactive Media GmbH and released by [[THQ]] on November 20, 2008 for the [[Wii]].

==Overview==

In ''Gallop and Ride'', you play as a boy or girl who works at his or her grandfather's ranch known as the Old Mill Ranch. Grandfather gave his grandchild the ranch after him and asked to put it back up to its formal glory. So, in the game, the main objective is to renovate all facilities back up for the guests and clients visiting. The player can choose from a wide variety of outfits. But, can only choose a small portion in the beginning of the game. The player has the option to use to game controls for riding: gesture or control stick. Both are the same as for games such as [[Paws and Claws: Pet Vet]]. In gesture, it is somewhat similar towards real-life, with all Wii Remote movement, and in control stick, the player uses the Nunchunk for movement, and clicks on buttons on the Wii Remote for speeding up or slowing down.

===Gameplay===

====Activities====

In the game, you are able to do many things. You can groom your horse using brushes or a hose. You can also clean your horse's hooves using a pick and a brush. You are able to cure your horses if they get sick, or call in a veterinarian. You can breed your horses as well. You can train foals. You can feed your horses hay, oats and barley, or pellets. You can have several types of blankets and saddles for your horse. You can take it out to ride in the fields, woods, or mountains. You can train your horse in order to go through competitions. You can also have guests to stay overnight in a sort-of-like hotel and have them ride your horses. You can also massage your horses in a therapy center or put them inside a paddock to reduce stress. You can clean out the stalls in the stable. You can pick up carrots in your garden and use them for tidbits or for foal training. You can also read books that allow you to higher advance your facilities.

====You and Your Horse====

You can choose from 3 breeds: [[Friesian horse|Friesan]], [[Hanoverian horse|Hanoverian]], and [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]]; from 7 colors: black, white, gray, bay, red, cream, and palomino; and from 6 patterns: black hair (mane and tail), solid, pinto, dapple, socks, and stripes. You can braid your horse's mane and name your horse. The gender is uncertain. The player can be either gender and any name and can choose from a wide range of outfits that can be purchased. Though the names can only have so many characters in them.

'''Gaussian adaptation (GA)''' (also referred to as normal or natural adaptation and sometimes abbreviated as NA) is an [[evolutionary algorithm]] designed for the maximization of manufacturing yield due to statistical deviation of component values of [[signal processing]] systems. In short, GA is a stochastic adaptive process where a number of samples of an ''n''-dimensional vector ''x''[''x''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')] are taken from a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]], ''N''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''M''), having mean ''m'' and [[covariance matrix|moment matrix]] ''M''. The samples are tested for fail or pass. The first- and second-order moments of the Gaussian restricted to the pass samples are ''m*'' and&amp;nbsp;''M*''.

The outcome of ''x'' as a pass sample is determined by a function ''s''(''x''), 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, such that ''s''(''x'') is the probability that x will be selected as a pass sample. The average probability of finding pass samples (yield) is

:&lt;math&gt; P(m) = \int s(x) N(x - m)\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Then the theorem of GA states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For any ''s''(''x'') and for any value of ''P&amp;nbsp;''&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q'', there always exist a Gaussian p. d. f. [ [[probability density function]] ] that is adapted for maximum dispersion. The necessary conditions for a local optimum are ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''* and ''M'' proportional to ''M''*. The dual problem is also solved: ''P'' is maximized while keeping the dispersion constant (Kjellström, 1991).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proofs of the theorem may be found in the papers by Kjellström, 1970, and Kjellström &amp; Taxén, 1981.

Since dispersion is defined as the exponential of entropy/disorder/[[average information]] it immediately follows that the theorem is valid also for those concepts. Altogether, this means that Gaussian adaptation may carry out a simultaneous maximisation of yield and [[average information]] (without any need for the yield or the [[average information]] to be defined as criterion functions).

'''The theorem is valid for all regions of acceptability and all Gaussian distributions'''. It may be used by cyclic repetition of random variation and selection (like the natural evolution). In every cycle a sufficiently large number of Gaussian distributed points are sampled and tested for membership in the region of acceptability. The centre of gravity of the Gaussian, ''m'', is then moved to the centre of gravity of the approved (selected) points, ''m''*. Thus, the process converges to a state of equilibrium fulfilling the theorem. A solution is always approximate because the centre of gravity is always determined for a limited number of points.

It was used for the first time in 1969 as a pure optimization algorithm making the regions of acceptability smaller and smaller (in analogy to [[simulated annealing]], Kirkpatrick 1983). Since 1970 it has been used for both ordinary optimization and yield maximization.

==Natural evolution and Gaussian adaptation==
It has also been compared to the natural evolution of populations of living organisms. In this case ''s''(''x'') is the probability that the individual having an array ''x'' of phenotypes will survive by giving offspring to the next generation; a definition of individual fitness given by Hartl 1981. The yield, ''P'', is replaced by the [[mean fitness]] determined as a mean over the set of individuals in a large population.

Phenotypes are often Gaussian distributed in a large population and a necessary condition for the natural evolution to be able to fulfill the theorem of Gaussian adaptation, with respect to all Gaussian quantitative characters, is that it may push the centre of gravity of the Gaussian to the centre of gravity of the selected individuals. This may be accomplished by the [[Hardy–Weinberg law]]. This is possible because the theorem of Gaussian adaptation is valid for any region of acceptability independent of the structure (Kjellström, 1996).

In this case the rules of genetic variation such as crossover, inversion, transposition etcetera may be seen as random number generators for the phenotypes. So, in this sense Gaussian adaptation may be seen as a genetic algorithm.

==How to climb a mountain==
Mean fitness may be calculated provided that the distribution of parameters and the structure of the landscape is known. The real landscape is not known, but figure below shows a fictitious profile (blue) of a landscape along a line (x) in a room spanned by such parameters. The red curve is the mean based on the red bell curve at the bottom of  figure. It is obtained by letting the bell curve slide along the ''x''-axis, calculating the mean at every location. As can be seen, small peaks and pits are smoothed out. Thus, if evolution is started at A with a relatively small variance (the red bell curve), then climbing will take place on the red curve. The process may get stuck for millions of years at B or C, as long as the hollows to the right of these points remain, and the mutation rate is too small.

[[Image:Fraktal.gif]]

If the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the disorder or variance  may increase and the parameter(s) may become distributed like the green bell curve. Then the climbing will take place on the green curve, which is even more smoothed out. Because the hollows to the right of B and C have now disappeared, the process may continue up to the peaks at D. But of course the landscape puts a limit on the disorder or variability. Besides &amp;mdash; dependent on the landscape &amp;mdash; the process may become very jerky, and if the ratio between the time spent by the process at a local peak and the time of transition to the next peak is very high, it may as well look like a [[punctuated equilibrium]] as suggested by Gould (see Ridley).

==Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation==
Thus far the theory only considers mean values of continuous distributions corresponding to an infinite number of individuals. In reality however, the number of individuals is always limited, which gives rise to an uncertainty in the estimation of ''m'' and ''M'' (the moment matrix of the Gaussian). And this may also affect the efficiency of the process. Unfortunately very little is known about this, at least theoretically.

The implementation of normal adaptation on a computer is a fairly simple task. The adaptation of m may be done by one sample (individual) at a time, for example

: ''m''(''i'' + 1) = (1 – ''a'') ''m''(''i'') + ''ax''

where ''x'' is a pass sample, and ''a'' &lt; 1 a suitable constant so that the inverse of a represents the number of individuals in the population.

''M'' may in principle be updated after every step ''y'' leading to a feasible point

: ''x'' = ''m'' + ''y'' according to:

: ''M''(''i'' + 1) = (1 – 2''b'') ''M''(''i'') + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where ''y''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of ''y'' and ''b'' &lt;&lt; 1 is another suitable constant. In order to guarantee a suitable increase of [[average information]], ''y'' should be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with moment matrix ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', where the scalar ''μ'' &gt; 1 is used to increase [[average information]] ([[information entropy]], disorder, diversity) at a suitable rate. But ''M'' will never be used in the calculations. Instead we use the matrix ''W'' defined by ''WW''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''M''.

Thus, we have ''y'' = ''Wg'', where ''g'' is normally distributed with the moment matrix ''μU'', and ''U'' is the unit matrix. ''W'' and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; may be updated by the formulas

: ''W'' = (1 – ''b'')''W'' + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;   and   ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 – ''b'')''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bgy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;

because multiplication gives

: ''M'' = (1 – 2''b'')''M'' + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where terms including ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been neglected. Thus, ''M'' will be indirectly adapted with good approximation. In practice it will suffice to update ''W'' only

: ''W''(''i'' + 1)  = (1 – ''b'')''W''(''i'') + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is the formula used in a simple 2-dimensional model of a brain satisfying the Hebbian rule of associative learning; see the next section (Kjellström, 1996 and 1999).

The figure below illustrates the effect of increased [[average information]] in a Gaussian p.d.f. used to climb a mountain Crest (the two lines represent the contour line). Both the red and green cluster have equal mean fitness, about 65%, but the green cluster has a much higher [[average information]] making the green process much more efficient. The effect of this adaptation is not very salient in a 2-dimensional case, but in a high-dimensional case, the efficiency of the search process may be increased by many orders of magnitude.

==The evolution in the brain==
In the brain the evolution of DNA-messages is supposed to be replaced by an evolution of signal patterns and the phenotypic landscape is replaced by a mental landscape, the complexity of which will hardly be second to the former. The metaphor with the mental landscape is based on the assumption that certain signal patterns give rise to a better well-being or performance. For instance, the control of a group of muscles leads to a better pronunciation of a word or performance of a piece of music.

In this simple model it is assumed that the brain consists of interconnected components that may add, multiply and delay signal values.
* A nerve cell kernel may add signal values,
* a synapse may multiply with a constant and
* An axon may delay values.
This is a basis of the theory of digital filters and neural networks consisting of components that may add, multiply and delay signalvalues and also of many brain models, Levine 1991.

In the figure below the brain stem is supposed to deliver Gaussian distributed signal patterns. This may be possible since certain neurons fire at random (Kandel et al.). The stem also constitutes a disordered structure surrounded by more ordered shells (Bergström, 1969), and according to the [[central limit theorem]] the sum of signals from many neurons may be Gaussian distributed. The triangular boxes represent synapses and the boxes with the + sign are cell kernels.

In the cortex signals are supposed to be tested for feasibility. When a signal is accepted the contact areas in the synapses are updated according to the formulas below in agreement with the Hebbian theory. The figure shows a 2-dimensional computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation according to the last formula in the preceding section.

[[Image:Schematic of a neural network executing the Gaussian adaptation algorithm.GIF]]

''m'' and ''W'' are updated according to:

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''1;   ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

As can be seen this is very much like a small brain ruled by the theory of [[Hebbian learning]] (Kjellström, 1996, 1999 and 2002).

==Gaussian adaptation and free will==
Gaussian adaptation as an evolutionary model of the brain obeying the [[Hebbian theory]] of associative learning offers an alternative view of [[free will]] due to the ability of the process to maximize the mean fitness of signal patterns in the brain by climbing a mental landscape in analogy with phenotypic evolution.

Such a random process gives us lots of freedom of choice, but hardly any will. An illusion of will may, however, emanate from the ability of the process to maximize mean fitness, making the process goal seeking. I. e., it prefers higher peaks in the landscape prior to lower, or better alternatives prior to worse. In this way an illusive will may appear. A similar view has been given by Zohar 1990. See also Kjellström 1999.

==A theorem of efficiency for random search==
The efficiency of Gaussian adaptation relies on the theory of information due to Claude E. Shannon (see [[information content]]). When an event occurs with probability ''P'', then the information &amp;minus;log(''P'') may be achieved. For instance, if the mean fitness is ''P'', the information gained for each individual selected for survival will be &amp;minus;log(''P'') – on the average - and the work/time needed to get  the information is proportional to 1/''P''. Thus, if efficiency, E, is defined as information divided by the work/time needed to get it we have:

: ''E'' = &amp;minus;''P'' log(''P'').

This function attains its maximum when ''P'' = 1/''e'' = 0.37. The same result has been obtained by Gaines with a different method.

''E'' = 0 if ''P'' = 0, for a process with infinite mutation rate, and if ''P'' = 1, for a process with mutation rate = 0 (provided that the process is alive).
This measure of efficiency is valid for a large class of [[random search]] processes provided that certain conditions are at hand.

1  The search should be statistically independent and equally efficient in different parameter directions. This condition may be approximately fulfilled when the moment matrix of the Gaussian has been adapted for maximum [[average information]] to some region of acceptability, because linear transformations of the whole process do not affect efficiency.

2   All individuals have equal cost and the derivative at ''P'' = 1 is &lt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Then, the following theorem may be proved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All measures of efficiency, that satisfy the conditions above, are asymptotically proportional to –''P'' log(''P/q'') when the number of dimensions increases, and are maximized by ''P'' = ''q'' exp(-1) (Kjellström, 1996 and 1999).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Efficiency.GIF]]

The figure above shows a possible efficiency function for a random search process such as Gaussian adaptation. To the left the process is most chaotic when ''P'' = 0, while there is perfect order to the right where ''P'' = 1.

In an example by Rechenberg, 1971, 1973, a random walk is pushed thru a corridor maximizing the parameter ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case the region of acceptability is defined as a (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional interval in the parameters ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but a ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-value below the last accepted will never be accepted. Since ''P'' can never exceed 0.5 in this case, the maximum speed towards higher ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-values is reached for ''P'' = 0.5/''e'' = 0.18, in agreement with the findings of Rechenberg.

A point of view that also may be of interest in this context is that no definition of information (other than that sampled points inside some region of acceptability gives information about the extension of the region) is needed for the proof of the theorem. Then, because, the formula may be interpreted as information divided by the work needed to get the information, this is also an indication that &amp;minus;log(''P'') is a good candidate for being a measure of information.

==The Stauffer and Grimson algorithm==
Gaussian adaptation has also been used for other purposes as for instance shadow removal by "The Stauffer-Grimson algorithm" which is equivalent to Gaussian adaptation as used in the section "Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation" above. In both cases the maximum likelihood method is used for estimation of mean values by adaptation at one sample at a time.

But there are differences. In the Stauffer-Grimson case the information is not used for the control of a random number generator for centering, maximization of mean fitness, [[average information]] or manufacturing yield. The adaptation of the moment matrix also differs very much as compared to "the evolution in the brain" above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36860">'''Genome instability''' (also '''genetic instability''' or '''genomic instability''') refers to a high frequency of [[mutation]]s within the genome of a cellular lineage.  These mutations can include changes in [[nucleic acid sequence]]s, [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s or [[aneuploidy]]. Genome instability does occur in bacteria.&lt;ref name=Darmon&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darmon | first1 = E | last2 = Leach | first2 = DRF | date = 2014 | title = Bacterial Genome Instability | journal = Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. | volume = 78 | pages = 1–39 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00035-13 | pmc = 3957733 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In multicellular organisms genome instability is central to carcinogenesis,&lt;ref name=Schmitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = MW | last2 = Prindle | first2 = MJ | last3 = Loeb | first3 = LA | date = 2012 | title = Implications of genetic heterogeneity in cancer | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1267 | pages = 110–116 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06590.x | pmid = 22954224 | pmc=3674777}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in humans it is also a factor in some neurodegenerative diseases such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] or the neuromuscular disease [[myotonic dystrophy]].

The sources of genome instability have only recently begun to be elucidated. A high frequency of externally caused DNA damage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Møller | first1 = P | date = 2005 | title = Genotoxicity of environmental agents assessed by the alkaline comet assay | journal = Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol | volume = 96 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 1–42 | pmid = 15859009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be one source of genome instability since DNA damages can cause inaccurate translesion synthesis past the damages or errors in repair, leading to [[mutation]].  Another source of genome instability may be [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] or [[mutation]]al reductions in expression of DNA repair genes.  Because [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|endogenous (metabolically-caused) DNA damage]] is very frequent, occurring on average more than 60,000 times a day in the genomes of human cells, any reduced DNA repair is likely an important source of genome instability.

==The usual genome situation==

Usually, all cells in an individual in a given species (plant or animal) show a constant number of [[chromosome]]s, which constitute what is known as the [[karyotype]] defining this species (see also [[List of number of chromosomes of various organisms]]), although some species present a very high karyotypic variability.  In humans, mutations that would change an amino acid within the protein coding region of the genome occur at an average of only 0.35 per generation (less than one mutated protein per generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keightley PD |title=Rates and fitness consequences of new mutations in humans |journal=Genetics |volume=190 |issue=2 |pages=295–304 |date=February 2012 |pmid=22345605 |pmc=3276617 |doi=10.1534/genetics.111.134668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, in a species with a stable karyotype, random variations that modify the normal number of chromosomes may be observed. In other cases, there are structural alterations ([[chromosomal translocation]]s, [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]s ...) that modify the standard chromosomal complement. In these cases, it is indicated that the affected organism presents genome instability (also ''genetic instability'', or even ''chromosomic instability''). The process of genome instability often leads to a situation of [[aneuploidy]], in which the cells present a chromosomic number that is either higher or lower than the normal complement for the species.

==Causes of genome instability==

===DNA Replication Defects===
In the cell cycle, DNA is usually most vulnerable during replication. The replisome must be able to navigate obstacles such as tightly wound chromatin with bound proteins, single and double stranded breaks which can lead to the stalling of the replication fork. Each protein or enzyme in the replisome must perform its function well to result in a perfect copy of DNA. Mutations of proteins such as DNA polymerase, ligase, can lead to impairment of replication and lead to spontaneous chromosomal exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aguilera|first1=A|last2=Klein|first2=H. L.|title=Genetic control of intrachromosomal recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I. Isolation and genetic characterization of hyper-recombination mutations|journal=Genetics|date=Aug 1998|volume=4|issue=4|pages=779–790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins such as Tel1, Mec1 (ATR, ATM in humans) can detect single and double-stranded breaks and recruit factors such as Rmr3 helicase to stabilize the replication fork in order to prevent its collapse. Mutations in Tel1, Mec1, and Rmr3 helicase result in a significant increase of chromosomal recombination. ATR responds specifically to stalled replication forks and single-stranded breaks resulting from UV damage while ATM responds directly to double-stranded breaks. These proteins also prevent progression into mitosis by inhibiting the firing of late replication origins until the DNA breaks are fixed by phosphorylating CHK1, CHK2 which results in a signaling cascade arresting the cell in S-phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cobb|first1=J. A.|title=Replisome instability, fork collapse, and gross chromosomal rearrangements arise synergistically from Mec1 kinase and RecQ helicase mutations|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=Dec 2005|volume=19|issue=24|pages=3055–3069|doi=10.1101/gad.361805|pmc=1315408}}&lt;/ref&gt; For single stranded breaks, replication occurs until the location of the break, then the other strand is nicked to form a double stranded break, which can then be repaired by Break Induced Replication or homologous recombination using the sister chromatid as an error-free template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cortes-Ledesma|first1=Felipe|last2=Aguilera|first2=Andres|title=Double-strand breaks arising from replication through a nick are repaired by cohesin-dependent sister-chromatid exchange|journal=EMBO Reports|date=Sep 2006|volume=7|issue=9|pages=919–926|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400774|pmc=1559660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to S-phase checkpoints, G1 and G2 checkpoints exist to check for transient DNA damage which could be caused by mutagens such as UV damage. An example is the Saccharomyces pombe gene rad9 which arrests the cells in late S/G2 phase in the presence of DNA damage caused by radiation. The yeast cells with defective rad9 failed to arrest following radiation, continued cell division and died rapidly while the cells with wild-type rad9 successfully arrested in late S/G2 phase and remained viable. The cells that arrested were able to survive due to the increased time in S/G2 phase allowing for DNA repair enzymes to function fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinert|first1=T. A.|last2=Hartwell|first2=L. H.|title=Cell cycle arrest of cdc mutants and specificity of the RAD9 checkpoint|journal=Genetics|date=May 1993|volume=134|issue=1|pages=63–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragile Sites===
There are hotspots in the genome where DNA sequences are prone to gaps and breaks after inhibition of DNA synthesis such as in the aforementioned checkpoint arrest. These sites are called fragile sites, and can occur commonly as naturally present in most mammalian genomes or occur rarely as a result of mutations, such as DNA-repeat expansion. Rare fragile sites can lead to genetic disease such as fragile X mental retardation syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Friedrich’s ataxia, and Huntington’s disease, most of which are caused by expansion of repeats at the DNA, RNA, or protein level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durkin|first1=Sandra G.|last2=Glover|first2=Thomas W.|title=Chromosome Fragile Sites|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|date=Dec 2007|volume=41|issue=1|pages=169–192|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.41.042007.165900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, seemingly harmful, these common fragile sites are conserved all the way to yeast and bacteria. These ubiquitous sites are characterized by trinucleotide repeats, most commonly CGG, CAG, GAA, and GCN. These trinucleotide repeats can form into hairpins, leading to difficulty of replication. Under replication stress, such as defective machinery or further DNA damage, DNA breaks and gaps can form at these fragile sites. Using a sister chromatid as repair is not a fool-proof backup as the surrounding DNA information of the n and n+1 repeat is virtually the same, leading to copy number variation. For example, the 16th copy of CGG might be mapped to the 13th copy of CGG in the sister chromatid since the surrounding DNA is both CGGCGGCGG…, leading to 3 extra copies of CGG in the final DNA sequence.

===Transcription-associated instability===
In both E. coli and Saccromyces pombe, transcription sites tend to have higher recombination and mutation rates. The coding or non-transcribed strand accumulates more mutations than the template strand. This is due to the fact that the coding strand is single-stranded during transcription, which is chemically more unstable than double-stranded DNA. During elongation of transcription, supercoiling can occur behind an elongating RNA polymerase, leading to single-stranded breaks. When the coding strand is single-stranded, it can also hybridize with itself, creating DNA secondary structures that can compromise replication. In E. coli, when attempting to transcribe GAA triplets such as those found in Friedrich’s ataxia, the resulting RNA and template strand can form mismatched loops between different repeats, leading the complementary segment in the coding-strand available to form its own loops which impede replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabczyk|first1=E.|last2=Mancuso|first2=M.|last3=Sammarco|first3=M. C.|title=A persistent RNA-DNA hybrid formed by transcription of the Friedreich ataxia triplet repeat in live bacteria, and by T7 RNAP in vitro|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Aug 2007|volume=35|issue=16|pages=5351–5359|doi=10.1093/nar/gkm589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, replication of DNA and transcription of DNA are not temporally independent; they can occur at the same time and lead to collisions between the replication fork and RNA polymerase complex. In S. cerevisiae, Rrm3 helicase is found at highly transcribed genes in the yeast genome, which is recruited to stabilize a stalling replication fork as described above. This suggests that transcription is an obstacle to replication, which can lead to increased stress in the chromatin spanning the short distance between the unwound replication fork and transcription start site, potentially causing single-stranded DNA breaks. In yeast, proteins act as barriers at the 3’ of the transcription unit to prevent further travel of the DNA replication fork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trautinger|first1=Brigitte W.|last2=Jaktaji|first2=Razieh P.|last3=Rusakova|first3=Ekaterina|last4=Lloyd|first4=Robert G.|title=RNA Polymerase Modulators and DNA Repair Activities Resolve Conflicts between DNA Replication and Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|date=July 2005|volume=19|issue=2|pages=247–258|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2005.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increase Genetic Variability===
In some portions of the genome, variability is essential to survival. One such locale is the Ig genes. In a pre-B cell, the region consists of all V, D, and J segments. During development of the B cell, a specific V, D, and J segment is chosen to be spliced together to form the final gene, which is catalyzed by RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases.  Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) then converts cytidine into uracil. Uracil normally does not exist in DNA, and thus the base is excised and the nick is converted into a double-stranded break which is repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This procedure is very error-prone and leads to somatic hypermutation. This genomic instability is crucial in ensuring mammalian survival against infection. V, D, J recombination can ensure millions of unique B-cell receptors; however, random repair by NHEJ introduces variation which can create a receptor that can bind with higher affinity to antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrader|first1=Carol E.|last2=Guikema|first2=Jeroen E. J.|last3=Linehan|first3=Erin K.|last4=Selsing|first4=Erik|last5=Stavnezer|first5=Janet|title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase-dependent DNA breaks in class switch recombination occur during G1 phase of the cell cycle and depend upon mismatch repair|journal=Journal of Immunology|date=Nov 2007|volume=179|issue=9|pages=6064–6071|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.179.9.6064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In neuronal and neuromuscular disease==

Of about 200 neurological and neuromuscular disorders, 15 have a clear link to an inherited or acquired defect in one of the DNA repair pathways or excessive genotoxic oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;Subba Rao K.

Six ([[spinocerebellar ataxia]] with axonal neuropathy-1, [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Down's syndrome]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]) seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this causes.  Four of them (Huntington's disease, various [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]s, [[Friedreich’s ataxia]] and [[myotonic dystrophy]] types 1 and 2) often have an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, likely attributable to genome instability.  Four ([[ataxia-telangiectasia]], ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, [[Nijmegen breakage syndrome]] and Alzheimer's disease) are defective in genes involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks. Overall, it seems that oxidative stress is a major cause of genomic instability in the brain.  A particular neurological disease arises when a pathway that normally prevents oxidative stress is deficient, or a DNA repair pathway that normally repairs damage caused by oxidative stress is deficient.

Situations of genome instability (as well as aneuploidy) are common in cancer cells, and they are considered a "hallmark" for these cells.

===Cause of mutations in cancer===
The likely major underlying cause of mutations in cancer is DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Prasad AR, Nfonsam V, Bernstein H.  (2013).

Externally and endogenously caused damages may be converted into mutations by inaccurate [[translesion synthesis]] or inaccurate DNA repair (e.g. by [[non-homologous end joining]]).  In addition, DNA damages can also give rise to [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations during DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cuozzo | first1 = C | last2 = Porcellini | first2 = A | last3 = Angrisano | first3 = T | last4 = Morano | first4 = A | last5 = Lee | first5 = B | last6 = Di Pardo | first6 = A | last7 = Messina | first7 = S | last8 = Iuliano | first8 = R | last9 = Fusco | first9 = A | last10 = Santillo | first10 = MR | last11 = Muller | first11 = MT | last12 = Chiariotti | first12 = L | last13 = Gottesman | first13 = ME | last14 = Avvedimento | first14 = EV | date = 2007 | title = DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 3 | issue = 7| page = e110 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030110 | pmid = 17616978 | pmc=1913100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB.

===Very frequent mutations in cancer===
As noted above, about 3 or 4 driver mutations and 60 passenger mutations occur in the exome (protein coding region) of a cancer.&lt;ref name=Vogelstein /&gt;  However, a much larger number of mutations occur in the [[Noncoding DNA|non-protein-coding regions]] of DNA.

===Cause of high frequency of mutations in cancer===
The high frequency of mutations in the total genome within cancers suggests that, often, an early carcinogenic alteration may be a deficiency in DNA repair.  Mutation rates substantially increase (sometimes by 100-fold) in cells defective in [[DNA mismatch repair]]&lt;ref name=Narayanan&gt;{{cite journal | author = Narayanan L | author2 = Fritzell JA | author3 = Baker SM| author4 = Liskay RM | author5 = Glazer PM | title = Elevated levels of mutation in multiple tissues of mice deficient in the DNA mismatch repair gene Pms2 | journal = Proc.

I. Genetical and clinical observations in the first twenty-seven patients | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 196–227 | pmid = 5770175 | pmc=1706430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone [[DNA repair|translesion synthesis]] past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to [[Epigenetics|epigenetic alterations or epimutations]].  While a mutation or epimutation in a DNA repair gene, itself, would not confer a selective advantage, such a repair defect may be carried along as a passenger in a cell when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.  Such cells, with both proliferative advantages and one or more DNA repair defects (causing a very high mutation rate), likely give rise to the 20,000 to 80,000 total genome mutations frequently seen in cancers.

===DNA repair deficiency in cancer===
In somatic cells, deficiencies in DNA repair sometimes arise by mutations in DNA repair genes, but much more often are due to epigenetic reductions in expression of DNA repair genes.  Thus, in a sequence of 113 colorectal cancers, only four had somatic missense mutations in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority of these cancers had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.&lt;ref name="pmid15888787"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halford S | author2 = Rowan A | author3 = Sawyer E| author4 = Talbot I | author5 = Tomlinson I | title = O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase in colorectal cancers: detection of mutations, loss of expression, and weak association with G:C&gt;A:T transitions | journal = Gut | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–802 |date=June 2005 | pmid = 15888787 | pmc = 1774551 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2004.059535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five reports, listed in the article [[Epigenetics]] (see section "DNA repair epigenetics in cancer") presented evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.

Similarly, for 119 cases of colorectal cancers classified as mismatch repair deficient and lacking DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, Pms2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Truninger | first1 = K | last2 = Menigatti | first2 = M | last3 = Luz | first3 = J | last4 = Russell | first4 = A | last5 = Haider | first5 = R | last6 = Gebbers | first6 = JO | last7 = Bannwart | first7 = F | last8 = Yurtsever | first8 = H | last9 = Neuweiler | first9 = J | last10 = Riehle | first10 = HM | last11 = Cattaruzza | first11 = MS | last12 = Heinimann | first12 = K | last13 = Schär | first13 = P | last14 = Jiricny | first14 = J | last15 = Marra | first15 = G | date = 2005 | title = Immunohistochemical analysis reveals high frequency of PMS2 defects in colorectal cancer | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 5| pages = 1160–1171 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.056 | pmid = 15887099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other 10 cases of loss of PMS2 expression were likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valeri | first1 = N | last2 = Gasparini | first2 = P | last3 = Fabbri | first3 = M | last4 = Braconi | first4 = C | last5 = Veronese | first5 = A | last6 = Lovat | first6 = F | last7 = Adair | first7 = B | last8 = Vannini | first8 = I | last9 = Fanini | first9 = F | last10 = Bottoni | first10 = A | last11 = Costinean | first11 = S | last12 = Sandhu | first12 = SK | last13 = Nuovo | first13 = GJ | last14 = Alder | first14 = H | last15 = Gafa | first15 = R | last16 = Calore | first16 = F | last17 = Ferracin | first17 = M | last18 = Lanza | first18 = G | last19 = Volinia | first19 = S | last20 = Negrini | first20 = M | last21 = Mcllhatton | first21 = MA | last22 = Amadori | first22 = D | last23 = Fishel | first23 = R | last24 = Croce | first24 = CM | date = 2010 | title = Modulation of mismatch repair and genomic stability by miR-155 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 107 | issue = 15| pages = 6982–6987 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1002472107 | pmid = 20351277 | pmc=2872463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cancer epigenetics]] (see section [[Cancer epigenetics#Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes|Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes]]), there is a partial listing of epigenetic deficiencies found in DNA repair genes in sporadic cancers.  These include frequencies of between 13–100% of epigenetic defects in genes [[BRCA1]], [[WRN (gene)|WRN]], [[FANCB]], [[FANCF]], [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]], [[MLH1]], [[MSH2]], [[MSH4]], [[ERCC1]], XPF, [[NEIL1]] and [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]] located in cancers including breast, ovarian, colorectal and head and neck.  Two or three epigenetic deficiencies in expression of ERCC1, XPF and/or PMS2 were found to occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Facista | first1 = A | last2 = Nguyen | first2 = H | last3 = Lewis | first3 = C | last4 = Prasad | first4 = AR | last5 = Ramsey | first5 = L | last6 = Zaitlin | first6 = B | last7 = Nfonsam | first7 = V | last8 = Krouse | first8 = RS | last9 = Bernstein | first9 = H | last10 = Payne | first10 = CM | last11 = Stern | first11 = S | last12 = Oatman | first12 = N | last13 = Banerjee | first13 = B | last14 = Bernstein | first14 = C | date = 2012 | title = Deficient expression of DNA repair enzymes in early progression to sporadic colon cancer | journal = Genome Integr | volume = 3 | issue = 1| page = 3 | doi = 10.1186/2041-9414-3-3 | pmid = 22494821 | pmc=3351028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these DNA repair deficiencies can be caused by epimutations in [[microRNA]]s as summarized in the [[MicroRNA]] article section titled [[MicroRNA#miRNA, DNA repair and cancer|miRNA, DNA repair and cancer]].

===Lymphomas as a consequence of genome instability===
Cancers usually result from disruption of a tumor repressor or dysregulation of an oncogene. Knowing that B-cells experience DNA breaks through development can give insight to the genome of lymphomas. Many types of lymphoma are caused by chromosomal translocation, which can arise from breaks in DNA leading to incorrect joining. In Burkitt’s lymphoma, c-myc, an oncogene encoding a transcription factor, is translocated after the promoter of the immunoglobulin gene, leading dysregulation of c-myc transcription. Since immunoglobulins are essential to a lymphocyte and highly expressed to increase detection of antigens, c-myc is then also highly expressed leading to transcription of its targets which are involved in cell proliferation. Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by fusion of cyclin D1 to the immunoglobulin locus. Cyclin D1 inhibits Rb, a tumor suppressor, leading to tumorigenesis. Follicular lymphoma results from the translocation of immunoglobulin promoter to the Bcl-2 gene, giving rise to large amounts of Bcl-2 protein which inhibits apoptosis. DNA-damaged B-cells no longer undergo apoptosis leading to further mutations which could affect driver genes leading to tumorigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Jie|title=Oncogenic chromosomal translocations and human cancer (Review)|journal=Oncology Reports|date=Nov 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=2011–2019|doi=10.3892/or.2013.2677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of translocation in the oncogene shares structural properties of the target regions of AID, suggesting that the oncogene was a potential target of AID, leading to a double-stranded break that was translocated to the immunoglobulin gene locus through NHEJ repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramiro|first1=Almudena|last2=San-Marin|first2=Bernardo Reina|last3=McBride|first3=Kevin|last4=Jankovic|first4=Mila|last5=Barreto|first5=Vasco|last6=Nussenzweig|first6=Andre|last7=Nussenzweig|first7=Michel C.|title=Advances in Immunology|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-373706-9|pages=75–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">'''Giovanni Battista Abatessa''' (? – after 1651) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[composer]] and [[Baroque guitar]]ist, likely born in Bitonto (near Bari) in the Kingdom of Naples. His compositional output consists of four books of pieces for five-course [[Baroque guitar]]. While many of Abatessa’s contemporaries used the guitar as an accompaniment for the voice, Abatessa’s main focus was on the guitar as a solo instrument.

Abatessa’s books contain instructions concerning the interpretation of the alphabeto tablature, the fingering of the chords, and the tuning of the guitar. The 1627 collection gives instructions regarding the execution of certain kinds of strum such as the trillo and repicco, while the 1635 book and the undated Ghirlanda di varii fiori contain a table of correspondences between alfabeto chords in different positions. The 1635 collection contains five [[villanella]]s; others are found in the 1652 book, with, however, only the words and the accompanimental chords for guitar notated. The 1652 book also explains how to tune the guitar with the harp, presumably for the simultaneous playing of [[Basso continuo]] parts.

==Works==
*''Corona di vaghi fiori'' ([[Florence]], 1627) - contains battute solos in ''alfabeto'' notation.
*''Cespuglio di varii fiori'' ([[Orvieto]], 1635) - contains ''alfabeto'' solos, as well as songs in staff notation with ''alfabeto''
*''Intessatura di varii fiori'' ([[Naples]], 1645) - contains ''alfabeto'' solos.  Known from a later edition, ([[Rome]] and [[Lucca]], 1652).
*''Ghirlanda di varii fiori'' ([[Milan]], c. 1650) - contains ''alfabeto'' solos.

[[File:Розочка белое стекло.jpg|thumb|A broken bottle ready for glassing.]]
'''Glassing''' is a physical attack using a [[Drinking glass|glass]] or [[Beer bottle|bottle]] as a weapon. Glassings can occur at bars or pubs where alcohol is served and such items are readily available. The most common method of glassing involves the attacker smashing an intact glass in the face of the victim. However, the glass may be smashed before the attack, and then gripped by the remaining base of the glass or neck of the bottle with the broken shards protruding outwards. Glassing is easily prevented by using containers made from plastic or [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]] instead, but they suffer from unpleasant feel (plastic) and higher expense (for tempered glass). These alternative containers are slowly being adopted in areas with a high frequency of glassing, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. In New Zealand, a similar phenomenon is referred to as "bottling".

Common injuries resulting from glassings are heavy blood loss, permanent scarring, disfigurement and loss of sight through ocular injury. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year,&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1248571/Shatter-proof-pint-glasses-trialled-pubs-fight-drunken-violence.html |title=Shatter-proof pint glasses to be trialled in pubs to fight drunken violence |work=Daily Mail |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in over 5,000 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calling time on pub pint glasses|work=Manchester Evening News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/22/22330_calling_time_on_pub_pint_glasses.html|date=2002-10-22|author=Ian Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassing is a relatively small portion of all alcohol-related violence, constituting 9% of injuries from alcohol-related violence in New South Wales, from 1999 to 2011, for instance.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-109695.html Alcohol-related violence: Is “glassing” the big issue?], October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tempered glass as policy response ==
{{Further|Tempered glass}}
In 2000, following a series of glassing attacks in [[Manchester]], [[Greater Manchester Police]] and the [[Manchester Evening News]] launched a campaign ''Safe Glass Safe City'' promoting the use of [[toughened glass]] in pubs and clubs to prevent such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modifying Criminogenic Products: What Role for the Government?|journal=Crime Prevention Studies|volume=18|pages=49&amp;ndash;51|author=Ronald V.

===Australia===
At least three states in Australia are addressing glassing incidents by introducing regulations for liquor-licensed venues.

==== New South Wales ====
New South Wales introduced many restrictions in 2008, including the removal of glass after midnight for high-risk venues. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of glassings.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

==== Western Australia ====
In response to glassing violence, the [[government of Western Australia]] in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry on the use of tempered glass in hotels.&lt;ref name="perthnow"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Cordingley |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-leads-in-fight-against-glassing-with-tempered-glassware-in-perth-pubs-and-bars/story-e6frg13u-1226012509118 |title=WA leads in fight against glassing with tempered glassware in Perth pubs and bars |publisher=PerthNow |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of tempered glass in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to tempered beer glasses in six to 12 months.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt; Royal Perth Hospital's head of plastic surgery Mark Duncan-Smith described it as an important step in protecting the public.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt;

==== Queensland ====
In relation to continuing glassing incidents despite limited glass bans in [[Queensland]], Australia, state Liquor Licensing Minister Paul Lucas in 2011 predicted that almost all Queensland pubs and clubs would be (standard) glass-free in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Sandy |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/all-pubs-set-to-become-glass-free/story-fn6ck51p-1226020075518 |title=All pubs set to become glass-free |publisher=The Courier-Mail |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''human spirit''' is a component of human [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[art]], and [[knowledge]] - the spiritual or mental part of humanity. While the term can be used with the same meaning as "human soul",  human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to [[soul]] or '''''psyche''''' which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity.

In the models of [[Daniel A. Helminiak]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]], human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of [[awareness]], [[insight]], [[understanding]], [[judgement]] and other reasoning powers.  It is distinguished from the separate component of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] which comprises the entities of [[emotion]], [[image]]s, [[memory]] and [[Personality type|personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL9hwUBJm18C |title=The human core of spirituality: mind as psyche and spirit |author=Daniel A. Helminiak |isbn=978-0-7914-2950-1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Teske views human spirit as a [[social construct]] representing the qualities of purpose and [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] which transcend the individual human.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6i5ynN9qX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA189 |title=The human person in science and theology |chapter=The Social Construction of the Human Spirit |author=John Teske |isbn=978-0-567-08692-1 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the human spirit and soul==
According to  historian [[Oswald Spengler]], a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development.&lt;ref name = "spengler"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spengler
|first=Oswald
|title=The Decline of the west(An abridged edition)
|chapter= vol2, chpt: 3 &amp; 8
|year=1922
|isbn=1-4000-9700-2
|publisher= Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of  human's non material makeup -  the part that is impersonal or universal.  Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual.  As Spengler writes in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'':

{{cquote| ... more important than all this is the opposition of Spirit and Soul (Hebrew: ''ruach'' and ''nephesh'', Persian: ''ahu'' and ''urvan'', Mandasan: ''monuhmed'' and ''gyan'', Greek: ''pneuma'' and ''psyche'') which first comes out in the basic feeling of the prophetic religions, then pervades the whole of Apocalyptic, and finally forms and guides the world-contemplations of the awakened Culture - as seen with Philo, Paul and Plotinus, Gnostics and Mandeans, Augustine and the Avesta, Islam and the Kabbalah. ''Ruach'' means originally "wind" and ''nephesh'' "breath."  The ''nephesh'' is always in one way or another related to the bodily and earthly, to the below, the evil, the darkness. Its effort is the "upward." The ''ruach'' belongs to the divine, to the above, to the light. Its effects in man when it descends are the heroism of a Samson, the holy wrath of an Elijah, the enlightenment of the judge (e.g. Solomon passing judgment) and all kinds of divination and ecstasy. It is poured out. As in Isaiah xi, x, the Messiah becomes the incarnation of the ''ruach''.&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;}}

In Christianity, the [[Bible]] identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%205:23&amp;version=NIV 1 Thes 5:23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians emphasise  that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 1 Cor 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Cor 5:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV Rom 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]], the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the "consensus" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

The '''Jesuit Community Cemetery''' is on the campus of [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., the final resting place for [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who were affiliated with the university. It was first established in 1808 and was moved to its present location in 1854.

== History ==
The Jesuit cemetery was originally established in 1808 at the southern end of [[Healy Hall]]. The first person buried there was Thomas Kelly, S.J. on August 16, 1808.&lt;ref name=location&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.georgetown.edu/infrequently-asked-questions/it-true-jesuit-community-cemetery-was-originally-different-location-cam|title=Is it true that the Jesuit Community cemetery was originally in a different location on campus?|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Georgetown University Library]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612212248/https://www.library.georgetown.edu/infrequently-asked-questions/it-true-jesuit-community-cemetery-was-originally-different-location-cam|archive-date=June 12, 2013|dead-url=no|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the construction of Maguire Hall, university administrators ordered the cemetery moved to its present location in 1854 so that it was not immediately next to the hall.&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552741|title=Jesuit Community Cemetery at Georgetown University|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Georgetown University Library]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425054612/https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552741|archive-date=April 25, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this, the remains of 46 Jesuits were exhumed and relocated.&lt;ref name="location" /&gt; A senior administrator wrote to university president [[Edward B. Bunn]] in 1964, proposing the idea of exhuming the bodies in the cemetery and removing them to the cemetery at [[Woodstock College]] in Maryland, as doing so would free up approximately one acre of land on the campus that could be used for building.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://georgetownvoice.com/2009/10/29/six-feet-under-gu/|title=Six Feet Under GU|last=Brint|first=Juliana|date=October 29, 2009|work=The Georgetown Voice|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041615/http://georgetownvoice.com/2009/10/29/six-feet-under-gu/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique S. "Kiki" Camarena Salazar''' (July 26, 1947{{spaced ndash}}February 9, 1985) was a Mexican-born American undercover agent for the [[United States]] [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) who was abducted on February 7, 1985, and then tortured and murdered, while on assignment in [[Mexico]].

==Early life and education==
From 1973 to 1975, Camarena served in the United States Marine Corps. After his military service he became a police officer in his hometown.  Camarena was also a Special Agent on the original Imperial County Narcotic Task Force (ICNTF) while working in Calexico, California.  

Camarena first joined the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], at their [[Calexico, California]] office. In 1977, Camarena moved to the agency's [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] office, and in 1981, he was assigned to their [[Guadalajara]] office in Mexico.

== Abduction and murder ==

In 1984, acting on information from Camarena, 450 Mexican soldiers backed by helicopters destroyed a {{convert|1000|hectare|acre|adj=on}} [[marijuana]] plantation in  [[Allende Municipality, Chihuahua| Allende (Chihuahua)]]&lt;ref&gt;https://elmonitorparral.com/notas.pl?n=86286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://diario.mx/Estado/2013-08-16_f5e5369b/chihuahua-la-huella-de-caro-quintero/&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated annual production of $8 billion known as "Rancho Búfalo".&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Peter. [http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/4768.html "Big-time Smuggler's Blues"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405005616/http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/4768.html |date=2012-04-05 }}. ''[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]]''.

Camarena was tortured at Gallardo's ranch over a 30-hour period, then murdered. His skull, jaw, nose, cheekbones and [[windpipe]] were crushed, his ribs were broken, and a hole was drilled into his head with a power drill. He had been injected with [[amphetamine]]s and other drugs, most likely to ensure that he remained conscious while being tortured.&lt;ref&gt;Seper, J. (May 5, 2010).

Retrieved October 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Camarena's body was found in a rural area outside the small town of [[San Lucas Municipality, Michoacán|La Angostura]], in the state of Michoacán, on March 5, 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Investigation ===

Camarena's torture and murder prompted a swift reaction from the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and launched Operation Leyenda, the largest DEA homicide investigation ever undertaken.&lt;ref name="Last Narco"/&gt;&lt;ref name=leyenda&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/about/history/1985-1990.pdf | title = Camarena Investigation Leads to Operation Leyenda | accessdate = January 20, 2013 | work =A Tradition of Excellence, History:1985–1990 | publisher = DEA | date =January 15, 2009| page=64 | format=[[PDF]] 1.73MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special unit was dispatched to coordinate the investigation in Mexico, where government officials were implicated—including Manuel Ibarra Herrera, past director of Mexican Federal Judicial Police, and [[Miguel Aldana Ibarra]], the former director of Interpol in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-01/news/mn-1572_1_u-s-drug-agents|title=2 Ex-Officials in Mexico Indicted in Camarena Murder : Narcotics: One-time high-ranking lawmen are alleged to have participated in the 1985 slaying.

Under pressure from the U.S. government, Mexican President [[Miguel de la Madrid]] quickly apprehended Fonseca and Caro but Félix Gallardo still enjoyed political protection.&lt;ref name="Last Narco"/&gt;

The United States government pursued a lengthy investigation of Camarena's murder. Due to the difficulty of [[extradition|extraditing]] Mexican citizens, the DEA went as far as to detain two suspects, [[Humberto Álvarez Machaín]], the physician who allegedly prolonged Camarena's life so the torture could continue, and Javier Vásquez Velasco; both were taken by [[bounty hunter]]s into the United States.

Despite vigorous protests from the Mexican government, Álvarez was brought to trial in [[Los Angeles]] in 1992. After presentation of the government's case, the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict, and charges were dropped. Álvarez subsequently initiated a [[United States v. Alvarez-Machain|civil suit]] against the U.S. government, charging that his arrest had breached the U.S.–Mexico extradition treaty.  The case eventually reached the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that Álvarez was not entitled to relief.&lt;ref&gt;Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The four other defendants, Vásquez Velasco, [[Juan Matta-Ballesteros|Juan Ramón Matta-Ballesteros]], Juan José Bernabé Ramírez, and Rubén Zuno Arce (a brother-in-law of former President [[Luis Echeverría]]), were tried and found guilty of Camarena's kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/07/us/bodyguard-is-convicted-in-case-with-links-to-drug-agent-s-death.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Bodyguard Is Convicted in Case with Links to Drug Agent's Death | date=August 7, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuno had known ties to corrupt Mexican officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/us/central-figure-is-convicted-in-85-killing-of-drug-agent.html | work=The New York Times | title=Central Figure Is Convicted in '85 Killing of Drug Agent | date=August 1, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mexican officials were implicated in covering up the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/index.html#39 | title=Thirty Years of America's Drug War | work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) | date= | accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican police had destroyed evidence on Camarena's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/lawn.html | title=Interviews - Jack Lawn - Drug Wars | work=Frontline | publisher=PBS |date= | accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, two former federal agents and a self-proclaimed ex-[[CIA]] contractor told an American television network that CIA operatives were involved in Camarena's kidnapping and murder, because he was a threat to the agency's drug operations in Mexico. According to the three men, the CIA was collaborating with drug traffickers moving cocaine and marijuana to the United States, and using its share of the profits to finance [[Nicaragua]]n [[Contras|Contra]] rebels attempting to overthrow Nicaragua's [[Sandinista]] government. A CIA spokesman responded that "it's ridiculous to suggest that the CIA had anything to do with the murder of a U.S. federal agent or the escape of his killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The CIA helped kill DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena', say witnesses|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/15/inenglish/1381856701_704435.html|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=[[El País]] (Spain)|date=15 October 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In November 1988, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine featured Camarena on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601881107,00.html|title=TIME Magazine -- U.S. Edition -- November 7, 1988 Vol. 132 No. 19|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camarena received numerous awards while with the DEA, and he posthumously received the Administrator's Award of Honor, the highest award given by the organization.&lt;ref name="RedRibbon history"/&gt; In Fresno, the DEA hosts a yearly [[golf]] tournament named after him.&lt;ref name="RedRibbon history"/&gt; A school, a library and a street in his home town of [[Calexico, California]], are named after him. The nationwide annual [[Red Ribbon Week]], which teaches school children and youths to avoid drug use, was established in his memory.&lt;ref name="RedRibbon history"/&gt;

In 2004, the Enrique S. Camarena Foundation was established in Camarena's memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camarenafoundation.org/index.htm |title=Enrique S. Camarena Foundation |publisher=Camarenafoundation.org |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530130809/http://www.camarenafoundation.org/index.htm |archivedate=May 30, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camarena's wife Mika and son Enrique Jr. serve on the all-volunteer Board of Directors together with former DEA agents, law enforcement personnel, family and friends of Camarena's, and others who share their commitment to alcohol, tobacco and other drug and violence prevention. As part of their ongoing Drug Awareness program, the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]] awards an annual Enrique Camarena Award at local, state and national levels to a member of law enforcement who carries out anti-drugs work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chea-elks.org/DACamerenaCriteria.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Calexico Police Department erected a memorial dedicated to Camarena. The memorial is located in the halls of the department, where Camarena honorably served.

Several books have been written on the subject. Camarena is the subject of the book ''¿O Plata o Plomo? The abduction and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena'' (2005), by retired DEA Resident Agent in Charge James H. Kuykendall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverorlead.com/ ''¿O Plata o Plomo? The abduction and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena'']. silverorlead.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Saviano]]'s non-fiction book ''Zero Zero Zero'' (2015) deals in part with Camarena's undercover work and his eventual fate.

==Personal life==
Camarena was married to Mika and they had three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-diane-bell-talks-geneva-camarena-2010mar14-htmlstory.html|title=Diane Bell talks to Geneva Camarena|last=Bell|first=Diane|date=2010-03-14|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media depictions ==
''[[Drug Wars: The Camarena Story]]'' (1990) is a U.S television [[mini-series]] about Camarena, starring [[Treat Williams]] and [[Steven Bauer]],

The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Heroes Under Fire: Righteous Vendetta'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=74818#details ''Hes Under Fire: Righteous Vendetta'']. aetv.com&lt;/ref&gt;  chronicles the events and features interviews with family members, DEA agents, and others involved in the investigation.

In the 2018 [[Netflix]]  drama, ''[[Narcos: Mexico]]'', Camarena was played by American actor [[Michael Peña]].

The spider family '''Liphistiidae''', recognized by [[Tamerlan Thorell]] in 1869, comprises 8 [[genus|genera]] and about 100 [[species]] of medium-sized spiders from [[Southeast Asia]], [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xu, X. |date=2015 |title=A genus-level taxonomic review of primitively segmented spiders (Mesothelae, Liphistiidae) |journal=ZooKeys |volume=488 |pp=121–151. |doi=10.3897/zookeys.488.8726 |display-authors=etal |pmid=25878527 |pmc=4389128}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] living [[spider]]s, belonging to the suborder [[Mesothelae]]. In [[Japan]], the [[Kimura spider]] (''Heptathela kimurai'') is well known.

==Biology==
[[Image:Heptathela.kimurai.yanbaruensis.burrow.-.tanikawa.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Burrow of ''[[Heptathela kimurai]]'']]
Liphistiidae are tube-dwelling spiders that construct rudimentary trap-doors. They spend most of their time here and are rarely seen above ground. The medium to large spiders range from eight to twenty-three millimeters long. They are characterized by their downward pointing, daggerlike [[chelicerae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Haupt| first=J.| year=2004| title=The Mesothelae - a monograph of an exceptional group of spiders (Araneae: Mesothelae)| journal=Zoologica| volume=154| issue=8| ISSN=0044-5088| ISBN=3-510-55041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the segmented series of plates on the upper surface of the abdomen. The [[carapace]] is mostly flat, though it can be slightly elevated near the head. The eyes are distinctly clustered together on a single nodule. Anterior median eyes are small, but posterior median eyes are large and round. The lateral eyes are long and kidney-shaped. The distal leg segments have strong spines and three claws. Chelicerae are vertically attached to the cephalothorax.&lt;ref name=Song&gt;{{cite book| last1=Song| first1=D.X.| last2=Zhu| first2=M.S.| last3=Chen| first3=J.| year=1999| title=The Spiders of China| publisher=Hebei University of Science and Technology Publishing House, Shijazhuang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, they were frequently believed to lack venom, but in 2010 it was shown that at least ''[[Liphistius]]'' species have venom glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foelix |first1=R. |last2=Erb |first2=B. |date=2010 |title=Short communication: Mesothelae have venom glands |journal=The Journal of Arachnology |volume=38 |pp=596–598 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1636/b10-30.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are active at night and live for many years. Although most species live in burrows, cave-dwelling species also fasten their retreats to the cave walls. Both burrows and retreats are sealed with woven doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Murphy| first1=Frances| last2=Murphy| first2=John| year=2000| title=An Introduction to the Spiders of South East Asia| publisher=Malaysian Nature Society, Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trapdoor nests are generally built in shady areas with moss or sparse vegetation. Some make silk trip-lines radiating away from the burrow entrance. Adult males sometimes wander in search for females, but females rarely leave their burrows. The respiratory system consists only of [[book lungs]], which could help explain why they are relatively inactive.&lt;ref name=CoddingtonLevy1991&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Coddington| first1=J.A.| last2=Levi| first2=H.W.| year=1991| title=Systematics and Evolution of Spiders (Araneae)| journal=Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst.| volume=22| pages=565–592.| doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.003025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian species==
Three of the ''Liphistius'' species known to exist in Malaysia are endemic to only one or two caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavesofmalaysia.com/photopage1.htm Caves of Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known is ''[[Liphistius batuensis]]'', which is found in [[Batu Caves]]. Other species that can be found in Malaysia include ''[[Liphistius malayanus]]'', ''[[Liphistius murphyorum]]'' and ''[[Liphistius desultor]]''. The Malaysian trapdoor spiders are protected by local law, though continuous threats come from loss of habitat and collection by exotic pet traders. It is believed that these species are endemic and once an isolated habitat is destroyed, the species may go extinct.

==Systematics==
Although they have downward pointing chelicerae like the [[Mygalomorphae]], there is no close relationship between the two. It is thought that the common ancestor of all spiders was orthognath and that in the [[Opisthothelae]], comprising Mygalomorphae (mostly tarantulas) and [[Araneomorphae]] (all other spiders), only the Araneomorphae changed their alignment of chelicerae, while the mygalomorphs retained this [[symplesiomorphic]] feature.&lt;ref name=CoddingtonLevy1991/&gt;

===Phylogeny===
[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenetic studies]] have repeatedly shown that the family is [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], at least as regards extant (living) species. The relationship between the genera is shown in the following cladogram:&lt;ref name=XuLiuChenChen15&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Xin |last2=Liu |first2=Fengxiang |last3=Cheng |first3=Ren-Chung |last4=Chen |first4=Jian |last5=Xu |first5=Xiang |last6=Zhang |first6=Zhisheng |last7=Ono |first7=Hirotsugu |last8=Pham |first8=Dinh Sac |last9=Norma-Rashid |first9=Y. |last10=Arnedo |first10=Miquel A. |last11=Kuntner |first11=Matjaž |last12=Li |first12=Daiqin |date=2015 |title=Extant primitively segmented spiders have recently diversified from an ancient lineage |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=282 |issue=1808 |page=20142486 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2486 |pmid=25948684 |lastauthoramp=yes |pmc=4455790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[Kyukichi Kishida]] suggested dividing the family into two subfamilies, Liphistiinae and Heptathelinae, corresponding to the genera ''Liphistius'' and ''Heptathela''.&lt;ref name=Kish23&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kishida |first1=K. |date=1923 |title=''Heptathela'', a new genus of liphistiid spiders |journal=Annotationes Zoologicae Japonenses |volume=10 |pages=235–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More genera have since been added to the family, but the subfamily division has been upheld by modern phylogenetic studies. ''Liphistius'', the sole genus in the subfamily Liphistiinae, is found only in Southeast Asia (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra). The Heptathelinae are found further north: five genera in northern Vietnam and China and two genera in Japan and offshore islands (Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands).&lt;ref name=XuLiuChenChen15/&gt;

===Genera===
{{As of|2015|11}}, the [[World Spider Catalog]] accepted the following [[extant taxon|extant]] genera:&lt;ref name=WSC_gl50&gt;{{cite web |title=Family: Liphistiidae Thorell, 1869 (genus list) | work=World Spider Catalog |publisher=Natural History Museum Bern |url=http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/genlist/50 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One genus of fossil spiders, ''[[Cretaceothele]]'' &lt;small&gt;Wunderlich, 2015&lt;/small&gt;, was originally placed in this family,&lt;ref name=Wund15&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Wunderlich |first1=Jörg |date=2015 |title=On the evolution and classification of spiders, the Mesozoic spider faunas, and descriptions of new Cretaceous taxa mainly in amber from Myanmar (Burma) (Arachnida: Araneae) |journal=Beiträge zur Araneologie |volume=9 |pp=21–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was subsequently transferred to the separate family [[Cretaceothelidae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Jörg Wunderlich |year=2017 |chapter=New and rare fossil spiders (Araneae) in mid Cretaceous amber from Myanmar (Burma), including the description of new extinct families of the suborders Mesothelae and Opisthothelae as well as notes on the taxonomy, the evolution and the biogeography of the Mesothelae |editor=Jörg Wunderlich |title=Beiträge zur Araneologie, 10 |publisher= |volume= |pages=72–279 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Fossil record==
While some [[Carboniferous]] fossil spiders have been assigned to [[Mesothelae]], the only fossil to be explicitly placed in the family Liphistiidae is ''Cretaceothele lata'' Wunderlich, 2015 from the Cretaceous Burmese amber of [[Myanmar]]. The fossil genus was diagnosed as having an eye-field wider than that in living species.&lt;ref name=Wund15/&gt;

The '''Lunar Receiving Laboratory''' ('''LRL''') was a facility at [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (Building 37) that was constructed to [[quarantine]] [[astronauts]] and material brought back from the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo program]] to mitigate the risk of [[back-contamination]]. After recovery at sea, crews from [[Apollo 11]],  [[Apollo 12]] and  [[Apollo 14]] walked from their [[helicopter]] to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] on the deck of an [[aircraft carrier]] and were brought to the LRL for quarantine. Samples of rock and [[regolith]] that the astronauts collected and brought back were flown directly to the LRL and initially analyzed in [[glovebox]] [[vacuum chamber]]s.

:::[[File:NASA-Houston LRL-installation.png]]

The quarantine requirement was dropped beginning with [[Apollo 15]] and the LRL was used for study, distribution and safe storage of the lunar samples. Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo space flight missions brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust from the lunar surface. The six space flights returned 2200 separate samples from six different exploration sites on the lunar surface.  (Other lunar samples were returned to Earth by three automated Soviet spacecraft, named [[Luna 16]], [[Luna 20]], and [[Luna 24]], which returned samples totaling 300&amp;nbsp;grams (approximately 3/4 pound) from three other lunar sites.)

In 1976, a portion of the samples were moved to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] for second-site storage. In 1979, a [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] was built to serve as the chief repository for the Apollo samples. It was constructed to provide permanent storage of the lunar sample collection in a physically secure and non-contaminating environment. The facility consists of storage vaults for the samples, laboratories for sample preparation and study, a vault for sample data and records, and machinery to supply nitrogen to the cabinets in which the samples are stored and processed. [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lun-fac.cfm] The Lunar Receiving Laboratory building is currently occupied by the Life Sciences division. It contains biomedical and environment labs, and is used for experiments involving human adaptation to [[microgravity]].

'''Maternal somatic support after brain death''' occurs when a [[brain death|brain dead]] patient is [[pregnant]] and her body is kept alive to deliver a [[fetus]]. It occurs very rarely internationally. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suddaby|first=E.C|author2=Schaeffer, M.J. |author3=Brigham, L.E. |author4=Shaver, T.R. |title=Analysis of organ donors in the peripartum period|journal=Journal of Transplant Coordination|volume=8|issue=1|pages=35–39|pmid=9726218 |date=March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past cases ==

In the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were "30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series)."&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esmaeilzadeh|first=Majid |author2=Christine Dictus |author3=Elham Kayvanpour |author4=Hamedani |author5=Michael Eichbaum |author6=Stefan Hofer |author7=Guido Engelmann |author8=Hamidreza Fonouni |author9=Mohammad Golriz |author10=Jan Schmidt |author11=Andreas Unterberg |author12=Arianeb Mehrabi |author13=Rezvan Ahmadi |title=One life ends, another begins: Management of a brain-dead pregnant mother-A systematic review-|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=8|issue=74|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-8-74|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support.&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt; However, according to Esmaelilzadeh, et al. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother "since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature."&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt; Moreover, the mother's wishes are rarely, if ever, known, and family should be consulted in developing a care plan.&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt;

== Life support complications ==

Throughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including "[[infection]], hemodynamic instability, [[diabetes insipidus]] (DI), [[panhypopituitarism]], [[poikilothermia]], metabolic instability, [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]."&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt; Treating these complications is difficult since the effects of medication on the fetus's health are unknown.&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt;

== Fetus's chance of survival ==

According to Esmaelilzadeh, et al., "[a]t present, it seems that there is no clear lower limit to the gestational age which would restrict the physician's efforts to support the brain dead mother and her fetus."&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt; However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into [[preterm birth]]s indicates that "a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. At 24, 28 and 32 weeks, a fetus has approximately a 20–30%, 80% and 98% likelihood of survival with a 40%, 10% and less than 2% chance of suffering from a severe handicap, respectively."&lt;ref name=Esmaeilzadeh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slattery|first=Michael|author2=John J Morrison|title=Preterm delivery|journal=The Lancet|volume=360|issue=9344|pmid=12433531|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11476-0|date=November 2002|pages=1489–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain death vs. similar conditions ==

It is important to understand the similarities and differences between [[brain death]] and two other conditions: persistent [[vegetative state]] and [[coma]].

=== Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state ===

Patients in a persistent vegetative state "are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. The eye opening may give the impression of consciousness, but there is no awareness of the environment. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non-purposeful; they do not speak."&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Robert|title=Understanding brain death vs. states of consciousness|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/09/brain-death-states-of-consciousness/4397515/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between the two states is that brain death means "death of the brainstem" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means "permanent and total loss of forebrain function" which needs further investigation.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=B|author2=Blume W |author3=Lynch A. |title=Brain death and the persistent vegetative state: similarities and contrasts.|journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Science|volume=16|issue=4|pmid=2680003|date=November 1989|pages=388–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Difference between brain death and coma ===

People in comas have "presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses."&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt; However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

== U.S.A. Federal and state laws ==

Several laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. The [[Patient Self-Determination Act|Federal Patient Self-Determination Act]] (PSDA) requires health care institutions to provide newly admitted adult patients with information regarding advance health care directives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care Advance Directives - What is the Patient Self-Determination Act|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/patient_self_determination_act.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of this law is to make patients aware of their rights with regard to [[end-of-life care]].

State laws have also proven important in cases involving maternal somatic support. The Texas Advance Directives Act, also referred to as the [[Texas Futile Care Law]], provides hospitals with discretion over continuing the provision of life support, and voids [[advance directive]] wishes for patients who are pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 166 of the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/HS/2/H/166/B/166.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This Texas law served as a point of contention in the [[Death of Marlise Muñoz]]—a situation in which end-of-life care became entangled with [[abortion]] laws and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=When antiabortion laws hurt a grieving family: Texas denies brain-dead pregnant woman's rights|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/01/08/when_anti_abortion_law_hurts_a_grieving_family_texas_denies_brain_dead_pregnant_womans_rights/|accessdate=2014-02-09|newspaper=Salon|date=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Marlise Muñoz was 14 weeks pregnant when this incident occurred, and while an abortion is legal at 14 weeks in Texas, the state's law dictates that a hospital must provide life support for pregnant women.  Absent from the legislation are specifics as to how the law should be applied depending on how far along a woman is in her pregnancy, as well as the definition of [[terminally ill]] versus [[brain dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Statutes - Section 166.049: PREGNANT PATIENTS|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/HS/2/H/166/B/166.049.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This Texas law does not specifically detail a hospital's obligation in the case when a pregnant woman is brain dead, thus leading to the long-drawn legal battle that ensued in the weeks following Marlise Muñoz's pulmonary embolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruni|first=Frank|title=The Cruelest Pregnancy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/opinion/sunday/bruni-the-cruelest-pregnancy.html?_r=0)|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Texas is one of several states that have laws that pertain to pregnant women and advance directives or [[Do Not Resuscitate]] (DNR) directives. Specifically, 26 states have laws that ignore advance directives when a woman is terminally ill, but pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Wills: State Laws|url=http://estate.findlaw.com/living-will/living-wills-state-laws.html.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This recent situation involving Marlise Muñoz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=Even in Death, Abortion Politics Never Goes Away|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/01/even-in-death-abortion-politics-never-goes-away.html|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost of care ==

The cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the [[Intensive care unit|Intensive Care Unit (ICU)]]. One might consider that every day (after [[Fetal viability|viability]]) that the [[fetus]] is [[in utero]] is a day in which fetal development occurs and represents one day less that the fetus would have to be in the [[neonatal]] ICU (NICU).&lt;ref name="catlin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catlin|first=A.J.|author2=Volat|title=When the fetus is alive but the mother is not: critical care somatic support as an accepted model of care in the twenty first century?|journal=Critical Care Nursing Clinics of North America|volume=21|issue=2|pages=267–276|doi=10.1016/j.ccell.2009.01.004|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2005 study found the average cost of medical ventilation for adults in the ICU to be $1,500 per day and long-term ICU care to be approximately $5,000 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dasta|first=J.F.|author2=McLaughlin, T.P. |author3=Mody, S.H. |author4=Piech, C.T. |title=Daily cost of an intensive care unit day: the contribution of mechanical ventilation.|journal=Critical Care Medicine|year=2005|volume=33|issue=6|pages=1266–1271|pmid=15942342 |doi=10.1097/01.ccm.0000164543.14619.00}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days).&lt;ref name="Esmaeilzadeh" /&gt;

The cost of a [[cesarean section]], the recommended mode of delivery for brain dead pregnant women, is roughly $4,500 for physicians' fees alone, according to the [[Healthcare Bluebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Bluebook: Cesarean Section|url=https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/page_Results.aspx?id=107&amp;dataset=MD&amp;g=Cesarean%20Section|publisher=CAREOperative|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending upon how many weeks a neonate is premature, he or she could spend anywhere between two and four months in the NICU.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt; NICU costs generally run more than $3,500 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muraskas|first=J.|author2=Parsi, K.|title=The Cost of Saving the Tiniest Lives: NICUs versus Prevention.|journal=Virtual Mentor|year=2008|volume=10|issue=10|pages=655–658|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2008/10/pfor1-0810.html|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2008.10.10.pfor1-0810}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983. The costs for maternal care in that case were $183,081 and those for neonatal care were $34,703.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=D.R.|author2=Gates, E.A. |author3=Creasy, R.K. |author4=Jonsen, A.R. |author5=Laros, R.K. |title=Maternal Brain Death During Pregnancy: Medical and Ethical Issues.|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=1988|volume=260|issue=6|pages=816–822|doi=10.1001/jama.1988.03410060086033}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Household income in the United States|average household income in the U.S.]] in 1983 was $29,184.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Median Income for 4-Person Families, By State: Calendar Year 1983.|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/statistics/4person.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[death of Marlise Muñoz]] at [[John Peter Smith Hospital]] in Fort Worth, TX was the most recently publicized instance of somatic support of a brain dead pregnant woman from 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickline|first=S.|title=A Brain-Dead Mother, a Million-Dollar Baby.|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/OBGYN/Pregnancy/43736|publisher=Med Page Today: OB/Gyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hospital declined to reveal how much it cost to treat Muñoz.&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=J.|title=Q&amp;A: Latest on pregnant Tarrant woman being kept on life support.|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140116-lawyers-hospital-records-confirm-pregnant-woman-on-life-support-is-brain-dead.ece|publisher=Dallas News|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ascertaining the costs of treatment for such episodes of care may be difficult given that the billing procedures of many hospitals rely on the costs listed in each hospital's [[chargemaster]]. Costs maintained on the chargemaster differ greatly from hospital to hospital and there is little transparency detailing many hospitals' chargemaster listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brill|first=S.|title=Bitter Pill: Why Medial Bills Are Killing Us.|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2136864,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)]] does have a provision, Sect. 2718 (c), that requires all hospitals to publish a list of their "standard charges", but the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] has not issued a rule to implement that provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=J.|title=Revealing times: Hospitals, physicians face mounting policy and market pressure to disclose prices.|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140118/MAGAZINE/301189936|publisher=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment for care ==

It is uncertain if government or private [[health insurance]] would pay for extended somatic support for a brain dead pregnant woman and how much of care costs a family may have to pay.&lt;ref name="catlin" /&gt; In the [[death of Marlise Muñoz]] at [[John Peter Smith Hospital]], the hospital declined to reveal who would pay for the extended medical care provided.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=A.|title=The family of Marlise Muñoz speaks out [Interview video].|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2014/01/30/ac-munoz-family.|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

Ethical decisions to prolong somatic survival for a brain dead pregnant woman take on several views, with decisions often influenced by the [[gestational age]] of the fetus at the time the woman sustained injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=DM|author2=Borgida AF |author3=Rodis JF |author4=Campbell WA |title=Irreversible maternal brain injury during pregnancy: a case report and review of the literature.|journal=Obstetrics Gynecology Survey|date=November 2000|volume=55|issue=11|pages=708–714|pmid=11075735 |doi=10.1097/00006254-200011000-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficence and [[right to life]] for both the fetus and mother guide many ethical arguments. If prolonging the mother's life is likely to have a positive outcome for the fetus, it can be considered ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=A|author2=Westbrook A |author3=Grady D |author4=O'Connor R |author5=Counihan TJ |author6=Marsh B |author7=Laffey JG. |title=Maternal brain death: medical, ethical, and legal issues.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=July 2004|volume=30|issue=7|pages=1484–6|pmid=15107974 |doi=10.1007/s00134-004-2305-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Drawing upon the principle of beneficence, Dillon et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=WP|author2=Lee RU, Tronolone MJ, Buckwald S, Foote RJ|title=Life support and maternal brain death during pregnancy|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=1982|volume=248|issue=9|pages=1089–91|doi=10.1001/jama.1982.03330090059030|pmid=7109202}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and Loewy&lt;ref name="Loewy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loewy|first=EH|title=The pregnant brain dead and the fetus: must we always try to wrest life from death?|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|year=1987|volume=157|issue=5|pages=1097–1101|doi=10.1016/s0002-9378(87)80268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  propose the following rubric when determining whether or not to offer life support to a pregnant, brain dead woman:
* If the fetus suffers from the event as the mother suffers, life support should not be provided. 
* Pregnancy before 24 Weeks Gestation: Life support administered to the mother for the sake of the fetus should not be provided.
* Pregnancy from 24–28 Weeks Gestation: Intervention should be provided only after educating decision-makers of potential risks. 
* Pregnancy after 28 Weeks Gestation: Intervention should be provided until fetus can be delivered or the mother's condition worsens.

A second view considers the autonomy of the mother and her [[right to die]]. For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health has published Brain Death and Pregnancy, a report to help clinicians, healthcare administrators, and families evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding women's health. Within this report the committee establishes that healthcare providers are first responsible to the woman, and then to the unborn fetus. The report concludes by stating, "Women have the right to die in dignity. The goal of fetal rescue does not exonerate healthcare givers from the duty to respect this right of the primary patient—the woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2011.07.002 |pmid=21839449 |title=Brain death and pregnancy |journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=84–5 |year=2011 |last1=Dickens |first1=Bernard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third view considers the cognizance of the mother. The mother is responsible for the well-being of her fetus as long as she recognizes its existence. When a pregnant woman becomes brain dead, the mother can no longer acknowledge the fetus; as such, the mother no longer has a [[moral responsibility]] for keeping the fetus alive. Without an advance directive stating that the woman wishes to be kept alive to save her unborn child, prolonging life is unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=D|title=From the dead to the unborn: is there an ethical duty to save life?|journal=Medicine Law|year=2004|volume=23|issue=3|pages=567–585|pmid=15532949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, some ethicists have argued that there are no ethical dilemmas inherent in the case of a pregnant woman who is declared brain dead. They argue that because the brain dead patient is no longer alive, he or she ceases to be a patient; the continuation of ventilation in an effort to save the fetus can be considered a medical experiment that requires ethics committee or IRB-approval before a facility can perform this work.

== Public opinion and activism ==

Keeping a medically declared 'brain dead' woman on life support to sustain a potentially viable fetus is a topic of considerable debate and controversy. Such circumstances involve considerable moral, ethical, biological and legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kukla|first=Rebecca|title=Pregnancy, Birth, and Medicine|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ethics-pregnancy/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is heavy discourse between biomedical and legal experts regarding whether a dead person is "a dysfunctional incubator" to an unborn fetus.&lt;ref name="Loewy" /&gt; And, further deliberation surrounds a woman's rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] to make medical decisions about her own body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macklin|first=Ruth|title=When Fetal Rights Trump Those of Patient and Family|work=The Doctor's Tablet|publisher=Albert Einstein College of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also question about the intervening capacity of state authority in such cases, particularly in states like Texas, which prohibit medical officials from withdrawing life support from a pregnant patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez|first=M|title=Pregnant, and Forced to Stay on Life Support|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Public opinion]] is depicted as being shaped by individual beliefs pertaining to related matters of [[end-of-life care]], [[abortion]], female [[reproductive rights]] and the rights of an unborn child. Personal viewpoints are also shaped by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwell|first=Joel R.|title=Concept of Brain Life: Shifting the Abortion Standard Without Imposing Religious Values|journal=Duguesne Law Review|date=July 1986|pages=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments have been made in favor of or against preserving the somatic function of a dead pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberman|first=Michelle|title=Women, Fetuses, Physicians, and the State: Pregnancy and Medical Ethics in the 21st Century|year=2005|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disputes are often spearheaded by activist groups that advocate one of these two positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Michelle|title=Whould Marlise Munoz's Fetus Have Survived? Should it Have?|work=Petrie-Flom Center|publisher=Harvard Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters against life-sustaining efforts, when it conflicts with a woman's wishes, include [[Pro-choice movements|pro-choice]] groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America. These dispute government, state and/or religious institutional interventions to make decisions against an individual's own wishes, which they argue renders advance directives meaningless and fails to protect women.

Supporters in favor of life-sustaining efforts include [[anti-abortion]] advocacy groups (e.g. [[Secular Pro-Life]], [[National Black Pro-Life Coalition]] and [[Operation Rescue (Kansas)|Operation Rescue]]), as well as some [[legislators]], who advocate protecting the life of a fetus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3030">Colonel the Honourable '''Melchior-Alphonse de Salaberry''' or '''Melchior-Alphonse d'Irumberry de Salaberry''' (May 19, 1813 &amp;ndash; March 27, 1867) was a [[Quebec]] lawyer and political figure.

He was born in [[Saint-Philippe-de-Laprairie]], [[Lower Canada]] in 1813, the son of [[Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry]], the hero of the [[Battle of Chateauguay]].

He was appointed commissioner for small causes in 1836. In 1837, he was named to the [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada]], but never took his seat due to the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]]. In the same year, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the local militia and prevented the capture of [[Fort Chambly]] by the Patriotes. In 1841, he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] for [[Rouville (electoral district)|Rouville]]. He was forced to run again for his seat in 1842 after accepting the post of clerk of the Richelieu district court and was defeated by [[William Walker (Quebec politician)|William Walker]]. He was admitted to the bar in 1845 and practiced law with [[Robert-Shore-Milnes Bouchette]]. In 1847, he was appointed assistant [[coroner]] of Montreal and, in 1848, assistant adjutant-general of the Lower Canada militia. He served in this last post until his death at [[Quebec City]] in 1867.

Melchior-Alphonse de Salaberry married Marie-Émilie Guy, the daughter of [[Louis Guy]], in 1846. The couple`s daughter, Miss Hermine de Salaberry was a native of Quebec, and was educated in Quebec city and in Montreal. In 1889, she was accorded a private audience with Her
Majesty [[Queen Victoria]] at the instance of H.R.H. the Princess Louise (later Duchess of Argyll). In October 1895, Hermione unveiled the monument to [[Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry]], which commemorates the [[Battle of Chateauguay]]. The de Salaberry family resided at 833 Sherbrooke Street, Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/87 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mictlan''' ({{IPA-nah|ˈmikt͡ɬaːn}}) was the [[underworld]] of [[Aztec mythology]].  Most people who died went to Mictlan, although other possibilities existed (see "[[#Other destinations|Other destinations]]", below).&lt;ref name="Smith2009p207" /&gt;  Mictlan consisted of nine distinct levels.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p207" /&gt;

The journey from the first level to the ninth was difficult and took four years, but the dead were aided by the [[psychopomp]], [[Xolotl]]. The dead had to pass many challenges, such as crossing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field with wind that blew flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome jaguars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mictlan also features in the Aztec creation myth. Mictlantecuhtli set a pit to trap Quetzalcoatl. When Quetzalcoatl entered Mictlan, Mictlantecuhtli was waiting. He asked Quetzalcoatl to travel around Mictlan four times blowing a conch shell with no holes. Quetzalcoatl eventually put some bees in the conch shell to make sound. Fooled, Mictlantecuhtli showed Quetzalcoatl to the bones. But Quetzalcoatl fell into the pit and some of the bones broke. The Aztecs believed this is why people's height are different.

Mictlan was ruled by King [[Mictlantecuhtli]] ("Lord of the Underworld")&lt;ref name="Smith2009p206" /&gt; and his wife, [[Mictecacihuatl]] ("Lady of the Underworld").&lt;ref&gt;Soustelle, Jacques (Patrick O'Brian, translator) (1961). ''Daily Life of the Aztecs on the Eve of the Spanish Conquest''. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other deities in Mictlan included [[Cihuacoatl (goddess)|Cihuacoatl]] (who commanded Mictlan spirits called [[Cihuateteo]]), [[Acolnahuacatl (deity)|Acolmiztli]], [[Chalmecacihuilt]], [[Chalmecatl]] and [[Acolnahuacatl (deity)|Acolnahuacatl]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Relationship to Nahuatl creation mythology==
[[File:Codex Borgia page 52.jpg|thumb|350px|Mictlampa, the Northern hemisphere of Mictlan according to the [[Codex Borgia]].]]
The nine regions of Mictlán (also known as Chiconauhmictlán) in [[Mexica mythology|Aztec mythology]] take shape within the Nahua worldview of space and time as parts of a universe composed of living forces. According to [[Mexica]] mythology, in the beginning there were two primordial gods, [[Ometeotl|Omecíhuatl]] and Ometecuhtli, whose children became the creator gods. The names of these creator gods were [[Xipe Totec|Xipetótec]], [[Tezcatlipoca]], [[Quetzalcóatl]], and [[Huitzilopochtli]], and they inherited the art of creation from their parents. From the preexisting matter, after 600 years of inactivity Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcóatl organized the vertical and horizontal universes, where the horizontal universe was composed of cardinal or hemispheric directions and the vertical universe was composed of two parts, a higher and a lower. The higher part was supported by four gigantic trees, growing in each corner of the [[Tlalocan|Tlalocán]] (the central part of the universe). Such imagery is also found in the idea of a [[world tree]], such as [[Yggdrasil]] in Norse mythology, Jian Mu in Chinese mythology or the [[Ashvattha]] fig in Hindu mythology. These trees impeded the joining of the Overworld (the higher world) and the [[Underworld]] (the lower world) to Tlaltícpac (the earth). The earth was a land formed from the body of [[Cipactli]], the crocodilomorphic sea monster, and was a solid, living land that generated food for humankind. Cipactli was [[mother nature]], from whom was created the surface and soil that was Tlaltícpac.&lt;ref&gt; Hall, L. (1975). The Cipactli Monster: Woman as Destroyer in Carlos Fuentes. Southwest Review,60(3), 246-255. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/43471223&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth recounts the following. From Cipactli's hair sprang trees, flowers and plants, from her skin sprang plains, valleys and river sediments, from her eyes came wells, caves and fountains, from her mouth sprang rivers, lakes and streams, from her nose came valleys, ranges and mesas, from her shoulders the saw-toothed mountain ranges, volcanoes and mountains. As they organized the universe horizontally and vertically, the four creator gods forged the pairs&lt;ref&gt;Stross, B. (1983). Oppositional Pairing in Mesoamerican Divinatory Day Names. Anthropological Linguistics, 25(2), 211-273. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/30027669&lt;/ref&gt; of gods who would control each area of power: the water ([[Tláloc|Tlaloc]] and [[Chalchiuhtlicue]]), the earth ([[Tlaltecuhtli]] and Tlalcíhuatl), fire ([[Xiuhtecuhtli]] and [[Xantico|Chantico]]) and the dead ([[Mictlantecuhtli]] and [[Mictecacihuatl|Mictecacíhuatl]]).

==Other destinations==
In addition to Mictlan, the dead could also go to other destinations:
*Warriors who died in battle and those who died as a sacrifice went east and accompanied the sun during the morning.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p207" /&gt;
*Women who died in [[childbirth]] went to the west and accompanied the sun when it set in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coe| first=Michael D. |title=Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs |year=1994| edition=4 |place=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People who died of drowning — or from other causes that were linked to the rain god [[Tlaloc]], such as certain diseases and lightning — went to a paradise called [[Tlalocan]].&lt;ref name="Smith2009p207" /&gt;

Hamed was known for his unconventional boxing antics and spectacular ring entrances which included entering the ring on a [[flying carpet]], a [[elevator|lift]], and a [[palanquin]], as well as re-enacting the video of ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]'', and wearing a [[Halloween]] mask. He was also known for his [[somersault|front somersault]] over the top rope into the ring, his highly athletic and hard-hitting [[southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxing style, and formidable one-punch [[knockout]] power; having finished his career with a knockout-to-win ratio of 84%.&lt;ref&gt;Rold, Cliff (2 October 2014).

==Early life==
Hamed was born in [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]] to [[Yemen]]i parents, in 1974.&lt;ref name="EastSide"&gt;[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/weblog/news.php?p=18166&amp;more=1 'The Brash Prince' – Prince Naseem Hamed]. East Side Boxing&lt;/ref&gt;  A protege of [[Brendan Ingle]]'s Wincobank gym, his talent and flashy [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] style marked him out from an early age.&lt;ref name="EastSide"/&gt;

==Professional career==

===Early years===
Hamed started boxing professionally at [[flyweight]] in 1992. He soon began rising through the ranks as he knocked out a series of opponents in the opening rounds. Age 20 he won the European bantamweight title, comprehensively beating the beleaguered Vincenzo Belcastro over twelve rounds. After one defence he won the WBC International super bantamweight title in 1994, overwhelming Freddy Cruz in Sheffield, whom he severely punished and stopped in six rounds. Hamed's popularity grew, his unorthodox style winning a large fan base and his boxing antics generating a large group of detractors.&lt;ref name="EastSide"/&gt; After signing for [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]], Hamed, employing more spectacular entrances, knocked out better opposition in Enrique Angeles and Juan Polo Pérez, both within two rounds.

===World featherweight champion===
====Hamed vs. Robinson====
Later in 1995, after controversially being named the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] #1 featherweight contender (despite never having boxed at that weight), Hamed moved up to face [[Wales|Wales']] defending [[WBO]] champion [[Steve Robinson (boxer)|Steve Robinson]]. After dominating the bout and scoring a knockdown in round 5, Hamed won the title when the referee stopped the fight in round 8 after Robinson was caught with a left hook that dropped him spectacularly. The fight was held in front of Robinson's home crowd at the rugby ground, [[Cardiff Arms Park]], with rain pouring down on the fighters and the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxsports.co.uk/biogs_other.asp?BiogID=201|title=SFX Sports group profile on Naseem Hamed|website=Sfxsports.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first bout where Hamed badly injured his hand, a problem that would continue for the rest of his career.

====Hamed vs. Medina====
Hamed's next defence was in [[Dublin]] against former two-time world featherweight title holder [[Manuel Medina (boxer)|Manuel Medina]]. After knocking Medina down heavily in round 2, Hamed struggled to finish the fight until finally knocking Medina down twice in the 10th round. Finally, at the end of round 11, Medina's corner withdrew him from the fight on the advice of the ringside doctor. Hamed revealed in his post-fight interview that he had fought with a heavy cold. Medina would go on to have many more tough title fights, remarkably winning versions of the featherweight world title another three times. Hamed's next opponent was the 27–0 [[Remigio Molina]] of Argentina, who was stopped in two rounds.

====Hamed vs. Johnson====
In February 1997, Hamed defeated long-time [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] champion [[Tom "Boom Boom" Johnson]] in eight rounds in a unification bout at the [[London Arena]]. After being constantly stunned and staggered from round 3 onwards, Johnson was finally dropped by a huge uppercut, then saved from further punishment by the referee. Hamed's first defence of both the WBO &amp; IBF titles was a first-round KO of veteran British boxer and European champion Billy Hardy. Before the bout Hamed had correctly predicted he would win in round 1. The next defence was an easy two-round win against a hugely outclassed Juan Gerardo Carbrera. Due to boxing politics involving the IBF's mandatory challenger, Hamed was soon forced to relinquish the IBF title.

====Hamed vs. Badillo====
In Hamed's hometown of Sheffield in October 1997, he produced one of the best performances of his career in defending his WBO title against Jose Badillo, whose corner entered the ring to stop the fight during round 7.

====Hamed vs. Kelley====
{{Main article|Naseem Hamed vs. Kevin Kelley}}
In late 1997 Hamed made his heavily hyped U.S. debut. His ceremonious arrival on the [[British Airways]] [[Concorde]] was covered by multiple [[mass media|media]] outlets. There, he and former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] title holder [[Kevin Kelley (boxer)|Kevin Kelley]] fought in a highly entertaining bout. This fight marks something of a watershed in Hamed's career, as he was forced, for the first time, to abandon his ''hands-down'' style of fighting throughout the entire course of the bout, given the calibre of Kelley. Nonetheless, despite suffering three knockdowns himself, Hamed put Kelley down for a third and final time to win by a fourth-round knockout. This was his first of many fights on [[Home Box Office|HBO]].

====Other title defences====
{{Main article|Naseem Hamed vs. Wilfredo Vázquez|Naseem Hamed vs. Wayne McCullough|Naseem Hamed vs. Paul Ingle}}
In 1998, Hamed enjoyed victories over former three-time [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] title holder and then-[[lineal championship|lineal champion]] [[Wilfredo Vazquez]] (TKO 7), former WBC bantamweight title holder [[Wayne McCullough]] (W 12), and future IBF title holder [[Paul Ingle]] (TKO 11; no relation to Hamed's then-former trainer [[Brendan Ingle]]).

====Hamed vs. Soto====
In October 1999 at [[Joe Louis Arena]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], United States, Hamed defeated WBC featherweight champion [[Cesar Soto (boxer)|Cesar Soto]] of Mexico over 12 rounds, adding the WBC title to his collection and unified the WBC &amp; WBO titles. Hamed soon chose to relinquish his WBC title due to his commitment to being WBO champion.

Had Vazquez not been stripped by the WBA of his belt (the WBA did not want their featherweight title unified with the WBO), Hamed would have had the distinction of winning all four world titles in a division, something only [[Riddick Bowe]] had achieved by that point, at heavyweight.

====Hamed vs. Bungu====
In March 2000 at Olympia, [[Kensington|Kensington, London]], Hamed knocked out former undefeated long-reigning [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[super bantamweight]] title holder, [[Vuyani Bungu]] of South Africa. The fight was ended with a single straight left hand, in one of Hamed's most impressive performances and biggest victories.

====Hamed vs. Sanchez====
Hamed fought in August 2000 against [[Augie Sanchez]] at [[Foxwoods Resort Casino|Foxwoods Resort]], [[Mashantucket Pequot Tribe|Mashantucket, Connecticut]], United States. Sanchez is known for being the last American to defeat [[Floyd Mayweather]] as an [[amateur boxer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the last American to beat Floyd Mayweather|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/meet-the-last-american-to-beat-floyd-mayweather/|work=[[Boxing News]]|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamed successfully retained his WBO title for the fifteenth and final time against Sanchez via a devastating fourth-round knockout. Hamed broke his hand badly in the bout, and following surgery he spent half a year out of the gym, gaining 35 pounds in weight. Rather than face the unknown [[European Boxing Union|EBU]] Champion &amp; WBO mandatory challenger [[István Kovács (boxer)|István Kovács]], Hamed relinquished his WBO title to pave the way for a Superfight with [[Marco Antonio Barrera]].

===Hamed vs. Barrera===
Eight weeks prior to the fight, which took place at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in Las Vegas on 7 April 2001, [[Marco Antonio Barrera]] prepared to fight. Barrera had moved up a weight division. At the end of training camp he was in the best shape of his life. According to [[Sky Sports]], Barrera had "trained like a monk" in Big Bear, California, while Hamed trained in Bing Crosby's old house.&lt;ref name="SSN"&gt;Sporting Heroes – Naseem Hamed". Sky Sports 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Steward]] had arrived to oversee the last two weeks of Hamed's training, including sparring, and was worried immediately.&lt;ref name="EastSide"/&gt; He had seen Barrera look razor sharp only a few months before in a stoppage win in Las Vegas, and watched Hamed not take his sparring with young Mexicans seriously.&lt;ref name="EastSide"/&gt; The fight was also for the [[International Boxing Organization]] World featherweight title.

Barrera handed Naseem Hamed his first and only loss for the [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[featherweight]] championship by a twelve-round decision. Before the fight, Hamed was a 3 to 1 betting favorite in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Juipe (1997-12-18).

Retrieved 2013-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamed could not hit Barrera with his trademark lefts as Barrera circled to his left and worked both head and body. Barrera was not a fan of Hamed's antics and responded to Hamed's punches during clinches. On one occasion early in the fight, Hamed grabbed Barrera and they both fell to the ground where Barrera threw a right jab, leading to a warning from referee Joe Cortez. In the 12th and final round Barrera trapped Hamed in a full nelson and forced his head into the turnbuckle, resulting in a point deducted by referee Joe Cortez. Ultimately, Barrera threw more, harder punches and more impressive combinations than Hamed throughout the course of the fight. Barrera was awarded the victory via a unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 115–112, 115–112, 116–111 and won the lineal and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] featherweight titles.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Cawkwell [http://www.saddoboxing.com/Jim2.html Prince Naseem Hamed Marco Antonio Barrera fight]. Saddoboxing.com. Retrieved 2013-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fight drew 310,000 [[pay-per-view]] buys on HBO.&lt;ref name="barrera"/&gt; It was the highest-grossing featherweight bout ever in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britannica: The Year in Review|date=2002|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica]]|isbn=9780852298312|page=326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsYSdJScdo0C&amp;q=pay+per+view|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final fight vs. Calvo===
On 18 May 2002 at [[London Arena]], Docklands, London, Hamed returned to the ring for what turned out to be his final boxing match, against the European champion Manuel Calvo (33 wins, 4 losses, 1 draw) for the International Boxing Organization World featherweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/prince-naseem-announces-comeback-1.412171|title=Prince Naseem announces comeback|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamed was booed by the 10,000 fans as he won unconvincingly on points after 12 rounds looking sluggish and uninterested. The judges scored the fight 120-110 and 119-109 (twice).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/3027975/Boos-greet-Hameds-comeback-win.html|title=Boos greet Hamed's comeback win|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post-fight interview with Ian Darke, Hamed assured a quick return to the ring, which ultimately never happened. For years, Hamed did not confirm whether he had retired or not; there were talks of several fights in the UK and in the US, included Hamed's brother and manager, Riath, speaking to HBO about a potential fight with Michael Brodie.

In an interview for [[BBC Radio]] [[Sportsweek]], Hamed said that his retirement was largely due to chronic problems with his hands, including multiple fractures as well as surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Naseem Hamed Reveals The "Real Reason" He Retired | publisher = ''Boxingscene'' | date = 31 August 2009 | url = http://www.boxnews.com.ua/en/news/5769/2009-08-31/Naseem-Hamed-Reveals-The-Real-Reason-He-Retired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and impact==
Hamed's boxing career was seen by many experts in the sport as one of massive potential. [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]], the boxing promoter, once said of Hamed: "I think at one stage he was the most exciting fighter that I'd ever been involved with. At one stage, in the early part of his career, he could have gone on to become one of the great fighters. But that disappeared when he didn't fight as regularly as he should have done, when he was cutting corners on his training. It just didn't work out for him from that point on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Prince's Place in History | publisher = ''Eastsideboxing'' | date = 4 January 2006 | url = http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=6498&amp;more=1 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110914213258/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=6498&amp;more=1 | archivedate = 14 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, commentators have pointed out that Hamed's ability should have propelled him to achievements that would have given him legendary status, but that his noted dislike of the long hard training camps and long periods away from his family hindered this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Prince Naseem Hamed "I was bloody good" | publisher = ''sky sports'' | date=25 April 2008 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtnwxNbFtA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As popular lower weight fighters like [[Oscar De La Hoya]] and [[Kostya Tszyu]] moved into the mid-weight classes and the Mexican champion [[Julio César Chávez]] declined, Hamed and [[Arturo Gatti]] filled the void. Hamed's boxing antics made him the new poster-boy for lighter-weight boxers and his charisma attracted a large number of fans. In 2002 the UK public voted Hamed's victory over Kevin Kelley on the list of the [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html 100 Greatest sporting moments – results]. ''[[Channel 4]]''. Retrieved 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

British boxing pundit [[Steve Bunce]] stated on 15 March 2008 edition of [[BBC]] panel show ''[[Fighting Talk]]'' that Hamed was the greatest British boxer of all time.  ''World Boxing'', a sister publication of the more famous [[The Ring magazine|''The Ring'' Magazine]], ranked Hamed as the 11th greatest British boxer of all-time. ''The Ring'' also ranked Hamed as the 46th greatest puncher of all-time. Journalist Daniel Fletcher, in a 10-year anniversary commemoration of the end of Hamed's career, "Requiem for Naseem", referred to Hamed as "the most talented fighter to ever live", one of history's première featherweights and British boxers, and that while his career ended prematurely at the age of 28, he still managed to dominate his weight class for six years and boast some formidable achievements.&lt;ref name="car crash1"&gt;{{cite news

===Popular culture===
Hamed was referenced by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artist [[Nas]] in the song "You Won't See Me Tonight", with the lyrics "I can't forget how I met you, you thought I was a boxer/ Prince Naseem, but I'm a mobster, Nas from Queens". Hamed himself recorded a song with [[hip hop]] group [[Kaliphz]] called "Walk Like a Champion", which reached number 23 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1996.

Hamed had a licensed [[Sports game|sports]] [[fighting game]], ''Prince Naseem Boxing'', published by [[Codemasters]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Naseem Boxing|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_pnboxing_psx|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=28 December 2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portable version of the game was also released for the [[Game Boy Color]], developed by Virtucraft, which later in 2002 developed a [[Mike Tyson]] based follow-up, ''Mike Tyson Boxing'', for the [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Tyson Boxing|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/02/19/mike-tyson-boxing-2|website=[[IGN]]|date=19 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamed also inspired a character called Prince Naseem in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', released in 1998. While called "Prince Naseem" in the original Japanese version, the character's name was changed to "Prince Doza" in the Western versions, much like how [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]]'s name was "Mike Bison" (based on Mike Tyson) in the original Japanese version of ''[[Street Fighter II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prince Doza / Prince Naseem (Japanese name) History |url=http://www.fightabase.com/charGame.aspx?id=3214 |website=FightABase |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2005 Hamed was involved in a 90-mph three-car collision at Ringinglow Road, [[Sheffield]], while driving his £300,000 silver [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren|McLaren-Mercedes SLR]].

On 31 March 2006 Hamed entered a plea of guilty and was warned he could face jail by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Boxer could face jail after crash | publisher = ''BBC News'' | date = 31 March 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4864262.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recorder of Sheffield, Judge Alan Goldsack, adjourned the case until 12 May to allow pre-sentence reports to be prepared. The court heard how the man in the car Hamed hit, later revealed as 38-year-old Anthony Burgin, who had attended a number of previous hearings, was unable to come to court because he was in hospital for further treatment. His wife Clare was also injured.

On 12 May the court heard in a sentencing hearing how Hamed had been anxious to impress businessman Asif Goro, who was a passenger in the McLaren-Mercedes at the time of the crash.  Hamed was showing what his car could do when he crossed a solid white line at a speed of at least 90&amp;nbsp;mph and crashed head-on into a [[Volkswagen Golf]] that emerged from a dip in the road.  Hamed's car then hit a second vehicle, the [[Ford Mondeo]] he had been trying to overtake. Mr. Burgin, the driver of the Volkswagen Golf, was very seriously injured, breaking every major bone in his body and suffering bruising to the brain.&lt;ref name="car crash2"&gt;{{cite news

Hamed was sentenced for 15 months after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing. He was also given a four-year driving ban. Judge Alan Goldsack told Hamed: ''"I find it astonishing that the [[DVLA]] has not been prepared to cooperate with the prosecution to give them details of your earlier offences – apparently on human rights grounds."'' The DVLA's decision led to Hamed being sentenced without the judge being told he had previously been banned for a year for driving a [[Porsche]] at 110&amp;nbsp;mph on the M1 in [[Derbyshire]]. It was also revealed that Hamed had three other previous convictions for speeding offences, details of which the prosecution had to find from court records.

&lt;!-- Any updates??:In May 2006, BBC confirmed that Hamed would appeal against his 15-month prison sentence. Hamed's solicitor Stephen Smith said the appeal would be against the length of the sentence and comments made by the judge in his summing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Boxer to appeal against jail term | publisher = ''BBC News'' | date = 15 May 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4774637.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Hamed was granted an early release and left prison on 4 September 2006 after serving 16 weeks of the 15-month sentence. Hamed was placed under [[Home Detention Curfew]] for the remainder of his sentence, and monitored by an [[Electronic tagging|electronic tag]].

Anthony Burgin, the driver with whom Hamed collided, said: ''"I am shocked that after such a serious accident Mr Hamed has been released after less than four months."'' After a recommendation from the [[Honours Forfeiture Committee]], Hamed was later stripped of his [[MBE]], annulled as a consequence of the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16823208 |title=BBC News – Honours stripped: Who else has lost out? |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a civil court case rumoured to cost Hamed up to £1 million plus legal costs, as Burgin was deemed unable ever to work again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Early release for ex-boxing champ | publisher= ''BBC News'' | date = 1 September 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/5306648.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgin was later arrested and charged with dangerous driving for an incident alleged to have involved Eleasha Hamed (the wife of Naseem) on 19 April 2007. Burgin pleaded not guilty, and appeared in court on 17 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hamed crash victim denies charge | publisher= ''BBC News'' | date = 14 January 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7187790.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which he was cleared of charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Victim cleared on Naz car rap | publisher = ''The Sun'' | date = 20 March 2008 | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article941478.ece | location=London | first=Alistair | last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order '''Notostraca''' comprises the single family '''Triopsidae''', containing the '''tadpole shrimp'''&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; or '''shield shrimp'''.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crustacea.net/crustace/www/notostra.htm |author=J. K. Lowry |work=Crustacea, the Higher Taxa: Description, Identification, and Information Retrieval |date=October 2, 1999 |title=Notostraca (Branchiopoda) |publisher= |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two genera, ''[[Triops]]'' and ''[[Lepidurus]]'', are considered [[living fossil]]s, having not changed significantly in outward form since the [[Triassic]]. They have a broad, flat [[carapace]], which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The [[telson]] is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. [[Phenotypic plasticity]] within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction. Notostracans are [[omnivore]]s living on the bottom of [[temporary pool]]s and shallow lakes.

==Description==
Notostracans are {{convert|2|-|10|cm|1}} long, with a broad [[carapace]] at the front end, and a long, slender abdomen.&lt;ref name="Light"&gt;{{cite book |author=Denton Belk |chapter=Branchiopoda |editor1=Sol Felty Light |editor2=James T. Carlton |year=2007 |title=The Light and Smith Manual: Intertidal Invertebrates from Central California to Oregon |edition=4th |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-23939-5 |pages=414–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64jgZ1CfmB8C&amp;pg=PA417}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives them a similar overall shape to a [[tadpole]], from which the [[common name]] ''tadpole shrimp'' derives.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; The carapace is dorso-ventrally flattened, smooth, and bears no [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]]; it includes the head, and the two sessile [[compound eye]]s are located together on top of the head.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; The two pairs of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are much reduced, with the second pair sometimes missing altogether.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The [[arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]] comprise a pair of uniramous [[mandible]]s and no maxillipeds.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt;

[[File:Triops australiensis belly.jpg|thumb|left|The ventral side of ''Triops australiensis'', showing the many pairs of phyllopodous legs]]
The trunk comprises a large number of "body rings", which appear to be [[Segmentation (biology)|body segments]], but do not always reflect the underlying segmentation.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; The first eleven body rings compose the [[thorax]] and bear one pair of [[arthropod leg|legs]] each, the last of which also bears the genital opening.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; In the female, it is modified to form a "brood pouch".&lt;ref name="Pennak"/&gt; The first one or two pairs of legs differ from the remainder, and probably function as sensory organs.&lt;ref name="Pennak"&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas Grant Smith |year=2001 |title=Pennak's freshwater invertebrates of the United States: Porifera to Crustacea |edition=4th |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-35837-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GqIctb8IqPoC&amp;pg=PA431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining segments form the abdomen. The number of body rings is variable both within and between species,&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; and the number of pairs of legs per body ring can rise as high as six.&lt;ref name="Ax"/&gt; The legs become progressively smaller along the abdomen,&lt;ref name="Pennak"/&gt; with the last segments being legless.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt;

The abdomen ends in a [[telson]] and a pair of long, thin, multi-articulate caudal rami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Invertebrata |edition=4th |year=1961 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |chapter=Subclass 1. Branchiopoda |pages=368–375 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the telson varies between the two genera: in ''[[Lepidurus]]'', a rounded projection extends between the caudal rami, while in ''[[Triops]]'' there is no such projection.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt;

==Life cycle==
[[File:Collected Eggs of Triops Longicaudatus.JPG|thumb|right|A collection of lake sediment containing the pink eggs of ''Triops longicaudatus'']]
Within the Notostraca, and even within species, there is variation in the mode of reproduction, with some populations [[sexual reproduction|reproducing sexually]], some showing [[self-fertilisation]] of females, and some showing a mix of the two.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable.&lt;ref name="Pennak"/&gt; In sexual populations, the [[sperm]] leave the male's body through simple pores, there being no [[penis]]. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch.&lt;ref name="Pennak"/&gt; The eggs are retained by the female only for a short time before being laid,&lt;ref name="Ax"/&gt; and the [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] develop directly, without passing through a [[metamorphosis]].&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt;

==Ecology and distribution==
Notostracans are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating small animals such as [[fish]]es and [[fairy shrimp]].&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt; They are found worldwide in [[freshwater]], [[brackish water]] or [[Saline water|saline]] pools, as well as in shallow [[lake]]s, [[peat bog]]s and [[moorland]].&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; In [[California]]n [[Paddy field|rice paddies]], the species ''[[Triops longicaudatus]]'' is considered a [[pest (organism)|pest]], because it stirs up sediment, preventing light from reaching the rice seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hugh F. Clifford |year=1991 |title=Aquatic Invertebrates of Alberta: an Illustrated Guide |publisher=[[University of Alberta]] |isbn=978-0-88864-234-9 |chapter=Notostraca: tadpole shrimp |pages=144–145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UQ4jHev6voC&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and fossil record==
The [[fossil record]] of Notostraca is extensive, occurring in a wide range of geological deposits, and reaching back to the [[Carboniferous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Atte Korhola  |author2=Milla Rautio  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |chapter=Cladocera and other branchiopod crustaceans |pages=5–41 |editor1=John P. Smol |editor2=Harry John Betteley Birks |editor3=William M. Last |title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments. Volume 4: Zoological Indicators |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-4020-0658-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-bwPq3P1YwC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of major morphological change since {{Ma|250}} has led to Notostraca being described as a [[living fossil]].&lt;ref name="Diversity"/&gt; [[Kazacharthra]], a group known only from [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] fossils from [[Kazakhstan]] and Western [[China]],&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Hongfu|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Sinica|year=1996|volume=4|issue=35|pages=490–494|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/CBA/295478/reload=0;jsessionid=ZLmTAb0szp8TXnYtpqjL.4|title=New materials of Late Triassic Kazacharthra from Xinjaing}}&lt;/ref&gt; are closely related to notostracans, and may belong within the order Notostraca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marjorie L. Reaka-Kudla |year=2002 |chapter=Habitat specialization and its relation to conservation policy in Crustacea |pages=211–221 |editor=Elva Escobar-Briones &amp; Fernando Alvarez |title=Modern Approaches to the Study of Crustacea |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-306-47366-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "central autapomorphy" of the Notostraca is the abandonment of [[filter feeder|filter feeding]] in open water, and the development of a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters, taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals.&lt;ref name="Ax"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Ax |year=2000 |title=Multicellular Animals. The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa. Volume II |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-3-540-67406-1|chapter=Notostraca |pages=158–159 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FweHI7uZ198C&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other characteristics are correlated with this change, including the increased size of the animal compared to its relatives, and the loss of the ability to hinge the carapace; although a central keel marks the former separation into two valves, the [[Adduction|adductor muscle]] is missing.&lt;ref name="Ax"/&gt; Notostracans retain the [[plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]] condition of having two separate compound eyes, which abut, but have not become united, as seen in other groups of Branchiopoda.&lt;ref name="Ax"/&gt;
&lt;!--
The metamerism of the trunk of Notostraca is unique. Whereas each of the first eleven thoracic segments in them has one pair of limbs, the next 16 to 20 segments have several pairs each - from two to six pairs on each segment, the number of pairs per segment increasing rearward while the size of the limbs decreases. Such polypody is a unique phenomenon. It is usually attributed to fusion of segments or to their failure to develop. F. Linder states that in the postembryonic development of Conchostraca the individualisation of each new segment begins on the ventral side, and in some cases is not completed: the author attributed the polypody of Notostraca to that process. In fact, not only the limbs of Notostraca but also other metameric organs on their ventral side are subject to 'multiplication': the metamerism of the ventral nerve chain and the ventral muscles agrees with the metamerism of the limbs, and not with that of the cuticle and of the longitudinal musculature of the dorsal side of the body. Apart from their polypody, the postgenital thoracic segments of Notostraca differ considerably from the pregenital segments, in both the structure of their musculature and that of the peripheral nerves innervating it. Because of all these differences, carcinologists often regard only the pregenital segments of Notostraca and Conchostraca as thoracic, and classify all the rest as abdominal. The last four to fifteen segments of the body of Notostraca have no limbs ..., which ends in the anal lobe, with paired filamentous cerci. The separate species of Notostraca differ among themselves in the number of postgenital (polypodous) segments, the number of limbs, and the number of limbless abdominal segments; these numbers vary even within each separate species. Inconstancy of numbers of body segments within a species is a very primitive feature, and very rare among arthropods; except for Notostraca and Conchostraca, such inconstancy is known only among some trilobites and myriapods.

'''Omega Red''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. In 2009, Omega Red was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 95th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/95.html Omega Red is number 95] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfVNfM7R?url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/95.html |date=2012-09-14 }} [[IGN]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}
Omega Red [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' #4 (vol. 2, January 1992), and was created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of '''Arkady Gregorivich Rossovich''' except that he was a [[serial killer]] born in [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]. He was captured by the [[Interpol]] agent [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]] and turned over to the [[KGB]], which wanted to experiment and attempt to create a [[supersoldier]] similar to [[Captain America]]. Omega Red is the end result.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version of Omega Red's past, Arkady was a Soviet soldier stationed in a small Siberian town. He was a murderer; his crimes easily discoverable due to the town's small size and limited number of potential victims. He was caught by his fellow soldiers and summarily executed via a gunshot to the back of the head. His superiors are astonished when Arkady survives the execution, and recommend him for the aforementioned Soviet super soldier project, a brutal process; it is suggested that Arkady survives solely due to his evil and mean nature. He becomes an operative for Soviet intelligence and the KGB.&lt;ref&gt;''[[David North (comics)|Maverick: In the Shadow of Death]]'' #1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet government implanted a retractable [[adamantium#Carbonadium|carbonadium]] [[tentacle]] within each of Omega Red's arms. Carbonadium was the Soviets' attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as [[adamantium]], as Carbonadium is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to a wrap a victim in his coils to literally drain them of their "life" energy. This [[vampire|vampiric]] tendency is essential to Omega Red's survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps take small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his [[immune system]]. In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the "Carbonadium Synthesizer," a device that was stolen by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[David North (comics)|Maverick]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] during their final mission together as "Team X" and attempted rescue of double agent Janice Hollenbeck in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;as revealed in ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of his need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts. While Sabretooth and Maverick ''might'' have been aware of its location, it was eventually revealed that Wolverine actually ''does'' know where it is.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' #31&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega Red also battled [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]] in Berlin at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #61&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time in the past the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon, and so needed to be put in [[cryonics|cryogenic]] [[suspended animation]] until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]] he was revived from suspended animation by [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], who led his own renegade faction of the clan of [[ninja]] known as [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. Omega Red became a warrior serving Matsu'o Tsurayaba and was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the [[X-Men]] many times. In their first encounter in modern times, Omega Red captured Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt; He fought and defeated Wolverine, and brought him to Tsurayaba, [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], and [[Abraham Cornelius|Cornelius]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5&lt;/ref&gt; He battled the X-Men,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt; and was wounded by [[Psylocke]] and defeated by the X-Men and Maverick but  escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #7&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the [[Soul Skinner]] in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red was able to subdue the team and capture Wolverine and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and was then sent to capture [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who had retreated. Omega Red eluded capture by Wolverine after the Soul Skinner's death.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #18-19&lt;/ref&gt; He later fought against [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but suffered a humiliating defeat.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

He has worked for [[Post-Communism|Neocommunist]] organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the subversive [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and the technology suppliers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A. I. M.]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

While working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine's friends and family alongside [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by [[Teleportation|teleporting]] away with Wolverine, his ward [[Amiko Kobayashi|Amiko]], and the information.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Omega Red is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] does in the U.S.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} At present, Omega Red has resumed his search for the Carbonadium Synthesizer.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} In ''Wolverine: Origins'' #6 and #7, Omega Red locates former Team X member, and now one of the numerous depowered mutants, [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]] a.k.a. [[David North (comics)|Maverick]], who is the only person that knows the location of the Carbonadium Synthesizer. This brings him into direct confrontation with Wolverine, who has also sought out Maverick in hopes of locating the Carbonadium Synthesizer. The result of this encounter is that Wolverine outsmarts Omega Red, landing him in the custody of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Months later it becomes known that the [[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]] bought Omega Red's freedom with the hopes of using him to their own ends. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Colossus, and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] encounter him after he has freed himself from his master, however, and they engage in combat. Omega Red is largely impervious to Wolverine's claws; the Red Room had been experimenting on his body in an effort to enhance his healing factor. After Nightcrawler intervenes and knocks Omega Red unconscious, he is returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' 497–499&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the enigmatic [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]], Omega Red is transferred to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine. Aided by [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], their plan consisted of dropping Logan into molten steel. However, as Wild Child was preparing to finish the job, Omega Red interrupted him. While Wild Child and Omega Red battle each other, Logan managed to flee. A distracted Wild Child is consequently thrown into the molten steel by Omega Red after having his chest punctured.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #39&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega Red was killed after being stabbed in the heart with the Muramasa blade by Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine Origins'' #39&lt;/ref&gt;

He later appears in [[Hell]] attempting to attack Wolverine by binding him with his tentacles, but is quickly taken down when Wolverine grabs him by the tentacles and flips him over.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of Arkady Rossovich was later obtained by some Russian members of the Church of St. Mitrophan who, after a mystical ceremony, made by their magiks were able to raise Omega Red back to life. However the procedure is only temporary, as the grave will continue to call Arkady, nevertheless they reassure him that they will continue searching for a way to overcome this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; The limitation was eventually solved when the Russian Mafia used the abilities of X-Man Magik to restore Omega Red's to his fullest strength, but ultimately he was nevertheless defeated and delivered to the custody of S.I.C.K.L.E. (the Russia's version of S.H.I.E.L.D.).&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Gold'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Omega Red is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and the ability to secrete pheromones from his body typically referred to as Death Spores. The death spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his immediate vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. The spores are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds, though some superhumanly powered beings can withstand exposure to them for extended periods of time.

Implanted within Omega Red's arms are long retractable tendril-like coils made of carbonadium, an artificial alloy that is the former Soviet Union's attempt at creating [[Adamantium|true adamantium]]. Carbonadium is more malleable than adamantium and, while being vastly stronger than steel, is considerably less durable than adamantium. Carbonadium, however, is for all practical purposes virtually indestructible. Omega Red can cause the coils to shoot forward from openings in the undersides of his wrists in order to ensnare his victims. Omega Red is able to use the tentacles as highly effective offensive weapons, often brandishing them like whips during combat. The natural durability of the tentacles, combined with his physical strength, are sufficient to cause damage to most conventional materials.

Omega Red also has superhuman levels of stamina sufficient to engage [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in combat continuously for over eighteen hours with no signs of fatigue. His bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than those of an ordinary human. While he is not invulnerable, his body can withstand great impact and blunt trauma forces that would result in severe injury or death in an ordinary human. However, his resistance to injury is considerably enhanced due to the red carbonadium armor that he wears, which has been sufficient to allow him to withstand powerful energy blasts from the likes of [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]],{{Issue|date=March 2011}} and Wolverine's claws,{{Issue|date=March 2011}} without sustaining injury.

Omega Red has the ability, and need, to drain the life force of victims with his pheromones in order to sustain his own. Omega Red can likewise ensnare his victims within his tentacles, and use the coils as a conduit for his lethal pheromones. Due to the mutant "death factor" and the presence of the carbonadium within his body, Omega Red must drain the life force of others on a regular basis in order to sustain his own physical health and remain active. Omega Red can use these absorbed energies to, temporarily, increase his body's healing capabilities to the point where he can fully heal from a punctured lung within a few minutes. Only a device known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer can stabilize his condition, as carbonadium is the only metal that can neutralize the "death factor," thereby stabilizing it within his body.

Omega Red is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician. He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the [[Yakuza|Japanese]] and [[Russian Mafia|Russian]] criminal [[Organized crime|underworlds]]. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of [[organized crime|criminal organizations]].

==Omega Clan==
{{split section|date=October 2018}}
Following the demise of Omega Red, a secret organization known as "The White Sky" which is specialized in growing and programming unique assassins to meet all their clients' expectations, were hired to create three "clones" from the remains of the original Omega Red. Each of these clones have different abilities from each other and they passionately hate X-Force just for the fact they were implanted with false memories to believe that X-Force members had killed their father.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omega Clan is composed by:

* '''Omega Black''' - A female clone of Omega Red, she goes by the programmed name of Sylvia Engel Rossovich.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #34&lt;/ref&gt; Omega Black's chest is implanted with five retractable Carbonadium tendrils which she can use to affect people with such disease as cancer.
* '''Omega White''' - A male clone of Omega Red, he has the power to create energy constructs similar to Omega Red's coils which he uses to drain the psychic energy and life force from his enemies. He's also able to render himself intangible, thus becoming immune to physical attacks.
* '''Omega Red''' - A male clone of Omega Red, in fact he is the closest member in terms of appearance and powers to the original Omega Red.

===Confrontation with X-Force===
When Wade Wilson tried to infiltrate the White Sky facility, he was discovered and battle the Omega Clan.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; He was quickly backed up by fellow X-Force members: Wolverine and Nightcrawler. Both of them were tortured by the three clones, until Deadpool managed to stop them by sending his own White Sky creation: Alpha Achromic.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #26&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after that battle, the Omega Clan revealed itself as part of Daken's Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #27&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole Brotherhood hid for a time in an underwater secret base,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; in order to push Evan Sabahnur, Apocalypse's clone, into the Brotherhood's own Apocalypse&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #31&lt;/ref&gt;

When X-Force infiltrated the base, Omega Black was the one along Daken and Blob to stop Deadpool while he was trying to extract Evan. After being captured, Wade was inspected by Sylvia in order to remove his telepathic dampening device, and once Farouk had probed his mind, Omega Black was asked to kill Wade by filling his head with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #32&lt;/ref&gt;

Intent on doing what was asked of her, she tried to finish the job by beating him up with a wrench, only stopping when she was asked to bring Evan to see Wolverine drowning, in order to push him to wear the Celestial Armor and ascend as Apocalypse. As Daken was beating him to death to make him reveal his nature as Wolverine, Omega Black stopped him and brought the boy back to the torture room with Deadpool, and then left, while Evan wore the Celestial Armor to end this.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #33&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Celestial Armor on, Evan fought back and freed his friends, seemingly killing Omega Red in the process. Omega White tried to avenge his "brother" but Psylocke mind-controlled him in order to absorb the Shadow King's, and then erased Omega White's mind, leaving the Shadow King trapped in a brain-dead corpse. With the Brotherhood tore apart Black Omega was somehow able to escape the base. Omega White's body was later entrusted to Brian Braddock's care &lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent whereabouts===
It was revealed that Omega Red was able to survive Evan's attack and started a mercenary career, working for Roxxon.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #41&lt;/ref&gt; When he clashed with Deadpool, he tried to have revenge on him for the false memories implanted on him.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #42&lt;/ref&gt; After clashing with Deadpool numerous times, the mercenary convinced him that the memories of his past were false, and that just like him, Omega Red needed to realize he wouldn't be controlled by those who transformed them into monsters. Both called a truce, and Omega Red left Deadpool alone, unless he discovered he had actually murdered his family.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol.3 #44&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega Black has since reappeared too, with the revelation that she had become a vessel for Shadow King which the Crimson Pirates were supposed to give to Tullamore Voge.&lt;ref&gt;''Nightcrawler'' #08&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Return of Wolverine]]" miniseries, Omega Red appeared as a masked sniper at a work camp owned by Soteira. A revived wolverine sees him shooting a fleeing scientist. Upon Wolverine returning fire, Omega Red shoots out the front tire of Wolverine's motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;''Return of Wolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; While on the ocean, Omega Red and a revived Daken attack the speedboat that Wolverine and Ana are on. Omega Red is shot off the boat by Ana using the speedboat's harpoon gun.&lt;ref&gt;''Return of Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich. Instead of a [[homicide|homicidal]] maniac, Rossovich appeared more [[sanity|sane]] and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Man'' #2 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon X into Weapon Omega, the heir of Apocalypse, it was mentioned that Rossovich had returned to his country where under the alias of Omega Red had built an army strong enough to overrun most of Asia and Eastern Europe with relative ease. When Weapon Omega was eventually deposed, the threat from Omega Red to the East was expected, yet the first wave never came and it never would, as Omega Red had been given the knowledge that the canister containing the Apocalypse power was now in Prophet’s possession.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Apocalypse'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Days of Future Now===
In the "Days of Future Now" story, Omega Red is a member of [[X-Force]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Omega Red is an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]. He is depicted as a mutant with a hatred of humans. At some point, he had been hired to attack a cargo ship belonging to [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]] as a conspiracy against its leader Donald Roxxon. After his fight with Spider-Man, he was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. However, he managed to escape when the [[Green Goblin]] escaped. His defeat by Spider-Man became public knowledge because of articles written by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] detailing his humiliation.  Subsequently, his former clients blacklisted him. He blamed Jameson for the loss of his livelihood. When Jameson began writing articles critical of Roxxon, Omega Red went to the [[Daily Bugle]] office disguised as a janitor and ambushed Jameson in his office with the intent to do Roxxon a high-profile favor and restore his mercenary career.  Unfortunately, Peter Parker happened to be in the Bugle office that day. Changing into his Spider-Man costume and bursting through Jameson's office window, he quickly subdued Omega Red, ultimately knocking him unconscious with a vending machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #86&lt;/ref&gt; His tentacles extend from the tops of his wrists instead of the bottom and appear to be organic, not artificial. He has demonstrated superhuman strength.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #87&lt;/ref&gt; He is later imprisoned in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Triskelion]], and freed in a breakout by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] hired by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] along with [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]], and [[Gwen Stacy]], aka [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later after the death of Spider-Man, Omega Red is seen resuming his work but is stopped by the second [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paula Jean Welden''' (October 19, 1928 – disappeared December 1, 1946) was an American college student who disappeared while walking on [[Vermont]]'s [[Long Trail]] hiking route, the scene of several other unexplained disappearances around this time. The local sheriffs were criticised for their poor investigation, and this led to the creation of the [[Vermont State Police]].

==Background==

Paula Welden was the eldest of four daughters of the well-known industrial engineer, architect and designer William Archibald Welden (1900–1970) and his wife Jean Douglas (b at [[Mount Kisco, New York]], 1901–d. at [[Venice, Florida]], 1976), née Wilson, of Brookdale Road, [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. Employed by the Revere Copper and Brass Company, W. Archibald Welden was the designer of many familiar household utensils, as well as stylish cocktail shakers and other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred Hamilton Barr]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3gMAQAAIAAJdrrbas_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=maxmas_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=11 |title=Masters of Modern Art |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paula was a 1945 graduate of [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stamford High School Yearbook |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bennington College==

In 1946, Welden was a sophomore at [[Bennington College]] in [[North Bennington, Vermont]]. Her college dormitory was Dewey House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benningtonalumnirelations.tumblr.com/post/154379075916/house-histories-dewey-another-house-has-been|title=House Histories: Dewey}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the older dormitories on the college grounds, and which remains to this day. She was an art major but, dissatisfied with the faculty and her progress, was contemplating changing her major{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}; she had discovered a newfound love of [[botany]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Welden, a typical student, was sorting out her own interests from those of her parents and was trying to expand her circle of friends{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. She and her roommate were quite close and both realized how dependent they were on one another for a social life{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Paula started to befriend other students and became involved in square dancing and hiking with groups of friends from Bennington College and [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

Welden worked part-time at the dining hall in The Commons on campus. On Sunday, December 1{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} she worked the lunch shift. She decided to find and walk a portion of the Long Trail, a few miles from the campus. Paula knew of the famous trail but hadn't yet had an opportunity to hike it. She tried to get some other students to join her that day, but they were busy. Paula went by herself.&lt;ref name="Dooling, Michael C 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dooling |first=Michael C. |title=Clueless in New England: The Unsolved Disappearances of Paula Welden, Connie Smith, and Katherine Hull |publisher=The Carrollton Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0962742439}}{{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

==Long Trail==

After finishing her shift in the dining hall, Welden returned to her room and changed into walking clothes. Her clothing was adequate for the weather that afternoon but not for the anticipated drop in temperature that night. She packed no bag, took no extra clothing, and did not take any extra money. From all appearances, she did not expect to be gone more than a few hours. Welden walked down the campus driveway and hitched a ride from [[Vermont Route 67A|State Route 67A]] near the college entrance in North Bennington to a point on [[Vermont Route 9|State Route 9]] near the Furnace Bridge between downtown [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] and Woodford Hollow. Local contractor Louis Knapp picked her up and drove her as far as his house on Route 9, about {{convert|2.5|mi}} from the Long Trail. From this point, Welden either hitchhiked or walked the rest of the way to the start of the Long Trail in Woodford Hollow.&lt;ref name="Dooling, Michael C 2010"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

A group of hikers were walking down the trail as Welden was walking up. She approached them and asked them a few questions about the Long Trail. She continued walking in a northerly direction on the road portion of the trail now known as Harbour Road. Welden was on the Long Trail late in the afternoon and darkness was falling as she approached the end of Harbour Road. She may have continued into quickly darkening woods and it was presumed that she must have continued her Long Trail walk along the Bolles Brook valley, although there are no known confirmed sightings of her past the Fay Fuller Camp.&lt;ref name=begg&gt;{{cite book |last=Begg |first=Paul |title=Into Thin Air: People Who Disappear |publisher=David &amp; Charles |year=1979 |isbn=978-0715377246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search==
[[File:Paula Jean Welden missing person flyer.jpg|thumb|right|Original missing person flyer for Welden, dated 1946.]]
Welden didn't return to campus. Her roommate thought she must have gone to the library to study for exams, but the next morning, Welden still hadn't returned. Once the college administrators were notified, they immediately started a search of the campus itself. The [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington County]] [[district attorney|State's Attorney]] was notified, and the county [[sheriff]] was brought in to help with the search. Over the next couple of days, her visit to the Long Trail was discovered when one of the hikers she had approached identified her from the photo in the ''Bennington Banner'' newspaper, where he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Search for Paula Welden Centers on Long Trail |newspaper=Bennington Banner |date=December 4, 1946 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks of searching ensued. The college closed for several days, and the students and faculty participated in organized searches. Hundreds of volunteers, family members, National Guard troops, students, and firefighters searched for her to no avail. Ground and air searches concentrated on the Long Trail up as far as [[Glastenbury Mountain]] (ten miles to the north), the trail's various branches, and along Vermont Route 9 from Bennington to [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]]. Most of those searching assumed Paula had gotten lost in the woods. When no clues were found as to her whereabouts, other theories started to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Bennington Banner |date=December 1946}} &lt;!-- title? author? date? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connecticut State Police investigation==

Alternative theories speculated that she had been in unusually high spirits and had decided to run away to start a new life, was going to meet a secret lover and went off with him, or had become injured and suffered from [[amnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Connecticut Girl Sought as Missing |newspaper=Hartford Courant |date=December 3, 1946 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darker theories speculated that Paula was [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and may have committed [[suicide]], she might have been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] or [[murder]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foul Play Theory Studied by Police in Welden Case |newspaper=Stamford Advocate |date=December 7, 1946 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Paula's disappearance, there was no state police organization in Vermont, and the state's attorney, county sheriff and state investigator Almo Franzoni were responsible for the investigation. Paula's father pressed the investigators and the governor to bring in additional professional law enforcement help. Vermont's governor asked Connecticut's governor to lend assistance. [[Connecticut State Police]] detective Robert Rundle and state policewoman Dorothy Scoville were assigned to the case. They interviewed every person who saw, or thought they saw Paula, every person who lived along the route she took or who were simply in the vicinity of the Long Trail on that December afternoon.

Investigators discovered that one of the last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He was in the midst of an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.&lt;ref name="Dooling, Michael C 2010"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref name="charley_project"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/w/welden_paula.html|title=Paula Jean Welden|work=The Charley Project|accessdate=2009-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212022421/http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/w/welden_paula.html#|archive-date=December 12, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doenetwork"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1784dfvt.html|title=1784DFVT - Paula Jean Welden|website=www.doenetwork.org|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The manner in which Paula's disappearance was handled was sharply criticized by Paula's father and many others.&lt;ref name="BBanner 1946-12-10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Clues Peter Out in Hunt for Student |newspaper=Bennington Evening Banner |date=December 10, 1946 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Outside Aid in Search for Missing Paula Welden |newspaper=Bennington Evening Banner |date=December 11, 1946 |pages=1, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that the lack of a statewide law enforcement organization and the lack of training of local sheriffs contributed to a poorly run investigation.&lt;ref name="BBanner 1946-12-10"/&gt; Within seven months of Paula's disappearance, the Vermont legislature created the [[Vermont State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bennington Banner'', December 1946 to July 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cases==

In the same general area where Welden disappeared, at least four other unexplained vanishings were reported to have taken place between 1945 and 1950. Due to the strangeness of these events, Vermont broadcaster and author [[Joseph A. Citro]] dubbed the wilderness area northeast of Bennington "the [[Bennington Triangle]]" – a reference to unexplained disappearances in the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PkXpHv7HKcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=erJQ9nLA3yWAQw4ZPdksqtK4ap4 |last=Citro |first=Joseph A. |author2=Mark Moran |author3=Mark Sceurman |title=Weird New England |publisher=Sterling |year=2005 |page=75 |isbn=9781402733307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=R. D. |last2=Zeller |first2=J. |title=The Strange Disappearances at Mt. Glastenbury |work=Fate |date=July 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

Author [[Shirley Jackson]] (1916–1965) was inspired by Welden's vanishing when she wrote her novel ''[[Hangsaman]]'' (1951), as indicated by Jackson's papers in the [[Library of Congress]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} At the time of Welden's disappearance in 1946, Shirley Jackson was living in North Bennington, Vermont, where her husband was employed at Bennington College. Jackson's short story "The Missing Girl", included in ''Just An Ordinary Day'' (the 1996 collection of her previously unpublished/uncollected short stories), also references the Welden case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powers |first=Tim |title=Remember Paula Welden? 30 Years Ago |newspaper=Bennington Banner |date=December 1, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C.A. "Peter" Bransgrove (1914-1966) Architect.jpg|thumb|border|right|text-top|alt=C.A. "Peter" Bransgrove|C.A. "Peter" Bransgrove]]
'''Charles Alfred &amp;quot;Peter&amp;quot; Bransgrove''' (April 7, 1914 -January 26, 1966) was an architect who mostly worked in Dar es Salaam but also in other parts of Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;C.A. Bransgrove &amp; Partners architectural practice records&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], Surrey, England on 7 April 1914 &lt;ref&gt;Birth Certificate June quarter 1914 district Kingston volume 2a page 926&lt;/ref&gt; he was the fourth child to Sidney and Julie Bransgrove.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;Bransgrove family&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the School of Architecture at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] in London and at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Architecture]], also in London.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt; In 1947 he was employed as an architect for the [[Tanganyika groundnut scheme|Tanganyika Groundnut Scheme]]. When Peter's role in the scheme came to an end in 1948, he moved from Kongwa to [[Dar es Salaam]] and opened the first independent architectural practice in Dar es Salaam, C. A. Bransgrove &amp; Partners. &lt;ref name="practice"&gt;C.A. Bransgrove &amp; Partners architectural practice records&lt;/ref&gt; His design style was a climate-driven version of the [[Modern architecture|Modernist movement]].

==Modernism==
[[Modern architecture|Modernism]] in Architecture was a result of both advancement in technology and fabrication, as well as social enlightenment, that swept through the Western World soon after the [[World War I|First World War]]. [[Walter Gropius]] founded the [[Bauhaus]], [[Le Corbusier]] published his &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; about architecture and by the end of the 1920s, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]] had built the [[Barcelona Pavilion]].

==Biography==
Peter finished primary school in 1926 and in 1927, at the age of thirteen, was enrolled into the School of Architecture at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] in London.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt; From an early age he was exposed to the new architectural style of the day. It was an exciting period to be part of, with old traditional ways of designing a building opposed to the new movement of thinking sweeping Europe and North America. There would have been much discussion between those 'for' and those 'against'.

Having completed five years at the Polytechnic, Peter was employed by the architect Herbert William Matthews in 1934, located at 1 Manchester Square, London. Later (1943), in Peter's nominations papers to be accepted into the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], Mr Matthews writes:&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;Herbert William Matthews, architect&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;For some years he (Peter) was Principal Assistant in my office. I regard him as a very competent architect and a person of integrity and suitable for election to the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]].&amp;quot;&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In 1935, Peter was accepted into the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Architecture]].&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Obituary for Peter Bransgrove published in the Tanganyika Standard newspaper, 27 January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite likely that he continued to work in the office of Mr Matthews during this time. Whilst at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]], Peter won many prizes for his student work, including:&lt;br /&gt;
1935 &amp;ndash; 1st Landseer Prize (&amp;pound;15) and silver medal for a set of measured drawings of any building or part of a building.&lt;ref name="RAA"&gt;[[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1938 &amp;ndash; 1st Landseer Prize (&amp;pound;20), silver medal and a hand-bound with tooled leather book on &amp;quot;discourses&amp;quot; (lectures) by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] for An Architectural Design.&lt;ref name="RAA" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1939 &amp;ndash; RA Gold medal and &amp;quot;Edward Stott Travelling Studentship&amp;quot; (&amp;pound;200), for the architectural design of a Campo Santo (holy field and Crematorium). This is the highest award given to students of Architecture.&lt;ref name="RAA" /&gt;

Having completed his time at the Academy in 1939, Peter may have left his place of employment to work for various Government Departments. The war in Europe had begun and it would have been difficult to find work.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

In 1942, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Peter was stationed in [[Bangalore]], India as a &amp;quot;Sapper&amp;quot; ([[Royal Engineers]]) Captain, where he was involved in defusing bombs. On his return to England in 1944, Peter resumed his employment with Herbert William Matthews. During this time he also carried out commissions under his own name, mostly around reconstructive work of bomb affected housing.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

He passed his Registration Final in London in 1944 and was accepted into the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] as an Associate in 1945. By 1946 he had taken up work for the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works and Planning]].&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

After the war, Britain was stretched financially. All round the world they had assets that had been shipped to various theatres of war and were left idle and unused. In [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]], there was a large amount of civil works machinery that was going to have to be abandoned. At the same time the Overseas Food Corporation saw the need to supply the world with more vegetable oils from nuts, but required civil engineering equipment to make it work. Hence the [[Tanganyika groundnut scheme|Tanganyika Groundnut Scheme]] was formed and in 1947 Peter took up the opportunity to be involved.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;APPOINTMENTS
Mr. C. A. Bransgrove [A] has been appointed Chief Architect to Messrs. Pauling &amp; Co., Ltd., Civil Engineering Contractors for the groundnut project in Tanganyika. He will be pleased to receive trade catalogues, etc., from firms interested in exporting to East Africa. His address is P.O. Kongwa, Tanganyika, East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Journal Volume 54 &amp;ndash; page 576, year 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pauling &amp; Co.]], Ltd. were employed by the [[United Africa Company]] to undertake ground clearance.&lt;ref name="Pauling"&gt;[[Pauling &amp; Co.#History|Pauling &amp; Co. History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1948, either the demise of the Scheme was becoming apparent or the work for architects was complete. Whatever the reason, Peter's involvement in the [[Tanganyika groundnut scheme|Groundnut Scheme]] came to an end. In lieu of payment for himself and his new family to return to England, he accepted a plot of land, owned by the Overseas Food Corporation, in the suburb of [[Kurasini]] in [[Dar es Salaam]]. Here he designed and built the family house that they would live in until the completion of Luther House in 1963. The family then moved into the penthouse of Luther House, which adjoined the practice offices on the fifth floor.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

In the same year Peter opened the first independent architectural practice in [[Dar es Salaam]]. C. A. Bransgrove &amp; Partners was based in TanCott House and one of his first employees was Alf &amp;quot;Tigger&amp;quot; Hastings. A few years after, Hastings left the practice to set up his own office and co-founded the practice of French &amp; Hastings. Both French and Hastings were possibly with the Royal Engineers during the war.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

Another notable name to be employed by Peter was H. L. &amp;quot;Sukhi&amp;quot; Shah. His father Luvji Kara Shah, was the bookkeeper for C. A. Bransgrove. Sukhi joined the practice with an eye to becoming an architect. He was shipped off to England in 1952 by his father to attend the Regent Street Polytechnic and studied architecture between 1952-1958. He started his own practice on his return to [[Dar es Salaam]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Lemmens"&gt;Bert Lemmens&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Herbert Betts joined Peter as a Partner in the early days of the practice and became sole owner of C. A. Bransgrove and Partners for a further four years after Peter's death. A month after the passing of Peter, an architect by the name of Raymond Howes was met off the plane from Australia by Joe Betts to join the practice and stayed until 1971. During that time Joe and Raymond designed many buildings in Dar and other locations in [[Tanzania]]. In 1970 the practice was taken over by Jackson Hill Architects. The practice of Jackson Hill was incorporated into the firm of Covell Matthews Partnership Ltd, Tanzania in 1972.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt;

Peter was involved in many projects and building types throughout Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda. Mostly however they were in Dar es Salaam and included high rise office blocks, low rise offices, schools, hospitals, hostels, churches, post offices, embassies and private residences.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt;

Most notably, the countries for which Peter designed houses for their Consuls were:&lt;br /&gt;
America: Robert A. McKinnon (Consul) and William B. Edmondson (Vice-Consul). Both houses were on Queens Drive (now Toure Drive), [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]].&lt;br /&gt;
Holland: Ernst Henry van Eeghen. Queens Drive (now Toure Drive), [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]].&lt;br /&gt;
Belgium: 3 houses on Upanga Rd (now Ali Hassan Mwinyi Rd), [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]].&lt;br /&gt;
British High Commission: originally designed for Antoniou at #1 Kingsway (now Kenyatta Drive), [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]].&lt;br /&gt;
Italy: originally designed for Amir Karimjee on Kingsway Drive (now 104 Kenyatta Drive), [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]].&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt; 

During the early 1960s, Peter made a number of trips to Rome to the architectural firm of Whiting Associates International, to co-design the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]], [[Tanzania]] for the Protestant Churches in the country, known collectively as The Good Samaritan Foundation.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt;

There is no denying that Peter's design style was a climate-driven version of the [[Modern architecture|Modernist movement]]. Known simply as &amp;quot;tropical modernism&amp;quot;, the term and therefore type of architecture was a direct mix of both the &amp;quot;international style&amp;quot; of the time and that of the location and requirement to address the heat by ensuring any breeze was unhindered through the building and at the same time deny the sun direct access. Usually based on a grid system, there was a notable lack of fanciful adornment and a strong sense of simplicity. The climate to a certain extent dictated the type of materials used and the methods employed to combat the heat and humidity.

From 1951 to 1955 he was a member of the Dar es Salaam City Council and he also served on the Tanganyika Advisory Council for Education and the National Housing Corporation. In 1961, Peter had helped to set up the [[International School of Tanganyika]]. At the time of his death in 1966 he was chairman of the International School Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

On 10 April 1956 Peter put forward a Patent for &amp;quot;louvre blocks&amp;quot; for use in building in the tropics:&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;Patent number 782,754, application date 25 January 1955, date of filing complete specification 10 April 1956, complete specification published 11 September 1957, The Patent Office, London&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;The concrete building block comprises two parallel end panels united by one or more inclined webs extending upwardly from the front edges of the panels to the rear thereof. The blocks are laid in superposed courses, to form louvres, the web having an upward extension which fits between the end panels of the block above it. Keying grooves are provided at the ends of the block.&amp;quot;&lt;ref name="patent" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of his buildings used this concrete block for ventilation as well as preventing both direct sunlight and rain to enter.

Peter has been described by current architects and researchers as a leading exponent of the [[Modern architecture|Modernist style]] in [[Tanzania]] during that period and an architect to be admired and extolled for what he contributed during his time.&lt;ref name="Folkers"&gt;Antoni Folkers, architect, et al&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;quot;He shaped a considerable part of the old city centre of Dar es Salaam in the fifties and sixties.&amp;quot;&lt;ref name="Lemmens" /&gt;

Peter died in [[The Nairobi Hospital|Nairobi Hospital]] on 26 January 1966, aged 51.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

'''Shanmugalingam Sivashankar''' ({{lang-ta|சண்முகலிங்கம் சிவசங்கரன்}}; 1962 &amp;ndash; 18 May 2009; commonly known by the nom de guerre '''Pottu Amman''') was a [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] rebel and leading member of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], a [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|separatist Tamil militant organisation]] in [[Sri Lanka]].

Sivashankar was a supporter of [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF) MP [[V.

Sivashankar married a woman from the Batticaloa region and had a son and daughter.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLG0807"&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Profile of LTTE intelligence head, Pottu|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2007/08/short-profile-of-ltte-intelligence-head.html|work=Sri Lanka Guardian|date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LTTE==
Sivashankar joined the [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|militant]] [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) in 1981 along with T. Sivanesan ([[Soosai]]).&lt;ref name="DN090409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TN041009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weerakoon|first1=Ruwan|title=Pottu Amman: Patient but ruthless Tiger|url=http://www.nation.lk/2009/10/04/militarym.htm|work=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)]]|date=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Another source says he joined the LTTE in 1982.&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt;}} He took on the [[nom de guerre]] "Pottu".&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; Seniority in the LTTE resulted in his nom de guerre "Pottu" being suffixed by "Amman" (uncle).&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt; After being trained he served briefly as LTTE leader [[V. Prabhakaran]]'s bodyguard.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; He was then sent to [[Tamil Nadu]], India to be in charge of the shore operations in the [[Vedaranyam]] area.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; In 1985, whilst he was in charge of the LTTE's camp in Vedaranyam, he was abducted by rival militant group [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE).&lt;ref name="TN041009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FL131001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeyaraj|first1=D.

Pottu Amman returned to Sri Lanka in 1987.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; He was sent to the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] where he was the LTTE's associate commander for Batticaloa District.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; He clashed often with the ambitious [[Karuna Amman]] who wanted to eastern regional commander.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; One of the factors leading to Karuna's defection to the Sri Lankan government in 2004 was his rivalry with Pottu Amman.&lt;ref name="SL140304"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Joanne|title=An Institutional History of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)|url=https://www.sem.admin.ch/dam/data/sem/internationales/herkunftslaender/asien-nahost/lka/LKA-geschichte-ltte-e.pdf|publisher=Staatssekretariat für Migration/[[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]/The Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pottu Amman was recalled to [[Jaffna]] and in October 1987, when war had erupted between the LTTE and the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), he was sent to Tamil Nadu to co-ordinate the flow of supplies from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; He was briefly jailed in India for smuggling.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; He returned to Jaffna to take part in military operations against the IPKF and was briefly Jaffna commander.&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; After being injured in the stomach he moved to the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] to recover.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;

After recovering Pottu Amman was put in charge of the [[Tiger Organization Security Intelligence Service]] (TOSIS), the LTTE's intelligence wing, in mid 1988.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Joanne|title=An Institutional History of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)|url=https://www.sem.admin.ch/dam/data/sem/internationales/herkunftslaender/asien-nahost/lka/LKA-geschichte-ltte-e.pdf|publisher=Staatssekretariat für Migration/[[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]/The Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the IPKF withdrawal in March 1990 and under Pottu Amman's leadership, TOSIS expanded greatly and became a formidable organisation, copying the tactics of [[Inter-Services Intelligence]], [[Mossad]] and [[Shin Bet]].&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richards21&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Joanne|title=An Institutional History of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)|url=https://www.sem.admin.ch/dam/data/sem/internationales/herkunftslaender/asien-nahost/lka/LKA-geschichte-ltte-e.pdf|publisher=Staatssekretariat für Migration/[[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]/The Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chief of TOSIS, Pottu Amman is believed to have masterminded the [[List of assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War|assassinations]] of [[Rajiv Gandhi]], [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]], [[Ranjan Wijeratne]], [[Clancy Fernando]] and many others.&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt; He also played a key role in the unmasking of the "conspiracy" against LTTE leader [[V. Prabhakaran]] by deputy leader [[Mahattaya]].&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt; Pottu Amman is believed to have tortured Mahattaya and extracted his "confession".&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; In 1993 two separate divisions were created in TOSIS - National Intelligence Division and Military Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; Pottu Amman was in charge of the National Intelligence Division as well as being in overall charge of TOSIS.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richards21/&gt; He was later in charge of the LTTE's Chiruththaigal (leopard) [[commando]] division.&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLG0807"/&gt; In 1997 he was appointed military commander of [[Jaffna peninsula]].&lt;ref name="FL131297"/&gt;

In March 2008 Prabhakaran, Pottu Amman and four other LTTE members were charged with the assassination of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Sri Lanka)|Foreign Minister]] [[Lakshman Kadirgamar]] in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kadir killing: 6 top LTTEers charged|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080316/News/news0018.html|work=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|date=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
{{See also|White Flag incident}}
What happened to Pottu Amman, like many senior LTTE members, in the final staged of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] in 2009 remains shrouded in mystery and prone to wild speculations and rumours. Officially Pottu Amman was killed in the early hours of 18 May 2009 as he, Colonel Letchumanan and other LTTE cadres tried to cross the [[Nanthi Kadal]] in a boat and were fired upon by Sri Lankan soldiers.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OI110914"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Pallavi|title='Dead' LTTE Intelligence chief Pottu Amman arrested in Hong Kong|url=http://www.oneindia.com/international/dead-ltte-intelligence-chief-pottu-amman-arrested-in-hong-kong-1519398.html|work=[[Oneindia]]|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Joanne|title=An Institutional History of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)|url=https://www.sem.admin.ch/dam/data/sem/internationales/herkunftslaender/asien-nahost/lka/LKA-geschichte-ltte-e.pdf|publisher=Staatssekretariat für Migration/[[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]/The Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sri Lankan military]] the wife of Soosai, head of the [[Sea Tigers]], had told them during [[interrogation]] that Pottu Amman, together with Soosai, Prabhakaran and Prabhakaran's son Charles Anthony, had remained in the war zone in the final days of the war.&lt;ref name="FL060609"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=B.

In September 2009 Deputy Solicitor-General [[Kapila Waidyaratne]] informed the Colombo High Court that Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman had been killed in May 2009 in Karaithuraipatru and that their names should be removed from those charged with Kadirgamar's assassination.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; Judge Kumudini Wickremasinghe approved the changes, judicially confirming Pottu Amman's death.&lt;ref name="DBSJ110909"/&gt; In March 2010 the Sri Lankan government asked [[Interpol]] to remove Pottu Amman from its most wanted list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka asks Interpol to treat Pottu Amman as dead|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/sri-lanka-asks-interpol-to-treat-pottu-amman-as-dead_612302.html|work=[[Zee News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 the charges against Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman in relation to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi were dropped after the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] filed a report stating that the pair were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LTTE chief's case closed|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/7359/year-after-death-ltte-chiefs-case-closed|work=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)]]|agency=[[Times of India]]|date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Empire Adur''''' was a 1,479 ton steamship which was built in 1920 as the '''''Griffdu'''''. She was renamed '''''Noyo''''' in 1935 and in 1940 was sold to Thailand, being renamed '''''Nang Suang Nawa''''', being seized in 1942 and renamed ''Empire Adur''. She was sold to Thailand in 1948, reverting to ''Nang Suang Nawa'' and was lost at sea in 1955 while being towed to Hong Kong for scrapping.

==History==
''Griffdu'' was built by [[J. F. Duthie &amp; Company|J F Duthie &amp; Co]], [[Seattle]], Washington. She was the 37th and last ship built by Duthie.&lt;ref name=Duthie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergency/wwone/duthie.htm |title=J. F. Duthie &amp; Company, Seattle WA |publisher=shipbuildinghistory.com |accessdate=2008-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217060141/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergency/wwone/duthie.htm |archivedate=17 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Griffdu'' was launched on 20 September 1920, and completed the following month.&lt;ref name=Miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=2220755|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her original owner was the Universal Steamship &amp; Barge Co, Seattle. In 1925, ''Griffdu'' was sold to The Charles Nelson Co, [[San Francisco]], serving with them for ten years. In 1935, ''Griffdu'' was sold to the Union Lumber Co, San Francisco, who renamed her ''Noyo''. She served for five years before being sold to the Thai Niyom Panich Co, (''Thai Navigation Co Ltd'') [[Bangkok]], who reflagged her and renamed her ''Nang Suang Nawa''.&lt;ref name=Mariner/&gt; In 1942, ''Nang Suang Nawa'' was seized,&lt;ref name=Straits/&gt; and passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] and renamed ''Empire Adur''. She was placed under the management of the [[Singapore Straits Steamship Company]].&lt;ref name=Mariner/&gt;

''Empire Adur'' was not a popular member of convoys due to the condition of her boilers, and the fact that she would belch black smoke and flames from her funnel. The convoy escorts threatened to ask ''Empire Adur'' to leave the convoy or sink her. Another of her faults was that the nut holding the steering wheel on often came loose, with the result that the  wheel came off in the helmsman's hands.&lt;ref name=Straits&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/straits3.html |title=STRAITS STEAMSHIP COMPANY |publisher=merchantnavyofficers.com |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Empire Adur'' joined [[Convoy KMS 21]] at [[Gibraltar]] on 29 July 1943, arriving at [[Port Said]] on 9 August. ''Empire Adur'' had a final destination of [[Tripoli]] and [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=KMS21&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warsailors.com/convoys/kms21.html |title=CONVOY KMS 21 |publisher=warsailors.com |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, ''Empire Adur'' was sold to the Thai Maritime Navigation Co, Bangkok and regained her former name of ''Nang Suang Nawa''. She served for a further seven years but went missing under tow by the [[Philippines]] registered tug ''Albacore'' to [[Hong Kong]] for scrapping. Both vessels were presumed lost.&lt;ref name=Mariner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireA.html |title=EMPIRE - A |publisher=Mariners-L |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last reported position was north of the [[Paracel Islands]] at {{coord|17|56|N|113|45|E|display=inline,title}} on 23 November 1955.&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book | first1 =W H| last1 =Mitchell |first2=L A |last2=Sawyer | year = 1995| title = The Empire Ships| publisher = Lloyd's of London Press Ltd| location = London|isbn=1-85044-275-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satyagraha''' ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}}; satya: "''truth''", graha: "''insistence''" or "''holding firmly to''") or holding onto truth''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gandhifoundation.net/about%20gandhi6.htm “Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.”&lt;/ref&gt;'' or truth force – is a particular form of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]].  Someone who practices satyagraha is a '''satyagrahi'''.

The term ''satyagraha'' was coined and developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948).&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uma Majmudar|title=Gandhi's pilgrimage of faith: from darkness to light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xM4paHEq5oQC&amp;pg=PA138|year=2005|publisher=SUNY Press|page=138|isbn=9780791464052}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deployed satyagraha in the [[Indian independence movement]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]] for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s and [[James Bevel]]'s campaigns  during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States, and many other social justice and similar movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525247/satyagraha "Gandhi’s satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=9165422 "In this respect Satyagraha or non-violent resistance, as conceived by Gandhiji, has an important lesson for pacifists and war-resisters of the West. Western pacifists have so far proved ineffective because they have thought that war can be resisted by mere propaganda, conscientious objection, and organization for settling disputes." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and meaning of name ==
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|250px|Gandhi leading the 1930 [[Salt March]], a notable example of satyagraha.]]

The term originated in a competition in the news-sheet ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' in [[South Africa]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38" /&gt; Mr. Maganlal Gandhi, grandson of an uncle of Gandhi, came up with the word "Sadagraha" and won the prize. Subsequently, to make it clearer, Gandhi changed it to Satyagraha. "Satyagraha" is a [[tatpuruṣaya]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of the Sanskrit words ''[[satya]]'' (meaning "truth") and ''agraha'' ("polite insistence", or "holding firmly to"). Satya is derived from the word “sat”, which means “being”. Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth. In the context of satyagraha, Truth therefore includes a) Truth in speech, as opposed to falsehood, b) what is real, as opposed to nonexistent (asat) and c) good as opposed to evil, or bad.  This was critical to Gandhi’s understanding of and faith in nonviolence: "The world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth. Asatya, meaning untruth, also means nonexistent, and satya or truth also means that which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of the question. And truth being that which is, can never be destroyed. This is the doctrine of satyagraha in a nutshell." &lt;ref&gt;Nagler, Michael N. The Nonviolence Handbook: A Guide for Practical Action. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere "passive resistance" and became strength in practising non-violent methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his words:
{{quote|Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, ''Satyagraha in South Africa'', Navajivan, Ahmedabad, 1111, pp. 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1935, a letter to P. K. Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of [[Civil Disobedience]] was adapted from the writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]] especially ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' of 1849.
{{quote|The statement that I had derived my idea of civil disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on civil disobedience. But the movement was then known as passive resistance. As it was incomplete, I had coined the word satyagraha for the Gujarati readers. When I saw the title of Thoreau’s great essay, I began the use of his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance. Non-violence was always an integral part of our struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gandhi described it as follows:

{{quote|I have also called it love-force or soul-force. In the application of satyagraha, I discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one’s opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Statement to Disorders Inquiry Committee'' January 5, 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 206)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contrast to "passive resistance" ==

Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter:
{{quote|"I have drawn the distinction between passive resistance as understood and practised in the West and satyagraha before I had evolved the doctrine of the latter to its full logical and spiritual extent. I often used “passive resistance” and “satyagraha” as synonymous terms: but as the doctrine of satyagraha developed, the expression “passive resistance” ceases even to be synonymous, as passive resistance has admitted of violence as in the case of the [[suffragette]]s and has been universally acknowledged to be a weapon of the weak. Moreover, passive resistance does not necessarily involve complete adherence to truth under every circumstance. Therefore it is different from satyagraha in three essentials: Satyagraha is a weapon of the strong; it admits of no violence under any circumstance whatsoever; and it ever insists upon truth."&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Letter to Mr.&amp;nbsp;– ” 25 January 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 350)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Ahimsa and satyagraha==
It is important to note the intrinsic connection between [[ahinsa]] and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a “marked” meaning to refer specifically to [[direct action]] that is largely obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience.

Gandhi says:
{{quote|It is perhaps clear from the foregoing, that without ahinsa it is not possible to seek and find Truth. Ahimsa and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle and separate them. They are like the two sides of a coin, or rather of a smooth unstamped metallic disk. Nevertheless, ahimsa is the means; Truth is the end. Means to be means must always be within our reach, and so ahimsa is our supreme duty.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha). Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Defining success ===
Assessing the extent to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that "this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Judith M., "Gandhi and Civil Resistance in India, 1917–47: Key Issues", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent’s objectives, or to meet one’s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, “The Satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Requisite Qualifications” ''Harijan'' 25 March 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, for e.g. a dictator, has to be unseated and one cannot wait to convert him. The satyagrahi would count this a partial success.

=== Means and ends ===
The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: “They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm “The Gospel Of Sarvodaya], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi used an example to explain this:

{{quote|If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Brute Force”, Chapter XVI of ''Hind Swaraj'', 1909 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 10, p. 287)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against “by any means necessary”&amp;nbsp;– if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap28.htm “Between Cowardice and Violence,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satyagraha versus duragraha ===
The essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or “purify” it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a “silent force” or a “soul force” (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous “[[I Have a Dream]]” speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a “universal force,” as it essentially “makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.”&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Rules of Satyagraha” ''Young India (Navajivan)'' 23 February 1930 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 48, p. 340)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with “duragraha” (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents.  He wrote: “There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap34.htm “Power of Satyagraha,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the “law of suffering”,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Law of Suffering” ''Young India'' 16 June 1920&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice.

== In large-scale conflict ==
{{main|Bardoli Satyagraha|Champaran Satyagraha|Kheda Satyagraha|Dharasana Satyagraha|Flag Satyagraha|Guruvayur Satyagraha|Non-cooperation movement|Quit India Movement|Salt Satyagraha|Vaikom Satyagraha}}

When using satyagraha in a large-scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline.  He wrote that it is “only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.”&lt;ref name="prereq" /&gt;

He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis:
# Appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily
# Tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient
# Be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends&lt;ref name="prereq"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Pre-requisites for Satyagraha” ''Young India'' 1 August 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

This obedience has to be not merely grudging, but extraordinary:
{{quote|...an honest, respectable man will not suddenly take to stealing whether there is a law against stealing or not, but this very man will not feel any remorse for failure to observe the rule about carrying headlights on bicycles after dark.... But he would observe any obligatory rule of this kind, if only to escape the inconvenience of facing a prosecution for a breach of the rule. Such compliance is not, however, the willing and spontaneous obedience that is required of a Satyagrahi.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “A Himalayan Miscalculation” in ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' Chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
Gandhi envisioned satyagraha as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle, but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm.

He founded the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to teach satyagraha.  He asked satyagrahis to follow the following principles (Yamas described in Yoga Sutra):&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha)'' (1961) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nonviolence ([[ahimsa]])
# Truth – this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true
# Not stealing
# [[Non-possession]] (not the same as poverty)
# Body-labor or bread-labor
# Control of desires (gluttony)
# Fearlessness
# Equal respect for all religions
# Economic strategy such as boycott of imported goods ([[swadeshi]])
On another occasion, he listed these rules as “essential for every Satyagrahi in India”:
# Must have a living faith in God
# Must be leading a chaste life, and be willing to die or lose all his possessions
# Must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner
# Must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants

=== Rules for satyagraha campaigns ===
Gandhi proposed a series of rules for satyagrahis to follow in a resistance campaign:&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;
# Harbour no anger.
# Suffer the anger of the opponent.
# Never retaliate to assaults or punishment; but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger.
# Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property.
# If you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life.
# Do not curse or swear.
# Do not insult the opponent.
# Neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent’s leaders.
# If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life.
# As a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect).
# As a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment.
# As a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect.
# Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.

== American Civil Rights Movement ==
Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance. For example, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi's influence on his developing ideas regarding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States:

{{quote|Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his [[Salt March]] to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of ''Satyagraha'' (''Satya'' is truth which equals love, and ''agraha'' is force; ''Satyagraha'', therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform. ... It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and nonviolence that I discovered the method for social reform that I had been seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Martin Luther King, Jr.|last= King, Jr. |first= Martin Luther | title= [[The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]| isbn=0-446-52412-3| year=1998 | editor1-first=Clayborne  |editor1-last=Carson | pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Satyagraha in relation to genocide ==
In view of the [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1930s-1940)|Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany]], Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating:

{{quote|If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance, but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy [...] the calculated violence of [[Hitler]] may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the God-fearing, death has no terror.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Jews” ''Harijan'' 26 November 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled “Some Questions Answered”:

{{quote|Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticizing my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-violence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them, I have suggested nothing new... What I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Questions Answered” ''Harijan'' 17 December 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, pp. 297–98)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during [[World War II]], Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called "Civilian Based Defense (CBD) or "[[social defence]]"):

{{quote|...there should be unadulterated non-violent non-cooperation, and if the whole of India responded and unanimously offered it, I should show that, without shedding a single drop of blood, Japanese arms – or any combination of arms – can be sterilized. That involves the determination of India not to give quarter on any point whatsoever and to be ready to risk loss of several million lives. But I would consider that cost very cheap and victory won at that cost glorious. That India may not be ready to pay that price may be true. I hope it is not true, but some such price must be paid by any country that wants to retain its independence. After all, the sacrifice made by the Russians and the Chinese is enormous, and they are ready to risk all. The same could be said of the other countries also, whether aggressors or defenders. The cost is enormous. Therefore, in the non-violent technique I am asking India to risk no more than other countries are risking and which India would have to risk even if she offered armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Non-violent Non-cooperation” ''Harijan'' 24 May 1942, p. 167 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 82, p. 286; interview conducted 16 May 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sean Richard Sellers''' (May 18, 1969 &amp;ndash; February 4, 1999) was an [[United States|American]] [[murder]]er, one of [[List of juvenile offenders executed in the United States|22 persons in the United States]] since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 to be executed for a crime committed while under the age of 18, and the only one to have been executed for crime committed under the age of 17.&lt;ref name="deathpenaltyinfo.org"&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=27&amp;did=203#execsus Execution of Juveniles in the U.S. and other Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513015221/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=27&amp;did=203 |date=2008-05-13 }}, deathpenaltyinfo.org; accessed May 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His case drew worldwide attention due to his age as well as his jailhouse conversion to [[Christianity]] and his claim that [[demonic possession]] made him innocent of his crimes.

==Crimes==
On March 5, 1986, Sellers killed his mother and stepfather, Vonda and Lee Bellofatto, while they were asleep in the bedroom of their Oklahoma City home. Wearing only underwear to limit blood spatter on himself, he first shot his step-father. The shot awoke his mother, whom he shot in the face. Sellers tried to disguise his guilt by arranging the crime scene to look as if an intruder had committed the killings.&lt;ref name="Devil"&gt;Dawkins and Higgins, ''Devil Child'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers also later confessed to the 1985 killing of a [[Circle K]] convenience store clerk &lt;!-- name?? --&gt;who had refused to sell him beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antonowicz|first=A.|title=On Thursday He Dies|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/On+Thursday+He+Dies+..%3B+Sean+Sellers+was+an+abused+16-year-old+when...-a060226483|accessdate=2015-04-23|work=''[[Daily Mirror]]''|date=January 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avowal of Satanism at trial==
At his trial, Sellers claimed he was a practicing [[Satanism|Satanist]] at the time of the murders and that demonic possession (by the demon "Ezurate"&lt;ref name="Pulling90"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stackpole|first=Michael A.|title=The Pulling Report: Sean Sellers|year=1990|at=Appendix 1|url=http://www.rpgstudies.net/stackpole/pulling_report.html#App1|accessdate=March 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616162940/http://www.rpgstudies.net/stackpole/pulling_report.html#App1#App1|archive-date=2010-06-16|dead-url=no|df=}} See Appendix 1: Letter from Sean Sellers.&lt;/ref&gt;) caused him to murder his victims. In later documents, he claimed to have read ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' by [[Anton Lavey]] "hundreds of times" between the ages of 15 and 16, when the crimes were committed,&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;Sellers, "Letter to Satanists" [http://seansellers.com/open_letter_to_satanists.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120020450/http://www.seansellers.com/open_letter_to_satanists.htm# |date=2008-11-20 }} accessed 2008-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and in a "Confession" letter written from prison, he reflected on this period of his life: "I got very involved in Satanism. I truly thought it was an honest way to live, and the rituals of it would enable me to control my life."&lt;ref name="confession"&gt;Sellers, "The Confession of My Crimes," [http://seansellers.com/confession.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203083818/http://seansellers.com/confession.htm# |date=2009-02-03 }}; accessed December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His attorneys also argued Sellers was addicted to the game "[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]", although Sellers would later write that the game had no part in his crimes and that "using my past as a common example of the effects of the game is either irrational or fanatical."&lt;ref name="Pulling90"/&gt;

The jury refused to consider either claim, and Sellers was found guilty of multiple homicides and sentenced to death in 1986.&lt;ref name="Devil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greiner"&gt;Greiner, John. "Sellers Implores Appeals Court To Stay Execution", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', January 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Oklahoma law did not give juries the option of giving a life sentence without the possibility of parole (that choice became available in 1987). One juror later said that the jury felt Sellers would be paroled in 7 to 14 years, and this prison term was not lengthy enough.  So the jury opted for the death penalty.&lt;ref name="ClayJuror"&gt;Clay, Nolan. "Ex-Juror Fails to Sway Board on Clemency Bid", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', January 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurors denied this was part of the deliberations.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sellers Executed For 3 Murders|date=1999-02-04|last1=Clay|first1=Nolan|last2=Thornton|first2=Anthony|work=[[The Daily Oklahoman]]|url=http://newsok.com/article/2641662|accessdate=2018-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413030313/http://newsok.com/article/2641662#|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious conversion to Christianity==
Sellers became a Christian while in prison. His friends started a website on his behalf, and he campaigned for [[clemency]] based on his religious conversion, age and involvement in Satanism. While on [[death row]], Sellers made numerous appearances in the mass media, appearing on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and on a [[Geraldo Rivera#Talk shows.2C specials and guest appearances|notorious segment]] of ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'' about Satanism.&lt;ref name="Ponca"&gt;"Sean Sellers Executed For Murders as a Teen", ''Ponca City News'', February 4, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alaska"&gt;Trostle and Green, "The Devil Made Me Do It: Adolescent Attraction to Satanism", ''Society: An Alaskan Perspective'', 1996.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in documentaries about Satanism and [[serial killer]]s for ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', [[MSNBC]], [[WNS NEWS]] and the [[A&amp;E Network]]. Sellers married in prison on February 14, 1995, but the marriage was annulled in 1997.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;

Sellers' step-siblings doubted that his conversion to Christianity was a sincere one.&lt;ref name="Facing"&gt;Thornton, Anthony. "Facing Death, Inmate Trying to Raise Doubt", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', January 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Of his many surviving family members, only his step-grandfather believed his conversion to have been genuine. However, the prison chaplain believed he had truly converted.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Nolan. "Sellers Hellbound, Family Says", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', February 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals and execution==
During his 1999 appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]], Sellers contended he had [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] (now dissociative identity disorder). The appellate court ruled that there was "uncontroverted evidence" of Sellers' religious conversion and that he may indeed suffer from multiple personality disorder. The panel of judges concluded that while Sellers might have been insane at the time of his crimes, the claim was made too late to be raised on appeal. [[Human Rights Watch]] condemned this decision to "[uphold] the sentence on narrow procedural grounds" despite the "acknowledged 'uncontested clinical evidence' that Sellers suffers from multiple personality disorder", adding in its letter to Governor Keating that "No civilized society can accept the execution of a person who was a child at the time he committed his crimes and who was — and remains — afflicted with a mental disorder. Such an execution offends the most basic principles of international justice and morality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/27/state-governor-urged-stop-execution-juvenile State Governor Urged to Stop Execution of Juvenile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126175532/https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/27/state-governor-urged-stop-execution-juvenile# |date=2015-11-26 }}, hrw.org; accessed May 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1999 letter HR Watch observed also that since 1990, the only other countries known to have executed juvenile offenders besides the United States of America were Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Psychiatric experts scoffed at Sellers' claim, arguing that any true mental illness would have been diagnosed soon after Sellers' arrest and not seven years later.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis"&gt;Thornton, Anthony. "Condemned Killer's Mental Diagnosis Draws Skeptics", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', January 27, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Prison officials also cast doubt on Sellers' mental illness by saying they saw Sellers rehearsing the evidence of mental illness and receiving coaching from his attorneys.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis"/&gt; 

Sellers made the same insanity claim to his clemency board, but the board refused to consider the issue. The board appeared to be swayed by prison officials' statements, the lengthy time delay in diagnosing the illness, and statements by Sellers' accomplice that he had seen no evidence of multiple personality. "The only thing that worried him was getting caught", Richard Howard wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thornton, Anthony. "Board Denies Sellers' Plea For Clemency", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', January 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Anthony. "Prison Staffers Brand Sellers 'Manipulator'", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', February 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]], but the court declined his appeal.&lt;ref name="Greiner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;

Two days before his execution, Sellers filed two more appeals. The first appeal, made in federal district court, accused the state Pardon and Parole Board of violating his civil rights. Sellers argued the pardon board's decisions were not impartial and were, instead, capricious. The appeal was denied, the issue having been considered and rejected by state courts numerous times (and recently as well). A second appeal, filed with the state Court of Criminal Appeals, claimed the state appellate court made a mistake by ruling Sellers had waived his insanity claim at trial. The state appellate court admitted it used the wrong legal justification in deciding Sellers' waiver of mental illness, but nevertheless rejected Sellers' appeal after reconsidering the case on the merits raised by Sellers' defense team.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Anthony and Greiner, John. "Condemned Killer Tries Last-Ditch Appeal", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', February 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, John. "U.S. Judge Denies Bid By Sellers", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', February 4, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers' imminent execution brought condemnation from a wide variety of sources, including the [[European Union]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Bianca Jagger]]. Nearly all raised issues about his age at the time of the crimes, and many argued that his religious work from prison outweighed the state's need to execute him.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;

Sellers was executed by [[lethal injection]] on February 4, 1999 at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]] at 12:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., five minutes after the lethal drugs were injected.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt; For his last meal, he had Chinese food: eggrolls, sweet-and-sour shrimp, and batter-fried shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. man executed for murdering parents|date=1999-02-04|agency=[[Reuters]]}} &lt;!-- free (non-lexis) online unsourceable but avail. at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.true-crime/Y73Y1lkRmQs/9Tiv6YkztysJ --&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; He began his final statement by addressing his step-siblings:{{quotation|All the people that are hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when you wake up in the morning, you're not going to feel any different. You're going to hate me just as much tomorrow as tonight. 

When you wake up and nothing has changed inside, reach out to God and He will be there for you. Reach out to God and He will heal you. Let Him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.

I love you all.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;}} 

In the final minutes before injection Sellers sang modern Christian music, then said loudly, "Here I come, Father; I'm coming home." He then turned to the Warden: "Let's do it, Gary. Let's get it on." Sellers finally sang his last words: "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee."&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;

Sellers's stepsiblings objected to the substance of his final remarks, that instead of apologizing or mentioning their mother, he only "addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel", said his stepsister.&lt;ref name="Ponca"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Sellers was the first and remains the only person executed in the U.S. for a crime committed under the age of 17 since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976.&lt;ref name="DOKFeb99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facing"/&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', {{ussc|542|551|2005}} later decided it was unconstitutional to execute an individual for a crime committed under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="Ponca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coppernoll, Carrie. "Supreme Court: Penalty Judged Cruel and Unusual", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', March 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in prison, Sellers authored a book of love stories and poems titled ''Shuladore''. The book was self-published, and sold via his Web site. Under Oklahoma law, a defendant cannot "receive any proceeds or profits from any source" as a direct or indirect result of his crime. An Oklahoma grand jury investigated whether Sellers or his friends received profits from the sale of the book, but no indictment was forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Bobby Jr. "Proceeds From Killer's Book Investigated", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', May 19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A Christian book publisher issued Sellers' autobiography, ''Web of Darkness'', in 1999 shortly before his death.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''Social cleansing''' ({{lang-es|limpieza social}}) is class-based killing that consists of elimination of members of society considered "undesirable," including but not limited to the homeless, criminals, [[street children]], the elderly, sex workers, and sexual minorities{{clarify|date=May 2015}}.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is caused by a combination of economic and social factors, but killings are notably present in regions with high levels of poverty and disparities of wealth.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators are usually of the same community as the victims and are often motivated by the idea that the victims are a drain on the resources of society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by national and local governments to stop these killings have been largely ineffective, and the government and police forces are often involved in the killings, especially in South America.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ab 187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mig 1155"/&gt;

==Causes==

===Africa===
In African countries, social cleansing almost always takes the form of [[witch hunting]],{{fact|date=April 2016}} which is most common in areas with poor economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Several social and economic theories exist as to why such circumstances have arisen and led to accusations of witchcraft, including warfare, natural disasters, unequal patterns of development, and larger forces of [[globalization]]. Most scholars agree that the cause of social cleansing efforts is a result of "interaction of economic conditions and cultural factors."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1169.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these theories must be linked to larger societal trends, including the devaluation and social marginalization of women as well as the placement of blame on individuals for their own economic misfortunes in lieu of recognition of global and local economic forces at play.&lt;ref name="fed14"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several scholars have emphasized the outside groups and circumstances related to these killings to dispute the idea that they are simply a cultural norm.&lt;ref name="fed11"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic====
In many countries, income disparities have led to social tensions and a climate of "mutual suspicion".&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy and powerful are perceived as having obtained their wealth through "evil arts", while the economically disadvantaged are accused of responsibility for misfortunes of the community.&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"/&gt; There is also evidence that the causes of social cleansing are linked to globalization and [[economic liberalization]], "to the extent that it has stripped entire populations of their means of subsistence, torn communities apart, deepened economic inequalities and forced people to compete for diminishing resources."{{fact|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="fed11" /&gt; Many African communities have been destabilized as communal lands have been privatized, local currency has been devalued, and public services have been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes these larger economic trends have been linked to more specific events. For example, in Southern Zimbabwe, violent wars led certain areas to be neglected in development efforts, leading to a lack of resources and increasing disparities of wealth in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, scholars have found positive correlations between extreme rainfall (both floods and droughts) and large negative income shocks and famine. These periods have been statistically linked to increases in murder of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural====
Several cultural explanations for social cleansing in Africa are related to religion.{{fact|date=April 2016}} One  that has been offered by scholars is the presence of [[Pentecostalists]], whose focus on the occult has been spread by the media and increased social anxiety. Pentecostalists have been recorded as preaching connections between illness and the devil, which has combined potently with existing indigenous beliefs, most notably in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="fed 12" /&gt; In Tanzania, a positive correlation exists between witch killing and areas where populations practice traditional religions, where belief in witchcraft is strong.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p.1154.&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars have suggested that the presence of these beliefs is important because it demonstrates that perpetrators generally do believe that their victims are practicing witchcraft, they also recognize that populations of traditional religious beliefs are often also of low socio-economic status, which supports their assertion that poverty is still the primary factor in motivating killings.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The most widespread myth about social cleansing in Latin America is that these killings are all related to drug use.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon is larger than the drug problem and is related to state ideology, a culture of violence, and inequitable wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Colombia specifically, economic factors account for many of the reasons behind these killings, but such factors are additionally "aggravated by external political and economic pressures from the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic====
Latin America has an extremely large number of individuals living below the poverty line, and these individuals are largely blamed for their impoverished state.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, pp.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals are in critical poverty, meaning that they do not even have the ability to secure food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This critical poverty is connected to inflation rates that has led the cost of living to increase and the minimum salary to be hardly adequate for survival.&lt;ref name="ord28"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the gap between the rich and poor has widened, and funds for welfare programs and social services has decreased while funding for security forces to protect "the haves from the have-nots" have tripled in Colombia specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culture of violence====
{{main|Crime and violence in Latin America}}

Latin America's history has long been plagued by political violence, which over time has morphed into class-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Despite mostly formally democratic governments, the "legacy of authoritarianism" lingers, and the presence of "armed actors" is prevalent as a result of a long history of violence between military, [[paramilitary]], and guerilla groups.&lt;ref&gt;Koonings 2001, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this culture of violence has had various effects on the underclass in countries in Latin America. The military and especially the police have been known to use violence to harm citizens rather than protect them.&lt;ref name="koon 404"&gt;Koonings 2001, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Private "vigilante" security forces have likewise used violence against the poor with the idea of promoting law and order, especially in Colombia, Guatemala, and Peru.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Though many guerilla groups are much less violent than when they originally emerged, they are a presence and an additional source of violence, especially in Colombia.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Tension between political groups has led these guerilla groups, the government, and vigilante actors to suspect peasants of working with their enemy and to intimidate them into leaving land in the countryside for the city.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Other poor rural residents have been forced to leave due to general violence or lack of public services.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Violence at the local level is also extremely common by organized criminals such as street gangs, drug bosses, vigilante justice groups, and local civil patrols.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; When poor residents are forced to move to the city, they often must turn to prostitution, crime, or begging in inner-city ghettos, which puts them in an extremely vulnerable position in the presence of these violent groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Men in particular become even more entrenched in the culture of violence as many join gangs to escape "social exclusion and economic disadvantage" and establish a sense of identity and masculinity.&lt;ref name="wild 741"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.741.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, violence exists at a level even smaller than the community—the home. Children are often victims of "physical, mental, and sexual abuse by adults member of their own families."&lt;ref name="ord 22"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Guatemala specifically, social cleansing occurs with the "backdrop of genocide," and homicide rates are still extremely high after "three decades of armed conflict" during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="san 108"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence experienced across the region has led to an erosion of social capital, which was described by Colombians as including "'social mistrust,' 'lack of unity,' 'fear' and 'lack of social institutions.'" &lt;ref name="mc971"&gt;McIlwaine and Moser 2001, p.971.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social cleansing in Spain ==
Spain, during times before colonization, demonstrates societal patterns that shaped life in Spain in terms of prejudice and discrimination. The discriminatory practice of Spanish legislation led to a certain caste system, pertaining to those with or without honor. Moreover one's reputation and the way one was treated was based on aspects such as honor, legitimacy, and the limpieza de sangre, a prejudicial marker that indicates one’s purity of blood, relating to their family timeline and deciding how society was to treat them.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Historic meanings of honor included those cultural specific ways that Spaniards had always rationalized discrimination due to defects in birth (illegitimate, nonnoble), religion (non-Catholic), and race (nonwhite).” &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This discriminatory institution based on these concepts of honor, limpieza, and legitimacy, is expressed through the legislation of Spanish government at the time. An example of this is was in 1414 when Pope Benedict XIII approved the constitution of Spanish College’s San Bartolomé, which linked these concepts through the school's acceptances.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Those excepted into the school had to prove they had pure blood, rather than Jewish, Moorish, or heretical heritage.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Social Cleansing in Colonial Latin America ==
The concept of "limpieza de sangre," or purity of blood, was used in societies of Spain and Portugal, originating from Iberian culture, where reputation was inherited by one's ancestors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had there been someone found to be a race such as Jewish, a converted Jewish, or Muslim in their family timeline, it was said to be a stain on their ancestry.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Consequently, one's own ancestry determined their reputation and social standing, impacting other aspects such as access to education, career, and marriage for further generations. This became known as the culture of honor, which resided in such reputational ancestry that came to define how individuals were respected.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Limpieza de sangre affected life for every individual in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, including the degree to exclusion and racial discrimination. When Europe came to colonize the "New World" these ethics of honor and limpieza de sangre implied that those with blood lacking purity to European standards was inferior. The Europeans were at the "apex" of social structure and everyone who was not identical in blood was inferior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As colonists, the presumed inferiors were the colonized and thus, due to this culture of honor, they became victims of this discrimination. While over time assimilation and miscegenation and admixture complicated this concept of social cleansing, the ideals of "purity of blood" prevailed, and elite was considered to be of European and Christian origins.

The conquest of indigenous people in Latin America strengthened these ideals. The vulnerability of one's identity in colonial America gave way to ones defense of honor, except for the elites and those in power, typically the colonists. As the degree of honor perceived by individuals was reputational, people felt the need to be confirmed by society or from those in good social standing through submission into the given standards that one's place holds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The pursuit of this honor leads to many disputes, as well as the fear of being rejected by society and losing one's place.

Despite these long-lived standards, during post colonialism, the ideals of Latin America changed with independence and the growth of democratic values. With this, the culture of honor and respect in those with pure bloodlines changed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; People began to socially include those who were previously seen as inferior.

==Social cleansing in Brazil==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common murder victim in [[Brazil]] is a young, black male living in a [[favela]], or a Brazilian slum.&lt;ref name="wild 730"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.730.&lt;/ref&gt; These young men typically are, or are assumed to be, gang members and criminals.&lt;ref name="wild 723"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.723.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence and murder are most common in areas that are economically disadvantaged and socially marginalized.&lt;ref name="wild 726"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.726.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often targets by association, though the effects of social cleansing and violence against women are largely absent in existing research.&lt;ref name="wild 733"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.733&lt;/ref&gt; Killings are often in public places, with victims being beaten or shot in the street.&lt;ref name="wild 739"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.739.&lt;/ref&gt; Police groups sometimes simply enter the community in a large armoured vehicle called a ""caveirão"" and start shooting.&lt;ref name="wild 743"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.743.&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle contributes to the "anonymity and impunity for the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="wild 743"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Social cleansing in Brazil is the result of a "murky symbiosis [that] has developed between the official security forces and paramilitary and vigilante-type actors" that carry out "law enforcement against the 'marginal classes.'"&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; State actors often act against the poor "as a form or result of exclusion and oppression."&lt;ref name="wild 725"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.725.&lt;/ref&gt; Gangs serve as a scapegoat for the levels of violence and lack of security in many communities.&lt;ref name="wild 726"/&gt; Private groups and some gangs perpetrate killings in attempts to take policing into their own hands.&lt;ref name="wild 732"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.732.&lt;/ref&gt; While some killings are a result of groups attempting to punish criminals for misdemeanors, others are a result of perceived threats of poor citizens, such as members of workers' movements.&lt;ref name="wild 733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koon 2001"&gt;Koonings 2001, p.405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Colombia==

In the 1980s, "social cleansing" groups started to be created. Their main mission was "to make justice" by killing all non-appropriate people in social terms, like prostitutes, street-living people, transvestites, and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence in Colombia: Building Sustainable Peace and Social Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZfIGhYF-BAC&amp;pg=RA1-PR2|date=January 2000|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-4383-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Victims and Methods===
Victims of social cleansing in [[Colombia]] are members of society who are considered "undesirable" and "disposable."&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; They are economically disadvantaged, usually live on the streets, and are considered to be a burden on society, "the cause of the country's problems, rather than a consequence of them."&lt;ref name="ord19"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Street children====
One of these groups is street children, who are without homes due to abuse, forced displacement, or the death of their parents.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; Death rates for street children have been as high as six to eight children per day.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often shot in their sleep or stabbed to death on the streets or in the police station. A 1993 case in which a 9-year-old girl was strangled to death in Bogota brought attention to this problem and led to nominal reforms.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Police targets street children specifically under the assumption that they are drug users and criminals. This is to some extent true, as many use drugs to relieve pain and avoid hunger and must shoplift to survive.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388"&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite living in conditions of extreme vulnerability to "aggression and danger," the National Police poses the greatest threat to street children's survival, as they drive them off the streets and target them in social cleansing.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388" /&gt;

====Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers====
Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers are also common targets. From 1988 to 1993, these individuals collectively comprised 56% of social cleansing victims.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are often victims of physical and sexual abuse by the police and vigilante groups known as "comas".&lt;ref name="ord23"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One common method of killing these individuals in the city of Bogota is the Choachí run, in which victims are taken to the top of a mountain in the town of Choachí, executed, and thrown off the mountain. In some cases, they are released to attempt escape, but die by falling down the mountain or being shot at as they run.&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; A similar method is known as "the ride," in which victims are forced into a vehicle, killed, and left in a desolate area.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; Death squads have employed other means for killing suspected criminals, such as murdering them and then cutting off their hands and putting them in small boxes in public spaces to intimidate other criminals.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Another group has been known to shoot victims and then cast their bodies into the municipal stadium.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;

====Sex workers and sexual minorities====
Sex workers and sexual minorities are treated quite similarly in regards to social cleansing, as both are hard to identify and victims of heavy discrimination despite the fact that both homosexuality and prostitution are legal.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many female sex workers are forced into the line of work due to poverty and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; Both male and female sex workers are often harassed by the police, and males specifically are demanded to pay a "tax" where "failure to pay results in beatings or imprisonment."&lt;ref name="ord 26"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In an upside-down system, encounters with dishonest police are preferable to honest police, as the dishonest will accept bribes, while the honest are more likely to kill.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt; Sexual minorities are particularly difficult to identify, because not only do some male sex workers participate in gay sex out of economic necessity, but victims are only considered homosexual if they were dressed as females at the time of death.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt;

====Beggars and Recyclers====
Another group includes those individuals in the most extreme form of poverty. These individuals subsist by asking for money and/or collecting garbage.&lt;ref name="ord 24"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The police have been known to kill these victims in especially cruel ways, such as pouring gasoline on them and setting them on fire.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt; It is also notable that at least 14 destitute individuals have been killed by security guards at one Colombian university for the use of their bodies as cadavers in the medical school.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===

====National Police====
The National Police has played a large role in carrying out class-based killings in Colombia. The police created the term "disposable" (Spanish: ''desechable'') to define economically disadvantaged people who are considered to have no value to society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether directly or through "paramilitary clients," the National Police was responsible for 74% of deaths related to social cleansing in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations include "security, aesthetics, economic well-being, morals, and religion."&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; In regards to safety and economic well-being, rationales include the idea that the poor are or look like criminals and decrease public safety and drive customers away from businesses.&lt;ref name="ord 31"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral arguments include protection from homosexuals and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;

====Death Squads and Paramilitary Groups====
The distinction between death squads and paramilitary groups and the National Police is not always clear. Not only are policemen often members of these groups, but these groups typically enjoy the protection of the police.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members include businessmen, industrialists, guerillas, and soldiers.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Death squads emerged in the late 1970s, one of the first being the Black Hand, a group that murdered suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 18" /&gt; Their reasoning behind these killings is the flawed legal system, which convicts less than 3% of criminals. Death squads and other groups believe it necessary to step in where the legal system has failed by eliminating these suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;  As of 1995, there were no less than 40 of these squads operating in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Factors===

====National government====
The role of the national government in Colombia has largely been complicit cooperation with the National Police. By failing to deal with crime and then also effectively granting impunity to police and military groups, the state has allowed safety issues to be addressed with violence and  has perpetuated a "cycle of crime, lack of public safety, violent response, and impunity" due to "terrifying inefficiency and unwillingness to hold people accountable for their acts".&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the government at least tries to protect street children through programs to put them in state-run homes, these programs often do not align with their actual needs and have largely failed.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; There have been limited attempts to protect those in poverty in the legal system, and one case of harassment against the poor resulted in a judge calling for their equal treatment and compensation from the offending policemen. However, the decision was not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Guatemala==

===Victims and Methods===
Social cleansing and gang killings make up a large portion of the homicides in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="san 112"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Since gangs typically make no effort to cover up crimes and leave bodies at the place of death, "signs of torture," as well as location of the body, "serve as indicators of the existence of social cleansing," according to Elizabeth Sanford.&lt;ref name="san 111"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by the Human Rights Ombudsman, "the increase in the number of women killed whose bodies bore marks of torture and other sadistic abuse accounted for 40 percent of the total increase in female murders in 2005."&lt;ref name="san 118"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Though female victims account for 10% of all homicides, over 18% of cadavers with signs of torture indicating social cleansing were female.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;  Furthermore, 2% of female victims of homicide are prostitutes, a common victim group of social cleansing efforts.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt; Furthermore, young and destitute male gang members, especially those blamed for homicide of females, have been common victims of social cleansing.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt;
The most common form of killing, indicated by the 305 cadavers found in 2005, is strangulation.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Other common methods included victims being beaten, shot in the head, bound by their hands and feet, and in the case of female victims, sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Victims are abducted, taken to a different location, are tortured and killed, and finally have their body dumped in a different location.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Perpetrators include the Guatemalan government as well as private groups either directly or indirectly complicit with the state.&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Social cleansing efforts are targeted against gangs and other perceived and actual criminals, who are blamed for the high rates of homicide.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; The perpetrators intend to both exterminate victims and intimidate other members of the target group.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt; Intimidation is carried out both through torture tactics used as well as propaganda including flyers and stickers that support social cleansing as a "method of social control."&lt;ref name="san 112"/&gt; Because perpetrators are directly or indirectly tied to the state, they naturally have impunity.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt;

===The origins of social cleansing in Guatemala===

The use of "social cleansing" efforts to eliminate criminals and other persons deemed to be socially dangerous has its origins during the period of military dictatorship and [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] (1954-1996). During the 1960s and 70s, many state-operated paramilitary front organizations (so-called "death squads") emerged with the express purpose of exterminating suspected communists and other enemies of the state. These groups included the [[Mano Blanca|MANO]], NOA, CADEG, 'Ojo por Ojo' and others. While nominally employed against political targets, the use of "death squads" came to be seen by the Guatemalan police forces (specifically the National Police) as a crime fighting tool, particularly after the election of Col. Arana Osorio in 1970 and the subsequent "state of siege". One early example of the use of "death squads" against non-political targets was a phantom organization called the 'Avenging Vulture', which specifically targeted criminals.

==Social cleansing in Tanzania==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common victims of social cleansing efforts in [[Tanzania]] are elderly women, the majority of whom are of low socioeconomic status, but several groups of people who are considered burdens to the community, such as children, the sick, infants, and the handicapped, are also victims.&lt;ref name="mig 115356"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1153-1156.&lt;/ref&gt; These people are usually accused of witchcraft following deaths or other misfortunes in society and tend to flee, choosing homelessness over death. Those who do not flee successfully are killed violently in their homes.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt; Sometimes those considered burdens are simply reduced to zero consumption and are starved to death. This occurs particularly among infants, who have no ability to flee or attempt to provide for themselves.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Victims are typically killed by members of their own families, who blame them for economic suffering and household misfortune. Accusations and subsequent killings are often incited by death or illness in the family or the family's livestock. However, general misfortune in the form of "failed crops, lost jobs, and bad dreams also arouse suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1156&lt;/ref&gt; While often accusations are raised to the effect of creating a scapegoat, not all forms of social cleansing are connected to witch hunting. The extreme scarcity theory suggests that some families to drive out or starve unproductive family members to provide more nutrients for other members.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1156-1558.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these perpetrators are young, unemployed men who see the elderly as a burden on their potential for success.&lt;ref name="fed 10"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key perpetrator of social cleansing in Tanzania are the [[Sungusungu]], councils of male elders that operate under the premise of promoting village security.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158" /&gt;  These groups formed under the premise that the government was not able to prevent crimes such as theft, and they serve as a form of vigilante justice.&lt;ref name="ab 187"&gt;Abrahams 1987, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other actors===
Although the Tanzanian government has made public witchcraft accusations illegal, the efforts to stop them have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="mig 1155"&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1155.&lt;/ref&gt; Conviction levels are extremely low, as "only seven of 1,622 individuals arrested in connection with witch killings during the 1970s and 1980s were convicted, and since then the conviction rate as apparently fallen even lower," according to  Edward Miguel.&lt;ref name="mig 1155" /&gt;  The perception of the government and police force as unable to control crime has led groups such as Sungusungu to take matters into their own hands, though studies suggest that the police may sometimes be involved in witch killings.&lt;ref name="ab 187" /&gt;

'''''Syntexis libocedrii''''', (also called the '''cedar wood wasp''' or '''incense-cedar wood wasp''') is the only living species in the [[wood wasp]] family '''Anaxyelidae''', within the [[Symphyta]], though the family has an extensive [[Mesozoic]] fossil record. This species is thus a "[[living fossil]]". It has the remarkable behavior of ovipositing only in recently burnt incense-cedar (''[[Calocedrus]]''), red cedar (''[[Thuja]]'') or juniper (''[[Juniperus]]''). The wood is often still smoldering while the wasp is laying its eggs, and the larvae develop in the wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first =N.M. | last =Schiff | title =Insects associated with forest fires in Northern California and Oregon | booktitle =Entomological Society of America meeting | date =December 2000 | location =Montreal }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''S. libocedrii'' occurs from the mountains of central [[California]] to southern [[British Columbia]], but is very rarely seen, except by firefighters.

The '''Tamagotchi Connection''' (UK: Tamagotchi Connexion) is a virtual pet in the [[Tamagotchi]] line of digital toys from [[Bandai]]. The Tamagotchi Connection is unique from prior models in that it uses [[infrared]] technology to connect and interact with other devices and was first released in 2004, 8 years after the first Tamagotchi toy. Using the device's infrared port, the virtual pet (referred to as a Tamagotchi) can make friends with other Tamagotchis, in addition to playing games, giving and receiving presents and having a baby.

Versions 1 to 4 of '''Tamagotchi Connection''' have 6 levels of friendship that can be viewed in the Friends List:
* Acquaintance (one smiley-face)
* Buddy (two smiley-faces)
* Friend (three smiley-faces)
* Good friend (four smiley-faces)
* Best friend (two love-hearts, two smiley-faces, during connection they may kiss)
* Partner (four love-hearts, during connection they will kiss and may have babies)
Versions 5 and 6 have different levels.[[File:Cliché 2007-07-17 15-08-25.jpg|thumb|260px|alt=text|Four Tamagotchi toys]]

If the Tamagotchi cannot find a partner from another device to have babies with, a matchmaker will come, allowing the Tamagotchi to have a baby with a [[computer]]-controlled Tamagotchi character. This applies to versions 1 to 4 and 6 only. Version 5 introduces a Dating Show game in which the user must play to gain a CPU partner.

==Versions==
All Tamagotchi Devices are capable of connecting with each other; however, a character from a newer Version will show on an older version as the mystery character known as Nazotchi.

===Tamagotchi Connection v2 (2004)===
The Tamagotchi Connection v2 introduces "Gotchi Points", an in-game currency used to buy shop items. Also, more games are unlocked as the Tamagotchi ages. It has 6 stages of life:
*Egg - This only occurs once the device has been reset, either by pressing the reset button on the rear of the device or by installing a new battery. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jump.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Bump.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the game Heading.
*Adult - The adult unlocks the game Slot.
*Senior. The senior can only be unlocked if the Matchmaker is refused every time it appears. This applies to all versions.

===Tamagotchi Connection v3 (2006)===
Aside from different games, The Tamagotchi Connection v3 makes few changes in comparison to the v2  Like the v2, the older the Tamagotchi gets, the more games it has access to, and there are still 6 stages of life.
*Egg - Like the v2, the egg is the first stage and occurs when the device has been reset. When the clock has been set, the egg will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Get Music.
*Child. The child unlocks the game Bump.
*Teenager. The teenager unlocks the games Flag and Heading.
*Adult. The adult unlocks the games Memory and Sprint.
*Senior. Like on the v2, the Senior can only be unlocked by refusing the Matchmaker every time it appears.

Other differences from the v2
*There is no 'Treat' option in the food.
*There are new 'Password' and 'Souvenir' options.
*When you are connecting with another v3, visiting is a new option.
*There are new 'Point' and 'Family' options in the friendbook.

=== Tamagotchi Connection v4 Jinsei (2007)===
As in previous versions, Tamagotchis play games for a certain amount of "Gotchi Points" and unlock more games as it ages.
*Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jumping Rope.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Mimic.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Shape, Dance and Flag.
*Adult - As an adult, the Tamagotchi can get a job which unlocks various mini-games, depending on what job the player chooses for the Tamagotchi. 
*Senior - Much like previous versions, the Senior life stage can only be achieved by refusing the matchmaker every time it appears.
The Tamagotchi Connection makes additional changes to gameplay instead of simply changing the games and other minor details. For example, the child and teenager can go to school and play mini-games, where an adult can get a job. Also, the "Lamp" menu item (allows the user to turn the "light" on or off) is no longer present. Instead, it is replaced with a "Mail" menu item where the player can check for any mail they will occasionally receive.

New to the Tamagotchi Connection with the v4 is the ability for a child or teenager Tamagotchi to go to school and an adult to go to work. The player can choose which teacher they want once the Tamagotchi reaches the Teenage stage, and will train either "Funny Points", "Gorgeous Points" and "Spiritual Points" through mini-games. The player also chooses what job an adult Tamagotchi gets and will unlock mini-games based on this choice.

==== Tamagotchi Connection v4.5 ====
The Connection v4.5 makes minimal changes to gameplay from the v4, short of adding new games; however, the Tamagotchi is now able to collect "Life Points".
*Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Climb.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Tug of War.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Apples, Shapes, and Man-hole.
*Adult - As an adult, the Tamagotchi can get a job which unlocks various mini-games, depending on what job the player chooses for the Tamagotchi.
*Senior - Much like previous versions, the Senior life stage can only be achieved by refusing the matchmaker every time it appears.

====PC====
This option is needed to visit the V4 online world of [[Tamagotchi Town]]. The Tamagotchi goes off the screen and a Log-In Password is provided. At Tamagotchi Town, the password is entered and Tamagotchi Town appears on-screen. In Tamagotchi Town, many things can be done, such as:

* Shopping for items and food (up to 10)
* Earning "Gotchi" points (up to 9900)
* Earning souvenirs
* Travelling to different countries
* Going to preschool
* Going to school
* Going to work
* Playing games
* Visit previous Tamagotchis

===Tamagotchi Connection v5 Familitchi (2008)===
The Tamagotchi Connection v5 is the English version of the FamiTama and is the first Tamagotchi to be exactly the same (besides language) worldwide since the Tamagotchi Plus. It was released in Asia on January 6, 2008 in Australia on January 10, 2008 and was released worldwide later in February 2008. The v5 introduces the ability to raise families, with 3-5 parents and kids. It also has a new website that it shares with the Famitama, the "Tama and Earth Expo". According to the package, "The Tamagotchis set up this expo to learn more about Earth." It contains a central pavilion and 4 other pavilions representing each of the main areas of the Earth. It also included a TV option where the player can use Gotchi Points to shop on the Shopping Channel, find a mate with the Dating Show, or go travelling on the Travelling Show which replaces the pause function of previous generations. There is a design flaw with the v5 which prevents it from properly connecting to the other Tamagotchis in the series.

Differences from previous versions:
*Individual Tamagotchis cannot be named. Instead, a family name is selected and individuals are identified by their character type. 
*There is a family bond percentage
*The Discipline is replaced with a Play option.

===Tamagotchi Connection v6 Music Star===
The Tamagotchi Connection v6 is the final release in the Connection series and allows the Tamagotchi to become a pop star. As the Tamagotchi ages, it will learn a musical instrument and a band manager will come once the Tamagotchi reaches 5 in-game years of age.

'''Torokul Dzhanuzakov''' (1893—1921) was a Soviet politician; the deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Committee of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], chairman of the Commission for Refugees in 1916, one of the main organizers and leaders of the pan-Turk movement in Turkestan, a member of the secret political organization [[Erk (historic party)|Turkestan National Union (TMB)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Зарождение и становление органов безопасности Кыргызстана. 1918 – 1953 годы.|last=РАЗАКОВ|first=ТАЛАНТ|publisher=Салам|year=2014|isbn=978-9967-27-284-2|location=Бишкек|pages=108—129|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzhanuzakov and the outstanding statesman of Turkestan [[Turar Ryskulov]] were friends since childhood. Together they graduated from the Merke boarding school in 1909. As the best graduate, Torokul was accepted as an interpreter by the administration to the Governor-General of Turkestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Кемелбек КОЖОМКУЛОВ,  историк. |editor=  |url= http://slovo.kg/?p=78084 |title= Манап – значит виноват! |edition= Слово Кыргызстана  |date= 18 November 2016 |year= 2016 |number= |language= Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to extracts from the diaries of [[Dmitry Furmanov]], Dzhanuzakov actively participated in the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|uprising of 16th year]] and was one of its leaders.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Фурманов Дмитрий Андреевич |editor=  |title= Собрание сочинений в четырех томах. Том 4. Дневники. Литературные записи. Письма. |edition= Государственное издательство художественной литературы  |date=  1961 |year= 1961 |number= |pages = 524 |language= Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Soviet times Dzhanuzakov was the initiator of the creation and chairman of the Commission for Refugees, participants of the uprising in 1916. He managed to free the local population, who suffered from the punitive operations of the [[tsarist regime]], from taxes, to allocate huge sums of money and other means of material assistance to the population of Turkestan. Using the powers that he has, Dzhanuzakov simultaneously organizes work to investigate the most violent manifestations of the great-power attitude of the [[kulak]] population of the [[Chuy Region|Chuy]] and [[Issyk-Kul Region|Issyk-Kul]] valleys towards the local Kyrgyz. Thus, as a result of the investigation of the brutal murder in 1916, 537 unarmed Kyrgyz people – old men, women and children in the vicinity of the village of [[Belovodskoye]], were sentenced to be executed by the organizers of this crime. Thanks to Dzhanuzakov's determination to implement the measures taken by the authorities to assist refugees returning from China, they immediately returned to their former owners the land occupied during and immediately after the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mp.kg/society/item/1593-torokul_zhanuzakov___vydayuschiisya_pobornik_svobody.html|title=Торокул Жанузаков – выдающийся поборник свободы|last=Кожомкулов|first=Кемелбек|date=28 July 2016|work=ОсОО "РКЦ Мегаполис"|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; But later, his concerns about improving the situation of his countrymen were interpreted as "distortions of land policy".&lt;ref&gt;Джунушалиев Дж., Семенов И. Е. Верный сын народа // В кн.: Абдрахманов Ю. 1916 Дневники Письма к Сталину. – Фрунзе, 1991.-С. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the military and political leadership of the Turkestan ASSR, there were contradictions on many issues. Especially for the first two years of the [[Basmachi movement]] there was no agreement. Political leadership allowed the criticism of the military for errors and surpluses in the fight against Basmachism in Turkestan. They consisted in a resolute resolution of the struggle against the Basmachi movement, numerous facts of arbitrariness and violence, [[Red Terror]] against ordinary people.

[[File:Bandera del Turquestan.svg|thumb|Flag of Turkestan|left|200x200px]]He attended the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] held in [[Baku]] in September 1920, where he had the floor and became involved in drawing up the statutes of [[Erk (historic party)|ERK]], a Muslim Socialist organisation.&lt;ref name="Andy Blunden, Brian Pearce"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blunden|first1=Andy|last2=Pearce|first2=Brian|title=Congress of the Peoples of the East.

At the [[Samarkand]] Turkestan National Union Congress sessions held 5–7 September, the by-laws of the society, consisting of twenty-four items, and the flag of Turkistan were approved. In the committee preparing the national flag of [[Turkestan]], Dzhanuzakov served along with Munevver Kari and [[Zeki Velidi Togan]] and a few other individuals.

In parallel with participation in the national liberation movement, Torokul Dzhanuzakov engaged in scientific research: he collected folklore, conducted archaeographical and ethnographic researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs: National Existence and Cultural Struggles of Turkistan and Other Muslim Eastern Turks|last=Prof. Velidi Togan|first=Zeki|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2012|isbn=1468005685|location=North Charleston, SC|pages=93-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzhanuzakov was shot by the [[Cheka]] authorities in 1921 when he was 28 years old. 

Report of the Cheka Plenipotentiary Representative in Turkestan Republic [[Yakov Peters]] to the Presidium of the Cheka of 17 November 1921: 

{{Cquote
| quote = ... We are serious about the matter. We had recruited one of the arrested ... gave him the opportunity to the escape, and he is now in Fergana, in the most basmachi setting. Mentioned in the report Dzhanuzakov, who plays in this case, perhaps, the most responsible role, all the time was in Ferghana with the Basmachi. I instructed the agents to catch Dzhanuzakov at any price and left a fairly large sum of money for this purpose. The first attempt was unsuccessful, Dzhanuzakov escaped, but we captured his briefcase with extremely important correspondence, only the trouble is that during the battle the portfolio drowned in the river. Another attempt was successful. Dzhanuzakov was captured, but on the way our detachment was attacked by the Basmachi. Fearing to lose Dzhanuzakov, he was killed by the detachment and we received only his corpse. On another day I received a telegram from Com. Eichmans, that he is managed to find his papers, very valuable, correspondence on the ulemist case, which will be delivered to me in the near future. Although we were aware of the existence of an ulemist organization in Turkestan even before the arrest of the mentioned persons going to the British and Japanese consuls, the question arose immediately: is this organization ulemistic or have we captured elements of several organizations?

'''Web life''' is a concept, that proposes that the [[World Wide Web]] (Web) has, or could, evolve into an entity worthy of consideration as a life form in its own right; a new posthuman species consisting of just one isolated member.

__TOC__
==Overview==
The web life&lt;ref name="tetlow"&gt;{{cite book | first=Philip D. | last=Tetlow |author2= |title=The Web's awake: an introduction to the field of Web science and the concept |year=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBskd46jR10C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Gopala+Hemachandra#v=onepage&amp;q=Gopala%20Hemachandra&amp;f=false |isbn=0-470-13794-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concept considers the Web not as a connected network of computers, as in common interpretations of the [[Internet]], but rather as a [[sociotechnical]] machine&lt;ref&gt;Nijholt, A. (2009) Socio-Technical Implementation: Socio-technical Systems in the Context of Ubiquitous Computing, Ambient Intelligence, Embodied Virtuality, and the Internet of Things. In: Handbook of Research on Socio-Technical Design and Social Networking Systems. IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of fusing together individuals and organisations into larger coordinated groups. It argues that unlike the technologies that have come before it, the Web is different in that its phenomenal growth and complexity are starting to outstrip our capability to control it directly, making it impossible for us to grasp its completeness in one go. A set of emergent characteristics and behaviours are now starting to appear, it suggests, that we have not programmed individually. These are apparently starting to increase in number and strength.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Many writers, like [[Arthur C. Clark]] and [[Gregory Stock]], have contemplated an "emergent property" such as life arising from the mass of humanity and computers. Some also refer to this using terminology like "[[metaman]]", "[[superorganism]]" or "[[global brain]]" but until recently few have chosen to take its potential seriously from a purely Web perspective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In fact, in 2005, when Sir [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first discussed the thinking behind web life he lightheartedly referred to it as a conspiracy in the spirit of Dan Brown's best selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

Building on the concepts outlined by [[Fritjof Capra]] in his theory of living systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Capra | first=Fritjof | authorlink=Fritjof Capra | year=1997 | title=The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems | publisher=[[Anchor (publisher)|Anchor]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; the argument for the likely emergence of web life draws upon ideas from diverse areas such as [[Web science]], [[swarm intelligence]], technology lock-in, [[scale-free network]]s, [[memes]], [[artificial life]], [[quantum Darwinism]], [[autocatalytic sets]] and the [[Semantic Web]].  The concept was first rigorously outlined in the book ''The Web's Awake''.&lt;ref name="tetlow"/&gt;

At its heart, web life advocates contemporary definitions of life which ask if it is relevant to differentiate between an individual organism and the entire biosphere. It is argued that a bacterium could easily mistake a person for a huge colony of one-celled organisms working in symbiosis, and therefore in the same way, a person could quite easily perceive the Web as a huge virtual colony of purposeful information-based technology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
