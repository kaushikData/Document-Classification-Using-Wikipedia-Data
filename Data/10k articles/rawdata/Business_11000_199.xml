'''Ahmed Ezz''' (born 1959) is an [[Egypt]]ian businessman and one-time politician, the owner of [[Ezz Steel]] and the former chairman of Egypt's national assembly's budget committee.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a former senior member of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party of Egypt]] (NDP) .

==Life and career==
Ahmed Ezz was born to Muslim parents. In 1959, Ezz graduated from [[Cairo University]] with a degree in Civil Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=25304598#ref492562659 Zoominfo]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been elected twice as the head of the [[Arab Iron and Steel Union]].  Prior to his work in organized labor, Ezz was a parliamentary member representing the districts of Sadat-Monouf-Sers al-Liyan in Monofuyia from the year 2000 to 2011, and also the Chairman of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the [[People's Assembly of Egypt]] as a member of the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. (According to [[Al Jazeera]], he resigned from the NDP on 29 January 2011.)

Prior to the revolution, opposition parties, other parliamentarians, and groups accused Ezz of monopolizing the steel industry in Egypt by holding more than 60 percent of the market share, describing it as an act that is backed up by the government, an act that was described by the active parliamentarian Aboul Ezz Al Hariri as "enhancing the proliferation of monopolies rather than fighting them". The groups mentioned are even blaming him of increasing the steel prices of as much as 70 percent. In response Ezz has told reporters that a competition law "would at least provide a legal framework preventing everyone from making accusations".

Ezz companies were investigated twice for monopoly by the Egyptian Competition Authority, both before and after the January 2011 Revolution. The companies were found "not guilty" of any monopolistic or anti-competition actions both times. Ahmed Ezz was also prosecuted for the same charge and found not guilty by the Egyptian Economic Court in July 2013.

Ezz was planning on running in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Egyptian parliamentary election]] as an independent in the [[Sadat City]] constituency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/mubarak-era-steel-tycoon-starts-electoral-campaign-monufiya|title=Mubarak-era steel tycoon starts electoral campaign in Monufiya|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he lost his appeal after he was disqualified from running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/124049/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-court-dismisses-steel-tycoon-Ahmed-Ezz-ap.aspx|title=Egyptian court dismisses steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz' appeal against elections ban|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=Ahram Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another appeal was adjourned until 22 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/03/15/court-adjourns-ahmed-ezzs-appeal-on-election-ban-to-22-april/|title=Court adjourns Ahmed Ezz’s appeal on election ban to 22 April|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Daily News Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
After the resignation of Hosni Mubarak due to the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], on 17 February 2011 Ahmed Ezz was arrested, along with former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]], former minister of housing [[Ahmed Maghrabi]] and former tourism minister [[Zuheir Garana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968 |title=BBC News - Egypt after Mubarak: Three ex-ministers arrested |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110218052005/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968| archivedate= 18 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  News of the arrests spread quickly in the local Egyptian press.  As a result, many fear that Ahmed Ezz will not receive a fair trial under a 1981 provision of Egyptian emergency law.  Amr Bargisi, a senior partner with the Egyptian Union of Liberal Youth, told the'' Washington Times''  "I am afraid the divorce of wealth from power will probably not only lead to the unfair treatment of many businessmen and former politicians, but might also take Egypt in a direction that will be devastating for the economy and the prospects of democracy. Every businessman at the moment is a suspect of the revolutionary regime and the public. If this trend continues, we will see major capital flight from Egypt."&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;  Joe Stork, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, told the ''Washington Times'' of Mr. Ezz:  "Certainly he, like anyone else, has his right to a fair trial. The judicial proceedings he is subjected to should meet fair-trial standards; he should know the accusations against him; he should be able to confront those who are accusing him."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets/print/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 11 March letter from prison that was published on the Bikyamas website, Mr. Ezz refuted the charges against him and warned that "In this unprecedented time for the country, it is important to remember what our youth are calling for: freedom, fairness and democracy. My hope is that this commitment to a bright future for Egypt is not undermined at its first hurdle through a desire to find scapegoats. I truly hope I can at least depend on a full representation of the facts, due legal process and a fair trial."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 5 October 2012, Ahmed Ezz was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to seven years in jail – plus a fine of 19.5bn Egyptian pounds (about $3bn; £2bn) Mr. Hammam was also fined 35 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19830922 |title=Egyptian steel magnate Ahmed Ezz convicted |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sentences were later appealed by Ahmed Ezz and they are currently being re-tried for this case.

'''''Aktieselskab''''' ([[Abbreviation|abbr.]]: '''⅍''', '''A/S''' or '''a/s''', [[Unicode]] U+214d '''⅍'''; literally meaning: "stock company") is the [[Denmark|Danish]] name for a [[stock]]-based [[corporation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://startvaekst.virk.dk/opstart/vaelg-virksomhedsform/aktieselskab|title=Aktieselskab|last=jpa|date=2015-06-03|work=Startvækst|access-date=2017-06-04|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''aktieselskab'' may be either publicly traded or private.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erst.lovportaler.dk/showdoc.aspx?docId=lov20090470-full|title=Erhvervsstyrelsens LovWeb - Login|website=Schultz Information|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
The [[shareholders]] of an ''aktieselskab'' are not liable for the debts of the company.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/selskaber|title=Selskaber|last=andgar@erst.dk|date=2014-11-17|work=erhvervsstyrelsen.dk|access-date=2017-06-04|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used to protect the assets of the company against creditors by forming a group of companies. If an ⅍ is owned by a [[holding company]] (typically another ⅍), the profit from the production company can be transferred to the holding company. Since there is no liability for the owners of an ⅍, creditors from the production company will not be able to claim the profit in case of [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Professional creditors, such as banks, protect themselves from this by demanding that the holding company guarantees the debts of the production company.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Formation of an ''aktieselskab''==
The formation of an ''aktieselskab'' requires a number of steps, including the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Notification concerning the formation to the Danish Business Authorities.
*Registration of the company.
*Resolution to form the company at the first general meeting.
*Subscription for shares and payment of the share capital. The share capital must be greater than 500,000 DKK.
*The signing of a memorandum of association which must contain a draft of the articles of association of the company.

An ''aktieselskab'' can only acquire rights or incur obligations as a company when it has been registered at the Danish Commerce and Companies Agency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Share capital==
The share capital registered at the Danish Commerce and Companies Agency must be at least 500,000 [[Danish krone|DKK]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The capital can come from contributions of cash or other assets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If half of the capital is lost the board of directors must convene a general meeting within six months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Board of directors==
An ''aktieselskab'' must have a [[board of directors]] consisting of at least three members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Members of the board can be elected for a period of up to four years depending on the articles of association.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The board members are usually elected at the general meeting.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The articles of association may confer upon public authorities or any third party the right to appoint one or more members of the board of directors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In companies with an average workforce of over 35 employees during the last three years, the employees are entitled to elect among themselves a number of members of the board of directors equal to half the members of the board of directors elected by the shareholders or appointed by third parties.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">'''Alfred Faust''' (15 December 1883 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1961) was a [[Germany|German]] advertising executive, journalist, editor, and left-wing politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Alsace]] (today part of [[France]]) in 1883, Faust was the son of a master plumber and winemaker. He had a business education, and an apprenticeship in printing, as well as attending a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] seminar in [[Belgium]]. In his youth he did military service, graduating as a [[Grenadier]] in [[Berlin]], going on to teach [[French language|French]] from 1905 on. From 1909 to 1914 Faust was a journalist, later working with advertisement for the company [[Café HAG]], working in [[Bremen]].

Between 1914 and 1918, Faust was called into the [[Imperial German Army]], and fought in the [[First World War]]. In 1917, before the war's end, he joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), a left-wing split from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). When the war ended in 1918, he became heavily involved in radical politics, joining the December Imperial Council Congress ({{lang-de|Reichsrätekongress}}) in Berlin. Returning to Bremen, he joined the government of the brief [[Bremen Soviet Republic]] (existing between January and February 1919). He was selected by the city's [[Workers' council|workers' and soldiers' council]] to serve as People's Commissar of press and propaganda, together with [[Curt Stoermer]]. He also served as editor of the ''[[Bremer Bürger-Zeitung]]'', which had been occupied by the workers.

After the defeat of the Bremen Soviet Republic at the hands of the Army and [[Freikorps Caspari]], he became chief editor of the ''Bremer Arbeiterzeitung''. In March 1919 he became a member of the Bremen National Assembly, serving as a deputy of the [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen]] from 1920 to 1933. In 1922 he joined the SDP,  after the USDP was merged with it once more. Faust became an editor of the ''Bremer Volkszeitung'', led by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], becoming its chief editor in 1928.

Elected to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] after the [[German federal election, November 1932|November 1932 federal election]], it wasn't until March 1933 that his seat was confirmed. The same month, after the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], he helped the fellow SDP politician [[Rudolf Breitscheid]] escape to [[Switzerland]], but returned to Bremen himself. A month later, on 28 April, he was put in "[[Protective custody#Nazi Germany|protective custody]]" by the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), and held in ''KZ Mißler'', an early [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in Bremen that later also held his fellow Bremen Soviet Republic politician [[Hermann Böse]]. Later placed in other detention centers, Faust was strongly physically abused by his captors, especially in ''KZ Mißler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akens.org/akens/texte/info/36/3.html|title=Vom Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst zum Konzentrationslager|last1=Wollenberg|first1=Jörg|last2= |first2= |date=|language=German|website=www.akens.org|publisher= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent time in prison until 1934, when he was released from jail and expelled from Bremen, settling in Berlin. He worked for [[Ludwig Roselius]], pro-Nazi founder of his previous employer Café HAG, at the ''Angelsachsenverlag''. [[Barbara Goette]] worked and corresponded extensively with Faust in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the publisher was closed in 1944, he fled to his native Alsace, working as an editor in [[Mulhouse]] until 1949. In August 1949 Faust returned to Bremen again, rejoining the ''Angelsachsenverlag''. From 11 July 1950 on until his death he was head of the press office of the [[Senate of Bremen]].

After his death in 1961, the a street was named for him in the Obervieland district of Bremen: ''Alfred-Faust-Straße''.

'''Kuan Yoke Loon''', commonly known as '''Andrew Kuan''' ({{zh|s=关玉麟|t=關玉麟|p=Guān Yù Lín}}) is the managing director of [[executive search]] firm [[Blue Arrow]].  From 2001 to 2004, Kuan was the group [[chief financial officer]] of the [[Jurong Town Corporation]], one of four designated statutory boards that confer eligibility to contest in the presidential elections.

Kuan applied to run as a candidate in the [[Singapore presidential election, 2005]].  However, his application for a Certificate of Eligibility was rejected as his seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were, in the opinion of the Presidential Elections Committee, not comparable to those required under the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]].

==Attempted candidacy for 2005 Singaporean presidential election==
Kuan joined the [[People's Action Party]] in 1999, and left in 2005 to qualify for the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2005/8/12/1131563.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112920/http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2005/8/12/1131563.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuan announced his intention to compete in  the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2005|2005 Singapore presidential election]] where the incumbent president [[S R Nathan]] is a candidate. However his application for a certificate of eligibility to compete was unsuccessful resulting to Kuan alleging conspiratorial theories involving the government. 

Kuan was disqualified by the Presidential Elections Committee for failing to meet the criteria for running for President in Singapore. The Committee said Mr Kuan's seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to those required under the Constitution. A presidential candidate is required to have experience as chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least S$100 million. 

Singaporean media have reported extensively on the circumstances surrounding Kuan's departure from his condominium's management council in 2001.  Kuan originally said he left amicably, but later admitted to being voted out with 13 council members voting against him, 2 abstaining and 1 voting for him.  Kuan attributed this to enmity aroused after he filed a police report against council member [[Chia Boon Teck]], who is also a member of [[People's Action Party|PAP]], accusing him of forging signatures.  The case was closed without [[prosecution]], but Chia filed a [[defamation]] suit against Kuan in 2005 after details of the case and his identity were leaked by ''[[The New Paper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/65761.asp | title=Battle begins early for Andrew Kuan | accessdate=2011-01-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203013036/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/65761.asp | archivedate=2006-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuan had apologised unreservedly to Chia for embarrassment and distress that his statements had caused. They had reached an out-of-court settlement for Kuan's defamatory comments he had made, the settlement includes compensation for damages as well as legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197557/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080507171837/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197557/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-07 |title=Andrew Kuan apologises to ex-neighbour over defamatory remarks |accessdate=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2005, [[Singapore]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] called for all candidates to be open about their records, so that Singaporeans can make an informed judgement on them. He also encouraged Andrew Kuan's former employers to come forward, speak freely and tell Singaporeans what they know about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050811013551/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-08-11 |title=PM Lee emphasises importance of electing the right person as President |accessdate=2011-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August 2005, Kuan's former employer government-linked [[JTC Corporation]] called a news conference to provide details on the circumstances leading to Kuan's resignation in July 2004. [[Chong Lit Cheong]], chief executive officer of JTC Corporation said that Andrew Kuan's work at JTC was unsatisfactory since his first year there and was asked to resign twice on 2003 and 2004.  No details of why his work was unsatisfactory were provided, other than to note that no fraud or other crime was involved and that Mr Kuan required "quite a fair bit of hand holding". In reply, Kuan noted that he had worked at JTC Corporation for 37 months, extending his contract several times, and he was given performance bonuses and a raise during this period.

==Singapore presidential election, 2011==
Kuan has announced his intention to contest in the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_689527.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kuan was deemed ineligible once more by the PEC for failing to meet the criteria for running for President in Singapore. The Committee said in a statement that Mr Kuan's seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to positions listed under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.sg/pressrelease/PreE2011/2011%20-08-11%20Certificates%20of%20Eligibility%20for%20Presidential%20Elections%202011.pdf#zoom=100 PE2011 Certificates of Eligibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avraham Shmuel Rakanti''' ({{Lang-he-n|אברהם שמואל רקנאטי}},  1888 – 3 March 1980) was a [[Greece|Greek]]-[[Israel]]i politician and journalist. In Greece he served as deputy mayor of [[Thessaloniki]] between 1925 and 1933, whilst in Israel he was a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Herut]] between 1949 and 1951.

==Biography==
Born in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], Rakanti studied in a [[heder]]. He became a member of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] association, and in 1925 he joined the [[Revisionist Zionism]] movement, becoming head of the Greek branch. In the same year he became deputy mayor of Thessaloniki, a position he held until 1933. He also founded and edited the [[French language]] newspaper, Pro-Yisrael. In 1934 he made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]]. A member of the Revisionist Zionist central committee, he was elected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]] in 1949 on the [[Herut]] list, but lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]]. He died on 3 March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenelson, K (1964) ''The Ashkenazi Revolution'', Anakh Publishing, p297&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce ===

[[File:Basilan Jaycees 1st induction.jpg|thumb|300px|Charter Induction of the Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce, December 11, 1949 at the old Basilan City Hall Courtyard; Middle and Bottom photos: Basilan Jaycees delegation at the 1950 Manila World Congress)]]

The Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce was organized on January 11, 1949 in a Joint Chapter Extension Project of the Manila and Zamboanga Jaycees. It included some of Basilan’s most active and civic-minded personalities in law, public service, medicine and business at the outset. Its Charter President (1949–1950), Dr. Isidro Sta. Elena, eventually became JCP Regional Vice President for Northern Mindanao in 1951-1952. National President Joaquin V. Gonzalez flew in from Manila to witness the induction of the Chapter’s 3rd President (1951), Judge Doroteo de Guzman. 4th President (1952), Dr. Alejandro C. Infante, founder of the [[Infante Hospital]] in Isabela City, was the longest-serving Adviser of the Chapter, whose service to the organization spanned over 50 years, until his demise in 2007. He was followed by a succession of able young Presidents who steered the Chapter in its early years. Prominent businessmen Amado Borja (1953), Thomas Ba Leong (1953), Carlos F. Tan (1955), and Judge Francisco S. Atilano (1955) were among the pioneers of this intrepid group of young leaders who invested the Chapter with a strong foundation based on an enduring vision of leadership and service to the community.

The 8th President (1957), Retired [[Philippine Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Associate Justice [[Regino C. Hermosisima, Jr.]], and current 3-term Regular Member of the [[Judicial and Bar Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index3.php?justicetype=Associate%20Justice&amp;justiceid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd64564a90690f5a |title=Associate Justice Regino C.

He presided over the controversial [[Aquino-Galman Double Murder Case]] in 1983. He has since retired from the Supreme Court, but has remained active in civic affairs as the Honorary National Chairman of the [[Young Men’s Christian Association]] (YMCA) of the Philippines. He was followed by the Chapter’s first elected two-termer, Emilio Lim (1958 &amp; 1959) and then by Atty. Laurencio Saavedra (1960 &amp; 1961) who also served two terms, Ricardo Madayag (1962), and then by Judge Cesar S. Principe (1963).

=== Junior Chamber of Basilan City, Inc. ===

The Chapter was officially registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) on August 26, 1965, as the Junior Chamber of Basilan City, Inc., during the term of its 13th President (1964 &amp; 1965), also a two-termer, and who likewise became the first JCI Senator of the Chapter, JCI Sen. Simplicio A. Bonifacio. He then went on to become a JCP Regional Vice President for Southern Mindanao (1968). A local politician, he served in the Basilan Provincial Board for three-terms before retiring in the early 1990s. He was followed by fellow lawyers Selso Manzanaris (1966) and Ricardo G. Mon (1967), who was on his third term as a City Councilor by the time he took over administration of the Chapter.

The organization became a force in local politics towards the late 1960s, when young politicians started to quickly fill up its ranks. Often split into two main opposing [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]] (LP) and [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalista]] (NP) wings, the organization mirrored the realities of local politics, serving as the most prestigious training ground for young politicians in the local arena. Chapter elections were hotly contested and these rivalries and factions were soon reflected in the floors of the [[History of Basilan|Basilan City]] Council throughout the rest of the decade, well into the early years of the 1970s. As the organization continued to attract the sons of local political families of Basilan, this same period saw oppositionist young Turks take control of the Chapter. Being young themselves, Presidents Reynaldo Martinez (1968), Armando L. Salvador (1969), and Quirico Tan (1970) worked closely with opposition stalwart and 6-term Basilan City Mayor Leroy S. Brown in denouncing the increasingly difficult situation that unfolded in Manila and Mindanao. By then, Pres. [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]' once popular administration seemed to unravel by the day, kicking off with the bloody [[Jabidah Massacre]], followed by the [[Moro Uprising]] of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF), and then finally by the increasingly violent student-led [[First Quarter Storm]] militant street actions in 1969.

Responding to the need for the Chapter to touch-base with Basilan’s core Muslim constituencies, even as the Nur Misuari-led secessionist movement continued to wreak havoc in the countryside, the members elected its first Muslim President (1971) in the person of a young Ulbert Ulama Tugung, a learned scholar and respected public servant who became a JCP Regional Vice President for Southern Mindanao (1977). He was ultimately appointed by Pres. Corazon C. Aquino to be the first Regional Governor of the Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook (LTP) or the Regional Administration for Western Mindanao and Sulu. Sadly, his exemplary leadership was cut short by an assassin’s bullet. His wife, Jayceerette PP Elnorita Pamaran Tugung, was appointed LTP Regional Governor at his death, and went on to win as Congresswoman of Basilan in 1992-1995. He was followed by NP party member JCI Sen. Aniceto G. Mon (1972) the twin brother of the Chapter's 15th President, Ricardo Mon.

Then on December 21, 1972, Pres. [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law]] and promptly placed Basilan City under a Military Government, presided over by Col. Tomas G. Nanquil, Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan, and then by Rear Admiral Romulo Espaldon, Commanding Officer of the Philippine Armed Forces' Southern Command. Basilan City was summarily abolished and replaced by the Province of Basilan as embodied in Presidential Decree No. 356 signed on December 27, 1973. Ten Municipalities were initially carved out of Basilan City through P.D. 593 promulgated on December 2, 1974.

Atty. Ricardo G. Mon, who was Chapter President in 1967, was appointed as the first Mayor of Isabela Municipality. At around this time, the Basilan Jayceerettes made its glamorous presence known. A series of socio-civic projects were conducted by the wives of the Jaycees as they promoted advocacies which ranged from a variety of environmental concerns to education and community health.

The 24th President (1973), JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano started the first of what eventually came to be three terms at the helm of the Chapter.

=== Silver Jubilee ===

[[File:Basilan Jaycees bowling tourney.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Basilan Jaycees Bowling Tournament, 1975]]

The Chapter celebrated its Silver Jubilee under the administration of its 25th President (1974) Dr. Edgardo Eustaquio, a public servant and health practitioner, one of the founders of the [[Basilan Community Hospital]] and a three-term City Councilor of Isabela City. He was followed by 26th President (1975), local business taipan JCI Sen. Yu Chi Han, whose lasting legacy of forging deeper ties between the Chapter and the local business community strengthened the Jaycees more so because the political situation deteriorated further as Basilan’s highlands was transformed into a combat zone where the military staged running gun-battles with the MNLF and isolated bandit groups, the “black shirts” or “munduhin” as they came to be romantically called. Also, as the countryside was rent asunder by a total breakdown in the peace and order, right-wing vigilante groups such as the Ilonggo-based “ilaga” and the Chavacano-Bisaya “mundo oscurro” rose up from nowhere and started to give the Muslim communities tit-for-tat.

=== Basilan Jaycees, Inc. ===

In the midst of the seeming chaos, the Chapter evolved once again, officially changing its name to the Basilan Jaycees, Inc., during the incumbency of the 27th (1976) and 28th (1977) President, JCI Sen. Fernando S. Cariaga, the first in a line of educators and faithful church workers, whose steady management of the Chapter’s affairs gave it a much-needed breather from all the politics which threatened to pull the chapter apart. A surprising economic upturn, engendered by the Marcos administration’s many infrastructure projects and programs, gave the Chapter and the Basileños a healthy respite from the incessant conflict that bugged the island.

What followed were some of the most active years of the Jaycees, led by JCI Sen. Kieck Seng Tan (1978) under whose able leadership the very first batch of Lady Jaycees were inducted, JCI Sen. Roque C. Tan (1979), and then again by JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano (1980), Engr. Tahir I. Latip (1981), currently Basilan's Provincial Engineer and the second Muslim to be elected President, Napoleon P. Yu (1982), and then for a third time, again by JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano (1983) wherein the Jaycees initiated the creation of political action committees and associations such as the Concerned Citizens’ Aggrupation (CCA) which gathered the local community in indignation rallies against the Marcos dictatorship immediately after the assassination of Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., as well as organized an Operation Quick Count for the 1986 Snap Elections, in close coordination with the National Movement for Free Elections ([[NAMFREL]]). For this, he was eventually appointed by President Corazon C. Aquino as the OIC Governor of Basilan Province upon her accession in 1986. Currently, he is the Deputy Governor for Christian Affairs of the [[Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM).

The 35th (1984) and 36th President (1985), also a two-termer, was Atty. Alvin G. Dans, a scion of yet another of the most established families in Basilan. He was eventually elected Mayor of the Municipality of Isabela for two terms, Governor of the Province of Basilan, and Congressman of the Lone District of the Basilan, appointed by Pres. [[Fidel V. Ramos]] as Undersecretary of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC), he eventually became the [[Postmaster]] General of the [[Philippine Post Office]]. His wife, Jayceerette Past President Athena Dans is a Commissioner of the [[Bureau of Customs]]. He was followed by the 37th President (1986), Perfecto C. Antonio, Jr., a three-termer in the [[Provincial Board]] of Basilan Province. The 38th President (1987), Nonito T. Ramirez, was the Secretary of the Isabela [[City Council]] for some time.

=== Junior Chamber of Basilan, Inc. ===

[[File:Basilan Jaycees bingo social.jpg|thumb|300px|Basilan Jaycees Bingo Bonanza 1997]]

The name of the Chapter was reverted to Junior Chamber of Basilan, Inc., under the auspices of the 39th (1988) and 40th President (1989) JCI Sen. Benedicto N. Peñaflor, following the JCI amendments during the World Congress in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China]]. He was followed by the 41st (1990) and 42nd President (1991), Michael M. Manapol, the Isabela City Tourism Officer from 1998 to 2007. A succession of able Presidents and leaders handled the Chapter in the 1990s, even as the ugly head of the [[Abu Sayyaf]] stole international headlines and totally re-wrote Basilan’s image here and abroad. The Chapter owes its existence in these most troubled times to the grit and temerity of Edgardo P. Ferrer (1992), well-connected businessman and entrepreneur, Rogelio J. Francisco (1993) an accomplished investment banker under whose term the Basilan Taguima Junior Jaycees was organized, Judge Danilo M. Bucoy (1994), the brave Regional Trial Court Judge who sentenced captured Abu Sayyaf terrorists to death, and the back-to-back two-termers Carlos F. Luy (1995 &amp; 1996) and Edgar R. Suson (1997 &amp; 1998).

=== Golden Anniversary ===

It is particularly remarkable to note, however, that it took the Chapter all of half a century since its inception, and 20 years since its first female member was inducted, to finally elect its very first Lady President. The chapter’s 50th President (1999) JCI Sen. Laura W. Alano, was likewise elected National Vice President for Western Mindanao (2000). She was awarded ‘Most Outstanding National Vice President for Area V in 2000’ and is the first Lady JCI Senator of the chapter. She was followed by JCI Mem. Ma. Theresa M. Alano (2000), who was appointed by Pres. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] as Assistant Secretary of the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]] (DSWD) charged with Christian-Muslim Affairs and Mindanao in general, and then by JCI Mem. Tita Orbecido-Tan (2001), also a teacher, who spearheaded the creation of Junior Jaycee Chapters in Basilan. The 53rd President (2002), JCI Mem. Reymond E. Bicariato, was the Administrator of the [[Philippine National Red Cross]] – Basilan Chapter during his incumbency and organized relief efforts and extended aid, also with the assistance of the Jaycees, to the hostages of the Abu Sayyaf kidnapping spree of 2001-2002, forging lasting ties with the troops in the [[US-RP Balikatan 02-1]] Joint Military Exercises. Our 54th President (2003), JCI Mem. Svetlana E. C. Sanchez, daughter of JCI Sen. Fernando Cariaga, signaled the generational shift in the chapter’s long history as the Baby Boomers eventually handed over control of the Chapter to succeeding generations of JCI Members.

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the Republic of the Philippines as Inducting Officer]]

Yet another page in the Chapter’s history was finally turned as, following the JCI Corporate Identity Program approved at the 2003 World Congress in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], the Chapter’s name was officially changed to Junior Chamber International – Basilan Inc., during the incumbency of the 55th President (2004), JCI Mem. [[Jaime J. A. Rivera]]. He was elected National Vice President for Western Mindanao for 2006. He is the Chapter’s first JCIP Academy and PRIME Graduate (Davao 2004), as well as Certified Local Trainer duly accredited by JCI University, his term has been characterized by a closer coordination with local government units, greater synergy with the business sector, and renewed ties with other Jaycee Chapters. He likewise won the "Most Outstanding National Vice President Award of Recognition" at the 2006 JCI Philippines National Convention held in Subic, Zambales on October 2006, and was appointed National Chairman of the Voice of Philippine Democracy project, as well as National Adviser of the Philippine Junior Jaycees, Inc. in 2007. The 56th President (2005) JCI Mem. Nuayme “Indah” M. Sangkula, hails from the prodigious Sangkula Clan of Sulu, and is also a teacher, the third Muslim President of the chapter. The flagship "Miss Isabela Earth Pageant" was held during this term, with the winner - Miss Bernadette Estrada (Tantoco) - carrying the Miss Western Mindanao - Earth title and reaching the semi-finals in the Miss Philippines-Earth 2005 in Manila. JCI Basilan Inc. likewise hosted the 1st Area Council Meeting of JCI Philippines Area 5 (Mindanao) at Lantaka Hotel, Zamboanga City.

The Chapter’s 57th President (2006) JCI Mem. Rowell C. Acaylar, is a Registered Nurse and a former Police Officer. He is currently a Clinical Instructor at the Mindanao Autonomous College Foundation Inc. (MACFI) in Lamitan City. His term is highlighted by twin victories at the National Convention Temyong Awards held in Subic, Zambales, where the Chapter’s only two bids for “Most Outstanding JCI Week Celebration” and “Most Outstanding JCI Family” both won coveted “Recognitions”, a substantial feat considering the competition for said categories. It was also on this year that JCI Basilan Inc. voluntarily split into two, with the male members retaining the Chapter’s name and seal, while lady JCI Members were assisted in forming the all-female [[JCI Basileña]], officially recognized on April 8, 2006 during the 2nd National Board Meeting of JCI Philippines Inc., held in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.

SIDEBAR: JCI Basileña was led by its Charter President, JCI Mem. Carlissele Rodriguez-Navales, followed by JCI Mem. Bernadita F. Hontucan in 2007, and Rev. May Casiano-Casada, a female Priest of the Episcopal Church in 2008 before falling into a hiatus. The all-female chapter has since been revived for 2014 by JCI Mem. Ma. Jennesa Santos-Tubongbanua, Isabela City Councilor.

Yet another example of inter-generational dynamics happening in the Chapter is the election of Atty. Orheim T. Ferrer, son of 1992 PP Edgardo Ferrer, as the Chapter’s 58th President (2007). He is followed by the 59th President JCI Mem. James Abner S. Rodriguez, Isabela City Councilor, school administrator and community organizer, with strong ties to the local military establishment.

A '''Big Hairy Audacious Goal''' ('''BHAG''' - pronounced BEE-hag) is a [[strategic planning|strategic]] [[business statement]] similar to a [[vision statement]] which is created{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to focus an [[organization]] on a single medium- to long-term organization-wide goal which is audacious, likely to be externally questionable, but not internally regarded as impossible.

[[James C. Collins|James Collins]] and [[Jerry Porras]] coined the term "Big Hairy Audacious Goal" in their 1994 book ''[[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Collins |first1= Jim |author1-link= James C. Collins |last2= Porras |first2= Jerry I. |author2-link= Jerry Porras |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Built To Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies |year= 1994 |publisher= HarperBusiness |isbn= 0-060-56610-8 |page= 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A BHAG encourages organisations to define [[visionary (disambiguation) | visionary]] goals that are more strategic and emotionally compelling.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many{{quantify|date=October 2018}} organisations set goals that describe what they hope to accomplish over the coming days, months or years. These goals help align employees to work together more effectively.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Often these goals are very tactical, such as "achieve 10% revenue growth in the next 3 months". In contrast, Collins and Porras define a BHAG as "an audacious 10-to-30-year goal to progress towards an envisioned future".&lt;ref&gt;

The authors claim that a [[company]] may have more than one BHAG; there may be one over-reaching BHAG and other shorter-term BHAGs.

{{quote|text= "A true BHAG is clear and compelling, serves as unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a clear catalyst for [[team spirit]]. It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for finish lines."|sign= Collins and Porras|source= [[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]}}

Mahoney and McCue sound a cautionary note when assessing BHAGs, seeing them as "[w]orthwhile when relevant to the business; inspiring to employees but disappointing when dropped in a few years in favor of other goals".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">'''Cleanliness suitability''' describes the suitability of operating materials and ventilation and air conditioning components for use in cleanrooms where the air cleanliness and other parameters are controlled by way of technical regulations. Tests are carried out to determine this.&lt;ref&gt;VDI 2083, Part 9.1: Cleanroom technology – Compatibility with required cleanliness and surface cleanliness&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VDI 2083, Part 17: Cleanroom technology – Cleanroom and cleanliness suitability of materials&lt;/ref&gt;

Trends such as the miniaturization of structures as well as increased levels of reliability in technology, research and science require controlled “clean” manufacturing environments. The task of such environments is to minimize influences which could damage the products concerned. The cleanroom environments created by filtering the air were originally developed for the fields of microelectronics and microsystem technology but are now used in a wide range of other high technology sectors such as photovoltaics and the automotive industry.

Depending upon the industry and process concerned, different factors may have a damaging influence on a product, e.g.:
# Particles, in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry and especially biotic particles in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology ([[cleanroom suitability]]) 
# Molecular contamination (outgassing), especially in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry
# Electrostatic discharge phenomena (ESD), especially in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry
# Resistance to cleaning and disinfection agents, especially  in life science industries such as pharmaceutics
# Surface interaction, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology 
# Cleanability, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology 
# Microbicidity, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology

The following factors may be responsible for contamination:
# The cleanroom itself: Staff, although this is becoming less relevant as more and more staff are banned from working in critical areas, 
# The use of manufacturing equipment, which is increasing as more and more automated solutions are being implemented. 
# Often in direct contact with the product, manufacturing equipment and the materials used in their construction form a further important contamination factor in a clean production environment.

== History ==
In British Columbia, a 1980 pilot project established through the Nanaimo Community Employment Advisory Society on Vancouver Island provided the framework for what would later become Community Futures. It was the first federally funded employment project aimed at encouraging members of the local business community to participate in stimulating private sector employment.  In 1983, the government created Local Employment Assistance and Development corporations in economically depressed regions across Canada.  These LEAD corporations were later rolled into the Community Futures Program, which was announced in 1986 as part of the federal government's Canadian Jobs Strategy.  The initial objective was to address areas "of chronic and acute unemployment which, given the economic development trends, gave the program a rural orientation"&lt;ref&gt;The Rural Paradigm: Policies and Governance, ISBC 92-64-02390-9 - OECD 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Futures program model originally consisted of two organizations, each with their own Board of Directors and a distinct mandate.  One was the Business Development Centre, which provided the business support and loan functions performed by the original LEAD corporations, the second was the Community Futures Committee which was intended to assess the community's economic potential and areas of opportunity for job creation and business development.  These two organizations were expected to work closely with each other.

==Governance==
Community Futures offices operate under the guidance of a Board of Directors that is made up of members of the community.  These boards "build trust" with the local community, as they are composed or a range of private and public stakeholders from the local community.&lt;ref&gt;The Rural Paradigm: Policies and Governance, ISBC 92-64-02390-9 - OECD 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, a '''corporate raid''' is the process of buying a large stake in a corporation and then using shareholder voting rights to require the company to undertake novel measures designed to increase the share value, generally in opposition to the desires and practices of the corporation's current management. The measures might include replacing top executives, [[Layoff|downsizing]] operations, or [[liquidation|liquidating]] the company.

Corporate raids were particularly common in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s in the United States. By the end of the 1980s, management of many large [[publicly traded]] corporations had adopted legal countermeasures designed to thwart potential [[hostile takeover]]s and corporate raids, including [[poison pill]]s, [[golden parachute]]s, and increases in [[debt]] levels on the company's [[balance sheet]].

In later years, some corporate raiding practices have been used by "[[activist shareholder]]s", who purchase equity stakes in a corporation to influence its board of directors and put public pressure on its management.

==History==
{{History of private equity and venture capital}}
{{main|History of private equity and venture capital}}
Corporate raids became the hallmark of a handful of investors in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly highlighted by the public suicide of [[Eli Black]]. Among the most notable corporate raiders of the 1980s were [[Carl Icahn]], [[Victor Posner]], Meshulam Riklis, [[Nelson Peltz]], [[Robert Bass|Robert M. Bass]], [[T. Boone Pickens]], [[Harold Clark Simmons]], [[Kirk Kerkorian]], [[Sir James Goldsmith]], [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]] and [[Asher Edelman]]. These investors used a number of the same tactics and targeted the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms. In fact it is Posner, one of the first "corporate raiders" who is often credited with coining the term "[[leveraged buyout]]" or "LBO".&lt;ref&gt;Trehan, R. (2006). ''[http://www.4hoteliers.com/4hots_fshw.php?mwi=1757 The History Of Leveraged Buyouts]''. December 4, 2006. Accessed May 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Posner]], who had made a fortune in real estate investments in the 1930s and 1940s, acquired a major stake in [[Triarc|DWG Corporation]] in 1966. Having gained control of the company, he used it as an investment vehicle that could execute [[takeover]]s of other companies. Posner and DWG are perhaps best known for the hostile takeover of [[Sharon Steel Corporation]] in 1969, one of the earliest such takeovers in the United States. Posner's investments were typically motivated by attractive valuations, balance sheets and cash flow characteristics. Because of its high debt load, Posner's DWG would generate attractive but highly volatile returns and would ultimately land in financial difficulty. In 1987, Sharon Steel entered [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon Steel files under Chapter 11|author=Associated Press|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|date=April 18, 1987|accessdate=May 4, 2014|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19870418&amp;id=u7cwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5861,942763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Icahn]] developed a reputation as a ruthless "corporate raider" after his [[hostile takeover]] of [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=IcahnTWA&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590446,00.html 10 Questions for Carl Icahn] by Barbara Kiviat, [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], February 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically selling TWA's assets to repay the debt he used to purchase the company, which was described as [[asset stripping]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2005/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/ TWA – Death Of A Legend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121150300/http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2005/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/ |date=November 21, 2008 }} by Elaine X.

Icahn also attempted the grand prize of [[U.S. Steel]], launching a hostile takeover for 89% of the industrial giant for $7 billion (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7|1986|r=1}}}} billion today) in late 1986 and only being rebuffed finally by CEO David Roderick on January 8, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_433681/icahn-drops-bid-to-acquire-usx.html Icahn drops bid to acquire USX]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. Boone Pickens]]' hostile takeover bid of [[Gulf Oil]] in 1984 led to shockwaves that such a large company could be raided. Gulf eventually sold out to [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] for a then record $13.3 billion (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|13.3|1984|r=1}}}} billion today) "white knight" buyout.

British raider [[Beazer]] also launched several successful hostile takeovers in the 1980s, the largest being that of [[Koppers]] in early 1988 for $1.81 billion (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.81|1987|r=1}}}} billion today).

Many of the corporate raiders of the 1980s were onetime clients of [[Michael Milken]], whose investment banking firm, [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] helped raise blind pools of capital which corporate raiders could use to make legitimate attempts to take over companies and provide [[high-yield debt]] financing of the buyouts.

===Ronald Perelman and Revlon===
Drexel Burnham raised a $100 million blind pool in 1984 for [[Nelson Peltz]] and his holding company Triangle Industries (later [[Triarc]]) to give credibility for takeovers, representing the first major blind pool raised for this purpose. Two years later, in 1986, Wickes Companies, a [[holding company]] run by Sanford Sigoloff, would raise a $1.2 billion blind pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bruck |first=Connie |title=[[The Predators' Ball]]: The junk-bond raiders and the man who staked them |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1988 |pages=117–118 |isbn=0-671-61780-X }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Milken and Drexel would shy away from certain of the more "notorious" corporate raiders as the firm and the private equity industry attempted to move upscale.

In 1985, Milken raised $750 million for a similar blind pool for [[Ronald Perelman]], which would ultimately prove instrumental in acquiring his biggest target: The [[Revlon|Revlon Corporation]]. In 1980, [[Ronald Perelman]], the son of a wealthy Philadelphia businessman, and future "corporate raider", having made several small but successful buyouts, acquired [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings|MacAndrews &amp; Forbes]], a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which Perelman's father had tried and failed to acquire 10 years earlier.&lt;ref name="RichardHackPage13"&gt;{{citation |title=When Money Is King |last=Hack |first=Richard |year=1996 |page=13 |publisher=Dove Books |location=Beverly Hills, CA |isbn=0-7871-1033-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman would ultimately divest the company's core business and use [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings|MacAndrews &amp; Forbes]] as a holding company investment vehicle for subsequent leveraged buyouts including [[Technicolor|Technicolor, Inc.]], [[Pantry Pride]] and [[Revlon]]. Using the [[Pantry Pride]] subsidiary of his holding company, [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings]], Perelman's overtures were rebuffed. Repeatedly rejected by the company's board and management, Perelman continued to press forward with a [[hostile takeover]], raising his offer from an initial bid of $47.50 per share until it reached $53.00 per share. After [[Revlon]] received a higher offer from a [[white knight (business)|white knight]], private equity firm [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company]], Perelman's [[Pantry Pride]] finally was able to make a successful bid for [[Revlon]], valuing the company at $2.7 billion.&lt;ref name="2.7Billion"&gt;{{citation |first=Richard |last=Stevenson |title=Pantry Pride Control of Revlon Board Seen Near |newspaper=The New York Times |page=D5 |date=November 5, 1985 |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/05/business/pantry-pride-control-of-revlon-board-seen-near.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buyout would prove troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load.&lt;ref name="PossibleBuyout"&gt;{{citation |first=Ann |last=Hagedom |title=Possible Revlon Buyout May Be Sign of a Bigger Perelman Move in Works |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |page=1 |date=March 9, 1987 |accessdate=May 16, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevlonProfits"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_March_8/ai_n11853855/ |title=Revlon Reports First Profitable Quarter in Six Years |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |journal=Business Wire |date=March 8, 2005 |author=Gale Group }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDebt"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/earnings/2005-03-08-revlon-usat_x.htm |title=Revlon profit first in more than 6 years |accessdate=March 20, 2007 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=March 8, 2005 |first=Cotten |last=Timberlake |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Shobhana |last2=Chandra }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Perelman's control, Revlon sold 4 divisions: two were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million, and its National Health Laboratories division was spun out to the public market in 1988.  Revlon also made acquisitions including [[Max Factor]] in 1987 and [[Betrix]] in 1989, later selling them to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/MacAndrews-amp;-Forbes-Holdings-Inc-Company-History.html |title=MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc. |accessdate=May 16, 2008 |work=Funding Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman exited the bulk of his holdings in Revlon through an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] in 1996 and subsequent sales of stock. As of December 31, 2007, Perelman still retains a minority ownership interest in Revlon. The Revlon takeover, because of its well-known brand, was profiled widely by the media and brought new attention to the emerging boom in leveraged buyout activity.  Litigation associated with the takeover has also become standard reading for introductory business organization classes in most law schools, introducing what have come to be known as "Revlon Duties" for boards of companies that are up for auction.

===Decline of the corporate raiders===
In the late 1980s several famous corporate raiders suffered from bad investments financed by large amounts of [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], ultimately losing money for their investors. Additionally, with the fall of [[Michael Milken]] and the subsequent collapse of [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], the credit lines for these investors dried up. By the end of the decade, management of many large [[publicly traded]] corporations reacted negatively to the threat of potential hostile takeover or corporate raid and pursued drastic defensive measures including [[poison pill]]s, [[golden parachute]]s and increasing [[debt]] levels on the company's [[balance sheet]]. Finally, in the 1990s the overall price of the American stock market increased, which reduced the number of situations in which a company's share price was low with respect to the assets that it controlled.

By the end of the 1990s, the corporate raider moniker was used less frequently as private equity firms pursued different tactics than their predecessors. Additionally, with revisionist history{{Citation needed|reason=Unless a reliable third party interprets the 60 Minutes portrayal of Icahn as being revisionist history, this is an unverified claim.|date=May 2018}}, in later years many of the corporate raiders would be re-characterized as "[[activist shareholder]]s", such as [[Carl Icahn]] during his 2008 profile on CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/60minutes/main3915473.shtml The Icahn Lift: 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl Profiles The Billionaire Investor], ''[[60 Minutes]]'', March 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reflections of corporate raiders==
&lt;!-- removed non-free image with no rationale given for use in this article [[File:Wall Street film.jpg|thumb|140px|right|''Wall Street'' depicted a stereotyped portrait of a 1980s "corporate raider"]] --&gt;
Although private equity rarely received a thorough treatment in popular culture, several films did feature stereotypical "corporate raiders" prominently. Among the most notable examples of private equity featured in motion pictures included:
* '''Gordon Gekko''', ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'' (2010) – The notorious "corporate raider" and [[greenmailer]], [[Gordon Gekko]] (played by [[Michael Douglas]]), represents a synthesis of the worst features of various famous private equity figures. In the film, the character intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker to take over a failing, but decent, airline. Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate [[pension fund]]. Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good") that would be attached to the private equity industry. '''Sir Lawrence Wildman''', based on [[Sir James Goldsmith]] also appears in Wall Street.
* '''"Larry the Liquidator"''', ''[[Other People's Money]]'' (1990) – A self-absorbed corporate raider "Larry the Liquidator" ([[Danny DeVito]]), sets his sights on New England Wire and Cable, a small-town business run by family patriarch ([[Gregory Peck]]) who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town. Larry ultimately wins over the shareholders when he admits he did not cause the company to fail; rather it was making outmoded equipment, using the analogy of 19th Century buggy whip makers who failed to realize they were being superseded by the automobile.
* '''Edward Lewis''', ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990) – Corporate raider Edward Lewis ([[Richard Gere]]) attempts to make a hostile takeover of Morse Industries. Edward explains what he does for a living to Vivian ([[Julia Roberts]]): he buys large companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, breaks them up and sells them in smaller parts, at a price that's more than the whole company, for profit.
* '''Devin Weston''', ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013) – Weston is initially presented as a self-made billionaire who made his fortune as a [[venture capitalist]]. In reality, he is a corporate raider who finds loopholes in legal contracts that he uses to [[asset stripping|strip companies of their assets]] simply because he can, and because he enjoys knowing that his victims can do nothing to stop him. Over the course of the game, he attempts to force the Richards Majestic film studio into bankruptcy by sabotaging production of a major film, leaving the owners with no choice but to sell their stake in the company to him. Once he has a majority shareholding (and after collecting the insurance on the film), he plans to tear the studios down and build luxury apartments in their place. The player is able to prevent this from happening by retrieving the film stolen by Weston, but this causes Weston to harbour a grudge against the player character, and he becomes the primary antagonist of the game.

'''Dashboards''' often provide at-a-glance views of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In the other, "dashboard" has another name for "progress report" or "report."

The "dashboard" is often displayed on a web page which is linked to a database that allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targetdashboard.com/site/Dashboard-Best-Practice/Management-Report-and-Dashboard-best-practice-index.aspx|title=Management Reports &amp; Dashboard Best Practice|last=Briggs|first=Jonathan|publisher=Target Dashboard|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dashboard originates from the [[automobile]] [[dashboard]] where drivers   monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster.

==Benefits==
Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of performance.

Benefits of using digital dashboards include:&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;
*Visual presentation of performance measures
*Ability to identify and correct negative trends
*Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies
*Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends
*Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected [[business intelligence]]
*Align strategies and organizational goals
*Saves time compared to running multiple reports
*Gain total visibility of all systems instantly
*Quick identification of data outliers and correlations

==Classification==
Dashboards can be broken down according to role and are either [[strategic]], analytical, operational, or informational.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.

==Types of dashboards==

Digital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then [[data drilling|drill down]] into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.

Three main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: stand alone software applications, web-browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as [[desktop widgets]]. The last are driven by a [[Software widget|widget engine]].

Specialized dashboards may track all corporate functions. Examples include [[human resources]], [[Recruitment|recruiting]], [[sales]], [[Business operations|operations]], [[security]], [[information technology]], [[project management]], [[customer relationship management]] and many more departmental dashboards. For a smaller organization like a startup a compact startup scorecard dashboard tracks important activities across lot of domains ranging from social media to sales.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Digital dashboard projects involve business units as the driver and the information technology department as the enabler. The success of digital dashboard projects often depends on the [[measurement|metrics]] that were chosen for monitoring. [[Key performance indicator]]s, [[balanced scorecard]]s, and sales performance figures are some of the content appropriate on business dashboards.

==Dashboards and scoreboards==
Balanced Scoreboards and Dashboards have been linked together as if they were interchangeable. However, although both visually display critical information, the difference is in the format: Scoreboards can open the quality of an operation while dashboards provide calculated direction. 
A balanced scoreboard has what they called a "prescriptive" format. It should always contain these components (Active Strategy)...
*Perspectives – group
*Objectives – verb-noun phrases pulled from a strategy plan
*Measures – also called Metric or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Spotlight Indicators – red, yellow, or green symbols that provide an at-a-glance view of a measure’s performance.
Each of these sections ensures that a Balanced Scorecard is essentially connected to the businesses critical strategic needs.

The design of a dashboard is more loosely defined.  Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted.  Even when there is a strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards.  However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;ZSL Inc., ''Dashboards Vs Scorecards – An Insight'' ZSL Inc. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Digital dashboard technology is available "out-of-the-box" from many software providers. Some companies however continue to do in-house development and maintenance of dashboard applications. For example, [[GE Aviation]] has developed a proprietary software/portal called "Digital Cockpit" to monitor the trends in aircraft spare parts business.

Good dashboard design practices take into account and address the following:

* the medium it is designed for (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet)
* use of visuals over tabluar presentation of data
** bar charts: to visualize one or more series of data
** line charts: to track changes in a number of dependent data sets over a period of time
** sparklines: to show the trend in a single data set
* use of legends anytime more than one color or shape is present on a graph
* spatial arrangement: place your most important view on the top left (if the language is written left to right) then arrange the following views in a Z pattern with the most important information following the top-to-bottom, left-to-right pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firican|first=George|date=May 22, 2017|title=Best Practices for Powerful Dashboards|url=https://tdwi.org/research/2017/05/business-intelligence-journal-vol-22-no-2.aspx|journal=Business Intelligence Journal|volume=22|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* color palettes to be colorblind friendly 

A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey Barr, ''7 Small Business Dashboard Design Dos and Don'ts'' (Barr, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the quality of dashboards==
There are a few key elements to a good dashboard:.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Hetherington, ''Dashboard Demystified: What is a Dashboard?'' (Hetherington, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simple, communicates easily
# Minimum distractions...it could cause confusion
# Supports organized business with meaning and useful data
# Applies human visual perception to visual presentation of information
# It can be accessed easily by its intended audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/white-paper-on-best-practices-for-powerful-dashboards/|title=White Paper: Best practices for powerful dashboards|last=|first=|date=May 29, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of digital dashboards followed the study of [[decision support system]]s in the 1970s. Early predecessors of the modern business dashboard were first developed in the 1980s in the form of [[Executive Information Systems]] (EISs). Due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling, it was soon realized that the approach wasn’t practical as information was often incomplete, unreliable, and spread across too many disparate sources.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, EISs hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing, and [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) allowed dashboards to function adequately.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Despite the availability of enabling technologies, the dashboard use didn't become popular until later in that decade, with the rise of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs), and the introduction of Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's [[Balanced Scorecard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne W. Eckerson]], ''Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business'' (Wiley , 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, [[Microsoft]] promoted a concept known as the [[Digital Nervous System]] and "digital dashboards" were described as being one leg of that concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/Breaking-News/Microsoft-refines-Digital-Dashboard-concept--12189.aspx | title=Microsoft refines Digital Dashboard concept | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the use of dashboards forms an important part of Business Performance Management (BPM).

The '''Doctor of Business Administration''' (commonly abbreviated as DBA, DrBA, or BusD and most recently {{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/phdba/|title=PH.DBA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=2018-07-22|dead-url=|access-date=|df=}}) is a [[research doctorate]] awarded on the basis of advanced study and [[research]] in the field of [[business administration]]. The D.B.A. is a [[terminal degree]] in business administration.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127015732/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Ph.D., it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D. in business administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university [[professor]] or [[Postdoctoral researcher | postdoctoral researcher]] in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], which is often represented via the [[English honorific]] "Dr." or the [[post-nominal letters]] "DBA",or "Ph.D.".

D.B.A. candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]], consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinham |first1=S. |last2=Scott |first2=C. |doi=10.1080/03098770020030498 |title=The Experience of Disseminating the Results of Doctoral Research |journal=Journal of Further and Higher Education |volume=25 |pages=45–55 |year=2001 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must [[Thesis defense|defend]] this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024642/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and format==
Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. D.B.A. candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behaviour, economics, finance and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the [[Bologna Process]], the normal duration of doctorate programs like the D.B.A.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where D.B.A. are mentionned into Bologna Process|date=March 2018}} and Ph.D is 4 years of full-time study.

The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, D.B.A programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian Universities. For instance, a D.B.A student cannot embark on the research phase before passing all his or her coursework. Furthermore, upon passing the proposal stage, he or she must clear ethics-related issues with an Ethics Committee. The D.B.A candidate must go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Successful candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee.

==Relationship between D.B.A. and Ph.D==
The Doctor of Business Administration and the Ph.D in Business Administration are equivalent degrees.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the United States. As such, both D.B.A. and Ph.D programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The D.B.A. and Ph.D in Business Administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue Ph.Ds; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases,the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.B.A. emphasizes applied research.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athab"&gt;http://www.mba.athabascau.ca/titanweb/au/webcms.nsf/AllDoc/B432DD075D38015987257076007C6B25?Opendocument Athabasca University: DBA vs PhD&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, graduates of Ph.D programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of D.B.A. programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of D.B.A. and Ph.D programs often become [[Adjunct professors in the United States| adjunct professors]] in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

==Geographic distribution==
D.B.A. programs are offered worldwide. The majority, however, are offered in Europe (42 percent), followed by North America (28 percent) and the Asia-Pacific region (22 percent). 6 percent of the programs are offered in Africa and 2 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

'''Food distribution''' is a  process in which a general population is supplied with food. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) considers food distribution as a subset of the [[Food systems|food system]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W0078e/w0078e04.htm|title=Chapter 3 - The food system and factors affecting household food security and nutrition|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.fao.org|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process and [[methodology]] behind food distribution varies by location. Food distribution has been a defining characteristic of [[human behavior]] in all societies, and recordings of food distribution date back for thousands of years.

One clear and defined documentation of historical food distribution comes from the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Many Roman rulers and emperors sought to determine the best method of distributing food throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and as the demands of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Roman people]] changed in time, so too did their leaders’ plans. In the few centuries after the death of [[Jesus|Christ]], the ''annona'' became a prominent aspect in Roman food distribution. As the Empire expanded and the accessibility to certain foods changed, the demand for grain and wine drastically increased, and became a defining aspect of Roman [[food culture]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food for Rome|last=Sirks|first=Boudewijn|publisher=J.C. Gieben|year=1991|isbn=90-5063-069-3|location=Amsterdam|pages=1–13, 303, 361, 388–391|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies prominent after the fall of the Romans continued to deal with the ever-present dilemma of food distribution. The distribution systems of the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]] have developed in unique ways, and faced different problems in the past century. The United States' food distribution system is vast in size and strength, and is dominated by corporations and industry. Current methods of food distribution in the US rely on the country's advanced network of [[infrastructure]] and [[Transportation of goods|transportation]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|last=Statler|first=Matthew|last2=Penuel|first2=Bradley|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4129-7101-0|location=United States of America|pages=225–228|quote=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cases in Food Distribution|last=McNair|first=Malcolm|last2=Applebaum|first2=William|last3=Salmon|first3=Walter|publisher=Richard D.

There are a multitude of risk factors that can affect food distribution. War, [[Economy|economic failure]], [[Politics|political problems]], and weather conditions all play a role in determining the efficiency of any food system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two recent examples of war and [[Economy|economic failure]] impacting food distribution includes the decline of food distribution in [[Empire of Japan|Japan during World War II]] and food [[recession]] in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both cases, food distribution was hindered and the [[population]] in these areas consequently suffered.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Recession and the Food Crisis in Africa|last=Lawrence|first=Peter|publisher=James Currey|year=1986|isbn=0-85255-309-9|location=London|pages=6–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Food Management in World War II|last=Johnston|first=B.

Special organizations exist today to prevent any total collapses in food distribution, assist in developing food distribution and food systems in underdeveloped areas, and respond to food distribution crises. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) plays a key role in facilitating the growth of food distribution systems all over the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/about/what-we-do/so1/en/|title=What we do|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.fao.org|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of federal, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], and volunteer organizations function in the United States to safeguard the well-being of the US food distribution system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[American Red Cross]] is one key example of a volunteer organization is the US that has an international presence.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief|title=Disaster Relief|last=|first=|date=2016|website=American Red Cross|publisher=The American National Red Cross|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rome ==
The traditional Roman diet consisted of grain, fruits, olive oil, meat and wine. Of all these, grain was extremely important to the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Roman people]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During Rome's height, it is estimated that the city itself needed 150,000 tons of grain and millions of liters of water and wine every year to survive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brlsi.org/events-proceedings/proceedings/25021|title=Feeding Ancient Rome|last=Morley|first=Neville|date=2005|publisher=Bath Royal Literacy and Scientific Institution|access-date=2016-10-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was traditionally the responsibility of the Roman government to guarantee that there was enough food for distribution among the people. In times of shortages, bad harvests, or interference by pirates, the government made sure to fulfill its obligation to food distribution. Officials would sometimes buy food themselves and then sell it back to the people at little to no cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Rome eventually established its Empire, foreign lands would send taxes in grain to Rome, which helped decrease the chance of a food distribution crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The ''Annona'' ===
The first indication of a collective, organized food distribution system within the [[Roman Republic]] comes from the ''annona''. Originally meaning "yearly return", the ''annona'' became the administrative term for governmental bread and grain distribution. Over time, ''annona'' came to represent the distribution of all pertinent foods in the [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman diet]]. The ''annona'' was originally organized between 500 and 50 BCE, and gained increasing influence in the centuries to come. The practice of specifically distributing grain to the [[Plebs|plebeian]] class, known as ''frumentationes'', gained prominence around 120 BCE and supplemented the efforts of the ''annona'' to feed the Roman people. [[Augustus|Emperor Augustus]] officially changed the ''annona'' system between 8 and 14 CE. He established the position of ''praefectus annonae'', Prefect of the Annona. Up to this point in time, the ''annona'' was handled by local government officials called [[aedile]]s. Augustus’ Prefect of the ''Annona'' oversaw all transportation, weighing, [[Inspection (medicine)|inspection]], and storing of state foods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The physical distribution of foods throughout the Roman Empire varied by location and type of food. Some foods were shipped by boat and then distributed once they reached port.  Others, specifically meat, were transported by land and brought into urban areas. Special regulations were put in place for the distribution of olive oil, as the Empire made contracts with olive oil producers all over the Mediterranean. Free daily distributions of olive oil were enacted by [[Severus Alexander|Emperor Severus]] during his reign from 192 to 211 CE. His distribution policy lasted for at least a few centuries, but scholars are unsure if the policy continued thereafter. Wine was not as freely distributed as olive oil, but was sold for a very low price starting around 300 CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Food Distribution in the 20th and 21st centuries ==

=== US Food Distribution from 1900 to 1960 ===
The United States' food distribution system has experienced major changes in the past hundred years.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Food distribution primarily relied on small, local farms in the 1940s, but quickly grew to become a large business in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=Magazines&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;mode=view&amp;catId=&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA352603575&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=temple_main&amp;jsid=6f206dadcd18b21868a424846f374a10|title=Meal deal; American food distribution|last=|first=|date=2013|work=The Economist|access-date=2016-10-20|via=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three economic advances that allowed for the growth in food distribution between 1910 and 1960 were the establishment of [[chain store]]s, [[Retailers' cooperative|retail cooperatives]], and [[supermarket]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Chain Stores ====
Chain stores did not become popular in the United States until the end of [[World War I]]. It was reported in 1929 that chain stores accounted for 39% of all grocery sales in the United States. Chain stores' success is related to their ability to undersell smaller distributors. An anti-chain movement arose in response to the success of the [[chain store]]s during the [[Great Depression]], but caused little detriment to the success and profitability of the chains.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Retail Cooperatives ====
Another response to the success of the chain stores was the development of [[Retailers' cooperative|retail cooperatives]]. These organizations were founded by groups of individual food distributors who saw the benefits of using chain-style pricing. [[Retailers' cooperative|Retail cooperatives]] accounted for 7% to 8% of the food market in 1930, and an increase in their popularity with independent food distributors rose retail cooperative's market share to 13% by 1958.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Supermarkets ====
The third and final change to US food distribution in the first half of the 20th century involved the establishment of supermarkets. The [[Ford Motor Company]] performed the first experiment regarding the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of large-scale supermarkets after the end of World War I. Supermarkets officially began gaining prominence in the 1930s and steadily continued their growth into the post-WWII era.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Modern US Food Distribution ===
[[File:Food_and_Drug_Administration_logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the Food and Drug Administration]]
Modern food distribution in the United States is a result of continued growth since the 1960s. In an increasingly connected world, food distribution efforts in the US reach from coast to coast. A network of [[infrastructure]], warehouses, factories, and commercial retailers comprise the bulk of US food distribution. It is estimated that food served in the United States may travel close to 1,500 miles between growers and consumers. While many products, specifically meat and grain, are distributed in different fashions, there are common trends to the distribution of most modern foods. An increase in the use of technology for farming has transformed the small local farm of the 1940s in to large production facilities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Several federal agencies, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]], manage and sustain the productivity of the US food distribution system.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Food Distribution in Latin America ===
Food distribution in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts have been made to compete with the [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, [[Consumers' co-operative|consumer cooperatives]], voluntary chains, and retailer purchasing associations. Consumer purchasing organizations are groups of families who buy food together. The benefits of joining one of these organizations are the reduced [[cost]] and improved variety in diet that comes from purchasing food with other families. Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices. The cooperatives are analogous to a food [[Trade union|union]] that actively works to secure the rights of its consumers. Voluntary chains are organizations of privately owned retailers and [[food]] [[Wholesaling|wholesalers]] who operate as one economic body. These groups form contracts to work under, but are economically independent of one another. Retailer purchasing organizations are groups of retailers who purchase products as though they were a single buyer. Members within these organizations are all involved in the purchasing of goods, but do not form contracts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Risk factors affecting food distribution and examples of failed policy ==
Prominent risk factors that can affect the food distribution within a society include war, [[Economics|economic failure]], [[Politics|political instability]], and weather conditions. Each of these factors affects individual groups of people differently, but all share the common attribute of being detrimental to local food distribution and [[food systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two prominent examples of risk factors' negative effect on a society's food distribution system are the situation in Japan during World War II and Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japanese food distribution drastically decreased from the effects of World War Two and the country's economic shortcomings. The need for food during the 1920s and 1930s rose drastically as Japan's population and average lifestyle increased. Japan was importing large amounts of rice, sugar, soybeans, and wheat from its [[Colony|colonies]] by 1935, and had a dependence on colonial possessions to distribute food to her people. 95% of Japanese rice between 1936 and 1938, just a few years before major conflict arose with the United States, was imported from its colonies in [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. Only 2% of Japan's rice came from foreign countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As war engulfed Japan after 1941, food distribution efforts began to suffer. Japan lost a tremendous amount of [[cargo ship]]s and was surrounded by an effective US [[blockade]] for most of the war. [[Import]]s were down, which cut off Japan from its primary source of food. [[Rationing]] programs, ran by Japan's Central Foodstuff Corporation and Local Foodstuff Corporations, were an attempt to distribute food equally among the general population. Changes in tax collection and [[Price controls|price control]] were also created to feed [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but these measures ultimately did not supply the Japanese people with enough food for survival. The average ration allowance consisted of a flour mixture which was often unhealthy and barely edible. Normal consumers age 16 to 60 received an average 330 g of ration per day in May 1943, and the situation only became more desperate as the war progressed. [[Rationing|Rationing programs]] were reduced even further in July 1945, just before the war's end.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Sharan Africa]], the food distribution crisis of the 1970s and 1980s was a result of a multitude of food distribution risk factors including [[Politics|political problems]], [[Economics|economic failures]], and [[Weather|weather conditions]]. The heart of the [[Politics|political problems]] and [[Economics|economic failures]] affecting food distribution included poor [[Agricultural policy|agricultural pricing]] and a lack of state involvement with rural development. Some of the [[Politics|political problems]] can be traced back to the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial period]]. Colonial policy supported the exportation of goods, even if it meant decreasing the amount of food for the local economy. Components of these colonial policies continued to be used after [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African countries]] gained their freedom from European nations. The usage of these failed policies caused malignant consequences on the economic situation of the [[peasant]] class, including the exploitation of peasant agriculture and in removal of peasants from their land. The weather and environmental issues regarding the Sub-Saharan African food distribution crisis also have roots in failed colonial policy. Labor migration cycles used during colonial times were ecologically damaging to the local environment and failed to create new areas for growing crops. As a result, [[desertification]] and a loss of [[soil fertility]] hurt the local [[Agriculture|agricultural sector]], which then in turn negatively affected food distribution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Food Distribution Organizations ==

=== The FAO ===
[[File:FAO_logo.svg|thumb|136x136px|Logo of the Food and Agriculture Organization.]]

One of the largest organizations working to avoiding food distribution crises on the global stage in the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]). The FAO is a branch of the [[United Nations]], and actively works to improve food distribution in countries that need support&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Organizations within the United States ===

==== Federal and Large-Scale ====
Several different organizations exist to mitigate and respond to food distribution crises in the United States. Prominent contributors to large-scale food distribution effort in the US include the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), [[United States Department of Agriculture|United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)]], and [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]]. FEMA and the USDA work together during food distribution crises to coordinate the procurement and transportation of [[Food preservation|nonperishable food]], [[water]], and other [[resource]]s to afflicted areas. The Salvation Army often receives federal supplies from FEMA and the USDA, and then works on the local level to distribute necessary goods. All food given to civilians during a crisis is typically distributed at mass emergency feeding stations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Volunteer and Local ====
[[File:FEMA_-_35275_-_American_Red_Cross_booth_at_FEMA_Hurricane_Awareness_Day.jpg|thumb|An American Red Cross volunteer explains a program to people visiting their display during FEMA's Hurricane Awareness Day.]]

Groups like FEMA, the USDA, and the Salvation Army could not operate without help from individuals and small [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] groups. Prominent contributors to local food disaster efforts include groups like [[Emergency Communities]] and the American Rainbow Rapid Response (ARRR). These organizations typically focus on supplying [[Rural area|rural]] and lower income areas that do not receive priority from large food distribution groups during a crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== The American Red Cross ====
{{main article|American Red Cross}}

Another group that works out of the United States is the [[American Red Cross]].  The American Red Cross is part of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]], and 95% of all workers within the American Red Cross are volunteers. In the case of all crises, whether food related or not, the American Red Cross in engaged in relieving disaster victims. The Red Cross coordinates with local communities to provide essentials such as food, water, and hot meals for those in need during a crisis.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Gayle Manchin was raised in [[Beckley, West Virginia]] and graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Beckley, West Virginia)|Woodrow Wilson High School]]. She received both her [[Bachelor of Arts]] in language arts and education, and a [[Master of Arts]] in reading (now known as the masters in [[literacy education]]), from [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref name=wvpeducation&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Gayle Manchin Elected President of the WVBE |url=https://wvde.state.wv.us/news/2822/ |work=[[West Virginia Department of Education]] |publisher= |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wvmn&gt;{{cite news|first=Brad|last=McElhinny |title=Gayle Manchin picked for Education and the Arts post |url=http://wvmetronews.com/2017/01/13/gayle-manchin-picked-for-education-and-the-arts-post/ |work=[[West Virginia MetroNews]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-13 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she received a second master's degree in educational technology leadership from [[Salem International University]].&lt;ref name=wvmn/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.wvgov.org/biographyFirstLadyGayleManchin.pdf Biography of West Virginia First Lady Gayle Conelly Manchin (accessed 5/21/09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Gayle Conelly married Manchin, with whom she had three children, [[Heather Bresch|Heather]], Joseph IV, and Brooke, and settled in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]].

==Career==
Manchin is a career educator.  She has worked as a teacher in the [[Marion County Public Schools|Marion County Public School district]] and a faculty member at [[Fairmont State University]], where she established the university's inaugural Community Service Learning Program.&lt;ref name=wvmn/&gt;&lt;ref name=wchs&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeffrey|last=Morris |title=Gayle Manchin named West Virginia Secretary of Department of Education and the Arts  |url=http://wchstv.com/news/local/gayle-manchin-named-west-virginia-secretary-of-department-of-education-and-the-arts |work=[[WCHS-TV|WCHS]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-13 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also served as Director of the [[AmeriCorps|AmeriCorps Promise Fellow Program]] in [[West Virginia]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Additionally, Machin worked for the Office of Secretary of Education and the Arts, where she established the West Virginia Partnerships to Assure Student Success initiative (WV PASS).&lt;ref name=wvmn/&gt;

Gayle Manchin held the position of [[First Lady of West Virginia]] from 2005 until 2010 during her husband's term as the state's governor. During her tenure as First Lady, Manchin simultaneously served as the chairperson of the West Virginia Citizen’s Council on Children and Families and Governor’s Healthy Lifestyles Coalition, co-chair of the Governor’s 21st Century Jobs Cabinet and the Intellectual Infrastructure of Vision Shared, and a member of the West Virginia Commission for National and Community Service.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=wvmn/&gt;

In 2007, Manchin was appointed to the West Virginia Board of Education from 2007 to 2015.&lt;ref name=wvpeducation/&gt;&lt;ref name=wvmn/&gt; She served two terms as the Board of Education's vice president.&lt;ref name=wvpeducation/&gt; On July 10, 2013, Manchin was elected President of the [[Education in West Virginia#West Virginia Board of Education|West Virginia Board of Education]] for a two-year term.&lt;ref name=wvpeducation/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdm&gt;{{cite news|first=Shay |last=Maunz |title=Gayle Manchin heading state Board of Education|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/News/Education/201307100169 |work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]]|date=2013-07-10|accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Manchin was the subject of some controversy when ''[[USA Today]]'', a national newspaper, published an article noting that Manchin, upon becoming Board of Education president in 2012, spearheaded a campaign for states to require schools to purchase [[EpiPens]] and other medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jayne|last=O'Donnell |title=Family matters: EpiPens had high-level help getting into schools |url=http://wvmetronews.com/2017/01/13/gayle-manchin-picked-for-education-and-the-arts-post/ |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |date=2016-09-20 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven states created laws to require schools to stock [[EpiPens]], made by [[Mylan]] pharmaceuticals, leading to a "near monopoly" of Mylan's [[epinephrine autoinjector]] in the school health sector.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|first=Jayne|last=O'Donnell |title=Family matters: EpiPens had high-level help getting into schools |url=http://wvmetronews.com/2017/01/13/gayle-manchin-picked-for-education-and-the-arts-post/ |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |date=2016-09-20 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article noted the potential for a conflict of interest, as Mylin's [[CEO]], [[Heather Bresch]], is Manchin's daughter.

==West Virginia Secretary of Education and the Arts==
Incoming [[Governor of West Virginia]] [[Jim Justice]] appointed Manchin to his cabinet as the state's Secretary of Education and the Arts on January 13, 2017. Manchin succeeded outgoing Secretary of Education Kay Goodwin, who was retiring from the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=WV MetroNews |title=Gayle Manchin picked for Education and the Arts post |accessdate=March 12, 2018 |url=http://wvmetronews.com/2017/01/13/gayle-manchin-picked-for-education-and-the-arts-post/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary for Education and the Arts oversees a collection of six state agencies, including [[West Virginia Public Broadcasting]], the West Virginia Library Commission, the Division of Culture and History, Volunteer West Virginia, the state Center for Professional Development, and the Division of Rehabilitation Services.

After the passage of HB 4006, a bill that would dissolve the West Virginia Department of Education and the Arts, in the [[West Virginia Legislature]], Manchin called on Justice to veto the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=WVNews |title=Gayle Manchin calls for Justice to veto bill dissolving Education and the Arts |accessdate=March 12, 2018 |url=https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/gayle-manchin-calls-for-justice-to-veto-bill-dissolving-education/article_0b7670ff-49da-534f-a82f-b9b5c2d3216e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin also offered to resign and "remove any political cloud," though days later, she was removed from office by Justice, leaving the office of Department Secretary vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=USA Today |title=W.Va.

'''Chinese imperial examinations'''&lt;!--chinese in infobox--&gt; were a [[civil service]] [[examination system]] in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] to select candidates for the state [[Civil service#China|bureaucracy]]. Imperial exams existed as early as the [[Han dynasty]], however they were only utilized as a means of recruitment for government office in the mid-[[Tang dynasty]], and remained so until its abolition in 1905. The exams were based on knowledge of the classics and literary style. The Confucian examination syllabus has been compared to the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist education]] central to contemporary European government service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased reliance on the exam system was partially responsible for China's shift away from a [[military aristocracy]] to a [[gentry]] class of [[scholar-bureaucrats]]. Starting with the [[Song dynasty]], the system was regularized and developed into a roughly three-tiered ladder from local to provincial to court exams. The content was narrowed and fixed on texts of [[Neo-Confucian]] orthodoxy. By the [[Ming dynasty]], the highest degree, the ''[[#Degree types|jinshi]]'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:進士|進士]]}}), became essential for highest office. On the other hand, the initial degree, the ''[[shengyuan]]'' ([[wikt:生員|生員]]), became vastly oversupplied, resulting in holders who could not hope for office, yet were still granted social privilege. 

The Chinese examination system spread to neighboring Asian countries, such as [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] (though briefly) &lt;!-- please do not remove Japan, this imperial examination system existed in Japan, it was used during the eighth to tenth centuries, its subjects include xiucai, mingjing, jinshi, mingfa, as well as medicine and acupuncture.--&gt;and [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]]. The Chinese examination system was introduced to the Western world in the reports of [[Europeans in Medieval China|European missionaries and diplomats]] and likely had an influencing the [[British East India Company]]'s introduction of similar methods to select prospective employees. Following the initial success in that company, the British government adopted a similar testing system for screening civil servants in 1855. Other European nations, such as France and Germany, followed suit. Modeled after these previous adaptations, the United States established its own testing program for certain government jobs after 1883.

Critics charged that the examination system stifled creativity and created officials who dared not defy authority, yet the system also continued to promote cultural unity. Wealthy families, especially from the merchant class, could opt into the system by educating their sons or purchasing degrees. In the 19th century, critics blamed the imperial system, and in the process its examinations, for China's lack of technical knowledge and its defeat by foreign powers.

==General history==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
The imperial examination system in its classical manifestation is historically attested to have been established in 605, during the [[Sui dynasty]], when the emperor could call for tests to be administered. In the following [[Tang dynasty]], tests were used on a small scale until the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of [[Wu Zetian]]:&lt;ref&gt;Paludin, 97&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of Wu's use of the testing system is still a matter for scholarly debate. However most government posts were still recruited through personal recommendation and connections to the court. It was not until the [[Song dynasty]] that most officials were recruited through examination. The Song emperors expanded both examinations and the government school system so that the number of those who passed the exams expanded to four to five times that of the Tang. Thus the system played a key role in the selection of the scholar-officials, who formed the elite members of society. During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the system contributed to the narrowness of intellectual life and the autocratic power of the emperor. The system continued with some modifications until its 1905 abolition under the Qing dynasty. Other brief interruptions to the system occurred, such as at the beginning of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 13th century. The modern examination system for selecting civil servants also indirectly evolved from the imperial one.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed., 2010), 145–147, 198–200,&lt;/ref&gt;

The operations of the examination system were part of the imperial record keeping system, and the date of receiving the ''jinshi'' degree is often a key biographical datum: sometimes the date of achieving ''jinshi'' is the only firm date known for even some of the most historically prominent persons in Chinese history. The regular higher level degree examination cycle was nominally decreed in 1067 to be 3 years. In practice both before and after this, the examinations were irregularly implemented for significant periods of time: thus, the calculated statistical averages for the number of degrees conferred annually should be understood in this context. The ''jinshi'' tests were not a yearly event and should not be considered so; the annual average figures are a necessary artifact of quantitative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han dynasty===
Candidates for offices recommended by the prefect of prefecture were examined by the [[minister of ceremony]] and then presented to the emperor.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics – Zhengyuan Fu&lt;/ref&gt; Some candidates for clerical positions would be given a test determine whether they could memorize nine thousand Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="Fu"/&gt; The imperial examinations during the [[Han dynasty]] did not offer a formal entry into government posts. Recruitment and appointment in the Han dynasty was primarily through recommendations by [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and local officials. Recommended individuals were also primarily aristocrats. In theory, recommendations were based on a combination of reputation and ability but it's not certain how well this worked in practice. Oral examinations on policy issues were sometimes conducted personally by the emperor himself during Western Han times.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 165 BC [[Emperor Wen of Han]] introduced recruitment to the [[civil service examination|civil service through examinations]], however these did not heavily emphasize Confucian material. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

While the examinations expanded under the Han, the number of graduates who went on to hold office were few. The examinations did not offer a formal route to commissioned office and the primary path to office remained through recommendations. Though connections and recommendations remained more meaningful than the exam, the initiation of the examination system by Emperor Wu had a cultural significance, as the state determined the most important examination material were Confucian. During the Han dynasty, these examinations were primarily used for the purpose of classifying candidates who had been specifically recommended. Even during the Tang dynasty the quantity of placements into government service through the examination system only averaged about nine persons per year, with the known maximum being less than 25 in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three Kingdoms era through the Sui dynasty===
Beginning in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (with the [[nine-rank system]] in the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]]), imperial officials were responsible for assessing the quality of the talents recommended by the local elites. This system continued until it was abolished in 587 by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] who created a system wherein every prefecture would supply three scholars a year.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics|last=Zhengyuan|first= Fu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 605 [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] established a new category of recommended candidates for the mandarinate (进士科). For the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. However, the Sui dynasty was short-lived, and the system did not reach its mature development until afterwards.

===Tang dynasty and Wu interregnum===
[[File:Exam cells model.jpg|thumb|275px|A model of exam cells displayed at [[Guozijian (Beijing)|Beijing Imperial Academy]]]]

Over the course of the Tang dynasty (唐朝) and during the Zhou dynasty of the [[Wu Zetian]] interregnum, the examination system developed into a more comprehensive system, developing beyond the basic Sui process of qualifying candidates based on questions on policy matters and then followed by an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Oral interviews as part of the examination and selection system were theoretically supposed to be an unbiased process, but in practice favored candidates from elite clans based in the capitals of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]] (speakers of solely non-elite dialects could not succeed).&lt;ref&gt;任立达，薛希洪，"中国古代官吏考选制度史" (''A History of the Examination Systems for the Chinese Imperial Mandarinate'')(青岛出版社, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keay|first=John|title=China&amp;nbsp;— A History|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-00-722178-3}} p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil-service examination was institutionalized, where six categories were created. Eventually these became just one ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' degree.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Although the number of candidates were sometimes as high as 2,000 a year, only 1 to 2 percent passed the test. At this point the exam became administered by the [[Ministry of Rites]].

A pivotal point in the development of imperial examinations arose with the rise of Wu Zetian.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that point, the rulers of the Tang dynasty were all male members of the Li family (李氏). Wu Zetian was exceptional: a woman not of the Li family, she came to occupy the seat of the emperor in an official manner in the year of 690, and even beforehand she had already begun to stretch her power within the imperial courts behind the scenes. Reform of the imperial examinations to include a new class of elite bureaucrats derived from humbler origins became a keystone of Wu's gamble to retain power.

In 655, Wu Zetian graduated 44 candidates with the ''jìnshì'' degree (進士), and during one 7-year period the annual average of exam takers graduated with a ''jinshi'' degree was greater than 58 persons per year. Wu lavished favors on the newly graduated ''jinshi'' degree-holders, increasing the prestige associated with this path of attaining a government career, and clearly began a process of opening up opportunities to success for a wider population pool, including inhabitants of China's less prestigious southeast area.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Li family supporters were located to the northwest, particularly around the capital city of Chang'an. Wu's progressive accumulation of political power through enhancement of the examination system involved attaining the allegiance of previously under-represented regions, alleviating frustrations of the literati, and encouraging education in various locales so even people in the remote corners of the empire would work on their studies in order to pass the imperial exams, and thus developed a nucleus of elite bureaucrats useful from the perspective of control by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

In 681, a written test on knowledge of the Confucian classics was introduced, meaning that candidates were required to memorize these works and fill in the blanks on the test.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 693, Wu Zetian's government further expanded the civil service examination system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paludan|first=Ann|title=Chronicle of the Chinese Emperors: The Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers of Imperial China|year=1998|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05090-2}} p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; part of a policy to reform society and to consolidate power for her self-proclaimed "Zhou dynasty". Examples of officials whom she recruited through her reformed examination system include [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], and [[Shen Quanqi]]. She introduced major changes in regard to the Tang system, increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test by allowing commoners and gentry previously disqualified by their non-elite backgrounds to attempt the tests. Successful candidates then became an elite nucleus of bureaucrats within her government.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 730 and 740, after the Tang restoration, a section requiring the composition of original poetry (including both ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'') was added to the tests, with rather specific set requirements: this was for the ''jinshi'' degree, as well as certain other tests. The less-esteemed examinations tested for skills such as mathematics, law, and calligraphy. The success rate on these tests of knowledge on the classics was between 10 and 20 percent, but for the thousand or more candidates going for a ''jinshi'' degree each year in which it was offered, the success rate for the examinees was only between 1 and 2 percent: a total of 6504 ''jinshi'' were created during course of the Tang dynasty (an average of only about 23 ''jinshi'' awarded per year).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the Tang restoration, the following emperors expanded on Wu's policies since they found them politically useful, and the annual averages of degrees conferred continued to rise; however with the upheavals which later developed and the disintegration of the Tang empire into the "[[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]", the examination system gave ground to other traditional routes to government positions and favoritism in grading reduced the opportunities of those taking the tests who lacked political patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically this period of fragmentation resulted in the utter destruction of old networks established by elite families that had ruled China throughout its various dynasties since its very conception. With the disappearance of the old aristocracy, Wu's system of bureaucrat recruitment once more became the dominant model in China, and eventually coalesced into the class of nonhereditary elites who would become known to the West as "mandarins," in reference to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the dialect of Chinese employed in the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-civil-service |title=Chinese civil service |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date= 19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song dynasty===
[[File:Palastexamen-SongDynastie.jpg|thumb|400px|The emperor receives a candidate during the Palace Examination. Song dynasty.]]

In the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) more than a hundred higher level examinations were held. Officials selected through the exams became dominant in the bureaucracy. The number of ''jinshi'' degrees also increased.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Theoretically, the examinations were open to adult (at least in terms of literacy) Chinese males, with some restrictions. This included even individuals from the occupied northern territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 257 (Table 2, which shows 26 doctoral degrees awarded in 1184 to individuals from Occupied North China, and 1 in 1256)&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Examples include [[Wang Anshi]], who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical, and [[Zhu Xi]], whose interpretations of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Classics]] became the orthodox [[Neo-Confucianism]] which dominated later dynasties. Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were [[Su Shi]] and his brother [[Su Zhe]]: both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi. Indeed, one of the major objectives of the examination system was to promote diversity of viewpoints and to avoid over-filling of offices with individuals of particular political or partisan alignment, as might occur with alternative, more biased methods, which could allow for active recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 391&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly, requiring time to spare and tutors. Most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning [[scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. (1962) ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright (Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}}, p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 937, by the decision of the Taizu Emperor of Song, the palace examination was supervised by the emperor himself. In 992, the practice of anonymous submission of papers during the palace examination was introduced; it was spread to the departmental examinations in 1007, and to the prefectural level in 1032. The practice of recopying the papers in order not to allow biases by revealing the candidate by his calligraphy was introduced at the capital and departmental level in 1105, and in the prefectures in 1037.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''A Cultural History of Civil Examinations in Late Imperial China'', 2000:14.
&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics indicate that the Song imperial government degree-awards eventually more than doubled the highest annual averages of those awarded during the Tang dynasty, with 200 or more per year on average being common, and at times reaching a per annum figure of almost 240.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reforms or attempts to reform the examination system were made during the Song dynasty, including by [[Fan Zhongyan]] and those by Wang Anshi. Fan's memorial to the throne actually initiated a process which lead to major educational reform through the establishment of a comprehensive public school system.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan dynasty (the Mongols)===
Governmental examinations ended with the defeat of the Song in 1279 by a disintegrating [[Mongol empire]]. After a period of turmoil, the part of the Mongol empire that was led by [[Kublai Khan]] established itself in China as the [[Yuan dynasty]]. One of Kublai's main advisers in this event was [[ Liu Bingzhong]], who wrote a memorial, among other things, recommending restoration of the examination system: however, this was not done.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai ended the imperial examination system, as he believed that Confucian learning was not needed for government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy, Frey. History Alive!: The Medieval World and beyond. Palo Alto, CA: Teacher's Curriculum Institute, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kublai was opposed to such a commitment to the Chinese language and to the Chinese scholars who were so adept, together with the accompanying ideology: he wished to appoint his own people without relying on an apparatus inherited from a newly conquered and sometimes rebellious country.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuation of the exams had the affect of reducing the prestige of traditional learning, reducing the motivation for doing so, as well as encouraging new literary directions not motivated by the old means of literary development and success.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988: 116, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination system was revived in 1315, with significant changes, during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Yuan|Emperor Renzong]]. The new examination system was one of regionalism with Mongol characteristics. The northern areas of Mongolia and its vicinity were favored, and a quota system (both for number of candidates and number of degrees awarded) which was based on the classification of the imperial population into four [[Race (human classification)|racially-based groups]] (or [[castes]] and/or [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]]) was instituted, the groups being Mongols, their non-Han allies ([[Semu|Semu-ren]]), Northern Chinese, and Southern Chinese, with further restrictions by province.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Under the revived and revised system the yearly averages for examination degrees awarded was about 21.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; As the degrees were arithmetically divided between the four "races" (although with further modification), rather than being proportionally based on either population or number of qualified candidates, this tended to favor the Mongols, Semu-ren, and North Chinese: the South Chinese were by far the greatest part of the population, the 1290 census figures recording some 12,000,000 households (about 48% of the total Yuan population), versus 2,000,000 North Chinese households, and the populations of Mongols and Semu-ren were both less.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on candidates by the new quota system allowed only 300 candidates for each testing session of the three year examination cycle. The provincial restrictions resulted in a greater effect; for example, only 28 Han Chinese from South China were included among the 300 candidates, the rest of the South China slots (47) being occupied by resident Mongols or Semu-ren, although 47 "racial South Chinese" who were not residents of South China were approved as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263, and note 17, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ming dynasty===
[[Image:Portrait of Jiang Shunfu.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A 15th-century portrait of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] official [[Jiang Shunfu]]. The two [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] on his chest are a "[[Mandarin square]]" for a civil official of the first rank.]]
The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) retained and expanded the system it inherited. Shortly after the inauguration of the dynasty, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in 1370 declared that the exams should cover the [[Four Books]], discourses, and political analysis, accepting the Neo-Confucian canon put forth by [[Zhu Xi]] in the Song dynasty. But he firmly insisted on including the martial arts.
The curriculum at the [[Guozijian]] (National Academy){{which|date=August 2018}} emphasized law, mathematics, calligraphy, [[equestrianism|horse riding]], and archery in addition to Confucian classics required in the exams.&lt;ref name="Langlois988"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Frederick W. Mote|editor2=Denis Twitchett|author-first = Jack|author-last = Langlois| chapter = The Hung-wu Reign, 1368–1398| title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=archery&amp;f=false|date=26 February 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|pages=122–}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor especially emphasized archery.&lt;ref name="Selby2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Selby|title=Chinese Archery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wY3sAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=yuanzhang+archery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI9c_n7b7MAhXkzoMKHcLRDCYQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuanzhang%20archery&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-501-4|pages=267–}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The three levels of examination were created during this period, whose degrees were in order, ''[[shengyuan]]'' (elementary), ''[[juren]]'' (provincial), and ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' (metropolitan examination).&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt;

The Ming established Neo-Confucian interpretations as the orthodoxy guidelines and created what the historian [[Benjamin Elman]] called a "single-minded and monocular political ideology" that "affected politically and socially how literati learning would be interpreted and used." The imperial civil service system adopted this rigid orthodoxy at a time when commercialization and population growth meant that there was an inflation in the number of degree candidates at the lower levels. As a result, the higher and more prestigious offices were dominated by ''jinshi '' (Palace) degree-holders, who tended to come from elite families. The Ming thus started a process in which access to government office became harder and harder and officials became more and more orthodox in their thought. Near the end of the Ming dynasty, in 1600, there were roughly half a million licentiates in a population of 150 million, that is, one per 300 people; by the mid-19th century the ratio had shrunk to one civil licentiate for each 1,000 people.{{sfnb|Elman|2009| pp = 408–409}}

The social background of metropolitan graduates also narrowed as time went on. In the early years of the Ming dynasty only 14 percent of metropolitan graduates came from families that had a history of providing officials, while in the last years of the Ming roughly 60 percent of metropolitan exam graduates came from established elite families.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:Xu Yang - Examination hall.jpg|thumb|250px|Examination hall, ''[[Prosperous Suzhou]]'' by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]], 1759]]
The Qing dynasty largely adopted the Ming civil-service exam in the year of its establishment, 1644. The ''shengyuan'' degree holders were given some tax exemptions from the general public. During the Qing dynasty a total of 112 ''jinshi'' examinations were held within 261 years (1644–1905), averaging 2.3 years per exam and 102 ''jinshi'' degrees conferred a year.&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which attempted to overthrow the Qing dynasty in the middle of the 19th century, in 1853 admitted for the first time women as examination candidates. The exams administered by the Heavenly Kingdom differed from those administered by the Qing dynasty, in that they required knowledge of the [[Bible]]. [[Fu Shanxiang]] took the exam and became the first female [[zhuangyuan]] in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Jiaqi (Grace Chor Yi Wong tr.) | last =Mao | chapter =Fu Shanxiang| pages =43–45| title =Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women | series = | volume = | editor =Ho Clara Wing-chug, ed.| location = Armonk, NY| publisher =Sharpe | year =1998 | isbn =0765600439|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uwPWtJ5WSQMC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Fu+Shanxiang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7BAdVeayl&amp;sig=5EUfk3kCuq0-LrJApSYZBwItt78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e1zLU49ahqTIBMeFgvgO&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fu%20Shanxiang&amp;f=false|ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of the imperial examination system===
With the military defeats in the 1890s and pressure to develop a national school system, reformers such as [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]] called for abolition of the exams, and the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] of 1898 proposed a set of modernizations. After the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the government drew up plans to reform under the name of [[New Policies]], then abolish the exams. On 2 September 1905, the throne endorsed a [[memorial to the throne|memorial]] which ordered that the old examination system be discontinued at all levels in the following years. The new system provided equivalents to the old degrees; a bachelor's degree, for instance, would be considered equivalent to the ''xiu cai''. The details of the new system remained to be worked out by the fall of the dynasty in 1911, but the end of the system meant the end of Confucianism as an official state ideology and of the [[scholar official]] as a legal group.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Franke, ''The Reform and Abolition of the Traditional Chinese Examination System'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: East Asian Research Center, 1968), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General discussion of late imperial system==
Reformers charged that the set format of the "[[Eight-legged essay]]" stifled original thought and satirists portrayed the rigidity of the system in novels such as ''[[Rulin waishi]]''. In the twentieth century, the [[New Culture Movement]] portrayed the examination system as a cause for China's weakness in such stories as [[Lu Xun]]'s "[[Kong Yiji]]." Some have suggested that limiting the topics prescribed in examination system removed the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation, perhaps contributing to the [[Great Divergence]], in which China's scientific and economic development fell behind Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, ''Demystifying the Chinese Economy'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. xiv, [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the political and ethical theories of Confucian classical curriculum has been compared to the [[classical studies]] of [[Renaissance Humanism|humanism]] in European nations which proved instrumental in selecting an "all-rounded" top-level leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elman |first1=Benjamin A. |title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China |date=2009 |publisher=Berkshire Publishing Group LLC |isbn=9780977015948 |pages=405 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; British and French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on Greco-Roman classical subjects and general cultural studies, as well as assessing personal physique and character.

In [[late imperial China]], the examination system was the major mechanism by which the central government captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. Their loyalty, in turn, ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered tendencies toward regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system.  The examination system distributed its prizes according to provincial and prefectural quotas, which meant that imperial officials were recruited from the whole country, in numbers roughly proportional to each province's population. Elite individuals all over China, even in the disadvantaged peripheral regions, had a chance at succeeding in the examinations and achieving the rewards and emoluments office brought.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History''. (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination based civil service thus promoted stability and social mobility. The Confucian-based examinations meant that the local elites and ambitious would-be members of those elites across the whole of China were taught with similar values.  Even though only a small fraction (about 5 percent) of those who attempted the examinations actually passed them and even fewer received titles, the hope of eventual success sustained their commitment. Those who failed to pass did not lose wealth or local social standing; as dedicated believers in Confucian orthodoxy, they served, without the benefit of state appointments, as teachers, patrons of the arts, and managers of local projects, such as irrigation works, schools, or charitable foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History'' (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), pp. 101–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China===
{{See also|History of the Republic of China}}

After the fall of the Qing in 1911, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the leader of the newly risen [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], developed similar procedures for the new political system through an institution called the [[Examination Yuan]], one of the five branches of government, although this was quickly suspended due to the turmoil in China between the two world wars, such as the warlord period and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]]. The [[Kuomintang]] administration revived the Examination Yuan in 1947 after the defeat of Japan. This system continues into present times in Taiwan along with the government itself after loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]].

==Taking the exams==
[[Image:Imperial examination cheating material.JPG|thumb|widthpx|"Cribbing Garment" worn as underwear into the examination]]

The examinations consisted of tests administered at the district, provincial, and metropolitan levels. Tight quotas restricted the number of successful candidates at each level—for example, only three hundred students could pass the metropolitan examinations. Students often took the examinations several times before earning a degree.

* Entry-level examinations were held annually and accessible to educated individuals from their early teenage years.  These were held locally and were collectively called '''''Tóngshì''''' ([[wikt: 童試|童試]], "Child Exam").  ''Háizi kǎoshì'' was broken down hierarchically into the '''''Xiànshì''''' ([[wikt:縣試|縣試]], "County Exam"), the '''''Fǔshì''''' ([[wikt:府試|府試]], "Prefectural exam") and '''''Yuànshì''''' ([[wikt:院試|院試]], "college exam").
* Provincial exams: '''''Xiāngshì''''' ([[wikt:鄉試|鄉試]], "township exam") were held every three years in provincial capitals.
* Metropolitan exams: '''''Huìshì''''' ([[wikt:會試|會試]], "conference exam") were held every three years in the national capital.
* Palace exams: '''''Diànshì''''' ([[wikt:殿試|殿試]], "court exam") were held every three years in the [[Forbidden City|Imperial palace]] and often supervised by the emperor himself.

Each candidate arrived at an examination compound with only a few amenities: a water pitcher, a [[chamber pot]], bedding, food (which he had to prepare himself), an [[inkstone]], [[inkstick|ink]] and [[ink brush|brushes]]. Guards verified a student's identity and searched for hidden printed materials.  In the Ming and Qing periods, each exam taker spent three days and two nights writing "[[eight-legged essay]]s"—literary compositions with eight distinct sections—in a tiny room with a makeshift bed, desk and bench. There were no interruptions during those three days, nor were candidates allowed any communication.  If a candidate died, officials wrapped his body in a straw mat and tossed it over the high walls that ringed the compound.&lt;ref&gt;Ichisada Miyazaki. ''China's Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of Imperial China.'' (New York: Weatherhill,  1976. {{ISBN|0834801043}}), pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense [[pressure to succeed]] meant that [[cheating]] and [[corruption in China|corruption]] were rampant, often outrunning strenuous attempts to prevent or defeat them. The Ming-dynasty ''[[Book of Swindles]]'' (c. 1617) contains an entire section of stories about "Corruption in Education", most of which involve swindlers exploiting exam-takers' desperate attempts to bribe the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to discourage favoritism which might occur if an examiner recognized a student's calligraphy, each exam was recopied by an official copyist.  Exact quotes from [[Four Books and Five Classics|the classics]] were required; misquoting even one character or writing it in the wrong form meant failure, so candidates went to great lengths to bring hidden copies of these texts with them, sometimes written on their underwear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew H. Plaks]],  [http://www.princeton.edu/~ealj/robe.htm  "Cribbing Garment" Gest Library]'''&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] holds an example of a Qing dynasty [[cheat sheet]], a handkerchief with 10,000 characters of Confucian classics in microscopically small handwriting.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gAfiJGpVM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the imperial examination==
===Curriculum===
By 115 AD, a set curriculum had become established for the so-called First Generation of examination takers. They were tested on their proficiency in the "[[Six Arts]]":

* Scholastic arts: music, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies in both public and private life.
* Militaristic: archery and horsemanship

The curriculum was then expanded to cover the "Five Studies": military strategy, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography, and the [[Confucian classics]]. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized during the sixth century AD, under the [[Sui dynasty]]. These examinations are regarded by most historians as the first [[standardized tests]] based on merit.

===Degree types===
[[File:状元卷.JPG|thumb|Exam paper of Ming dynasty [[Zhuangyuan]] Zhao Bing-zhong in 1598 AD]]
[[File:陳悅記祖宅舉人竿.jpg|thumb|Stone flagpole planted at the examiner's abode indicating the jinshi imperial examination status]]
By the [[Ming dynasty]], the examinations and degrees formed a "ladder of success", with success generally being equated with being graduated as ''[[jinshi]]'', a degree similar to a modern Doctor of Literature degree, or [[PhD]]. Modifications to the basic ''jinshi'' or other degree were made for higher-placing graduates, similar to the modern [[Summa cum laude]]. The examination process extended down to the county level, and included examinations at the provincial and national levels. The highest level tests would be at the imperial court or palace level, of which the ''jinshi'' was the highest regular level, although special purpose tests were occasionally offered, by imperial decree:

* '''''Tongsheng''''' ([[wikt:童生|童生]], lit. "child student"),  an entry-level examinee who had passed the county/prefecture exams.
* '''''[[Shengyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:生員|生員]], lit. "student member"), also commonly called '''''xiucai''''' ([[wikt:秀才|秀才]], lit. "distinguished talent"), an entry-level [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] who had passed the college exam.  ''Xiucai'' enjoyed officially sanctioned social privileges such as exemption from [[Corvée|statute labour]], access into local government facilities and limited immunity against [[corporal punishment]]s.  They were further divided into three classes according to exam performance.
** '''''Linsheng''''' ([[wikt:廩生|廩生]], lit. "granary student"), the first class of ''shengyuan'', who were the best performers in the college exam, and got to receive government-issued rations and pay for their academic achievements.  The top performers within this class would get accepted into the [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]] as '''gongsheng''' ([[wikt:貢生|貢生]], lit. "tribute student"), who will then be eligible to sit the provincial or even the national exam directly.
*** '''''Anshou''''' ([[wikt:案首|案首]], lit. "first on the desk"), the highest ranking ''linsheng'', and thus the top ''shengyuan'' who ranked first in college exam.
** '''''Zengsheng''''' ([[wikt:增生|增生]], lit. "expanded student"), the second class of ''shengyuan'', who performed less well than ''linsheng'' and enjoyed similar legal perks, but not the material allowance.
** '''''Fusheng''''' ([[wikt:附生|附生]], lit. "attached student"), the third class of ''shengyuan'' and considered substitute recruits outside the official quota of enrollment.  They were considered passable in exams but needed more improvements.
* {{anchor|juren}} '''''[[Juren]]''''' ([[wikt:舉人|舉人]], lit. "recommended man"), a qualified graduate who passed the triennial provincial exam.
** '''''Jieyuan''''' ([[wikt:解元|解元]], lit. "top escorted examinee"), the ''juren'' who ranked first in provincial exam.
* '''''Gongshi''''' ([[wikt:貢士|貢士]], lit. "tribute scholar"), a recognized scholarly achiever who passed the triennial national exam.
** '''''Huiyuan''''' ([[wikt:會元|會元]], lit. "top conference examinee"), the ''gongshi'' who ranked first in national exam.
* '''''[[Jinshi]]''''' ([[wikt:進士|進士]], lit. "advanced scholar"), a graduate who passed the triennial court exam.
** '''''Jinshi Jidi''''' ([[wikt:進士及第|進士及第]], lit. "distinguished ''jinshi''"), graduates ranked first class in the court exam, usually only the top three individuals were qualified for this title.
*** '''''[[Zhuangyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:狀元|狀元]], lit. "top thesis author"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked first overall nationwide.
*** '''''Bangyan''''' ([[wikt:榜眼|榜眼]], lit. "eyes positioned alongside"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked second overall just below ''zhuangyuan''.
*** '''''Tanhua''''' ([[wikt:探花|探花]], lit. "flower snatcher"), the ''jinshi'' ranked third overall.
** '''''Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:進士出身|進士出身]], lit. "''jinshi'' background"), the graduates who ranked second class in court exam, ranking immediately after the ''tanhua''.
** '''''Tong Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:同進士出身|同進士出身]], lit. "along with ''jinshi'' background"), graduates ranked third class in the court exam.

===Degree examinations===
Besides the regular tests for the ''jinshi'' and other degrees, there were also occasionally special purpose examinations, by imperial decree (''zhiju''). These decree examinations were for the purpose of particular promotions or to identify talented men for dealing with certain, specific, especially difficult assignments. During the Song dynasty, in 1061, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] decreed special examinations for the purpose of finding men capable of "direct speech and full remonstrance" (''zhiyan jijian''): the testing procedure required the examinees to submit 50 previously prepared essays, 25 on particular contemporary problems, 25 on more general historical governmental themes. In the examination room, the examinees then had a day to write essays on six topics chosen by the test officials, and finally were required to write a 3,000 character essay on a complex policy problem, personally chosen by the emperor, Renzong. Among the few successful candidates were the Su brothers, [[Su Shi]] and [[Su Zhe]] (who had already attained their ''jinshi'' degrees, in 1057), with Su Shi scoring exceptionally high in the examinations, and subsequently having copies of his examination essays widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 2000: page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Wu Zetian the imperial government created specialized military examinations for the selection of army officers as a response to the breakdown of garrison militias known as the [[Fubing system]].&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi. ''Pratique Des Examens Militaires En Chine.'' (Shanghai, Varietes Sinologiques. No. 9,  1896). [https://archive.org/details/pratiquedesexam00zigoog American Libraries Internet Archive Google Book (Searchable)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal military examinations were introduced in 702. Before the military exams, the participants who were from military families studied at military schools.&lt;ref name="Forges2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger V. Des Forges|title=Cultural Centrality and Political Change in Chinese History: Northeast Henan in the Fall of the Ming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE6Va-Fe1coC&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4044-9|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful candidates were awarded military versions of Jinshi and Juren degrees: ''Wujinshi'' (武進士) and ''Wujuren'' (武舉人), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi.

The names of civil ''jinshi'' were carved in marble whereas military ''jinshi'' were not. Nevertheless, the civil and military elements of government were in Chinese political theory sometimes compared to the two wheels of a [[Chinese chariot|chariot]]; if either were neglected, government would not run smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the military examinations had the same general arrangement as the regular exams, with provincial, metropolitan and palace versions of the exams. The ideal candidate was expected to master the same Confucian texts as the civilians, in addition to martial skills such as archery and horsemanship as well as [[Chinese military texts]], especially [[Sun Tzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F3baSe8QlPUC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=military+examination+administered+scholar+gunpowder#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Military culture in imperial China|author=Nicola Di Cosmo|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=245|isbn=0-674-03109-1|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the entry level exam, for instance, which was conducted by the [[County magistrate (China)|district magistrate]], the candidate had to shoot three arrows while riding his horse toward the target, which was the shape of a person. A perfect score was three hits, a good score two, and one hit earned a pass. The candidate failed if he made no hits or fell from his horse. The higher levels were made up of more and more challenging exams until the highest level, conducted at the palace in the presence of the emperor, which included not only mounted archery, but bow bending, halberd brandishing, and weight lifting.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JR.1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic Wakeman, Jr.|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1041#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04804-1|pages=1041–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the intention of raising more military officers through these examinations, rarely did famous generals and strategists ever arise from military degree holders. With some exceptions such as the Tang general [[Guo Ziyi]], the father of the founder of the Song dynasty [[Zhao Hongyin]], Ming generals [[Yu Dayou]] and [[Qi Jiguang]], and Qing general [[Wu Sangui]], graduates of the official military examinations have left few traces. Even in desperate times, the majority of distinguished military figures in Chinese history have come from civil degree holders. In total, 282 military metropolitan exams were held between their inception in 702 and abolishment in 1901. The practices of the Qing and Ming military exams was incorporated into physical education during the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="Morris2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew D.

Besides China, the military examinations were also a practice of certain Korean and Vietnamese dynasties.

===Examination procedures===
[[Image:Exam cells-large.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Examination hall with 7500 cells, [[Guangdong|Canton]], 1873.]]
By 1370, the examinations lasted between 24 and 72 hours, and were conducted in spare, isolated examination rooms; sometimes, however, it was held within cubicles. The small rooms featured two boards which could be placed together to form a bed or placed on different levels to serve as a desk and chair. In order to obtain objectivity in evaluation, candidates were identified by number rather than name, and examination answers were recopied by a third party before being evaluated to prevent the candidate's handwriting from being recognized.

In the main hall of the imperial palace during the Tang and Song Dynasties there stood two stone statues. One was of a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and the other of [[Ao (turtle)|Ao]] (鳌), the mythical turtle whose chopped-off legs serve as pillars for the sky in Chinese legend. The statues were erected on stone plinths in the center of a flight of stairs where successful candidates (jinshi) in the palace examination lined up to await the reading of their rankings from a scroll known as the [[jinbang]] (金榜). The first ranked scholar received the title of Zhuàngyuán (狀元/状元), and the honor of standing in front of the statue of Ao. This gave rise to the use of the phrases ''"to have stood at Ao's head"'' (占鳌头 [Zhàn ào tóu]), or ''"to have stood alone at Ao's head"'' (独占鳌头 [Dú zhàn ào tóu]) to describe a Zhuàngyuán, and more generally to refer to someone who excels in a certain field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Restrictions===
Some people were banned from taking the imperial exam, although this varied to some extent over history. Traditionally, Chinese society was divided into officials/nobility and commoners. The commoners were divided by class or status into 4 groups by occupation, ranked in order of prestige: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath these in terms of prestige were the so-called "mean" people, with various regional names and attributes; but, boat-people, beggars, sex-workers, entertainers, slaves, and low-level government employees were all people included among the "mean" class: among other forms of discrimination, "mean" people were forbidden to serve as government officials or to take the imperial exam.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Naquin |author2=Evelyn Sakakida Rawski |title=Chinese Society in the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=The+latter+category+included+remnants+of+aboriginal+groups+who+had+survived+Chinese+expansion+and+settlement+and+practitioners+of+occupations+that+included+prostitutes,+musicians,+actors,+and+some+yamen+employees+(gate+keepers#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20latter%20category%20included%20remnants%20of%20aboriginal%20groups%20who%20had%20survived%20Chinese%20expansion%20and%20settlement%20and%20practitioners%20of%20occupations%20that%20included%20prostitutes%2C%20musicians%2C%20actors%2C%20and%20some%20yamen%20employees%20(gate%20keepers&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-10-31 |type= |edition=reprint,  |series= |volume= |date= |year=1989 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-300-04602-2 |page=117 |pages= |at= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case for the caste of "degraded" outcasts in [[Ningbo]] city, where around 3,000 people, said to be [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] descendants, were barred from taking the Imperial Exams, among numerous other restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=min+degraded++class#v=onepage&amp;q=ningpo%20min%20degraded%20%20class%20descendants%20kin&amp;f=false|title=The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

Butchers and [[Wu (shaman)|sorcerers]] were also excluded at times.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 247&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants were generally restricted from taking the exams until the Ming and Qing dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 248&lt;/ref&gt; During Sui and Tang artisans were also restricted from official service; during the Song dynasty artisans and merchants were specifically excluded from the ''jinshi'' exam; and, in the Liao dynasty, physicians, diviners, butchers, and merchants were all prohibited from taking the examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 386 note 70, citing ''Liao-shih''.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, quota systems were also used to restrict the number of candidates allowed to take or to pass the imperial civil service examinations, by region or by other criteria.

==Cultural context==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
Chinese traditional religion responded to concerns about the imperial examination system. The examination system was also influential on the contemporary literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucian rationalism===
From a certain viewpoint, the examination system represented the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] system in its most rationalist aspect. The test system was designed to achieve a society ruled by men of [[Confucianism#Meritocracy|merit]], as determined by an objective measure of the candidates' knowledge and intelligence. However, in actual operation, the examinations also included various religious, mythical, or irrational beliefs, which made the examination structure more complex than the Confucian ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–266 and Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate===
A less scientifically rational idea which had a significant role in the cultural context of the examination system involved traditional beliefs about fate: that cosmic forces predestine certain human affairs, and particularly that individual success or failure was subject to the will of [[Tian|Heaven]], or that the results of taking the tests could be influenced by the intervention of various deities.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhong Kui===
[[Zhong Kui]], also known as Chung-kuei, was a deity associated with the examination system. The story is that he was a scholar who took the tests, and, despite his most excellent performance, he was unfairly deprived of the first-place prize by a corrupt system: in response, he killed himself, the act of suicide condemning him to be a [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]. Many people afraid of traveling on roads and paths that may be haunted by evil spirits have worshiped Zhong Kui as a protective deity.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 60 (picture, 58)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls''===
Also known as ''Kechang Yiwen Lu'', the ''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls'' was a collection of stories popular among Confucian scholars of the Qing dynasty. The theme of many of the stories is that good deeds are rewarded by success in the examination halls, often by Heaven-inspired deities acting on karmic principles; and evil deeds result in failure, often under the influence of the ghosts of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming taboo===
Some individuals were discriminated against because of their names, due to a [[naming taboo]]. For example, because the Tang dynasty poet [[Li He]]'s father's name sounded like the ''jin'', in ''jinshi'', he was discouraged from taking the tests.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, 286&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was that if Li He was called a ''jinshi'', it would be against the rule of etiquette that a son not be called by his father's name.

==Influence==
[[File:ThiHuong1888.jpg|thumb|right|Invigilators seated on high chairs at a provincial exam in 1888 in northern Vietnam]]
===Other countries===
====East====
The Chinese imperial examination system had extensive influence throughout East Asia. It was used as a model by both the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasties in Korea (see ''[[Gwageo]]'') until the country's [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|annexation by Japan]].  The examination was technically open to all, except [[Nobi]] who were not subject to taxes or army service. 

The Chinese system provided the framework for the [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]] from the reign of the [[Lý dynasty]] Emperor [[Lý Nhân Tông]] (1075) until that of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] Emperor [[Khải Định]] (1919). 

Japan also used the system as a model in the [[Heian period]]; however, it affected only the minor nobility and was replaced by the hereditary system during the [[Samurai]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Haifeng, ''Influence of China’s Imperial Examinations on Japan, Korea and Vietnam'' -''Frontiers of History in China'', October 2007, Volume 2, Issue 4, pp 493–512
&lt;/ref&gt;

====West====
The imperial examination system attracted much attention and greatly inspired political theorists in the Western World, and one of the earliest Chinese institutions to receive foreign notice.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] and hence the reform of the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Civil Service in British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Ssu-yu Teng, "Chinese Influence on the Western Examination System", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 7 (1942–1943):  267–312.&lt;/ref&gt; After Great Britain's successful implementation of systematic, open, and competitive examinations in India in the 19th century, similar systems were instituted in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom]] itself, and in other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 417&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
Some of the main outstanding questions regarding the imperial examinations are in regard to poetry. To what extent did the inclusion of poetry in the examinations influence the writing of poetry, for instance the proliferation of [[Tang poetry|poetry during the Tang dynasty]]?&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of debate on the usefulness of the procedure of testing the ability of the candidates to write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 51&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tang dynasty, a poetry section was added to the examinations, requiring the examinee to compose a ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' poem in the five-character, 12-line [[regulated verse]] form and a ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' composition of 300 to 400 characters&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry requirement remained standard for many decades, despite some controversy, although briefly abolished for the examination year 833–834 (by order of [[Li Deyu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–59, who notes factual inaccuracy of the former belief that the poetry requirement was eliminated from 781–834&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]], in the late 1060s [[Wang Anshi]] removed the traditional poetry composition sections ([[regulated verse]] and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]''), on the grounds of irrelevancy to the official functions of bureaucratic office: on the other side of the debate, [[Su Shi]] (Dongpo) pointed out that the selection of great ministers of the past had not been obstructed by the poetry requirements, that the study and practice of poetry encouraged careful writing, and that the evaluation and grading of poetry was more objective than for the prose essays, due to the strict and detailed rules for writing verse according to the formal requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Alexander Forrest.jpg|thumb|200px|James Alexander Forrest upon receiving an honorary Doctors of Laws degree, 1979.]]
'''Sir James "Jim" Alexander Forrest''' (10 March 1905 – 26 September 1990) was an [[Australia]]n lawyer, businessman and philanthropist.

Born in [[Kerang, Victoria]], Forrest was educated at [[Caulfield Grammar School]] in [[Melbourne]] before studying an articled clerk's course at the [[University of Melbourne]]. Although this course did not end with him receiving a law degree, Forrest became qualified to work as both a barrister and solicitor in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. His admission to the Victorian Bar was moved by both [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Wilfred Fullagar]], and presided over by [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]], then the Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].

Forrest became a prominent lawyer, specialising in corporate law. He was a partner at the firm of Hedderwicks Fookes &amp; Alston, which later merged to become Allens Arthur Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Allens Arthur Robinson (2006). [http://www.aar.com.au/about/his.htm#hedder Our history]. Retrieved 5 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], he was a Flight Lieutenant in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and shortly after the war took up several board directorships of Australian companies. From 1959 to 1978, he served as the Chairman of the [[National Australia Bank|National Bank of Australasia]], and he served at both [[Alcoa]] Australia and [[WMC Resources|Western Mining Corporation]] as Chairman and director respectively.

From 1961 to 1971 he was a foundation member of the Council of [[Monash University]]. In 1979, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree by the university for service to the law, commerce and Monash itself. He was a board member of numerous charitable and educational bodies, including the [[Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne|Royal Children's Hospital]], [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], [[Scouts Australia]], and an original member of the Victoria Law Foundation. He was also a [[list of Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science|fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]] from 1977 to his death, after becoming the fourth person inducted into the Fellowship by Special Election.

The '''Jewelry District''' is a section of [[Downtown Los Angeles]] where a variety of [[jewelry|jeweled products]] are sold.

According to the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] and Visitor's Bureau, it is the largest jewelry district in the [[United States]]. The annual reported sales from the Jewelry District is just under $3 billion. It comprises close to 5,000 businesses, with vendors on Hill Street, Olive Street, and [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]] between 5th and 8th Streets. Shoppers can find designer jewelry, [[precious stones]], and [[gold]] and silver items at street level as well as in some of the jewelers found in the Los Angeles Jewelry Mart, Pacific Center, the California Jewelry Mart, and the International Jewelry Center also known as the "550" building.

==History==
The Jewelry District is predominantly made up of early twentieth-century buildings, when the number of registered vehicles in the county grew from 160,000 to 842,000 in a span of 10 years. Half of the area falls under the greater [[Historic Core, Los Angeles|“Historic Core”]] of Downtown Los Angeles, which spans between Hill and Main Streets, and 3rd and 9th streets. The median year in which the buildings in the area were built was 1923. The oldest building to remain in the district is located on 543 South Broadway Avenue - a three story, 32,600 square foot commercial space that is now occupied by Teresa’s Bridals.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles County, "Office of the Assessor: Property Search." Accessed March 14, 2012.[http://maps.assessor.lacounty.gov/link1_Link1]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the earliest jewelers to establish stores in 1932 were the Laykin Diamond Company (Laykin et Cie) and [[Harry Winston Diamond Corporation|Harry Winston &amp; Co]]. Both stores were housed at the historic Alexandria Hotel on 5th street, just behind the district on S. Broadway.

==Density==
Almost all of the buildings within the Jewelry District were designed for general office use with retail spaces on the street level,&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Roger (February 6, 2015) [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-re-jewelry-office-sold-20150206-story.html "Historic L.A. Jewelry District building to become offices again"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; with some large venues, such as the historic [[State Theatre (Los Angeles) | Loew’s State Theatre]] on 703 S. Broadway, which was built in 1923.  In the early twentieth-century, downtown was rapidly developing but it did not feature skyscrapers as tall as [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]]. The buildings were limited to 150 feet by law, which was favored by architects and planners who saw the towering skyscrapers of the east coast metropolises as unsustainable and not conducive to the Southern California lifestyle. Although many residents were living in apartment buildings at the time, the architects and planners argued that excessive vertical expansion would lead to inhumane overconcentration and congestion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Axelrod, "Keep The "L" Out of Los Angeles," Journal of Urban History, 34, no. 1 (2007): 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rise of Jewelry District and restoration==
The influx of jewelry stores in the area did not come about until after the 1960s when gold came to be seen as a safer investment than U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;John Caskey, Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor, (New York: Russel Sage, 1996), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this surge, the California Jewelry Mart dominated the local industry with its establishment on S. 607 Hill Street.&lt;ref&gt;St. Vincent Jewelry Center, "District History." Accessed March 14, 2012. [http://www.svjc.com/link2_Link 2]&lt;/ref&gt;  The district became even more popular with the opening of Saint Vincent Jewelry Center, which is still housed in a large 1923 building complex with a European-inspired alley of restaurants. Across the street from St. Vincent’s is the State Theater Building, a twelve-story red brick office building and theater, designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Day in 1921. Right across Loew’s Theatre was another office building which accommodated a drug store in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Knopf, Los Angeles: A History, (New York: Rosebud Books, 1980), 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind Loews, along 7th street, is the Speckels building – an office building turned garment manufacturing center – and the Provident Loan Association, a not-for-profit organization that provided short term loans for gold and jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;USC Libraries, "The Loew's State building, Provident Loan Association, Thrifty Drug Store, Owl Drug Company, New York Millinery, and Ritz Millinery on Seventh Street."

Hill Street is the Jasper building, a 14-story office Italianate building built in 1928, which was converted to accommodate another jewelry manufacturing center.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;M Holding LLC, "Jasper Building."

[http://www.mmholdingllc.com/jasper.htm/link4_Link 4]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One particular historic site in process of restoration is [[Clifton's Cafeteria|Clifton’s Cafeteria]] on 648 South Broadway, whose original 1904 façade has been restored after 50 years of a grate-like, modern aluminum covering. This 1963 remodeling effort was an attempt to compete with the newer restaurants in the city suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, "Clifton's Cafeteria reveals original facade, hidden for fifty years," Los Angeles Times, 2, no. 12 (2012)[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0209-clifton-facade-20120209,0,5192237.story/link5_Link 5]&lt;/ref&gt;   It was once home to Boos Brothers Cafeteria until Clifton purchased the lease in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Conservancy, "Clifton's Cafeteria reveals original facade, hidden for 50 years." Accessed March 14, 2012.[http://laconservancy.org/issues/issues_cliftons.php/link6_Link 6] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709145557/http://laconservancy.org/issues/issues_cliftons.php/link6_Link |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The Los Angeles Jewelry District can be accessed by public transportation through the [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] to [[Pershing Square (LACMTA Station)|Pershing Square]] station. The district is southeast of the square.

The '''Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration''' was a report by [[Richard Lambert]] published by [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2003, which made "a series of recommendations aimed at smoothing out the path between Britain’s strong science base and the [[business]] community" [HM Treasury 2003a]. The Lambeth Review concluded that the British dual support system acts as a disincentive to business-[[university]] collaboration [HM Treasury 2003, p5] and that the biggest single challenge for [[knowledge transfer]] is in boosting the demand for research from non-academic communities, rather in increasing the supply of ideas and services from universities [p10].

The Treasury advised that:

* the best form of knowledge transfer comes when a talented researcher moves out of the university and into business, or vice versa. [p12]
* the most exciting collaborations arise as a result of like-minded people getting together – sometimes by chance – to address a problem. [p12]
* encouraging academics and business people to spend more time together should be a high priority for knowledge transfer professionals. [p12]
* the [[innovation]] process is non-linear, so knowledge transfer is not simply a question of channeling clever ideas from [[researcher]]s down a [[production line]] into [[commercialisation]]. "Great ideas emerge out of all kinds of [[feedback]] loops, [[wikt:development|development]] activities and sheer chance. This is another reason why it is so critical to build dynamic networks between academic researchers and their business counterparts." [p12]
* diversity is good, both in mission and in funding. "The type of business collaboration that would make sense for one kind of university might be either impossible or irrelevant for another." [p13]
* proximity matters when it comes to business collaboration. [p13]
* "business-university collaborations need careful and consistent [[management]] by both sides, and a number of joint programmes have failed for lack of such attention". [p13]
* an emphasis on knowledge transfer requires institutions to put in place new mechanisms for establishing institutional priorities. [p13]
* universities are more complex to manage than businesses, with a variety of different [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] – academics, students, and funders. [p13]
* that the large number of pots of ring-fenced financing is 'the source of endless unnecessary frustration'. [p13]

'''Marc Matthew Harris''' (born c. 1965) is a Panamanian accountant who was formerly active in the field of offshore financial services. At one time he claimed that his firm, The Harris Organisation, had funds under management of $1 billion and $35 million in capital but the organization collapsed after being exposed as fraudulent in ''OffshoreAlert'' in 1998. In 2004, Harris was convicted in the United States on charges of [[money laundering]] and [[tax evasion]].

==Early life and career==
Harris was born around 1965.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; His father was Baum Harris{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and his mother was Marianna Adler.&lt;ref name=boca/&gt; He graduated from [[North Carolina Wesleyan College]] aged 18 and received an MBA from [[Columbia University]] in 1985. He qualified as a [[certified public accountant]] in the United States but quickly left the Florida firm he joined. He started his own firm in Miami with a $5,000 advance on his credit card in December 1985 but his license was suspended by the Florida authorities in December 1990 for various "violations".&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1998-05-31/marc-harris-tax-haven-whiz-or-rogue-banker "Marc Harris: Tax Haven Whiz Or Rogue Banker?"] ''Businessweek Archives'' at [[Bloomberg Business]]. Originally published 31 May 1998. Retrieved 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Jerome Schneider]], Harris set up banks in Montserrat that included, among others, the Allied Reserve Bank, Fidelity Overseas Bank, and First City Bank, but these were all closed down by the Montserrat authorities around 1988.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;&lt;ref name=quat&gt;[http://www.quatloos.com/mho-judg.pdf Harris v. Marchant, Final Judgement, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Miami Division. 10 August 1999.] Quatloos! Retrieved 8 April 2015. [https://www.webcitation.org/6Xe4a8Fl0?url=http://www.quatloos.com/mho-judg.pdf Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panama==
In 1989 or 1990, Harris left the United States as a result of what he called U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] "persecution". He settled in Panama, renounced his U.S. citizenship, and became a Panamanian citizen. In order to operate in the [[offshore trust]] market, Harris bought the Trust Services firm from Robin Bailey and Derek Sambrook in 1995 but the two bought the firm back after becoming disillusioned with Harris's business practices.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

He traded as The Harris Organisation and marketed his services online through the marc-harris.com&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030208042713/http://www.marc-harris.com/ marc-harris.com] Internet Archive, 8 February 2003.

The firm used a Panama postal address but was incorporated in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. In 1998, Harris claimed that his firm had funds under management of $1 billion and $35 million in capital.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

In March 1998, Jim Bennett, an offshore asset protection attorney, asked [[David Marchant (journalist)|David Marchant]], editor of the ''OffshoreAlert'' newsletter, to investigate Harris. Bennett had seen Harris speak in London at the Shorex offshore finance conference in London in 1997. Harris had already come to the attention of financial regulators in various countries by the time that Marchant published his findings in ''OffshoreAlert'' in March 1998 but Marchant's report was the first to show a complete picture of Harris's operation. Among other things, Marchant accused The Harris Organisation of being an insolvent [[Ponzi scheme]]. In April that year Harris responded by filing a $30 million libel claim against Marchant&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; which Harris lost.&lt;ref name=quat/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; In 2000, he also lost his appeal against the original ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060423163946/http://www.quatloos.com/groups/m-harris.htm EXHIBIT: Marc Harris, Anatomy of an Offshore Service Provider Gone Bad.] Quatloos! 23 April 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">In economics, the '''marginal product of labor''' ('''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in output that results from employing an added unit of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin  | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ  | page = 108 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian? Leland B. Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

'''Maximilian Leopold Löblich''' (born 16 November 1901 in [[Vienna]]; died 1 March 1984) was an [[Austria]]n entrepreneur, [[coppersmith]], engineer and president of [[Löblich &amp; Co.]], the oldest heating manufacturer in Austria.

== Life ==

Max Loeblich, son of the director of the Vienna Local Railway Company (''[[Wiener Lokalbahnen]]''), went to boarding-school in [[Horn, Austria|Horn]], [[Lower Austria]], then finished the poly-technicum in Vienna and became a coppersmith master there. From 1924 to 1927 he worked as a technical designer in a German manufacturing company, before becoming responsible for product design and engineering at Loeblich &amp; Co.

In 1935 he took over the management of the Leopold Loeblich Metal Works from his uncle Leopold Löblich, together with his brother, the engineer Franz Loeblich. The Federal Union of Coppersmiths became under [[Nazi]] rule  (1938–1945) part of a German craftsmanship representation, in which Loeblich (despite not being a member of the [[Nazi Party]]), was elected chairman, representing the coppersmiths. After the death of his brother in the last days of World War II, he continued the business on his own.

As engineer and designer of new types of heating boilers (Rohleder-system welded smoke-pipe boilers with atmospheric burners (Polidoro, Italy), and Brahma-system electro-mechanical gas valves) he managed to expand the business among the leading producers in Europe and was the leader in Austria's market for gas heaters in the 1950s. In due course, gas became the most popular form of energy for household heating in Austria and many countries in Europe.

Among Loeblich's customers were Austria's federal presidents [[Adolf Schärf]], [[Franz Jonas]], [[Kurt Waldheim]], and [[Thomas Klestil]], and Hungarian president [[János Kádár]], prime minister [[Bruno Kreisky]], and vice-chancellor [[Alois Mock]]. Loeblich obtained many public awards during this period.

A few years before his death in 1984 he passed over the management of the company to his son Max Wolfgang Loeblich (b. 1931) and his nephew, engineer Adolf Loeblich (b. 1938), who continued the business and started many international cooperations, distribution and service agreements in the fields of heating and catering systems.

== Family==

Married to Elisabeth Goetz (1899–1987), Loeblich was the father of three children: Maria, Konstanze, and Max. Loeblich died in 1984 and is buried in Weidling near Vienna in the family grave, the first work of architect Robert Oerley.

His contribution to technological improvement in paper production and in the use of [[dissolved air flotation]] is so much eminent that the equipment itself is often named Krofta itself.

==Life and career==

Born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] on July 23, 1912, he studied mechanical engineering in both Ljubljana and [[Prague]]; after some years managing paper mills in Slovenia, he moved to [[Milan]], Italy in 1945 due to the political situation in his homeland. He started successfully operating as an engineering consultant and then moved to USA, where he moved in 1951; after the set up of Krofta Engineering Corporation, Dr. Krofta began to design and manufacture equipment for his customers. His improvements in hydraulic design resulted in major improvements in DAF technology performances in water clarification, both for the [[paper]] industry and different applications, with lower chemicals and energy consumption; the high efficiency of equipment like the Krofta Supercell allowed for high rate of pulp recovery and reuse of process water, reaching the goal of zero discharge for a water demanding industry. Milos Krofta started several branches in the world and founded the Lenox Institute for Water Technology, a non-profit educational and research unit based in [[Lenox, MA]]; Krofta companies, his patents and legacy are now part of Krofta  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krofta.com|title=Krofta Company Website|last=Krofta, MA, USA|first=|date=|website=Krofta.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movielink''' was a [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[video on demand]] (VOD) and [[electronic sell-through]] (EST) service offering movies, TV shows and other videos for rental or purchase. Movielink drew its content offerings from the libraries of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], [[Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group|Buena Vista Pictures]] (including [[Miramax Films|Miramax]]), [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Koch Entertainment]] and others on a non-exclusive basis.  While it was only available to users in the United States, it was the first company in the world to offer legally downloadable movies from major studios.

In general, movies obtained through Movielink could only be viewed on the computer or a TV connected to the computer that the movie was purchased from.  However, consumer electronics devices such as the [[Xbox 360]] game console also allowed users to more easily view these digital media on a traditional TV screen.&lt;ref name="PC to TV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |title=Movielink FAQ: How do I connect my PC to my TV? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812033259/http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Movielink had deals with certain set top box companies to offer its movies downloaded directly to people's TV's (including AT&amp;T's Homezone product).&lt;ref name="Homezone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |title=Movielink - Watch Movielink on Your TV! |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030356/http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |archivedate=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation with other [[business model]]s was underway, including a feature which allowed users to purchase, download, and burn a DVD of a selected film.

==History==
Movielink was launched on November 11, 2002. Movielink used [[digital rights management]] software from [[Microsoft]] and [[RealNetworks]] to protect their content.  Consequently, compatibility was limited to [[Wintel|Intel-based computers]] running [[Microsoft Windows 2000]], [[Microsoft Windows XP|XP]],or [[Microsoft Windows Vista|Vista]] and [[Windows Media Player]] version 9 or later.&lt;ref name="Sys Req"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |title=Movielink FAQ: What are the system requirements? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016101903/http://movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They offered daily weekday specials for under 99 cents, and certain films for half price every week.

On June 1, 2006, it was revealed that Movielink's initial investors—a joint venture of Paramount, Sony, MGM, Universal, and Warner Bros—were looking to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Bloomberg Business |work=Bloomberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625083655/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came shortly after numerous studios announced their intent to work with a range of potential Movielink competitors, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[Apple Computer]], [[BitTorrent Inc.]], [[Jaman]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]].

On August 8, 2007, Blockbuster purchased Movielink.  According to the 8-K filing by Blockbuster, the total purchase price was $6.6 million. The deal included content agreements thus giving Blockbuster access to one of the largest libraries of downloadable movies.  With the acquisition of Movielink, Blockbuster was positioned for media content delivery in [[brick and mortar]] rentals, [[DVD-by-mail]], and online delivery of movies.&lt;ref name="Blockbuster acquisition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070809/mvw073.html?.v=1|title=Press Release: MultiVu Video Feed: Blockbuster Inc. Acquires Movielink, LLC|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=Yahoo! Finance|year=2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2008, the Movielink website was shut down. The site was re-directed to the [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] [[home page]]. Customers were notified 30 days in advance that all movies rented or purchased prior to the shutdown date must be downloaded by no later than 12/15/08 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time.

The first NEA investment fund had only $16 million of capital. The firm's second fund raised $45 million and the third fund collected $125 million of commitments from investors in 1984. The firm continued to grow steadily throughout the 1980s and early 1990s raising $900 million from 1987 through 1996 across NEA's next four funds.&lt;ref name=vcstories /&gt; Beginning with NEA-8 in 1998, the firm greatly increased the size of its investment funds. NEA's tenth fund had $2.3 billion of investor commitments in 2000. After raising a more modest $1.1 billion in 2004 for the firm's eleventh fund, NEA was able to raise $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for its next two funds, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2006/07/24/story14.html?from_rss=1 New Enterprise Associates closes new $2.5 billion fund].

In [[corporate law]] in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, an '''oppression remedy''' is a statutory right available to [[oppressed shareholder]]s. It empowers the shareholders to bring an action against the corporation in which they own shares when the conduct of the company has an effect that is oppressive, unfairly prejudicial, or unfairly disregards the interests of a shareholder. It was introduced in response to ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'', which had held that where a company's actions were ratified by a majority of the shareholders, the courts will not generally interfere.

It has been widely copied in companies legislation throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including:

==Introduction in the United Kingdom==
{{see also|Unfair prejudice in United Kingdom company law}}
An oppression remedy, intended to operate as an alternative to [[winding up]] a company, was adopted as s. 210 of the ''[[Companies Act 1948]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Now {{cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/30|title = Part 30}} of the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which declared:

{{quotation|
'''210'''. (1) Any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to some part of the members (including himself) or, in a case falling within [s. 169(3)], the [[Board of Trade]], may make an application to the court by petition for an order under this section.

:(2) If on any such petition the court is of opinion{{emdash}}
::(a) that the company's affairs are being conducted as aforesaid; and
::(b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice that part of the members, but otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding-up order on the ground that it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up;
:the court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of, make such order as it thinks fit, whether for regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future, or for the purchase of the shares of any members of the company by other members of the company or by the company and, in the case of a purchase by the company, for the reduction accordingly of the company's capital, or otherwise.
}}

In the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]'', the relevant provision is expressed in s. 994 (and the Secretary of State has similar authority under s. 995):

{{quotation|
'''994'''. (1) A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground{{emdash}}

:(a) that the company's affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself), or
:(b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
}}

Conduct that is considered to constitute "unfair prejudice" has been given a broad interpretation, which can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Anthony Lee|title = Guide to Unfair Prejudice Against Shareholders|url = http://www.ashfords.co.uk/news/shareholders_disputes_guide|publisher = Ashfords|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-3}}|date = {{date|2012-11-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* exclusion from management in circumstances where there is a legitimate expectation of participation;
:* the diversion of business to another company in which the majority shareholder holds an interest;
:* the awarding by the majority shareholder to himself of excessive financial benefits; and
:* abuses of power and breaches of the Articles of Association.

The conduct is not confined to a specific group. In ''Re HR Harmer Ltd'', [[Jenkins LJ]] noted that the definition is "wide enough to cover oppression by anyone who is taking part in the conduct of the affairs of the company whether ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[1959] 1 WLR 62 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can cover the actions of:

:* directors,
:* a controlling shareholder,
:* persons with ''de facto'' control of the company,
:* a class of shareholders, or
:* conduct of a related company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Roman Tomasic|author2= Stephen Bottomley|author3 = Rob McQueen|edition = 2nd|title= Corporations Law in Australia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zFSgs52KSmoC&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;ots=x0ymO3P5oX&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Federation Press]]|location= Annandale, NSW|isbn= 1-86287-314-3|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Canada==
{{see also|Oppression remedy in Canadian corporate law}}
Provisions similar to s. 210 of the 1948 UK Act were first introduced into Canadian law through the 1975 passage of the ''[[Canada Business Corporations Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1974-76|chapter = 33|section=234|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl197476v01cana#page/886/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated recommendations made in 1962 by the UK [[Jenkins Committee on Company Law]] for removing the linkage of the remedy with that of [[winding-up]] and for broadening its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-I-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= I|at= par. 485-486, at pp. 162-164}}; 1971 draft s. 19.04 shown at {{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-II-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= II|pages=175-177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian legislation (both federally and in all provinces other than [[Prince Edward Island]]) provides for a broad approach to the oppression remedy ({{lang-fr|recours en oppression}}). In ''[[Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] noted:

{{quotation|
48. ...The oppression remedy of s. 241(2)(c) of the ''CBCA'' and the similar provisions of provincial legislation regarding corporations grant the broadest rights to creditors of any common law jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = D. Thomson|title = Directors, Creditors and Insolvency:  A Fiduciary Duty or a Duty Not to Oppress?|url = http://utflr.law.utoronto.ca/sites/utflr.law.utoronto.ca/files/media/UTLFR/utflr58/06_58UTorontoFacLRev31%282000%29.pdf|year = 2000|volume = 58|journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review|issue =  1|pages = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One commentator describes the oppression remedy as “the broadest, most comprehensive and most open-ended shareholder remedy in the common law world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Beck|first = Stanley M.|chapter = Minority Shareholders’ Rights in the 1980s|title = Corporate Law in the 80s, Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada|location = Don Mills|publisher = Richard De Boo|year = 1982|page = 312|isbn = 0-88820110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A "complainant" is deemed to be a current or former registered security holder, a current or former director or officer, the Director appointed under the ''CBCA'', or "any other person who, in the discretion of a court, is a proper person to make an application under this Part."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-44|section =238|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/section-238.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, it can include a creditor of the corporation (but not every creditor will qualify),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Frank Roberts|title = Creditor's use of the oppression remedy|url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=30298&amp;custom_att_2=direct|publisher = [[McGill University]]|year = 2000|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a trustee appointed under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' or a monitor appointed under the ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ernst &amp; Young Inc v Essar Global Fund Ltd et al|link=|year=2017|court=onsc|num=1366|format=|pinpoint=par. 36-37|parallelcite=|date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the United Kingdom, oppressive conduct is not restricted to that committed by corporations. In the case of corporate directors, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 held that they can be held personally liable for such conduct, but only where:

#the oppression remedy request is a fair way of dealing with the situation;
#any order made under s. 241(3) should go no further than necessary to rectify the oppression; and
#any such order may serve only to vindicate the reasonable expectations of security holders, creditors, directors or officers in their capacity as corporate stakeholders; but
#director liability cannot be a surrogate for other forms of statutory or common law relief, particularly where such other relief may be more fitting in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2017/supreme-court-clarifies-test-for-personal-liabilit|title= Supreme Court clarifies test for personal liability of directors for oppressive conduct|last1= O'Brien|first1= Kevin|last2= Carson|first2= Robert|last3= Malik|first3= Waleed|date= July 13, 2017|website= |publisher= [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Wilson v Alharayeri|link=Wilson v Alharayeri|year=2017|court=scc|num=39|pinpoint=par. 47-55|parallelcite=|date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications to the Court have been successful where:{{sfn|Ben-Ishai|Puri|2004|p=89}}

#there was lack of a valid corporate purpose for the transaction;
#the corporate and its controlling shareholders failed to take reasonable steps to simulate an [[arm's length]] transaction;
#there was lack of good faith on the part of the corporation's directors;
#there was discrimination among shareholders which benefited the majority to the exclusion of the minority;
#there was a lack of adequate and appropriate disclosure of material information to minority shareholders; and
#there was a plan to eliminate a minority shareholder.

The court's discretion is not unlimited, as the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (Court of Appeal)|Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador]] observed in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Pelley v. Pelley|link=|year=2003|court=nlca|num=6|format=|pinpoint=par. 37|parallelcite=221 Nfld &amp; PEIR 1  |date=2003-01-22|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The result of the exercise of the discretion contained in subsection 371(3)&lt;ref&gt;of ''NLCA'', equivalent to ''CBCA'', s. 241(3)&lt;/ref&gt; must be the rectification of the oppressive conduct.  If it has some other result the remedy would be one which is not authorized by law.
:* Any rectification of a matter complained of can only be made with respect to the person’s interest as a shareholder, creditor, director or officer.
:* Persons who are shareholders, officers and directors of companies may have other personal interests which are intimately connected to a transaction.  However, it is only their interests as shareholder, officer or director as such which are protected by section 371 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''NLCA''&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of that section cannot be used to protect or to advance directly or indirectly their other personal interests.
:* The law is clear that when determining whether there has been oppression of a minority shareholder, the court must determine what the reasonable expectations of that person were according to the arrangements which existed between the principals.
:* They must be expectations which could be said to have been, or ought to have been, considered as part of the compact of the shareholders.
:* The determination of reasonable expectations will also[...] have an important bearing upon the decision as to what is a just remedy in a particular case.
:* The remedy must not be unjust to the others involved.

Oppression claims are separate from [[derivative action]]s, but the two are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = T. Mark Pontin|author2 = Tracey M. Cohen|author3 = Graeme Cooper|title = Distinguishing Oppression Claims and Derivative Actions|url = http://www.fasken.com/files/Publication/9f6e9808-d5d0-4c18-bf65-0c3b0f128332/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/8cf188a6-678d-4107-993d-1ffa93f80f24/53611_2_CohenPontin.pdf|publisher = [[Fasken Martineau]]|date = June 2011|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a derivative action claim can only be instituted by [[appeal|leave of the court]], as it is brought by a complainant to sue on behalf of the corporation for a wrong done to the corporation, and any successful claim is binding on all shareholders. This is in contrast to the oppression remedy claim, where a complainant sues on behalf of himself for a wrong he suffers personally as a result of corporate conduct.&lt;ref name="Koshal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianappeals.com/2015/06/10/pick-your-poison-the-court-of-appeal-clarifies-the-distinction-between-the-oppression-remedy-and-the-derivative-action/|title= Pick Your Poison: the Court of Appeal Clarifies the Distinction between the Oppression Remedy and the Derivative Action|last1= Koshal|first1= Anu|date= June 10, 2015 |publisher= [[McCarthy Tétrault]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Rea v Wildeboer|link=|year=2015|court=onca|num=373|parallelcite=126 OR (3d) 178|date=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Australia==

S. 234 of the ''[[Corporations Act 2001]]'' provides that the following can apply for an order seeking relief for oppressive conduct:

:* a member of the company, on behalf of himself or another member,
:* a person who has been removed from the register of members, or has ceased to be a member under circumstances which are the substance of the application,
:* a person to whom a share in the company has been transmitted by will or by operation of law, or
:* any other person, with the consent of the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]], in connection to a current or prior investigation into the company conducted by ASIC.

S. 232 states that the conduct of the company's affairs, an actual or proposed act or omission by or on behalf of a company, or a resolution or proposed resolution by all, or by a class, of the shareholders, must be:

:* contrary to the interests of the shareholders as a whole; or
:* oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a shareholder or shareholders whether in that capacity or in any other capacity,

in order for an application to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statutory Oppression Remedy under the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth)|url = http://www.ahernslawyers.com.au/newsletter.asp?ID=8774|publisher = Aherns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppression remedy, together with the option available for winding up a company and ASIC's use of the public interest ground in that regard, has received greater exposure and legal development since the onset of the [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Oppression and winding up remedies after the GFC|url = |author1 = Michael Legg|author2 = Louisa Travers|journal = [[Company and Securities Law Journal]]|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 101{{en dash}}114|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilienthal is one of two sons born to Emmy Lou (née Asch) and Howard Lilienthal, an attorney.&lt;ref name=NYTHoward&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title=Howard Lilienthal |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 23, 1974 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/23/archives/howard-lilienthal.html  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one brother, Robert Lilienthal.&lt;ref name=NYTHoward /&gt; A graduate of [[Amherst College]] in 1962, Lilienthal attended law school at the [[University of Virginia]], receiving his J.D. in 1965.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/09/06/archives/lynn-langman-becomes-bride-of-law-student-alumna-of-new-school-and.html |title=Lynn Langman Becomes Bride Of Law Student; Alumna of New School and Philip Lilienthal Are Married Here |date=6 September 1963 |author=Turl-Larkin |publisher=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation Lilienthal joined the [[Peace Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=24 January 2005 |first=John |last=Donnelly |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/01/24/his_summer_camps_provide_fun_games_and_lessons_about_life_and_the_epidemic/ |title=His summer camps provide fun, games, and lessons about life and the epidemic |publisher=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt; and established Camp Langano, Ethiopia's first sleepaway summer camp. It served primarily inner city youths from [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=19 December 1966 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C14FD395F137A93CBA81789D95F428685F9 |title=Bedridden youth contributes $200 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Lilienthal's Peace Corps service ended and he handed over control of Camp Langano to the [[YMCA]], which ran it continuously until the overthrow of Ethiopian leader [[Haile Selassie I]] in 1974.

==Camp Winnebago==

In 1974, following the unexpected death of his father Howard, Lilienthal assumed his father's position as the director of [http://www.campwinnebago.com/ Camp Winnebago], one of Maine's most prestigious and venerable boys' summer camps.  The institution, above all, instills in its campers the practice of virtuous behavior and upright character and has even coined for itself a term to describe these qualities, "Winnebagan".

Lilienthal's tenure as camp director was marked by a number of achievements, including an increase in the number of international campers and counselors, the creation and expansion of a scholarship program for underprivileged youths, and the construction of a great number of new facilities, including new tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, volleyball and basketball courts, a hockey rink, a ropes course and a historically valuable museum on the premises. He served in the position until his retirement in 2003, when he passed control of the camp to his elder son, Andrew.

== Global Camps Africa ==

After his retirement from Winnebago, Lilienthal established Global Camps Africa, originally, [[WorldCamps]]—an organization dedicated to helping [[AIDS]]-affected youths throughout Africa. [[Camp Sizanani]], Lilienthal's first foray with Global Camps Africa, formed in partnership with South African NGO, HIVSA, has been a major success, creating a vital support network for some of South Africa's neediest children. Lilienthal continues to work tirelessly for AIDS-affected children throughout all of Africa. In June 2013, Lilienthal was awarded the prestigious Sargent Shriver Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service by the Peace Corps.

==Personal life==
In 1963, he married Lynn Langman,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; granddaughter of investment banker [[Maurice Wertheim]] and Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, the daughter of [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]]

[[File:Plastisol1.JPG|thumb|Plastisol]]
'''Plastisol''' is a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or other [[polymer]] particles in a liquid [[plasticizer]]; it flows as a liquid and can be poured into a heated mold.  When heated to around 177 degrees Celsius, the plastic particles dissolve and the mixture turns into a [[gel]] of high [[viscosity]] that usually cannot be poured anymore. On cooling below 60 degrees C, a flexible, permanently plasticized solid product results.&lt;ref name="Schey"&gt;Schey, J.A. "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes", ''The McGraw-Hill Companies'' (3rd Edition, 2000). Page 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from molding, plastisol is commonly used as a textile ink for [[screen-printing]] and as a coating, particularly in outdoor applications (roofs, furniture) and [[dip-coating]].

==Production==
[[File:Turbosphere.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Pilot turbosphere (200 liters) equipped with water cooling system to produce plastisols.]]
{{empty section|date=June 2012}}

==Uses==

===Textile ink===
Plastisol is used as [[ink]] for [[screen-printing]] on to [[textile]]s. Plastisols are the most commonly used inks for printing designs on to garments, and are particularly useful for printing opaque graphics on dark fabrics.

Plastisol inks are not water-soluble. The ink is composed of [[PVC]] particles suspended in a [[wikt:plasticizing|plasticizing]] [[emulsion]], and will not dry if left in the screen for extended periods. Garments don't need to be washed after printing. Plastisol inks are recommended for printing on colored fabric. On lighter fabric, plastisol is extremely opaque and can retain a bright image for many years with proper care.

Plastisol inks will not dry, but must be cured. Curing can be done with a flash dryer, or any oven. Most plastisols need to reach a temperature of about 180 degrees Celsius (350 Fahrenheit) for full curing. Plastisol tends to sit atop the fabric instead of soaking into the fibres, giving the print a raised, plasticized texture. Other inks can produce a softer feel.

===Slush molding===
Plastisol is used for ''slush molding'' or ''slush casting'', a form of [[spin casting]] that is more complex than simple [[resin casting]], but less expensive and less sophisticated than the [[injection molding]] used for most plastic products. It involves metal molds that are filled with liquid plastisol. When the open mold cavities are filled, the mold is spun on a high speed centrifuge to force the liquid vinyl into the fine details on the interior of the mold. Then the metal mold is placed into a heating solution, usually an industrial salt heated to about {{convert|204|°C|-1}}. The liquid vinyl cooks for a few seconds. The mold is then removed from the heating solution and the remaining liquid is poured out. This leaves a thin skin of vinyl on the interior of the metal mold. The mold is then placed back into the heating solution for three to four minutes to cure. After curing, the mold is again removed from the heating solution, cooled with water, and placed on a rack. While the vinyl part is still warm in the mold, it is very flexible and can be removed from the mold with pliers. When the parts cool, they become rigid and are ready for assembly.

The metal molds can produce an unlimited number of castings. Unlike the flexible molds used for resin casting, metal molds are not adversely affected by heat. The metal molds allow grouping of several parts in one mold cavity and several mold cavities in one mold for faster production.

===Solid rocket boosters===
Plastisol process is used to bind polymer with [[Metal|metallic]] or [[metalloid]] agent and a liquid [[oxidizer]], creating [[Solid-propellant_rocket#Electric_solid_propellants|Electric Solid Propellant]]. This substance can be ignited and extinguished by electric impulse, providing pulsed rocket propulsion. With achievable pulse frequency reaching 60Hz (60 ignition/extinguishing cycles per second), thrust of such boosters can be finely controlled; combined with possible minuscule dimensions, safety and low complexity it makes them usable as [[Reaction Control System|RCS]] thrusters of [[Miniaturized_satellite#Nanosatellites|nanosatellites]] like the [[CubeSat]]. &lt;ref&gt; W. Sawka, M. McPherson [http://dsspropulsion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ESP_Safe_Micro_To_Macro-Website.pdf "Electrical Solid Propellants: A Safe, Micro to Macro Propulsion Technology"] 49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference July 14 - 17, 2013, San Jose, CA. Retrieved on 1 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer clay===
Uncured plastisol is used as [[polymer clay]] (''"[[Fimo]]"''), a variety of [[modelling clay]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">'''Raja Mudaliar''' or sometimes spelt '''Raja Mendeliar''' was the richest trader in [[Malacca]] during the early 16th century [[Common Era|CE]]. He belonged to the [[Chitty]] community.

According to [[Sejarah Melayu]], Raja Mudaliar was the Syahbandar (Chief of Port) of Malacca. He was portrayed as a treacherous person who was responsible for concocting false accusation to sow distrust between [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]] and his [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Mutahir of Malacca|Tun Mutahir]], resulting in the execution of Tun Mutahir and his whole family. As a result, the Sultan was antagonized and the palace split into factions, this disunity made Malacca vulnerable to the invading Portuguese.

The '''Renaissance Center''' (also known as the '''GM Renaissance Center''' and nicknamed the '''RenCen''') is a group of seven interconnected [[List of tallest buildings in Detroit|skyscrapers]] in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]].  Located on the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]], the Renaissance Center complex is owned by [[General Motors]] as its world headquarters. The central tower, the '''Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center''', is the third [[List of tallest hotels in the world|tallest all-hotel skyscraper]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=tallesthotel&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/ty/ho/ Official World's 100 Tallest High Rise Buildings (Hotel Use)]. ''Emporis.com''. Retrieved on May 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been the [[List of tallest buildings in Michigan|tallest building]] in [[Michigan]] since it was erected in 1977.

[[John Portman]] was the principal architect for the original design.  The first phase consisted of a five tower [[rosette (design)|rosette]] rising from a common base. Four 39-story office towers surround the 73-story hotel rising from a square-shaped podium which includes a [[shopping center]], restaurants, [[brokerage firms]], and banks.&lt;ref name=DetroitAIA1980/&gt;&lt;ref name=DetArch/&gt;  The first phase officially opened in March 1977.

Conceived by [[Henry Ford II]] and financed primarily by the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Renaissance Center became the world's largest private development with an anticipated 1971 cost of $500 million.&lt;ref name=RenCen&gt;Detroit News Staff (September 29, 2001).

In 1970, Ford Motor Company Chairman Henry Ford II teamed up with other business leaders to form Detroit Renaissance, a private non-profit development organization, which he headed in order to stimulate building activity in the city.  The group announced the first phase of construction in 1971.  In addition, Detroit Renaissance contributed to a variety of other projects within the downtown area in the ensuing decades.  Henry Ford II sold the concept of the RenCen to the City and community leaders. Detroit [[Mayor]] [[Roman Gribbs]] touted the project as ''a complete rebuilding from bridge to bridge,'' referring to the area between the [[Ambassador Bridge]] that connects Detroit to [[Windsor, Ontario]] and the MacArthur Bridge, which connects the city with [[Belle Isle Park]].&lt;ref name=RenCen/&gt;

The ''city within a city'' arose. The first phase of Renaissance Center opened on July 1, 1976.  Principal architect [[John C. Portman Jr.|John Portman]] was also the architect for the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]] and the [[Peachtree Center]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; the [[Embarcadero Center]] in [[San Francisco, California]]; and the [[Bonaventure Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. For phase I, the facade of the first five towers was covered with {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2|-3|sp=us}} of glass, and used about {{convert|400000|cuyd|m3}} of concrete.&lt;ref name=RenCen/&gt; This did not include the additional glass used for the atriums.&lt;ref name=DetroitAIA1980/&gt;

Phase I of the Renaissance Center cost $337 million to construct, employing 7,000 workers.&lt;ref name=RenCen/&gt; In 1977, the central hotel tower of the Renaissance Center opened as the '''Detroit Plaza Hotel''', managed by [[Westin Hotels|Western International Hotels]],&lt;ref name=RenCen/&gt; to become the world's tallest all-hotel skyscraper&lt;ref name=tallesthotel/&gt; surpassing its architectural twin, the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza|Peachtree Plaza Hotel]] in Atlanta. The hotel was later renamed '''The Westin Hotel Renaissance Center Detroit'''. In 1986, it was surpassed in height by [[Swissôtel The Stamford|The Westin Stamford]] in [[Singapore]]. Since 1986, the Renaissance Center's central tower has held the distinction as the tallest all-hotel skyscraper in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="tallesthotel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rencen1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center| url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=marriottrenaissancecenter-detroit-mi-usa| publisher=Emporis.com| accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other phases that included residences, additional office and retail space were never constructed.

On April 15, 1977, Henry Ford II and Detroit mayor [[Coleman Young]] unveiled a plaque commemorating the private investors whose funds made the project possible and, later that evening, 650 business and society leaders attended a benefit celebrating the Renaissance Center's formal dedication. The money raised from the $300-per-couple tickets went to the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. When it opened, the [[cylindrical]] central tower was originally the [[flagship]] of Westin Hotels. The top three floors of the hotel hosted an upscale restaurant, The Summit, that rotated to allow a 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]] view.&lt;ref name=DetroitAIA1980/&gt;  The shopping center in the podium originally housed high-end boutiques, but now contains a greater complement of restaurants in the retail mix.&lt;ref name=RenCen /&gt;

In 1980, Detroit hosted the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] and presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] and former President [[Gerald Ford]] both stayed at the Renaissance Center while in attendance.&lt;ref name=Porembra&gt;{{cite book| last=Poremba| first=David Lee| title=Detroit in Its World Setting (timeline)| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2001| isbn=0-8143-2870-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Almanac2&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gavrilovich| first1=Peter| first2=Bill| last2=McGraw | title=The Detroit Almanac| edition=2nd| publisher=Detroit Free Press| year=2006| isbn=978-0-937247-48-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "city within a city" concept was duplicated in the metropolitan area with the {{convert|2200000|sqft|m2}} [[Southfield Town Center]] office complex with five inter-connected golden skyscrapers constructed from 1975 to 1989 in the suburb of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]].

In 1987, the elevated [[Detroit People Mover]] transit line began operation with a [[Renaissance Center (Detroit People Mover)|stop at the Renaissance Center]]. Initially, Ford Motor Company occupied a large block of space. In 1996, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] purchased the complex and moved its world headquarters to the Renaissance Center downtown from what is now the historic [[Cadillac Place]] state office complex in the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] district, northwest of downtown.&lt;ref name=NewCenter&gt;[http://www.newcenter.com/ New Center Council]. Retrieved on May 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the acquisition, [[Sibley's Shoes]] had its headquarters in the center.

Architects' initial design for the Renaissance Center focused on creating secure ''interior spaces'', while its design later expanded and improved to connect with the exterior spaces and waterfront through a reconfigured interior, open glass entryways, and a Wintergarden.&lt;ref name=DetArch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1link=John Portman| last1=Portman| first1=John| first2=Jonathan| last2=Barnett| year=1976| title=The Architect as Developer| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=0-07-050536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2004, GM completed an extensive $500 million renovation of the Renaissance Center.&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt; This included a $100 million makeover for the hotel. Among GM's first actions was to remove the concrete berms facing Jefferson Avenue. The renovation includes a lighted glass walkway which encircles the interior mezzanine for ease of navigation, while the addition of the Wintergarden provides riverfront access and a view of Canada. A covered [[skyway]] over Jefferson Avenue connects to the [[Millender Center]], Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown Detroit, and [[Coleman A. Young Municipal Center]].&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt;

The Renaissance Center is owned by General Motors.  The hotel in the central tower is now managed by the [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel chain and is called the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. The 1,298-room hotel is one of the largest operated by Marriott. The rooftop restaurant (which no longer revolves) received a $10 million renovation and is operated by The Epicurean Groups's Coach Insignia (closed in 2017&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180121/news/650721/new-restaurant-planned-for-top-of-rencen|title=New restaurant planned for top of RenCen|date=2018-01-21|work=Crain's Detroit Business|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Renaissance Center's [[modernist]] [[architecture]] balances the city's panoramic waterfront [[skyline]], a frequent feature in photography taken from nearby [[Windsor, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=AIADetroit/&gt; From the top of the Renaissance Center's Coach Insignia restaurant (closed in 2017&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), patrons peer down upon the neogothic spires of [[One Detroit Center]] and city's [[Detroit Financial District|Financial District]] skyscrapers and stadiums.

A pedestrian walkway over Jefferson Avenue connects the complex to the [[Millender Center]] and leads beyond to the [[Coleman A. Young Municipal Center]]. [[Hart Plaza]], [[Cobo Center]] (home to the [[North American International Auto Show]]) and [[Joe Louis Arena]], former home of the [[Detroit Red Wings]], are several blocks to the west.

In December 2001, the General Motors unveiled the ''Wintergarden'' retail atrium. Designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]], it rises {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall at its highest point opening direct access to the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]].

The design is consistent with the themes of [[Brutalist architecture]], especially in the heavy massing of concrete on the lower floors, but the 2001 renovation has softened those features.

===Redevelopment===
[[File:GM Plaza and Promenade.JPG|200px|thumb|GM Plaza and Promenade at the Renaissance Center along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]].]]

The redevelopment project included the work of many different architects including [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[SmithGroup]] of Detroit, Gensler Detroit office, and Ghafari Associates of [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] who did the renovation of the office towers. The majority of the construction operations were led by Turner Construction Company. The structural glass and steel for the Wintergarden, the entrance lobby as well as the mezzanine glass walkway were contributed by Mero. The cost of the renovation does not include the cost for reconfiguring the streets around the Renaissance Center or the cost of the park along the International Riverfront.

The $500 million renovation of the Renaissance Center completed in 2003 has helped improve Detroit's economy.&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt; Together, GM's renovation of the Renaissance Center and the Detroit Riverwalk exceeded $1 billion; the project constituted a substantial investment in downtown. More than 10,000 people (of whom 6,000 are GM employees) work in the complex.&lt;ref name=GMRenCen/&gt; Nearly 2,000 state workers now occupy GM's former office building, the restored [[Cadillac Place]], in the historic [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] district.&lt;ref name=NewCenter/&gt;

The redevelopment provides the ''GM World'' display of vehicles, a restored hotel, a renovated rooftop restaurant, and the addition of GM's corporate logo to crown the top of the building. Construction of the lighted glass walkway facilitates ease of navigation encircling the interior mezzanine.

The Riverfront Promenade was dedicated on December 17, 2004, and helped to usher in a return to recreational uses along Detroit's [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]. GM played a key role in the transformation of the east riverfront with a donation of $135 million to the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy for the development of a world class riverfront promenade planned at $559 million, which included $50 million from the Kresge foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit News Editorial (December 13, 2002).

In 2011, the Renaissance Center added colored LED lighting on the top of its towers (Towers 500 and 600 utilize traditional blue floodlights to illuminate their top floors). General Motors added a large illuminated LED corporate logo which also displays GM divisions. The animated logo and illuminated LED color bands around the towers can be used to support special events and may be seen from [[Comerica Park]], home of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The renovation of [[Cobo Center]] convention and exhibit facility incorporates similar blue neon lighting along riverfront promenade.

}}
'''Rudy Fernando Ulloa Igor''' (born 1 April 1960 in [[Puerto Natales]] [[Chile]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] politician, figurehead, and media entrepreneur who was born in Chile of Chilean parents.

==Early life and education==
Ulloa was born 1 April 1960 in Puerto Natales, Chile, “a small village of fishermen with metal housing painted in primary colors.” When he was a boy, he moved with his mother, Omnia Igor; his brother, Paloma; and his stepfather, José Heriberto Sánchez, to El Carmen, a neighborhood of tin-roofed houses in [[Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz|Río Gallegos]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz, Argentina]]. He attended the AGE School, funded by Sofía Vicic de Cepernic.

==Career==
When he was a young man helped to establish “Los Muchachos Peronistas,” a youth group that spawned many corrupt Argentinians which still exists today. At one rally he turned out "more than 1,000 people" in the "Patagonian cold" . Kirchner became Mayor of Rio Gallegos in 1987 and Governor of Santa Cruz in 1991, and appointed Ulloa to the Technical Secretariat. 

Ulloa began publishing a newspaper called ''El Periódico''. During Kirchner’s third term as governor, Ulloa was in charge of TV channel, Channel 5 Community and Channel 2 Rio Gallegos. 
Ulloa later became president of a multimedia business that included a daily newspaper, an FM radio station, a production company, and a local TV channel.&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web| title =Habló Rudy Ulloa, el ex chofer de Néstor Kirchner: "No me perdonan el éxito"| work =La Nacion| date =May 19, 2013| url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1583496-hablo-rudy-ulloa-el-ex-chofer-de-nestor-kirchner-no-me-perdonan-el-exito}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In May 2013, journalist [[Jorge Lanata]] showed that Ulloa owned a mansion in Rio Gallegos, a fleet of nine high-end cars, and other expensive property.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; In April 2014, Ulloa bought a $2 million farm that included a heated pool, soccer field, and a small theater. According to Clarin, at this point he already owned four houses in Rio Gallegos. In 2009, he had purchased a $700,000 mansion in Lomas de San Isidro, a $150,000 field in San Pedro, and an expensive property in the gated Pilar del Este district. The ''Clarin'' report stated that at least one source of his wealth was the income from the government’s advertising in his media properties, from which he had earned over $22 million during the “Kirchner decade.” Clarin reported that even after it folded, “El Periódico continued to receive government advertising.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Salinas| first =Lucia| title =Rudy Ulloa sumó a su fortuna una chacra de US$ 2 millones| work =Clarin| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Rudy-Ulloa-fortuna-US-millones_0_1123087762.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2013 that Ulloa had collected bribes for Nestor Kirchner from the firm San Isidro, owned by Raul "Cacho" Espinosa, who in return for his "donations" was promised fishing permits by Ulloa.&lt;ref name=sepr&gt;{{cite web| title =LAS VIEJAS CARPETAS: QUIEN ES RUDY ULLOA EL CHOFER DE NESTOR QUE QUISO COMPRAR TELEFE| work =Seprin| date =May 13, 2013| url = http://seprin.info/2013/05/13/las-viejas-carpetas-quien-es-rudy-ulloa-el-chofer-de-nestor-que-quiso-comprar-telefe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space Bucks''' was a space trading simulation developed by [[Impressions Games]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]]. The game focuses on the creation of a trade empire against several computer controlled opponents. Victory is achieved through a combination of infrastructure investments, the stock market, piracy, sabotage, and of course trade goods.

==Plot==
In the year 2375, Humans share the galaxy with four other races, the Colikars, Tesarians, Secanii, and the Krec N'had. Your fledgling trading company, consisting of a single port and a single ship, must, by the year 2500, expand by any means necessary to become the dominant trade empire in the galaxy. Three computer opponents will be pursuing the same goal.

==Gameplay==
There are numerous mechanics for the player to utilize in order to achieve victory.

===Ships===
Ships do the heavy lifting in the game. Without ships, the goods produced at planets can't be transported and the highest level goods can't be manufactured due to a lack of the appropriate resources. At the start of the game only a few ship types are available. As the game progresses new, more advanced ship types become available.

Ships have several stats which determine its suitability for use. Range, Speed, Capacity, Efficiency, Drive, and Maintenance cost.

===Planets===
Planets generate all of the trade goods in the galaxy. These goods range from food, to passengers, to luxury goods. The higher in development a planet is, the more and the greater the variety of goods that are produced. Once the highest levels of development can be reached the most expensive, and thus profitable, goods can be manufactured.

To gain access to a planet, a bid must be made on a planet which does not already have a deal with another trade company. The player must open negotiations with such a planet and if their demands are agreed to, they will ally themselves with the players trade company. The demands include a monthly rent paid by the player, the delivery of a specified good at regular intervals, and an agreement to build a specified piece of infrastructure on the planet within a certain timeframe. The demand for monthly rent is made for every planet, with the other two demands being optional and dependent on the developmental level of the planet.

Planets have morale which can be modified by in-game factors. Investing in planetary infrastructure can often help improve the morale of a planet and ensure docking rights are not lost. Should a planet be lost to an unhappy local populace, the player must begin negotiations for docking rights again. The higher the developmental level of the planet, the more infrastructure will be needed to keep the planet happy.

===Trade Goods===
Trade goods include fuel, food, passengers, and exotic goods such as wine and weapons. Each race produces different high-end goods than it consumes.

===Stock Market===
Each trading company has stock which can be sold on the market for an infusion of cash. Buying out the competition, by accumulating a majority of their stock, is possible. Stock can be bought and sold throughout the game, making it possible to sell lots of stock early for an early boost and then buy it back when the other companies sell off the shares they own.

===Piracy===
Pirates can be hired to harass the competition. They can be paid to harass the player as well. When a pirate attacks there are only a couple of options, pay them off, try to run, or fight back. The correct action to take will depend heavily on the specific ship being threatened and the upgrades that it has been outfitted with.

===Sabotage===
Sabotage missions can be undertaken to hurt the competitions bottom line. Of course the competition can do the same to the player.

===News Events===
A very basic mechanic, News Events inform the player of all the important events such as new ships, engines, or weapon systems which have become available. Sudden changes in the markets may also be announced throughout the game, giving the player the chance to make a quick profit.

==Critical reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' focused on the lack of anything to do in the game besides bid for landing rights and choose cargo: "No cut-throat strategy for undermining the competition's prices, no sabotage of trading routes, no space battles - not even the occasional price war." He recommended that players get "much better" business sims such as ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'' or ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]'' instead, and gave it 1 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Space Bucks |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1996|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Village (Gamer's Zone) wrote "The plot was a little thin for my taste, but if reading the business section of the paper excites you, then this game would be a must for you. The main weakness that I see in this program is lack of originality. I see parts of Railroad Tycoon, Civilization, Sim City among others, as well as the obvious connection to Air bucks v1.2. Nothing wrong with recycling older programs, especially as hardware improvements allow the newer versions to make improvements on game performance. That is what happened with this game. Unfortunately, it has a rushed feeling and fails to capitalize on the improvements there were put in the game."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/spacebuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said "If you love to create ornate moving sculptures that generate endless money but do very little else interesting, then SPACE BUCKS will have some appeal for you. Set at its hardest level, the game offers two or three hours of challenge before your empire grows to the point that nothing can really harm it and you simply sit around absorbing planets from your competitors and doing more and more unwieldy upgrades to your entire fleet. Other than that, it is pretty to look at, but definitely no AIR BUCKS in Space."{{cn|date=April 2017}} ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' wrote "Dealing with manufacturing, the bank and stock market, and random events do add a few things (bowling pins and knives?), but there still aren't a lot of different things to do (as in, say, Sim City or Capitalism). Despite this, you have to watch these things very closely, and it is easy for things to go critical very quickly. At the beginner level I played (and quickly lost) four games before I'd gotten a business that was even barely stable (and I was at the bottom of the pack). Maybe I just don't have a nose for business, but my attention wasn't strongly held. Beginning business sim fans might get more out of Space Bucks than I did, but I suspect advanced gamers will want to stick with a more detailed game like Capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20031103233809/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/005/087/space_bucks_review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Frederic Seagal''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|l}}; born April 10, 1952) is an American actor, film producer, screenwriter, martial artist, and musician. 

Seagal was born in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. A 7th-[[Dan (rank)|dan]] [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[aikido]], he began his adult life as a martial arts instructor in [[Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Steven Seagal Gets a Shot at Stardom |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1988-02-14|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42829_1_steven-seagal|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first foreigner to operate an aikido [[dojo]] in the country.&lt;ref name="British Aikido History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishaikido.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=88|title=British Aikido History - Segal an Aikido Dojo in Japan ?|publisher=British Aikido|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812212652/http://britishaikido.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=88|archive-date=12 August 2011|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he had the same profession. In 1988, Seagal made his acting debut in ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]''. By 1991, he had starred in four successful films. In 1992, he played [[Navy SEAL]] counter-terrorist expert [[Casey Ryback]] in ''[[Under Siege]]''. During the latter half of the 1990s, Seagal starred in three more feature films and the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]]''. Subsequently, his career shifted to mostly direct-to-video productions. He has since appeared in films and reality shows, including ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', which depicted Seagal performing his duties as a reserve deputy sheriff.

Seagal is a guitarist and has released two studio albums (''[[Songs from the Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[Mojo Priest]]''), and performed on the scores of several of his films. He has worked with [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Tony Rebel]], who both performed on his debut album. He has also been involved in a line of "therapeutic oil" products and energy drinks.

In addition, Seagal is known as an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2012/01/steven-seagal-six-things-to-know/ |title=Blogs - Six Things You Didn’t Know About Steven Seagal - AMC |publisher=Blogs.amctv.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[animal rights]] activist, and a supporter of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]].&lt;ref name="NPR 2007-10-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15321257|title=Dalai Lama Draws Strong Reactions on Both Sides|last1=Flintoff|first1=Corey|authorlink1=Corey Flintoff|date=16 October 2007|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogue Italia 2010-04-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/that-s-too-much/2010/04/steven-seagal |title=Steven Seagal - The actor of Under Siege is accused of sexual harrassment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|last1=Cassola|first1=Paola|date=13 April 2010|publisher=[[Vogue Italia]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his outspoken political views and support of [[Vladimir Putin]]. Seagal once referred to Putin as "one of the great living world leaders".&lt;ref name=MT140327/&gt; He was granted Russian citizenship in 2016. In 2018, he was appointed as a special envoy to the [[United States]] to improve ties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Actor Steven Seagal made special US-Russia envoy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45074380 |website=BBC.com |publisher=British Broadcasting Company |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1996 to 2010, multiple women [[#Allegations and lawsuits|have accused]] Seagal of sexual harassment or assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Amy B. |title=Steven Seagal accused of raping an 18-year-old — adding to decades of claims against the actor |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/20/steven-seagal-accused-of-raping-an-18-year-old-adding-to-decades-of-claims-against-the-actor/?utm_term=.a2708bce0bf3 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mancini |first1=Vince |title=A Brief History Of Sexual Assault Allegations Against Steven Seagal |url=https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/a-brief-history-of-steven-seagal-sexual-assault-allegations/ |website=Uproxx.com |publisher=Uproxx Media Group |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Steven Frederic Seagal was born in [[Lansing, Michigan]] on April 10, 1952,&lt;ref name="Official Website Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevenseagal.com/?page_id=26|title=Biography - Steven Seagal Official Website|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of medical technician Patricia (1930–2003) and high-school math teacher Samuel Seagal (1928–1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/44/Steven-Seagal.html |title=Steven Seagal Biography (1952?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], and [[Germans|German]] ancestry, while his paternal grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] who immigrated to the U.S.&lt;ref name="jewish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/scams/steven_seagal/index.html|title=Steven Seagal and the mob|accessdate=2008-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110802134302/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/scams/steven_seagal/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have [[Mongols|Mongol]] heritage.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savetibet.ru/2007/12/17/steven_seagal.html |title=Steven Seagal's Mongolian heritage |publisher=savetibet.ru |date=2009-08-15 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Seagal was five years old, his parents relocated to [[Fullerton, California]]. Patricia told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine that prior to the move, Steven was frail and suffered from asthma, saying, "He was a puny kid back then. But he really thrived after the move [from Michigan]." Seagal attended [[Buena Park High School]] in [[Buena Park, California]], and [[Fullerton College]] between 1970 and 1971. As a teen, Seagal spent much time in his garage listening to loud rock music. However, it was while working with a friendly old Japanese man at a dojo in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] that Seagal was encouraged to visit Japan.&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113675,00.html|title=Sure, He's Making a Box-Office Killing—but Who Is Steven Seagal?|last=Farrell|first=Mary H.J.|date=November 19, 1990|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|accessdate=March 12, 2011|last2=Benet|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Fuhrman|first3=Janice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martial arts ==
Seagal moved to Japan at some point between 1971 and 1973.  By 1974 he had returned to California. That year he met [[Miyako Fujitani]], a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. When Miyako returned to Osaka, Seagal went with her. The following year they married and had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. He taught at the school owned by Miyako's family (though he is often stated to have been the first non-Asian to open a dojo in Japan). As of 1990, Miyako and her brother still taught there, and her mother was the chairwoman.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

Seagal initially returned to [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]], with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], California, but later moved it to the city of [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which the latter ran until the two parted ways in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-entertainment/martial-art-movies/haruo-matsuoka-on-steven-seagal-and-aikido%E2%80%99s-history-in-america/|title=Haruo Matsuoka on Steven Seagal and Aikido’s History in America|last1=Cheng|first1=Mark|authorlink1=Mark Cheng|date=9 June 2011|publisher=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]|accessdate=8 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809145545/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-entertainment/martial-art-movies/haruo-matsuoka-on-steven-seagal-and-aikido%E2%80%99s-history-in-america/|archive-date=9 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebraziltimes.com/story/1659515.html|title=Aikido Institute hosting seminar with renowned martial artist|date=25 August 2010|publisher=Brazil Times|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Mark|authorlink1=Mark Cheng|date=April 2004|title=Thundering AIKIDO: Former Steven Seagal Protégé Haruo Matsuoka Speaks About the Early Days of Aikido in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=106|journal=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]|publisher=Cheryl Angelheart|page=106|issn=0277-3066|oclc=4949089|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seagal helped train [[Brazilian People|Brazilian]] [[Mixed Martial Arts|Mixed Martial Artist]] [[Lyoto Machida]], who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out [[Randy Couture]] at ''[[UFC 129]]'' in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23455/machida-credits-training-changes-seagal-for-ufc-129-win-over-couture.mma|title=Machida credits training changes, Seagal for UFC 129 win over Couture|author=John Morgan|publisher=MMAjunkie|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505080023/http://mmajunkie.com/news/23455/machida-credits-training-changes-seagal-for-ufc-129-win-over-couture.mma|archivedate=2011-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23445/ufc-129-main-card-results-st-pierre-outjabs-shieldss-aldo-retains-in-thrilling-finish.mma|title=UFC 129 main card results: St-Pierre outjabs Shields, Aldo retains in thrilling finish|publisher=MMAjunkie|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504122001/http://mmajunkie.com/news/23445/ufc-129-main-card-results-st-pierre-outjabs-shieldss-aldo-retains-in-thrilling-finish.mma|archivedate=2011-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hollywood career ==
=== 1980s–1990s ===
In 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'' (titled ''Nico'' in Europe), with director [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Steven Seagal Gets a Shot at Stardom |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1988-02-14|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42829_1_steven-seagal/3|accessdate=2010-11-29|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following its success, Seagal's subsequent movies were ''[[Hard to Kill]]'', ''[[Marked for Death]]'', and ''[[Out for Justice]]''; all were box office hits, making him an [[action hero]]. Later, he achieved wider, mainstream success in 1992 with the release of ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992), which reunited Seagal with director Andrew Davis.

Seagal hosted the April 20, 1991 episode of the late night variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which aired as the 18th episode of the 16th season. Cast member [[David Spade]] regarded Seagal as the show's worst host during Spade's time there. Spade and co-star [[Tim Meadows]] cite Seagal's humorlessness, his ill-treatment of the show's cast and writers, and his refusal to do a "[[Hans and Franz]]" sketch because that skit's title characters stated that they could beat up Seagal. Seagal was never invited back to the show following that episode.&lt;ref&gt;Venable, Nick (October 29, 2015).

When Cage worried that he would do so poorly that the audience would regard him as "the biggest jerk who's ever been on the show", Michaels replied, "No, no. That would be Steven Seagal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://snltranscripts.jt.org/92/92amono.phtml "Season 18: Episode 1"]. Saturday Night Live Transcripts. Retrieved October 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seagal directed and starred in ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' (1994), featuring [[Michael Caine]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in minor supporting roles. The film emphasized environmental and spiritual themes, signaling a break with his previous persona as a genre-ready inner-city cop. ''On Deadly Ground'' was poorly received by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_deadly_ground/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially denouncing Seagal's long environmental speech in the film. Regardless, Seagal considers it one of the most important and relevant moments in his career. Seagal followed this with a sequel to one of his most successful films, ''Under Siege'', titled ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' (1995). In 1996, he had a role in the [[Kurt Russell]] film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', portraying a special ops soldier who only appears in the film's first 45 minutes. The same year, he filmed a cop drama ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'' (1996). In another environmentally conscious and commercially unsuccessful film, ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1997), he played an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] agent fighting industrialists dumping toxic waste in the [[Kentucky]] hills. This film ended his original multi-picture contract with [[Warner Bros.]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Direct-to-video work ===
In 1998, Seagal made ''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]]'', another environmental thriller which was his first [[direct to video|direct-to-video]] release in the United States (though it was released theatrically in most of the world). Seagal produced this film with his own money, and the film was shot on-location on and near his farm in [[Montana]].

After producing ''[[Prince of Central Park (2000 film)|Prince of Central Park]]'', Seagal returned to cinema screens with the release of ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' in March 2001. The film had fewer martial arts scenes than Seagal's previous films, but it was a commercial success, taking almost $80 million worldwide. However, he was unable to capitalize on this success and his next two projects were both critical and commercial failures. The movie ''[[Ticker (2001 film)|Ticker]]'', co-starring [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], was filmed in San Francisco before ''Exit Wounds'', and went straight to DVD. ''[[Half Past Dead]]'', starring [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] star [[Ja Rule]], made less than $20 million worldwide.

Other than his role as a villain in [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s [[Machete (2010 film)|''Machete'']], all of the films Seagal has made since the latter half of 2001 have been released direct-to-video (DTV) in North America, with some theatrical releases to other countries around the world. Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include ''[[Black Dawn (film)|Black Dawn]]'', ''[[Belly of the Beast]]'', ''[[Out of Reach (film)|Out of Reach]]'', ''[[Submerged (2005 film)|Submerged]]'', ''[[Kill Switch (2008 film)|Kill Switch]]'', ''[[Urban Justice]]'', ''[[Pistol Whipped]]'', ''[[Against the Dark]]'', ''[[Driven to Kill]]'', ''[[A Dangerous Man]]'', ''[[Born to Raise Hell (film)|Born to Raise Hell]]'', and ''[[The Keeper (2009 film)|The Keeper]]'', a movie released in Japan fifteen weeks earlier than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296869/releaseinfo|title=The Keeper (2009/I) – Release dates|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-24|author=IMDB.com|work=IMDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Seagal starred in 7 direct-to-video movies.

=== Television and commercial work ===
In 2009, [[A&amp;E Network]] premiered the reality television series ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', focusing on Seagal as a deputy in [[Louisiana]]. In 2011, he produced and starred in a 13-episode television series entitled ''[[True Justice]]''. It was renewed for a second season on [[ReelzChannel]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2012/04/reelzchannel-orders-second-season-of-steven-seagals-true-justice-262369/ |title=ReelzChannel Orders Second Season Of Steven Seagal's 'True Justice' |date=April 26, 2012 |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva  |work=Deadline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, ''True Justice'' has been repackaged as a series of DVD "movies," with each disc editing together two episodes.

== Themes and motifs ==

Many of Seagal's films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the [[CIA]], [[Special Forces]], or [[Black Ops]] (for example, Casey Ryback in ''[[Under Siege]]'', a former [[Navy SEAL]], Jack Cole in ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'', an ex-CIA police detective, or Jonathan Cold in ''[[The Foreigner (2003 film)|The Foreigner]]'' and ''[[Black Dawn (film)|Black Dawn]]'', an ex-CIA Black Ops freelancer.) His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they almost never face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and never facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal.|last=Vern|publisher=Titan Books|year=2008|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception is 2010's ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'', which features Seagal in a rare villainous role.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Growl, and Let the Severed Heads Fall Where They May|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Stephen Holden|author=Holden, Stephen|date=September 2, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/movies/03machete.html?mcubz=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seagal's music appears in some of his films (for example, ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into The Sun]]'' and ''[[Ticker (2001 film)|Ticker]]'', where he appears as part of a bar band), as does his fluency in other languages (he speaks Japanese in ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into the Sun]]'') and religion ([[Buddhism]] features prominently in ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'' and ''[[Belly of the Beast]]''). His past as an aikido teacher is also incorporated into several films, for example ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'' (which opens with a montage of real-life photos from Seagal's own past) or ''[[Shadow Man (2006 film)|Shadow Man]]'', where he is seen giving an aikido demonstration. Several of his films also feature prominent political messages, most notably the [[environmentalism]] evident in ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', which ends with a lengthy speech in which Seagal (playing ex-CIA firefighter Forrest Taft) accuses big business of rampant environmental degradation:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;Big Business is primarily responsible for destroying the water we drink, the air we breathe and the food we eat. They have no care for the world they destroy, only for the money they make in the process... They basically control the legislation, and, in fact, they control the Law... They influence the media so that they can control our minds. They have made it a crime to speak out for ourselves, and if we do so we're called "conspiracy nuts" and we're laughed at... We have to force these companies to operate safely and responsibly, and with all our best interests in mind.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 2008, author and [[critic]] Vern (no last name) published ''[[Seagalogy]]'', a work which examines Seagal's filmography using the framework of [[auteur theory]]. The book divides Seagal's filmography into different chronological "eras" with distinct thematic elements. The book was updated in 2012 to include more recent films and Seagal's work on the [[reality TV]] show ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlawvern.com/2012/03/27/seagalogy-updated-and-expanded-edition/ |title=Seagalogy: Updated and Expanded Edition « The Life and Art of Vern |publisher=Outlawvern.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he spent the summer of 2006 touring the United States and Europe with his band, Thunderbox, in support of the album.

=== Law enforcement work ===
Seagal has been a [[Sheriffs in the United States|Reserve Deputy Chief]] in the [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], Louisiana Sheriff's Office. In the late 1980s after teaching the deputies martial arts, unarmed combat, and [[marksman]]ship, then  sheriff [[Harry Lee (sheriff)|Harry Lee]] (August 27, 1932 – October 1, 2007) was so impressed he asked Seagal to join the force. Seagal owns a second home in Louisiana and spends several months there each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Gary |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-12-02-seagal02_ST_N.htm |title='Lawman' finds Steven Seagal fighting crime for real |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seagal allegedly graduated from a police academy in Los Angeles over twenty years ago and has a certificate from Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training (POST), an organization that accredits California police officers. However, POST officials in California and Louisiana have no record of Seagal being certified, and Seagal's rank in Louisiana is therefore ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/02/entertainment/la-et-lawman2-2009dec02 |title=Steven Seagal gets to play cop |date=December 2, 2009 |first=Scott |last=Glover |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', series which follows his work in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, premiered on [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] on December 2, 2009. Seagal stated that "I’ve decided to work with A&amp;E on this series now because I believe it’s important to show the nation all the positive work being accomplished here in Louisiana—to see the passion and commitment that comes from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in this post-[[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] environment." The series premiere drew 3.6 million viewers, ranking as best season opener for any original A&amp;E series ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/ae/2008_Nov_25_steven_seagal_lawman|title=Steven Seagal: Lawman coming to A&amp;E|date=2008-11-23|accessdate=2008-11-23|author=Andy Denhart|work=realityblurred.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2010, the series was suspended by Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand due to a sexual trafficking lawsuit filed against Seagal. The suit was later dropped.&lt;ref name="tmz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/04/14/steven-seagal-lawman-suspended-lawsuit-sex-case-kayden-nguyen|title=Steven Seagal's TV Show – Suspended By Cops|publisher=TMZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;E resumed the show for the second season, which began on October 6, 2010.

=== Business ventures ===
In 2005, Seagal Enterprises began to market an [[energy drink]] known as "Steven Seagal's Lightning Bolt", but it has since been discontinued. Seagal has also marketed an aftershave called "Scent of Action", and a range of knives and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2009/aug/28/steven-seagal-lawman

== Personal life ==
Seagal owns a [[Guest ranch|dude ranch]] in [[Colorado]] and a home in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]], a wealthy neighborhood in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Sunday Express 2013-11-18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/443776/Steven-Seagal-adopts-a-dog-in-Romania|title=Steven Seagal adopts a dog in Romania|date=18 November 2013|publisher=[[Sunday Express]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Post 2013-11-18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/11/18/steven-seagal-adopts-stray-puppy-in-romania/|title=Steven Seagal adopts stray puppy in Romania|date=18 November 2013|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion===
Seagal is a Buddhist. In February 1997, [[Lama]] [[Penor Rinpoche]] from [[Palyul]] monastery announced that Seagal was a [[tulku]], and specifically the [[reincarnation]] of [[Chungdrag Dorje]], a 17th-century [[terton]] (treasure revealer) of the [[Nyingma]], the oldest sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorjeshugden.com/all-articles/features/the-peoples-princess-yabshi-pan-rinzinwangmo/ |title=The People's Princess Yabshi-Pan-Rinzinwangmo |publisher=DorjeShugden.com |date=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seagal's recognition aroused controversy in the [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist community]], with [[Helen Tworkov]] commenting in ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]]'' impugning the extent of Seagal's "spiritual wisdom" and suggesting that Seagal bought his [[Buddhahood]] by donations to Penor's [[Kunzang Palyul Choling]] center. Penor Rinpoche responded to the controversy by saying that Seagal, although acting in violent movies, had not actually killed people, and that Seagal was merely ''recognized'', whereas ''enthronement'' as a tulku would require first a "lengthy process of study and practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Tibet: Searching for Shangri-La from the Himalayas to Hollywood|first=Orville|last=Schell|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|year=2001|chapter=Tinseltown Tulkus|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted [[Serbian nationality law|Serbian citizenship]] on January 11, 2016, following several visits to the country, and has been asked to teach aikido to the [[Special forces of Serbia|Serbian Special Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/328583-steven-seagal-serbian-citizenship/ |title=Steven Seagal gets Serbian citizenship |date=12 January 2016|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seagal was granted [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizenship]] on  November 3, 2016; according to government spokesman [[Dmitry Peskov]], "He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/putin-grants-action-star-steven-seagal-russian-citizenship-101618186.html Putin grants action star Steven Seagal Russian citizenship], [[Yahoo!

[[Junior Achievement]]'s '''U.S. Business Hall of Fame''' was established in 1975,&lt;ref name=SpecialEvents&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Events :: U.S. Business Hall of Fame|publisher=Junior Achievement USA|url=http://www.ja.org/hof/|accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the result of an idea by Willard F. Rockwell, Jr. (former chairman and CEO of [[Rockwell International]]) and [[Alan Hilburg]] (assisting W. F. Rockwell as a representative of [[Junior Achievement]]).  Rockwell and Hilburg approached Pat Lenahan and Charles Whittingham (publisher and associate publisher of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine) with the idea.  Together they engaged the Board of Editors of ''Fortune'' to independently select the honorees.  The originating idea was to align the principles of Junior Achievement with the lives of the inductees to promote examples of what it considers exemplary business leadership.

'''William Fitzhugh''' (August 24, 1741{{spaced ndash}}June 6, 1809) was an American planter and statesman who served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] for [[Virginia]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=F000173|title=FITZHUGH, William - Biographical Information|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:"Chatham," Colonel Daniel Bradford Devore house, 120 Chatham Lane, Fredericksburg, Stafford County, Virginia. Porch and reflecting pool.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chatham Manor]], 120 Chatham Lane, Fredericksburg, originally built by William Fitzhugh, 1768-1771, restored, with changes, by Oliver H. Clark for [[Daniel Bradford Devore]], from 1920. Landscape: Ellen Biddle Shipman, from 1922. David Hanlon, gardener.]]

Fitzhugh and his wife, Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh (1747–1805), built [[Chatham Manor]] on property across the [[Rappahannock River]] from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], completing it in 1771 after 3 years of construction. It still stands today as the [[National Park Service]] Headquarters for the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]]. The Fitzhughs lived a lavish life there that included experimental farming and horse racing. After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], as the economy floundered, Fitzhugh sold Chatham Manor and 1,288 acres (5.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to Churchill Jones for $20,000.

About 1799, William Fitzhugh bought the house at 607 Oronoco St., [[Alexandria, Virginia]], that has become known as "The Boyhood Home of [[Robert E. Lee]]." The house was built in 1795 by John Potts, Jr. After William Fitzhugh's death, it then passed to [[William Henry Fitzhugh]], his only son, and was rented to the Lee family.

Fitzhugh had built another mansion, [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth]], in 1796, where [[North Springfield, Virginia]], is now located. This was his country home, with the Alexandria one being his townhouse. Ravensworth stood until about 1925, when it burned under mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://braddockheritage.org/content/vault/Stuntz_Mayo_c092fa2e92.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

William Fitzhugh and [[George Washington]] visited one another frequently until Washington's death in 1799, with Washington mentioning Fitzhugh in his diary and the two serving together on the Pohick Church vestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/frsp/gwchat/htm&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzhugh was the last person that Washington visited outside of [[Mount Vernon]] before his death in 1799.

==Political career==
[[File:Pohick Church 2012-09-12 10-00-54.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fitzhugh graves at Pohick Church; William's is on the extreme left]]
Fitzhugh served in the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] between 1772 and 1775. When that assembly was dissolved by Virginia colonial governor [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], Fitzhugh continued to serve [[King George County, Virginia]] in ad hoc conventions held in Williamsburg and Richmond. He was also a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Safety in 1774-75. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] he was a commissioner of two arms and munitions factories. He served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1776&amp;ndash;1777. He was a Virginia state senator in 1780&amp;ndash;1787).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/frsp/fitzchm.htm ''William Fitzhugh'' at National Park Service web site for Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park] Retrieved September 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzhugh was chosen as an elector for the [[1789 election]] from Westmoreland District.&lt;ref&gt;The Documentary history of the first Federal elections, 1788–1790, by Gordon DenBoer, Volume 2, page 303&lt;/ref&gt;  That District consisted of [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]], [[Lancaster County, Virginia|Lancaster County]], [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland County]], [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond County]], [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] and [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]], which cover the area between the Rappahannock and [[Potomac River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

All of the 10 electors who voted cast one of their two votes for George Washington.  5 of them cast their other vote for [[John Adams]].  3 cast theirs for [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]].  1 cast his for [[John Hancock]].  1 cast his for [[John Jay]].&lt;ref&gt;The Documentary history of the first Federal elections, 1788-1790, by Gordon DenBoer, Volume 2, pages 304-5&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter written by James Madison to Thomas Jefferson on March 29, 1789, 'Mr W Fitzhugh of Chatham' is described as a [[Federalist]] &lt;ref&gt;Cited in 'The Documentary history of the first Federal elections, 1788-1790', by Gordon DenBoer, Volume 2, page 408&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He was the great-grandson of English immigrant Colonel William Fitzhugh who came to Virginia in about 1671 and owned 54,000 acres (220&amp;nbsp;km²) when he died in 1701. William of Chatham inherited most of the land. As a child he suffered the loss of an eye when accidentally hit with a horse riding crop by one of his stepbrothers.  His mother was Lucy Carter, daughter of [[Robert Carter I|Robert "King" Carter]].

In 1804 Fitzhugh's daughter [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]] was married in the parlor of the Alexandria townhouse to [[George Washington Parke Custis]], grandson of [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Custis Washington]] and adopted grandson of George Washington. In 1831 their daughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], married [[Robert E. Lee]].

His wife was Ann Bolling Randolph ([[William Randolph II]] and Elizabeth Beverley's granddaughter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=bryan+fairfax&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NO-9Z2tykS&amp;sig=LyR-YUD9WGHv8aSwAlohuhUk1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA81,M1|title=Some Prominent Virginia Families|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This Randolph connection made Ann Fitzhugh cousin to Thomas Jefferson, a visitor to their home in Fredericksburg.

Fitzhugh died in 1809 at the age of 69, leaving behind the three of his children who survived to adulthood. He was initially buried at Ravensworth, but when the mansion was destroyed, his remains and gravestone were moved to [[Lorton, Virginia|Lorton]]'s [[Pohick Church]] cemetery.

'''Work experience''' is any [[experience]] that a person gains while working in a specific field or occupation, but the expression is widely used to mean a type of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work that is commonly intended for young people &amp;mdash; often [[students]] &amp;mdash; to get a feel for professional working environments. The [[American English|American]] equivalent term is [[internship]].

Though the placements are usually unpaid, travel and food expenses are sometimes covered, and at the end of the appointment, a character reference is usually provided. Trainees usually have the opportunity to network and make contacts among the working personnel, and put themselves forward for forthcoming opportunities for paid work.

Many employers in the more sought after professions (e.g. TV, politics, journalism) demand that every new entrant undergo a period of unpaid "work experience" before being able to get paid work.

== Secondary level work experience ==
Work experience is offered on the national curriculum for students in years 10 and 11 in the [[United Kingdom]] (3rd and 4th year in [[Scotland]]), [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]; every student who wishes to do so has a statutory right to take work experience. In 2011, however, the Wolf Review of Vocational Education proposed a significant policy change that—to reflect the fact that almost all students now stay past the age of 16—the requirement for pre-16 work experience in the UK should be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/The%20Wolf%20Report.pdf A Wolf, Review of Vocational Education, 2011 recommendation 21 p.17] accessed 3 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Work experience in this context is when students in an adult working environment more or less act as an employee, but with the emphasis on learning about the world of work. Placements are limited by safety and security restrictions, insurance cover and availability, and do not necessarily reflect eventual career choice but instead allow a broad experience of the world of work.&lt;ref name="oebp.org.uk"&gt;[http://oebp.org.uk/wps/wcm/connect/OEBP/Parents/OEBP+-+Parents+-+info+for+parents+carers Oxfordshire Education Business Partnership - (OEBP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A student who fails to find a placement may sometimes be required to attend school every day—continuing the normal school day, or doing a placement around the school such as aiding the caretaker for example, or helping out elsewhere in the school, such as with language and PE departments, or with ICT technicians.

Students are not prohibited from working at a company outside the conurbation of the city or abroad. Routine safety checks on the companies are now more thorough and students who arrange placements at failed companies are forced to find a new placement; companies that fail to comply with statutory requirements for insurance and child protection may be prohibited from officially taking students. (This depends upon the [[Local Education Authority|LEA]].)

Most students do not get paid for work experience. However, some employers pay students, as this is considered part of their education.  The duration varies according to the student's course, and other personal circumstances. Most students go out on work experience for one or two weeks in a year.&lt;ref name="oebp.org.uk"/&gt; Some students work in a particular workplace, perhaps one or two days a week for extended periods of time throughout the year—either for vocation reasons and commitment to alternative curricula or because they have social or behavioural problems.

== University level work experience ==
At university level, work experience is often offered between the second and final years of an undergraduate degree course, especially in the science, engineering and computing fields. Courses of this nature are often called ''[[sandwich course]]s'', with the work experience year itself known as the ''sandwich year''. During this time, the students on work placement have the opportunity to use the skills and knowledge gained in their first two years, and see how they are applied to real world problems. This offers them useful insights for their final year and prepares them for the job market once their course has finished. Some companies sponsor students in their final year at university with the promise of a job at the end of the course. This is an incentive for the student to perform well during the placement as it helps with two otherwise unwelcome stresses: the lack of money in the final year, and finding a job when the University course ends.
