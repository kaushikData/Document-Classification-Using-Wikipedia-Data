The '''A4161''' is a main road in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]]. The main purpose of the road is to link the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]] with the [[M4 motorway]] in the west at junction 33, and in the east with the [[A48(M) motorway]] at [[St Mellons]]. 
 
The 1923 route of the A48 was the main east-west link in south Wales.  The A48 in Cardiff was re-numbered to the A4161 on 19 November 1971 when the Eastern Avenue [[dual carriageway]] became the A48.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm |publisher=Cardiff Council |title=Cardiff Timeline |accessdate=2007-10-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134414/http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2 November 1975, Queen Street was partly pedestrianised and 2 subways were opened under North Road and Boulevard de Nantes&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; to allow the A4161 then to move from Queen Street to Dumfries Place, Stuttgart Strasse, Boulevard De Nantes. The A48 section between Rumney and [[St Mellons]] later became the B4487 and [[A4232 road#Southern Way Link Road|Southern Way]] (A4232) was built in 1978.&lt;ref name="Echo"&gt;''[[South Wales Echo]]'', "Opening up southern Cardiff – Value of PDR", Wednesday 22 May,&amp;nbsp;1985, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current route of the A4161 ==
From east to west it runs through the following roads in Cardiff:

* From [[A4232 road#Southern Way Link Road|Southern Way]] west along Newport Road
* Dumfries Place
* Stuttgarter Strasse
* Boulevard De Nantes

The road then follows the [[A470 road|A470]] from North Road (alongside [[Cardiff Castle]] through to Duke Street, before becoming the A4161 again from:

* Castle Street, and over Cardiff Bridge
* Cowbridge Road East
* Wellington Street
* Atlas Road
* Lansdowne Road
* Cowbridge Road East again, ending at Ely Bridge (roundabout on the A48)

Italiano]], web: [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a general methodology for algorithmic research.&lt;ref name="AEDef"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering – An Attempt at a Definition", [[Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|Peter Sanders]], web: [http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In 1995, a report from an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-sponsored workshop "with the purpose of assessing the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community" identified the slow speed of adoption of theoretical insights by practitioners as an important issue and suggested measures to
* reduce the uncertainty by practitioners whether a certain theoretical breakthrough will translate into practical gains in their field of work, and
* tackle the lack of ready-to-use algorithm libraries, which provide stable, bug-free and well-tested implementations for algorithmic problems and expose an easy-to-use interface for library consumers.&lt;ref name="EOTCS"&gt;"Emerging Opportunities for Theoretical Computer Science", Aho, Johnson, Karp, Kosaraju, McGeoch, Papadimitriou, web: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Scientists have encountered a widening gap between theoretical insights and their application in software engineering disciplines. While algorithm theory provides the mathematical foundation to discover ..., it often does not meet the practical requirements of software engineering. --&gt;
 
But also, promising algorithmic approaches have been neglected due to difficulties in mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Algorithm engineering was mentioned as one of the approaches to speed up adoption .... --&gt;

The term "algorithm engineering" was first used with specificity in 1997, with the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97), organized by [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~wae97 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from algorithm theory==
 
Algorithm engineering does not intend to replace or compete with algorithm theory, but tries to enrich, refine and reinforce its formal approaches with [[experimental algorithmics]] (also called empirical algorithmics).

This way it can provide new insights into the efficiency and performance of algorithms in cases where
* the algorithm at hand is less amenable to algorithm theoretic analysis,
* formal analysis pessimistically suggests bounds which are unlikely to appear on inputs of practical interest,
* the algorithm relies on the intricacies of modern hardware architectures like data locality, branch prediction, instruction stalls, instruction latencies which the machine model used in Algorithm Theory is unable to capture in the required detail,
* the crossover between competing algorithms with different constant costs and asymptotic behaviors needs to be determined.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDEA"&gt;"Towards a Discipline of Experimental Algorithmics", Bernard M. E. Moret, web: [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Some researchers describe algorithm engineering's methodology as a cycle consisting of algorithm design, analysis, implementation and experimental evaluation, joined by further aspects like machine models or realistic inputs.
They argue that equating algorithm engineering with [[experimental algorithmics]] is too limited, because viewing design and analysis, implementation and experimentation as separate activities ignores the crucial feedback loop between those elements of algorithm engineering.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Realistic models and real inputs===

While specific applications are outside the methodology of algorithm engineering, they play an important role in shaping realistic models of the problem and the underlying machine, and supply real inputs and other design parameters for experiments.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Design===
Compared to algorithm theory, which usually focuses on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, algorithm engineers need to keep further requirements in mind: Simplicity of the algorithm, implementability in programming languages on real hardware, and allowing code reuse.
Additionally, constant factors of algorithms have such a considerable impact on real-world inputs that sometimes an algorithm with worse asymptotic behavior performs better in practice due to lower constant factors.

===Analysis===
Some problems can be solved with heuristics and randomized algorithms in a simpler and more efficient fashion than with deterministic algorithms. Unfortunately, this makes even simple randomized algorithms ''difficult to analyze because there are subtle dependencies to be taken into account''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Implementation===
Huge semantic gaps between theoretical insights, formulated algorithms, programming languages and hardware pose a challenge to efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior.
The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend an considerable amount of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, and looking at the generated machine code.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Experiments===
See: [[Experimental algorithmics]]

===Application engineering===
Implementations of algorithms used for experiments differ in significant ways from code usable in applications.
While the former prioritizes fast prototyping, performance and instrumentation for measurements during experiments, the latter requires ''thorough testing, maintainability, simplicity, and tuning for particular classes of inputs''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Algorithm libraries===
Stable, well-tested algorithm libraries like [[Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms|LEDA]] play an important role in technology transfer by speeding up the adoption of new algorithms in applications. 
Such libraries reduce the required investment and risk for practitioners, because it removes the burden of understanding and implementing the results of academic research.

==Conferences==
Two main conferences on Algorithm Engineering are organized annually, namely:
* Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA), established in 1997 (formerly known as WEA).
* SIAM Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), established in 1999.

The 1997 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'97) was held in Venice (Italy) on September 11–13, 1997. The Third International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'99) was held in London, UK in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Amiga software''' is computer software engineered to run on the [[Amiga]] personal computer. Amiga software covers many applications, including productivity, [[digital art]], [[Video game|games]], commercial, freeware and hobbyist products. The market was active in the late 1980s and early 1990s but then dwindled. Most Amiga products were originally created directly for the Amiga computer (most taking advantage of the platform's unique attributes and capabilities), and were not ported from other platforms.

During its lifetime, thousands of applications were produced with over 10,000 utilities{{Ref label|Aminet_Statistics|1}} (collected into the [[Aminet]] repository). However, it was perceived as a games machine from outside its community of experienced and professional users.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} More than 12,000 games were available.{{Ref label|Amiga_WHDLoad_Site|2}}{{Ref label| Amiga LemonAmiga Site| 3}}{{Ref label| Obligement Amiga Site| 4}} New applications for the three existing Amiga-like operating systems{{Ref label| AmigaLike| 5}} are generally ported from the open source (mainly from [[Linux]]) software base.

Many Amiga software products or noteworthy programs during the timeline were ported to other platforms or inspired new programs, such as those aimed at 3D rendering or audio creations, e.g. [[LightWave 3D]], [[Cinema 4D]], and [[Blender (software)|Blender]] (whose development started for the Amiga platform only). The first multimedia word processors for Amiga, such as [[TextCraft]], [[Scribble!]], [[Rashumon]], and [[Wordworth (word processor)|Wordworth]], were the first on the market to implement full color [[WYSIWYG]] (with other platforms then only implementing black-and-white previews) and allowing the embedding of audio files.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==History and characteristics==

===From the origins to 1988===

====1985====
Amiga software started its history with the 1985 [[Amiga 1000]]. [[Commodore International]] released the programming specifications and development computers to various software houses, prominently [[Electronic Arts]], a software house that then offered [[Deluxe Paint]], [[Deluxe Music Construction Set|Deluxe Music]] and others. Electronic Arts also developed the [[Interchange File Format]] (IFF) file container, to store project files realized by Deluxe Paint and Deluxe Music. IFF became the ''de facto'' standard in AmigaOS. The first to be shown were digitizer software [[ProPaint]] (in early beta). Both were used by [[Andy Warhol]] to produce a black-and-white photo of [[Debbie Harry]] at the Launch Gala at [[Lincoln Center]], New York City in July 1985{{Ref label|Ars_Technica|6}}. In 1985 Commodore licensed the software called [[Transformer (software)|Transformer]] from [[Simile Research]] and put it on the market in January 1986, bundled with an external [[A1020]] 5.25-inch [[floppy drive]]. It emulated 8086 [[Intel]]-based [[PC-XT]] hardware. It could run [[MS-DOS]] and MS-DOS software such as [[Lotus 123]] or [[WordStar]]. This provided early access to many applications, while waiting for native Amiga software to be developed{{Ref label|Amiga_Transformer|7}}. In 1985, Deluxe Paint emerged with graphic features that had been available only on dedicated graphic computers. It was dubbed the first Amiga "[[Killer application]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====1986====
In 1986 (the year of the launch of [[Amiga 2000]]) Amiga software products contributed to the Amiga's success as a game and multimedia machine. [[AmigaBasic]] from [[Microsoft]], [[VizaWrite]], [[TextCraft]] (word processors), [[Pagesetter]] (Desktop Publishing), [[Analyze!]] (Spreadsheet), [[Superbase database|Superbase Personal]] (Database), [[MovieCraft]] (animation), Deluxe paint II, Deluxe Music, [[Instant Music (software)|Instant Music]] (a composition music program for non musicians) from Electronic Arts, and [[GraphiCraft]] again from Commodore were released. GraphiCraft was used by computer artist [[Jim Sachs]] to produce Amiga software such as ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'' and [[Centurion: Defender of Rome]] from [[Cinemaware]] and the Amiga porting of ''[[Saucer Attack]]''. Graphicraft was a predecessor of [[Aegis Images]] and [[AEGIS Animator]]{{Ref label|Jim_Sachs|8}}{{Ref label|Jim_Sachs2|9}}, one of the first programs worldwide capable of creating animation videos and cartoons complete with audio stereo, featuring a [[cel animation]] working paradigm interface and outputting files based on [[Delta encoding|delta-frame difference]] compression method which then were the lead for creating the [[ANIM]] file type standard. [[Byte-by-Byte]] Software Inc. released [[Sculpt-3D]]. It was the first rendering tool available for the first time to a vast audience of public, and in October of the same year, Impulse released [[TurboSilver]].

====1987====
In 1987 the Amiga 500 (A500) was released. The Amiga software market moved in favor of entertainment over professional software.

[[ProWrite]] (word processor), [[Maxiplan 500]] (spreadsheet), and [[Aegis Sonix]], a music program similar to Instant Music, were produced. {{Ref label|ProWrite|10}}.

In July, [[Wordperfect]] created an "Amiga/[[Atari]] Division" and started selling a version of its word processor for the Commodore platform for US$400{{Ref label|Wordperfect|11}}. It could load and save Wordperfect files created on any platform, such as IBM, Macintosh and Apple II.{{Ref label|Wordperfect2|12}} Wordperfect 4.1 for the Amiga was the first word processor in the world capable of opening an unlimited number of documents (limited by RAM), each in a separate window.{{Ref label|Wordperfect3|13}}

In 1987, [[Andrew Tanenbaum]] released [[Minix]], a free version of [[Unix]] with complete source code.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

At [[COMDEX]] [[NewTek]] showed for the first time a prototype of [[Video Toaster]] and Impulse released TurboSilver 2.0.

====1988====
In 1988, [[Photon Paint]] was released. It allowed digital painting using [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]] graphics mode and the full 4096-color palette of Amiga on a single screen. Maxiplan 500 become Maxiplan 1.x, Electronic Arts showed [[DeLuxe Photo Lab]] (photo editing software), Newtek demonstrated [[DigiView 3.0]] hardware and software image digitizing suite, and WordPerfect released the [[WordPerfect Library]] for the Amiga. At the summer [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES), the [[Pro Draw]] graphic tablet with mouse emulation software was also announced, as well as Flash-Back and Quarterback hard drive backup software. Superbase Personal became Superbase Professional, [[Micro Illusions]] started shipping [[Music-X]] audio software for the Amiga, and [[Lattice C|Lattice]] released its [[C++]] preprocessor for the Amiga. [[CygnusEd|Cygnus Editor]] ubiquitous text editor, one of the most versatile text editors and best seller on Amiga since then, was also released this year. It was one of the first Amiga programs featuring an [[AREXX]] port. [[Gold Disk]] released [[ComicSetter]] (comic creation) and [[MovieSetter]] (32-color cartoons with stereo sound animation software). In November, at the [[World of Commodore]] Show, [[ReadySoft]] demonstrated its Amax Macintosh emulator for the Amiga.

===1989–1994===
In 1989, [[Rashumon]] was first launched. In 1990, AmigaDOS 2.0 was released. The interface of the Workbench GUI was changed to a fake 3D aspect using gray shades. For the first time, Commodore introduced a style guide for developers on AmigaOS; because of this, the majority of Amiga software developed for AmigaDOS 2.0 had a standardized GUI that improved usability. Programs such as [[Imagine 3D]], [[Lightwave]], [[ImageFX]], and [[Scala, Inc|Scala]] continued using non-standard GUIs. AmigaVision was released and bundled free with any model of [[Amiga 3000]]. Directory Master, Directory Opus, TurboCalc, Photogenics, ImageFX, PC Task, Photogenics, Caligari, Final Calc, and [[Cinema 4D]] all belong to this period.

===1994 to today===
After 1994, Commodore's demise left Amiga to an uncertain future. Windows-based PCs became the standard in the home and the office. Many software houses either left the Amiga market or ran into financial troubles. In 1996, [[Aminet]] was created.  Aminet was the first centralized Internet repository of all Amiga public domain software and documents. It was the first Internet experiment of a centralized [[software repository]] created and maintained by one community for the community itself. Amiga's browsers like [[AWeb]], [[IBrowse]] and [[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]] were enhanced.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Voyager was the first browser to adopt [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]]. Mailers like [[YAM (Yet Another Mailer)|YAM]] are still used. In productivity software, programs like Candy Factory for image processing were still being developed, for vfx and animation programs like [[Wildfire]] by Andreas Maschke (ported by author to Java later). other prominent graphic software include [[fxPAINT]] by IOSpirit, [[fxSCAN]] for OCR and scanning by [[IOSpirit]], and [[SketchBlock]] painting program by Andy Broad for AmigaOS 4.x. Last but not least [[Tornado3D]] raytracing program by the Italian company Eyelight.

===Usability===
Amiga software presents a complete graphical interface, following Amiga [[WYSIWYG]] "desktop paradigm" and native AmigaOS interface guidelines; that is to say, the software is mouse-driven and presents also pull-down "menus" and "dialogue windows". AmigaOS maintained a text-based shell allowing software to present a text-based GUI, or a "command line".

====Communication protocols====
[[Skypix]] is an Amiga communication protocol. It was one of the first interactive online graphics-and-sound protocols.&lt;ref name="Skyline"&gt;{{cite web| title = The BBS Software Directory | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher=Jason Scott for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine | author=Scott Lee | access-date = April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in 1987 as part of the Skyline (Atredes) bulletin board system (BBS), running on the Skyline BBS and Skyterm terminal. Years before the World Wide Web, Skypix allowed rich interactive graphics and sound, as well as mouse control, to be a part of the online experience, which was until then limited to text and ANSI graphics. Skypix allowed users to write and integrate graphical programs, and included the first "authoring program", Skypaint. Skypix created enthusiastic game and online application writers years before the World Wide Web made such features a common part of the online experience. It was quickly abandoned as more advanced markup languages for BBS became available and due to the emerging of Internet phenomenon that marginalized the BBS system of communication.

===Utilities===
''AmiDock'' creates [[Dock (computing)|application launching docks]] on the desktop. It became popular in 1989–1990, due to the [[NeXT]] computer, that used the same [[68030]] processor as [[Amiga 3000]]) and that it also had the [[Acorn Archimedes]] [[RISC OS]] docking station utility. In Great Britain, Archimedes computers were adopted in schools. Young Amiga users (there were 1,500,000 Amigas sold in the United Kingdom) spotted docks on Archimedes at school and asked for it on Amiga also. Various launch bars or docking utilities were born as third-party hobby utilities (many examples of early docking software for Amiga like the ''ToolManager'' are still hosted in the [[Aminet]] repository of all Amiga free software, in the "Utility" directory) and then Amidock was officially integrated in AmigaOS with version 3.9.

''[[Directory Opus]]'' was a file utility program. When this software was released, Amiga magazines{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} proclaimed that it was the most important software ever released for the Amiga and "should be built into the operating system". Directory Opus went on to create a "replacement OS" for Workbench which overlaid itself upon the system. It started as a file manager, and then became a complete desktop replacement and an alternative to the official Workbench. The utility was later ported to Windows and remains widely used.

HyperCache was the first commercial disk caching software. Significant in that the base operating system lacked this ability, the addition of caching significantly improved the performance of both floppy and hard discs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140127030146/http://www.cucug.org/amiga/amiinfo/reviews/HyperCacheProf.txt REVIEW: HyperCache Professional], Retrieved April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''SysSpeed'' was a shareware [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarking program]] for Amigas equipped with [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68k]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/amazing-computing-magazine-1997-08/Amazing_Computing_Vol_12_08_1997_Aug_djvu.txt|title=The Old Workbench: Episode 9|last=Matthews|first=Dave|work=[[Amazing Computing]]|volume=12|issue=8|date=August 1997|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much shareware and free software was written for the Amiga and could be obtained via the [[Fred Fish]] disk series or from the Aminet software archive.

Because the custom chipset shares RAM (and therefore the memory bus) with the CPU, throughput increases measurably if the display is disabled. Some processor-intensive software, such as 3D renderers, disable the display during calculation to gain speed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Emulation==
{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}
Notable emulators included:

===Commercial===
[[Medusa (emulator)|Medusa]] ([[Atari ST]] emulator), [[Fusion (emulator)|Fusion]] ([[Macintosh]] Emulator), AMax and AMax II, (Macintosh), [[GO64]] (first Commodore [[Commodore 64|C64]] emulator), [[Transformer (emulator)|Transformer]] and [[PCTask]] (it was an [[Intel]] 8088 emulator, all software based, capable to emulate Intel PC based platforms ranging from [[PC XT]] 4,7 and 7&amp;nbsp;MHz on [[Amiga 500]], up to [[80486]] running at 12&amp;nbsp;MHz on [[Amiga 4000]] and other accelerated Amigas), [[A64 (emulator)|A64 Package]] (C64), [[Amiga BBC Emulator]] ([[Acorn BBC]] emulator)

==Games==
{{Main|Amiga games}}
Thousands of games were produced. At the time it was common for games to be produced for multiple formats. Since the Amiga hardware was the most advanced, games were usually developed on an Amiga, and the Amiga version would be the "gold standard" of the bunch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Demos==
{{Main|Amiga demos}}
The Amiga was a focal point for the "[[Demoscene|demo scene]]". The Amiga thrived on [[public domain]], [[freeware]] and other not-for-profit development. The demo scene spearheaded development in multimedia programming techniques for the Amiga, such that it was ''de rigueur'' for the latest visual tricks, soundtrackers and 3D algorithms from the demo scene to end up being used in computer game development.

==Piracy==&lt;!-- This section is the anchor for a redirect from [Commodore International] --&gt;
Because Amiga was one of the first game-oriented computers to feature a built-in floppy disk drive, it simplified [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]]. Many of the arguments pertaining to software copying, [[intellectual property]] rights in software, the [[open-source movement]] by the early 1990s.{{Clarify|reason=incomplete sentence|date=February 2014}} It was not unusual for demo groups to be openly involved in software piracy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Anti-piracy measures included the practice of distributing software on disks that contained secret "keys" on high-numbered tracks that were officially unused. The Amiga disk drive officially supported tracks 0–79 from a double-density disk, but could actually read tracks 80 through 82. Standard disk-imaging software ignored these tracks, so that a duplicate of a boxed disk would not contain the key and the software would not work. A similar technique involved writing to normally-unused sectors of the disk. Copy software called "nibble" copiers appeared that could exactly reproduce such disks.

Publishers turned to other methods. [[Dongle|Hardware dongles]] were occasionally used for high-end software. AmigaHASP protected [[Rashumon]] and was sold by HarmonySoft to Aladdin Systems. Some software manufacturers asked users to type a word from a particular page number and line number of the manual, meaning that successfully copying software included [[photocopy]]ing a large quantity of text. Sometimes the text was designed so that photocopiers would produce illegible copies, meaning that pirates had to manually add the text.

Pirates responded with "[[Software cracking|cracking]]" software that altered the code to bypass copy protection completely. Every protection scheme was eventually broken. One near exception was the scheme on ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'', which became the "holy grail" of crackers worldwide, but it was also broken.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=="Decrunching"==
[[Image:Amiga decrunching.png|thumb|A single frame of a typical decrunching screen]]

The Amiga's [[floppy disk drive]] allowed 880&amp;nbsp;kilobytes on a single disk, comparable to the RAM of most Amigas (512 kilobytes to 1 megabyte). To increase capacity, Amiga used [[data compression]]. The disk drive had a slow transfer rate, such that using processor-based decompression could actually reduce loading times versus loading uncompressed data. Early implementations wrote to a [[video display register]], causing it to break into multiple segments of colorful noise, which would become finer as the decrunching continued. This effect was [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] and very easy to implement, so it stuck; it was pioneered on the [[Commodore 64]].

===TransADF===
'''TransADF''' is a program that transfers the contents of a [[floppy disk]] or a similar [[block device]] to a file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=October 1998 |title=AFCD31, Amiga Forever! -Seriously_Amiga-/Hardware/Transadf |magazine=Amiga Format |publisher=Future Publishing|issn=0957-4867|issue=115|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=May 2000 |title=Your problems solved, ADF Files|magazine=Amiga Format |publisher=Future Publishing|issn=0957-4867|issue=136|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program can compress the disk image using the popular [[deflate]] algorithm, as utilized by [[PKZip]] and [[gzip]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1998-10-05| url=http://aminet.net/aminet/disk/misc/TransADF.readme |format=TXT |title=TransADF.readme |website=aminet.net |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atka Glacier''' ({{coord|76|41|S|161|33|E|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is the [[glacier]] immediately east of [[Flagship Mountain]], draining north into [[Fry Glacier]] in [[Victoria Land]]. It was discovered and named in 1957 by the New Zealand Northern Survey Party of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1956&amp;ndash;58, and named after [[USCGC Southwind (WAGB-280)|USS ''Atka'']], an American [[icebreaker]] in the convoy to [[McMurdo Sound]] in the 1956&amp;ndash;57 season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1061">A '''Bancroft point''' is the temperature where an [[azeotrope]] occurs in a [[Mixture|binary system]]. Although [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|vapor liquid]] azeotropy is impossible for binary systems which are rigorously described by [[Raoult's law]], for real systems, azeotropy is inevitable at temperatures where the saturation [[vapor pressure]] of the components are equal. Such a temperature is called a Bancroft point. However, not all binary systems exhibit such a point. Also, a Bancroft point must lie in the valid temperature ranges of the [[Antoine equation]].

Bancroft point is named after [[Wilder Dwight Bancroft]].

A '''biological network''' is any [[network science|network]] that applies to [[biological system]]s. A network is any system with sub-units that are linked into a whole, such as species units linked into a whole [[food web]]. Biological networks provide a [[graph theory|mathematical representation]] of connections found in [[ecological network|ecological]], [[phylogenetic network|evolutionary]], and [[physiological]] studies, such as [[neural networks]].&lt;ref name="Proulx05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Proulx | first1=S.

==Network biology and bioinformatics==
Complex biological systems may be represented and analyzed as computable networks. For example, ecosystems can be modeled as networks of interacting species or a protein can be modeled as a network of amino acids. Breaking a protein down farther, [[amino acids]] can be represented as a network of connected [[atom]]s, such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]]. [[vertex (graph theory)|Nodes]] and [[vertex (graph theory)|edges]] are the basic components of a network. Nodes represent units in the network, while edges represent the interactions between the units. Nodes can represent a wide-array of biological units, from individual organisms to individual neurons in the brain. Two important properties of a network are [[vertex (graph theory)|degree]] and [[betweenness centrality]]. Degree (or connectivity, a distinct usage from that used in [[Connectivity (graph theory)|graph theory]]) is the number of edges that connect a node, while betweenness is a measure of how central a node is in a network.&lt;ref name="Proulx"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Proulx, S.R. |title= Network thinking in ecology and evolution |journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |year= 2005  |volume= 20 |issue= 6 |pages= 345–353 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.04.004 |pmid=16701391|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nodes with high betweenness essentially serve as bridges between different portions of  the network (i.e. interactions must pass through this node to reach other portions of the network). In social networks, nodes with high degree or high betweenness may play important roles in the overall composition of a network.

As early as the 1980s, researchers started viewing [[DNA]] or [[genome]]s as the dynamic storage of a language system with precise computable finite [[state (computer science)|states]] represented as a [[finite state machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author= Searls, D. |title= Artificial intelligence and molecular biology |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1993 |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[complex system]]s research has also suggested some far-reaching commonality in the organization of information in problems from biology, [[computer science]], and [[physics]], such as the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (a special state of matter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bianconi, G.  |author2=Barabasi A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Bose-Einstein condensation in complex networks |journal= Phys. Rev. Lett. |year= 2001  |volume= 86 |issue= 24 |pages= 5632–5635 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.86.5632|pmid=11415319  |arxiv=cond-mat/0011224|bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.5632B|hdl=2047/d20000696  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioinformatics has increasingly shifted its focus from individual [[gene]]s, proteins, and [[search algorithm]]s to large-scale networks often denoted as [[omics|-omes]] such as [[biome]], [[interactome]], [[genome]] and [[proteome]]. Such theoretical studies have revealed that biological networks share many features with other networks such as the [[Internet]] or [[social network]]s, e.g. their [[network topology]].

==Networks in biology==

===Protein–protein interaction networks===
{{main article|interactome}}
Many [[protein–protein interaction]]s (PPIs) in a cell form ''protein interaction networks'' (PINs) where proteins are ''nodes'' and their interactions are ''edges''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Emamian|first2=Effat S.|last3=Abdi|first3=Ali|date=2014-01-01|title=Quantitative analysis of intracellular communication and signaling errors in signaling networks|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=8|pages=89|doi=10.1186/s12918-014-0089-z|issn=1752-0509|pmc=4255782|pmid=25115405}}&lt;/ref&gt; PINs are the most intensely analyzed networks in biology. There are dozens of PPI detection methods to identify such interactions. The [[Y2H|yeast two-hybrid system]] is a commonly used experimental technique for the study of binary interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mashaghi, A. |title= Investigation of a protein complex network |journal= European Physical Journal |year= 2004  |volume= 41 |issue= 1 |pages= 113–121 |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2004-00301-0|display-authors=etal|arxiv= cond-mat/0304207|bibcode= 2004EPJB...41..113M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated conservation of molecular networks through deep evolutionary time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sharan, R. |title= Conserved patterns of protein interaction in multiple species |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year= 2005  |volume= 102 |issue= 6 |pages= 1974–1979 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0409522102|pmid= 15687504 |display-authors=etal|pmc= 548573|bibcode= 2005PNAS..102.1974S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has been discovered that proteins with high degrees of connectedness are more likely to be essential for survival than proteins with lesser degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Jeong, H. |title= Lethality and centrality in protein networks |journal= Nature |year= 2001  |volume= 411 |issue= 6833 |pages= 41–42 |doi=10.1038/35075138 |pmid=11333967|display-authors=etal|bibcode= 2001Natur.411...41J |arxiv= cond-mat/0105306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the overall composition of the network (not simply interactions between protein pairs) is important for the overall functioning of an organism.

===Gene regulatory networks (DNA–protein interaction networks)===

{{main article| Gene regulatory network}}
The activity of genes is regulated by [[transcription factors]], proteins that typically bind to [[DNA]]. Most transcription factors bind to multiple binding sites in a [[genome]]. As a result, all cells have complex [[gene regulatory networks]]. For instance, the [[human genome]] encodes on the order of 1,400 DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate the expression of more than 20,000 human genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vaquerizas, J.-M. |title= A census of human transcription factors: function, expression and evolution |journal= Nature Reviews Genetics |year= 2009  |volume= 10 |issue= 4 |pages= 252–263 |pmid= 19274049 |doi=10.1038/nrg2538|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies to study gene regulatory networks include [[ChIP-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]], [[CliP-seq]], and others.

===Gene co-expression networks (transcript–transcript association networks)===
{{main article| Gene co-expression networks}}
Gene co-expression networks can be interpreted as association networks between variables that measure transcript abundances. These networks have been used to provide a systems biologic analysis of DNA microarray data, RNA-seq data, miRNA data etc.
[[Weighted correlation network analysis|weighted gene co-expression network analysis]] is widely used to identify co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes. Co-expression modules may correspond to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs can be interpreted as representatives of their respective module.

===Metabolic networks===
{{main article|metabolic network}}
The chemical compounds of a living cell are connected by biochemical reactions which convert one compound into another. The reactions are catalyzed by [[enzymes]]. Thus, all compounds in a cell are parts of an intricate biochemical network of reactions which is called [[metabolic network]]. It is possible to use network analyses to infer how selection acts on metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name="Proulx" /&gt;

===Signaling networks===
{{main article|Cell signaling}}
Signals are transduced within cells or in between cells and thus form complex signaling networks. For instance, in the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]] is transduced from the cell surface to the cell nucleus by a series of protein–protein interactions, phosphorylation reactions, and other events. Signaling networks typically integrate [[interactome|protein–protein interaction networks]], [[gene regulatory networks]], and [[metabolic network]]s.

===Neuronal networks===
{{main article| Biological neural network}}
The complex interactions in the [[brain]] make it a perfect candidate to apply network theory. [[Neuron]]s in the brain are deeply connected with one another and this results in complex networks being present in the structural and functional aspects of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bullmore, E.  |author2=O. Sporns  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems |journal= Nature Reviews Neuroscience |year= 2009  |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 186–198 |doi=10.1038/nrn2575 |pmid=19190637}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[small-world network]] properties have been demonstrated in connections between cortical areas of the primate brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Stephan, K.E. |title= Computational analysis of functional connectivity between areas of primate cerebral cortex |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]|year= 2000  |volume= 355 |issue= 1393 |pages= 111–126 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0552|pmid= 10703047 |display-authors=etal|pmc= 1692715}}&lt;/ref&gt; or during swallowing in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-01|title=Functional connectivity patterns of normal human swallowing: difference among various viscosity swallows in normal and chin-tuck head positions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899316306783|journal=Brain Research|volume=1652|pages=158–169|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2016.09.041|pmid=27693396|pmc=5102805|issn=0006-8993|last1=Jestrović|first1=Iva|last2=Coyle|first2=James L|last3=Perera|first3=Subashan|last4=Sejdić|first4=Ervin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that cortical areas of the brain are not directly interacting with each other, but most areas can be reached from all others through only a few interactions.

===Food webs===
{{main article|Food web}}
All organisms are connected to each other through feeding interactions. That is, if a species eats or is eaten by another species, they are connected in an intricate [[food web]] of predator and prey interactions. The stability of these interactions has been a long-standing question in ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= MacArthur, R.H. |author-link= Robert MacArthur|title= Fluctuations in animal populations and a measure of community stability |journal= Ecology |year= 1955  |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |pages= 533–536 |doi=10.2307/1929601|jstor= 1929601}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if certain individuals are removed, what happens to the network (i.e. does it collapse or adapt)? Network analysis can be used to explore food web stability and determine if certain network properties result in more stable networks. Moreover, network analysis can be used to determine how selective removals of species will influence the food web as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dunne, J.A. |title= Network structure and biodiversity loss in food webs: robustness increases with connectance |journal= Ecology Letters |year= 2002  |volume= 5 |issue= 4 |pages= 558–567 |doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00354.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important considering the potential species loss due to global climate change.

===Between-species interaction networks===
{{main article|social relation}}
In biology, pairwise interactions have historically been the focus of intense study. With the recent advances in [[network science]], it has become possible to scale up pairwise interactions to include individuals of many species involved in many sets of interactions to understand the structure and function of larger [[ecological network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bascompte, J. |title= Disentangling the web of life |journal= Science |year= 2009 |volume=325 |issue= 5939 |pages= 416–419 |doi=10.1126/science.1170749 |pmid=19628856|bibcode=2009Sci...325..416B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] can allow for both the discovery and understanding how these complex interactions link together within the system’s network, a property which has previously been overlooked. This powerful tool allows for the study of various types of interactions (from [[competitive]] to [[cooperative]]) using the same general framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Krause, J. |title= Animal social networks: an introduction |journal= Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.  |year= 2009 |volume= 63 |issue= 7 |pages= 967–973 |doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0747-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, plant-[[pollinator]] interactions are mutually beneficial and often involve many different species of pollinators as well as many different species of plants. These interactions are critical to plant reproduction and thus the accumulation of resources at the base of the [[food chain]] for primary consumers, yet these interaction networks are threatened by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change. The use of network analysis can illuminate how [[pollination network]]s work and may in turn inform conservation efforts.&lt;ref name="Memmott, J., et al. 2004 2605-261"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Memmott, J. |title= Tolerance of pollination networks to species extinctions |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |year= 2004 |volume= 271 |issue= 1557 |pages= 2605–261 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2909|pmid= 15615687 |pmc= 1691904 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within pollination networks, nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with a subset of species that generalists interact with), redundancy (i.e., most plants are pollinated by many pollinators), and [[modularity (networks)|modularity]] play a large role in network stability.&lt;ref name="Memmott, J., et al. 2004 2605-261"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olesen, J., et al. 2007 19891–19896"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Olesen, J. |title= The modularity of pollination networks |journal= PNAS |year= 2007 |volume= 104 |issue= 50 |pages= 19891–19896 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0706375104|pmid= 18056808 |pmc= 2148393 |display-authors=etal|bibcode= 2007PNAS..10419891O }}&lt;/ref&gt; These network properties may actually work to slow the spread of disturbance effects through the system and potentially buffer the pollination network from anthropogenic changes somewhat.&lt;ref name="Olesen, J., et al. 2007 19891–19896"/&gt; More generally, the structure of species interactions within an ecological network can tell us something about the diversity, richness, and robustness of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Campbell, V. |title= Experimental design and the outcome and interpretation of diversity-stability relations |journal= Oikos |year= 2011 |volume= 120 |issue= 3 |pages= 399–408 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18768.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers can even compare current constructions of species interactions networks with historical reconstructions of ancient networks to determine how networks have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lotze, H. |title= Historical changes in marine resources, food-web structure and ecosystem functioning in the Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean |journal= Ecosystems |year= 2011 |volume= 14 |issue= 2 |pages= 198–222 |doi=10.1007/s10021-010-9404-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research into these complex species interactions networks is highly concerned with understanding what factors (e.g., diversity) lead to network stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Romanuk, T. |title= Maintenance of positive diversity-stability relations along a gradient of environmental stress |journal= PLoS ONE |year= 2010 |volume= 5 |issue= 4 |pages= e10378 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010378|display-authors=etal |pmid=20436913 |pmc=2860506|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510378R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within-species interaction networks===
{{main article|social relation}}
Network analysis provides the ability to quantify associations between individuals, which makes it possible to infer details about the network as a whole at the species and/or population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Croft, D.P |title= Social networks in the guppy (Poecilia reticulate) |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |year= 2004 |volume= 271 |issue= Suppl |pages= S516–S519 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0206|pmid= 15801620 |pmc= 1810091 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers interested in animal behavior across a multitude of taxa, from insects to primates, are starting to incorporate network analysis into their research. Researchers interested in social insects (e.g., ants and bees) have used network analyses to better understand division of labor, task allocation, and foraging optimization within colonies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dornhaus, A. |title= Benefits of recruitment in honey bees: Effects of ecology and colony size in an individual-based model |journal= Behavioral Ecology |year= 2006 |volume=17 |issue= 3 |pages= 336–344 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arj036|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Linksvayer, T. |title= Developmental evolution in social insects: Regulatory networks from genes to societies |journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution |year= 2012 |volume=318 |issue= 3 |pages= 159–169 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.22001|pmid= 22544713 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mullen, R. |title= A review of ant algorithms |journal= Expert Systems with Applications |year= 2009 |volume=36 |issue= 6 |pages= 9608–9617 |doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2009.01.020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are interested in how certain network properties at the group and/or population level can explain individual level behaviors.  For instance, a study on wire-tailed manakins (a small passerine bird)  found that a male’s [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] in the network largely predicted the ability of the male to rise in the social hierarchy (i.e. eventually obtain a territory and matings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ryder, T.B. |title= Social networks in the lek-mating wire-tailed manakin (''Pipra filicauda'') |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]  |year= 2008 |volume= 275 |issue= 1641 |pages= 1367–1374 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0205 |pmid=18381257 |pmc=2602714|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[bottlenose dolphin]] groups, an individual’s degree and [[betweenness centrality]] values may predict whether or not that individual will exhibit certain behaviors, like the use of side flopping and upside-down lobtailing to lead group traveling efforts; individuals with high betweenness values are more connected and can obtain more information, and thus are better suited to lead group travel and therefore tend to exhibit these signaling behaviors more than other group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lusseau, D. |title= Evidence for social role in a dolphin social network |journal= Evolutionary Ecology |year= 2007 |volume=21 |issue= 3 |pages= 357–366 |doi=10.1007/s10682-006-9105-0|arxiv= q-bio/0607048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Network analysis can also be used to describe the social organization within a species more generally, which frequently reveals important proximate mechanisms promoting the use of certain behavioral strategies. These descriptions are frequently linked to ecological properties (e.g., resource distribution). For example, network analyses revealed subtle differences in the group dynamics of two related equid [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion]] species, [[Grevy’s zebra]] and [[onager]]s, living in variable environments; Grevy’s zebras show distinct preferences in their association choices when they fission into smaller groups, whereas onagers do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sundaresan, S. |title= Network metrics reveal differences in social organization between two fission-fusion species, Grevy's zebra and onager |journal= Oecologia |year= 2007 |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 140–149 |doi=10.1007/s00442-006-0553-6|pmid= 16964497 |display-authors=etal|bibcode= 2007Oecol.151..140S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, researchers interested in primates have also utilized network analyses to compare social organizations across the diverse [[primate]] order, suggesting that using network measures (such as [[centrality]], [[assortativity]], [[modularity (networks)|modularity]], and betweenness) may be useful in terms of explaining the types of social behaviors we see within certain groups and not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kasper, C. |author2=Voelkl, B. |title= A social network analysis of primate groups |journal= Primates |year= 2009 |volume= 50 |issue=4 |pages= 343–356 |doi=10.1007/s10329-009-0153-2|pmid=19533270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, social network analysis can also reveal important fluctuations in animal behaviors across changing environments. For example, network analyses in female [[chacma baboon]]s (''Papio hamadryas ursinus'') revealed important dynamic changes across seasons which were previously unknown; instead of creating stable, long-lasting social bonds with friends, baboons were found to exhibit more variable relationships which were dependent on short-term contingencies related to group level dynamics as well as environmental variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Henzi, S. |title= Cyclicity in the structure of female baboon social networks |journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |year= 2009 |volume= 63 |issue= 7 |pages= 1015–1021 |doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0720-y|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in an individual's social network environment can also influence characteristics such as 'personality': for example, social spiders that huddle with bolder neighbours tend to increase also in boldness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hunt, ER. |title= Social interactions shape individual and collective personality in social spiders |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year= 2018 |volume= 285 |issue= 1886 |pages= 20181366 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2018.1366|pmid= 30185649 |pmc= 6158534 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very small set of broad examples of how researchers can use network analysis to study animal behavior. Research in this area is currently expanding very rapidly. Social network analysis is a valuable tool for studying animal behavior across all animal species, and has the potential to uncover new information about animal behavior and social ecology that was previously poorly understood.

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Biosocial criminology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that aims to explain crime and [[antisocial behavior]] by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary [[criminology]] has been dominated by [[sociological]] theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="Asghate2011"&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
===Environment===
Environment has a significant effect on genetic expression. Disadvantaged environments enhance antisocial gene expression, suppress prosocial gene action and prevent the realization of genetic potential.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

{{quotation|Genes and environments operating in tandem (interacting) were required to produce significant antisocial behavior, while neither was powerful enough to produce it independent of the other. That is, children genetically at risk for antisocial behavior reared in positive family environments did not display antisocial behavior, and children not at genetic risk did not become antisocial in adverse family environments.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;}}

===Genetics===
One approach to studying the role of genetics for crime is to calculate the [[heritability]] coefficient, which describes the proportion of the [[variance]] that is due to actualized genetic effects for some trait in a given population in a specific environment at a specific time. The heritability coefficient for antisocial behavior is estimated to be between 0.40 and 0.58.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

The methodology often used in biosocial criminology (that of [[twin studies]]) has been criticized for producing inflated heritability estimates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Burt |first=Callie H. |last2=Simons |first2=Ronald L.|authorlink2=Ronald L. Simons |date=2014-05-01 |title=Pulling Back the Curtain on Heritability Studies: Biosocial Criminology in the Postgenomic Era |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12036/abstract |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=223–262 |doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12036 |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; though biosocial criminologists maintain that these criticisms are baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barnes |first=J. C. |last2=Wright |first2=John Paul|authorlink2=John Paul Wright |last3=Boutwell |first3=Brian B. |authorlink3=Brian Boutwell|last4=Schwartz |first4=Joseph A. |last5=Connolly |first5=Eric J. |last6=Nedelec |first6=Joseph L. |last7=Beaver |first7=Kevin M. |authorlink7=Kevin Beaver|date=2014-11-01 |title=Demonstrating the Validity of Twin Research in Criminology |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12049/abstract |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=588–626 |doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12049 |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal justice researchers Brian Boutwell and J.C. Barnes argue that many sociological studies that do not control for genetic inheritance of risk factors have misleading or unreliable results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2016/03/06/crime-genetic-scientists-don-know-because-they-afraid-ask/3lhGUVuNsfdJXjvhtaxPHN/story.html Is crime genetic? Scientists don’t know because they’re afraid to ask]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
Another approach is to examine the relationship between neurophysiology and criminality. One example is that measured levels of neurotransmitters such as [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]] have been associated with criminal behavior. Another is that [[neuroimaging]] studies give strong evidence that both brain structure and function are involved in criminal behaviors. The [[limbic system]] creates emotions such as anger and jealousy that ultimately may cause criminal behavior. The [[prefrontal cortex]] is involved in delaying gratification and impulse control and moderates the impulses from the limbic system. If this balance is shifted in favor of the limbic system this may contribute to criminal behavior. [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] argues that "life-course-persistent offenders" make up only 6% of the population but commits more than 50% of all crimes and that this is due to a combination neurophysiological deficits and an adverse environment that creates a criminal path that is very difficult to break once started.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
Men can potentially have many children with little effort; women only a few with great effort. One argued consequence of this is that males are more [[aggressive]], and more violently aggressive, than females, since they face higher reproductive competition from their own sex than females. In particular, low-status males may be more likely to remain completely childless. Under such circumstances, it may have been evolutionarily useful to take very high risks and use violent aggression in order to try to increase status and reproductive success rather than become genetically extinct. This may explain why males have higher crime rates than females and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. It may also explain why the degree of income inequality of a society is a better predictor than the absolute income level of the society for male-male homicides; income inequality creates social disparity, while differing average income levels may not do so. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Aurelio José Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman. The evolutionary psychology of criminal behaviour. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory" focuses on the hormone [[testosterone]] as a factor influencing aggression and criminality and being beneficial during certain forms of competition.&lt;ref name="psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=
Should We Be More Concerned With Prenatal Exposure In The Prevention Of Crime?|url=http://www.psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com/2015/04/should-we-be-more-concerned-with-prenatal-exposure-in-the-prevention-of-crime//|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males.&lt;ref name="crimetimes.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=MILD TESTOSTERONE REDUCTION EFFECTIVE AGAINST AGGRESSION?|url=http://www.crimetimes.org/95d/w95dp6.htm|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens in correlation with the rise of testosterone levels. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by [[lumbar puncture]], which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used less reliable measurements from blood or saliva. Some studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. A significant link between juvenile delinquency and testosterone levels has not been established. Some studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behavior]] and [[alcoholism]]. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship.&lt;ref name="EllisBeaver2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lee Ellis| author2=Kevin M. Beaver|author3=John Wright| title=Handbook of Crime Correlates| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eD0ttBXoMvQC| date=1 April 2009| publisher=Academic Press| isbn=978-0-12-373612-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts causing homicides involve status conflicts, protecting reputation, and seemingly trivial insults.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against aggression. Therefore, it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation ("[[honor]]"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

Some cultures place greater emphasis on protecting honor than other cultures. One explanation is that protecting honor was in the ancestral past relatively more important for herders than for farmers. The livestock of herders were easily and quickly stolen. As a result, it was important to constantly show toughness as a deterrence, which may cause a higher level of violence. The predictions of the theory was confirmed in a cross-cultural examination of traditional farming and herding Spanish-American societies. However, the prediction that sedentary fishing societies would place a low emphasis on honor was not confirmed.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

The degree of cultural [[collectivism]] is strongly associated with the burden of [[infectious disease]]. It has been argued that this is due to collectivism and associated characteristics such as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] avoidance limiting the spread of infectious diseases. Other characteristics such as strong [[in-group–out-group bias]] and willingness to defend the [[ingroup]]'s honor may promote violence. A study found strong associations between several forms of violent criminal behavior and both infectious disease rates across U.S states and degree of cultural collectivism across U.S. states. The associations remained strong after controlling for income inequality.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

==== Specific forms ====
Evolutionary psychology researchers have proposed several evolutionary explanations for [[psychopathy]]. One is that psychopathy represents a frequency-dependent, socially [[parasitic]] strategy. This may benefit the psychopath as long as there are few other psychopaths in the community since more psychopaths means increasing the risk of encountering another psychopath as well as non-psychopaths likely adapting more countermeasures against cheaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glenn | first1 = A.

[[Sociobiological theories of rape]] are theories that explore to what degree, if any, evolutionary adaptations influence the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.

The [[Cinderella effect]] is the alleged higher rate of [[Stepfamily|stepchildren]] being abused by  [[Stepfamily|stepparents]] as compared to genetic parents, observed in some, but not all, studies. An explanation of this affect has been attempted by application of [[evolutionary psychology]] theories. There have also been various criticisms of these theories.&lt;ref name=DalyWilson2007&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (2007) [http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf Is the "Cinderella Effect" controversial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516102016/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf |date=16 May 2011 }} In Crawford &amp; Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Infanticide]] is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success, in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]] to spend resources on the child, in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liddle | first1 = J.

==== Criminal justice ====
Punishment of exploitative behaviors harmful to the group was likely a recurring problem in the ancestral environment. As such humans are argued to have developed a range of psychological mechanisms for handling this. Punishment can be a deterrent to undesired behaviors but excessive punishment can also be harmful to the group. Thus, human are argued to favor a proportional response based on how severe the offence is. Cross-cultural research have a found a high agreement regarding how relatively harmful different crimes are perceived to be. On the other hand, evolutionary novel factors that may be rational to consider from a deterrent perspective, such as how difficult it is for the modern police to detect the crime, do not seem to affect people's perceptions of appropriate punishments.&lt;ref name=AEP2&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. The evolutionary psychology of Mass Politics. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a crime's severity has been judged, there is a choice regarding how to respond. In some cases in the ancestral environment there may have been benefits from future interactions with the offender which some forms of punishment may have prevented as compared to responses such as reparations or rehabilitation. Research suggests that individuals may modify what they think are appropriate forms of response to offenders based on factors that once in the past small-group environment may have indicated that they could personally benefit from continued interactions with the offender such as kinship, in-group or out-group membership, possession of resources, sexual attractiveness, expressed remorse, intentionality, and prior history of cooperation and exploitation.&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

A simple generalization of the [[black hole]] [[entropy]] bound (cf. [[holographic principle]]) to generic systems is that, in [[quantum gravity]], the maximum entropy which can be enclosed by a spatial boundary is given by a quarter of its surface area. However, as a general rule, this simple generalization appears to be false, because the spatial boundary can be taken to be within the [[event horizon]] of a black hole.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} It also fails in cosmological models.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Raphael Bousso]] came up with a modification that the spatial boundary should not be a [[trapped surface]]. This led him to come up with '''Bousso's holographic bound''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Basically, a spatial boundary is valid if, when one considers both null (or light) sheets orthogonal to its tangent space, the [[expansion factor]]s both point in the same direction. This defines inside and outside. The entropy crossing either (past or future) of the inner or non-expanding null surface (light sheet) is bounded by one quarter of the surface area of the interior region.

Cavitation is the [[Elastic instability|unstable]] unhindered expansion of a microscopic void in a solid elastomer under the action of tensile hydrostatic stresses.  This can occur whenever the hydrostatic tension exceeds 5/6 of [[Young's modulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gent|first=Alan N.|title=Cavitation in Rubber: A Cautionary Tale|journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology|year=1990|volume=63|issue=3|pages=49-53|doi=10.5254/1.3538266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon may manifest in any of the following situations:
* imposed hydrostatic tensile stress acting on a pre-existing void 
* void pressurization due to gases that are generated due to chemical action (as in volatilization of low-molecular weight waxes or oils:  'blowpoint' for insufficiently cured rubber, or 'thermal blowout' for systems operating at very high temperature)
* void pressurization due to gases that come out of solution (as in gases dissolved at high pressure)

A '''certified check''' or '''certified cheque''' is a form of [[cheque]] for which the bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, at the time the cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee.  Thus, a certified cheque cannot be stopped (can't "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).

In some countries, e.g. [[Germany]], it is illegal for a regular [[bank]] to certify checks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/scheckg/art_4.html Art. 4 of the German Cheque Code (Scheckgesetz)]&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation is supposed to prevent certified cheques from becoming a universal substitute for cash, which is considered the only [[legal tender]]. The [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] (Federal Bank) is the only financial institution authorized to issue certified checks.

Because of the liquidity and certainty of payment of a certified cheque, it is sometimes considered equivalent to cash, such as in the regulation of credit for casino gaming in [[Macau]], where the law explicitly states that if a casino patron obtains casino chips and pays with a certified cheque, the transaction is not regarded as credit for gaming (see Law 5/2004, art. 2).

It is possible to counterfeit or forge a certified cheque, in which case it is not binding on the bank and is worthless; see [[cashier's check]] for an exploration of associated risks.

The expression '''computational intelligence''' ('''CI''') usually refers to the ability of a [[computer]] to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation. Even though it is commonly considered a synonym of [[soft computing]], there is still no commonly accepted definition of computational intelligence.

Generally, computational intelligence is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems to which mathematical or traditional modelling can be useless for a few reasons: the processes might be too complex for mathematical reasoning, it might contain some uncertainties during the process, or the process might simply be stochastic in nature.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Intelligence: Synergies of Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks and Evolutionary Computing|last = Siddique |first = Nazmul |last2=Adeli |first2=Hojjat |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-118-53481-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Indeed, many real-life problems cannot be translated into binary language (unique values of 0 and 1) for computers to process it. Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions for such problems.

The methods used are close to the human's way of reasoning, i.e. it uses inexact and incomplete knowledge, and it is able to produce control actions in an adaptive way. CI therefore uses a combination of five main complementary techniques.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt; The [[fuzzy logic]] which enables the computer to [[natural language understanding|understand natural language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Intelligence: Methods and Techniques|last = Rutkowski|first = Leszek|publisher = Springer|year = 2008|isbn = 978-3-540-76288-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="Fuzzy Logic"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fuzzy-logic|title = Fuzzy Logic|date = July 2006 |website = WhatIs.com|publisher = Margaret Rouse|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[artificial neural network]]s which permits the system to learn experiential data by operating like the biological one, [[Evolutionary computation|evolutionary computing]], which is based on the process of natural selection, learning theory, and probabilistic methods which helps dealing with uncertainty imprecision.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt;

Except those main principles, currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms such as [[swarm intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[artificial immune system]]s, which can be seen as a part of [[evolutionary computation]], image processing, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, which tends to be confused with Computational Intelligence. But although both Computational Intelligence (CI) and [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) seek similar goals, there's a clear distinction between them{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Computational Intelligence is thus a way of performing like human beings{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. Indeed, the characteristic of "intelligence" is usually attributed{{by whom|date=October 2017}} to humans. More recently, many products and items also claim to be "intelligent", an attribute which is directly linked to the reasoning and decision making{{explain|date=October 2017}}.

== History&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ethw.org/IEEE_Computational_Intelligence_Society_History|title = IEEE Computational Intelligence Society History|date = July 22, 2014|accessdate = 2015-10-30|website = Engineering and Technology history Wiki|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The notion of Computational Intelligence was first used by the IEEE Neural Networks Council in 1990. This Council was founded in the 1980s by a group of researchers interested in the development of biological and artificial neural networks. On November 21, 2001, the IEEE Neural Networks Council became the IEEE Neural Networks Society, to become the [[IEEE Computational Intelligence Society]] two years later by including new areas of interest such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation, which they related to Computational Intelligence in 2011 (Dote and Ovaska).

But the first clear definition of Computational Intelligence was introduced by Bezdek in 1994:&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt; a system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the AI sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptively, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.

Bezdek and Marks (1993) clearly differentiated CI from AI, by arguing that the first one is based on [[soft computing]] methods, whereas AI is based on hard computing ones.

== Difference between Computational and Artificial Intelligence ==
Although Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence seek a similar long-term goal: reach [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]], which is the intelligence of a machine that could perform any intellectual task that a human being can; there's a clear difference between them. According to Bezdek (1994), Computational Intelligence is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

There are two types of machine intelligence: the artificial one based on hard computing techniques and the computational one based on soft computing methods, which enable adaptation to many situations.

Hard computing techniques work following binary logic based on only two values (the Booleans true or false, 0 or 1) on which modern computers are based. One problem with this logic is that our natural language cannot always be translated easily into absolute terms of 0 and 1. Soft computing techniques, based on fuzzy logic can be useful here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artificial Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, SoftComputing, Natural Computation - what's the difference? - ANDATA|url = http://www.andata.at/en/answer/artificial-intelligence-computational-intelligence-softcomputing-natural-computation-whats-the-difference.html|website = www.andata.at|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much closer to the way the human brain works by aggregating data to partial truths (Crisp/fuzzy systems), this logic is one of the main exclusive aspects of CI.

Within the same principles of fuzzy and binary ''logics'' follow crispy and fuzzy ''systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fuzzy Sets and Pattern Recognition|url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall07/cos436/HIDDEN/Knapp/fuzzy002.htm|website = www.cs.princeton.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisp logic is a part of artificial intelligence principles and consists of either including an element in a set, or not, whereas fuzzy systems (CI) enable elements to be partially in a set. Following this logic, each element can be given a degree of membership (from 0 to 1) and not exclusively one of these 2 values.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pfeifer. 2013. Chapter 5: FUZZY Logic. Lecture notes on "Real-world computing". Zurich. University of Zurich.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The five main principles of CI and its applications ==
The main applications of Computational Intelligence include [[computer science]], engineering, [[data analysis]] and [[bio-medicine]].

=== Fuzzy logic ===
As explained before, [[fuzzy logic]], one of CI's main principles, consists in measurements and process modelling made for real life's complex processes.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy Logic" /&gt; It can face incompleteness, and most importantly ignorance of data in a process model, contrarily to Artificial Intelligence, which requires exact knowledge.

This technique tends to apply to a wide range of domains such as control, [[image processing]] and decision making. But it is also well introduced in the field of household appliances with washing machines, microwave ovens, etc. We can face it too when using a video camera, where it helps stabilizing the image while holding the camera unsteadily. Other areas such as medical diagnostics, foreign exchange trading and business strategy selection are apart from this principle's numbers of applications.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt;

Fuzzy logic is mainly useful for approximate reasoning, and doesn't have learning abilities,&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt; a qualification much needed that human beings have.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} It enables them to improve themselves by learning from their previous mistakes.

=== Neural networks ===
This is why CI experts work on the development of [[artificial neural network]]s based on the [[Biological neural network|biological ones]], which can be defined by 3 main components: the cell-body which processes the information, the axon, which is a device enabling the signal conducting, and the synapse, which controls signals. Therefore, artificial neural networks are doted of distributed information processing systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Neural Networks |url =http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol4/cs11/report.html|last = Stergiou |first = Christos |last2=Siganos |first2=Dimitrios |date = |journal = SURPRISE 96 Journal |publisher=[[Imperial College London]] |doi = |pmid = |access-date = March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the process and the learning from experiential data. Working like human beings, fault tolerance is also one of the main assets of this principle.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt;

Concerning its applications, neural networks can be classified into five groups: data analysis and classification, associative memory, clustering generation of patterns and control.&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt; Generally, this method aims to analyze and classify medical data, proceed to face and fraud detection, and most importantly deal with nonlinearities of a system in order to control it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/dahe7472/Organizational%20Research%20Methods-2009-Somers-403-17.pdf|title = Using Artificial Neural Networks to Model Nonlinearity|last = Somers |first= Mark John |last2= Casal|first2 = Jose C.|date = July 2009|journal = Organizational Research Methods |volume=12 |number=3 |doi = 10.1177/1094428107309326 |access-date = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, neural networks techniques share with the fuzzy logic ones the advantage of enabling [[data clustering]].

=== Evolutionary computation ===
Based on the process of [[Evolution|natural selection]] firstly introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Charles Robert Darwin]], the evolutionary computation consists in capitalizing on the strength of natural evolution to bring up new artificial evolutionary methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evolutionary Computation:A Unified Approach|last = De Jong |first = K. |publisher = MIT Press|year = 2006|isbn = 9780262041942|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} It also includes other areas such as evolution strategy, and [[evolutionary algorithm]]s which are seen as problem solvers... This principle's main applications cover areas such as [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] and [[multi-objective optimization]], to which traditional mathematical one techniques aren't enough anymore to apply to a wide range of problems such as [[DNA Analysis]], scheduling problems...&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt;

=== Learning theory ===
Still looking for a way of "reasoning" close to the humans' one, [[computational learning theory|learning theory]] is one of the main approaches of CI. In psychology, learning is the process of bringing together cognitive, emotional and environmental effects and experiences to acquire, enhance or change knowledge, skills, values and world views (Ormrod, 1995; Illeris, 2004).&lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt; Learning theories then helps understanding how these effects and experiences are processed, and then helps making predictions based on previous experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2014-2015/clt/|title = Computational Learning Theory: 2014-2015|date = |accessdate = February 11, 2015|website = University of Oxford |publisher = University of Oxford|last = Worrell|first = James|others = Presentation page of CLT course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic methods ===
Being one of the main elements of fuzzy logic, probabilistic methods firstly introduced by [[Paul Erdős|Paul Erdos]] and [[Joel Spencer]] &lt;ref name="Siddique &amp; Adeli" /&gt;(1974), aim to evaluate the outcomes of a Computation Intelligent system, mostly defined by [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Intelligence in Time Series Forecasting : Theory and Engineering Applications|last = Palit |first = Ajoy K. |last2=Popovic |first2=Dobrivoje |publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year = 2006 |isbn = 9781846281846 |location = |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, probabilistic methods bring out the possible solutions to a reasoning problem, based on prior knowledge.

'''Critical ethnography''' applies a [[critical theory]] based approach to [[ethnography]]. It  focuses on the implicit values expressed within ethnographic studies and, therefore, on the unacknowledged biases that may result from such implicit values.&lt;ref name="sagepub"&gt;Soyini Madison, D. (2005). Critical ethnography: method, ethics, and performance. Retrieved from http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4957_Madison_I_Proof_Chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called critical theory in practice.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, J. (1993). Doing critical ethnography. Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  of critical theory, this approach seeks to determine symbolic mechanisms, to extract ideology from action, and to understand the cognition and behaviour of research subjects within historical, cultural, and social frameworks.

Critical ethnography incorporates reflexive inquiry into its methodology. Researchers employing this approach position themselves as being intrinsically linked to those being studied and thus inseparable from their context.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon, R. I., &amp; Dippo, D. (1986). On critical ethnographic work. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 17(4), 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to speaking on behalf of subjects, critical ethnographers will also attempt to recognize and articulate their own perspective as a means of acknowledging the biases that their own limitations, histories, and institutional standpoints bear on their work.&lt;ref name="sagepub" /&gt; Further, critical ethnography is inherently political as well as pedagogical in its approach.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; There is no attempt to be purely detached and scientifically objective in reporting and analysis. In contrast to conventional ethnography which describes what is, critical ethnography also asks what could be in order to disrupt tacit power relationships and perceived social inequalities.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

==History==
Critical ethnography stems from both [[anthropology]] and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (2003). Musings on critical ethnography, meanings, and symbolic violence. In R.P. Clair (Ed.), ''Expressions of Ethnography''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[movements for civil rights]] of the 1960s and 1970s some ethnographers became more politically active and experimented in various ways to incorporate emancipatory political projects into their research.&lt;ref&gt;Noblit, G. W., Flores, S. Y., &amp; Murillo, E. G. (2004). Postcritical ethnography: An introduction. Cress, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some ethnographers with political agendas for change chose to conduct fieldwork in unconventional environments such as modern workplaces that were not necessarily considered exotic, as previous anthropologists had typically done.&lt;ref name="sagepub" /&gt; Other ethnographers consciously attempted to conduct research on so-called deviant or suppressed groups from outside the paradigm of hegemonic cultural positionings to provide new avenues for dissent and dialogue on societal transformation.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;

'''Deepak Tripathi''', PhD, FRHistS, FRAS (born 1951) is a British historian with particular reference to [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]], the [[Cold War]] and the United States in the post-Soviet world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technologysource.org/author/deepak_tripathi/ The Technology Source Archives – Deepak Tripathi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/rhsfellows-t.pdf Royal Historical Society – Royal Historical Society Fellows]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career==

Tripathi was born into a political family in [[Unnao]], Uttar Pradesh, India. His grandfather, [[Pandit Vishwambhar Dayal Tripathi]], was a prominent leader in [[India]]'s independence movement, Member of the Constituent Assembly, and later of the [[Indian Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/members.htm#UNITED%20%20PROVINCES Members of the Constituent Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Krishna Dev Tripathi, was also a parliamentarian and an academic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://164.100.24.209/newls/lokprev.aspx Lok Sabha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210185843/http://164.100.24.209/newls/lokprev.aspx |date=10 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year at Aligarh Muslim University,&lt;ref name="Aligarh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amualumni.8m.com/Legends.htm#Journalism |title=Journalism Legends |publisher=Alumni of Aligarh Muslim University |work=AMU Alumni – Legends of History |accessdate=24 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016100159/http://www.amualumni.8m.com/Legends.htm#Journalism |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tripathi graduated from Christian College, [[Indore]] in 1973 with a BA in [[Political science|Politics]], Economics, [[Sociology]] and [[English studies|English]]. He then did a year of graduate study at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in New Delhi.

From 1974, Tripathi worked for the [[Voice of America]] in Washington, D.C. for 3 years.

In 1977, Tripathi worked with the [[BBC]] as a South Asia [[correspondent]], [[BBC News]] producer, and editor for the World Service Radio News. He was [[Afghanistan]] correspondent in the early 1990s in [[Kabul]]. He has reported from [[Sri Lanka]], India, [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Syria]].

In 2002, Tripathi completed a [[Postgraduate diploma|Post-Graduate Diploma]] in [[Administration of business|Business Administration]] from [[Edinburgh Business School]] of [[Heriot-Watt University]], Scotland.

From 2002, at the University of Sussex, Tripathi researched the [[Cold War]] Afghan conflict. This led to his well-received book on Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Hillstrom, David (2011) Review of ‘Breeding Ground’ by Deepak Tripathi, '' Foreign Policy Journal'', 4 March&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/old/view_article_details.php?id=16542 Moore, Chris(2011) Review of ‘Breeding Ground’ by Deepak Tripathi, ''Palestine Chronicle'', 01/11/2011 (Accessed Nov 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tripathi received his [[Doctorate]] in social science from the [http://www.roehampton.ac.uk University of Roehampton], where he was an Honorary Fellow at the Crucible Centre for Human Rights Research from 2012 to 2015, and is currently an associate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/crucible/people/ Crucible Centre for Human Rights Research]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his dissertation "A Critical Study of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars" under the supervision of Professor [[Martin Shaw (sociologist)]], known for his work on war, genocide and global politics.

In 2013, Tripathi was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Historical Society]], and a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]].

Tripathi writes on the effects of superpower rivalries in South Asia and the Middle East, and on U.S. policy in the region, for publications including [[Al Jazeera]], [[Al-Ahram]], [[History News Network]], [[CounterPunch]], [[AlterNet]], and [[ZNet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://deepaktripathi.wordpress.com/ Reflections]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of his work==
Tripathi has received praise from various reviewers&lt;ref name=Cohn /&gt;&lt;ref name="FPJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baroud /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=16542 | title=Palestine Chronicle | publisher=palestinechronicle.com | work=Breeding Ground – Book Review | accessdate=25 November 2011 | author=Moore, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoppa&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-bookworm/2010/03/tomorrows_titles_2.html Schoppa, Christopher (2010) Review of Tripathi, D.

==='Breeding Ground'===
Marjorie Cohn, in the [[History News Network]], writes of 'Breeding Ground': ''"Tripathi’s excellent work ends with a call to replace the military strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan with development, reconciliation, and reconstruction."'' and ''"Breeding Ground makes a significant contribution toward understanding the origins and triggers of terrorism.  Tripathi traces the development of a ‘culture of violence’ in Afghanistan—largely due to resistance against foreign invasion—from the “U.S.-led proxy war” against the USSR to the current U.S. war."''&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;Marjorie Cohn: Review of Deepak Tripathi, "Breeding Ground: Afghanistan and the Origins of Islamist Terrorism" (Potomac Books, Inc., 2011) [http://hnn.us/node/141328 George Mason University's History News Network]. Retrieved 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hillstrom, in the Foreign Policy Journal, describes 'Breeding Ground' as a "concise yet powerful book" which details the dangerously interlocking decisions and ill-thought-through strategies that inflamed the Afghan conflict.&lt;ref name="FPJ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/04/review-of-breeding-ground-by-deepak-tripathi/ | title=Foreign Policy Journal | publisher=Foreign Policy Journal | work=Review of ‘Breeding Ground’ by Deepak Tripathi | date=4 March 2011 | accessdate=24 November 2011 | author=Hillstrom, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hillstrom, Tripathi used a broad array of sources that only recently became available from both US and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archives. He writes that the tragedy is that Afghanistan, which has now been at war for 40 years, has suffered the same before, from the '[[Great Game]]' that the [[Russian Empire]] played with the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century; the players then as now had "simplistic strategic goals" but only "a shallow understanding" of Afghanistan itself. Hillstrom finds that Tripathi sums up the tragedy beautifully by closing his book with a quote from [[Tolstoy]]:&lt;ref name="FPJ" /&gt;

: ''“In all history there is no war which was not hatched by the governments, the governments alone, independent of the interests of the people, to whom war is always pernicious, even when successful.”''&lt;ref name="FPJ" /&gt;

==='Overcoming The Bush Legacy in Iraq and Afghanistan'===
Ramzy Baroud, in the Global Research, writes of 'Overcoming The Bush Legacy in Iraq and Afghanistan': ''"While reputable author and world renowned journalist Deepak Tripathi agrees with this grim view [of the poor outcomes of Western intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan], he doesn’t think all is lost. He believes that there is still a chance, an opportunity even to redress the injustice and reverse the terrible mistakes that were made. A compelling writer and a meticulous researcher, Tripathi’s work is both gripping and comprehensive. His latest book, 'Overcoming The Bush Legacy in Iraq and Afghanistan' serves as a glaring reminder of what military power can do when it goes unchecked, and when it is combined with religious fanaticism or misguided political ideology."''&lt;ref name=Baroud&gt;Ramzy Baroud.

==='Imperial Designs'===
Greta Morris, a retired US diplomat, writes in her review of 'Imperial Designs' in American Diplomacy: "As policymakers, scholars and citizens seek to understand the increasingly bitter and violent conflicts in the Middle East and the escalating anger and terrorist acts against the West (particularly the U.S.), Deepak Tripathi's Imperial Designs offers important perspectives and insights. Tripathi's book is subtitled 'War, Humiliation and the Making of History,' and his theme is the role of humiliation in international politics. Specifically, he argues that the humiliation of a state or people by a more powerful state (or states) through political manipulation and military defeat profoundly influences the subsequent actions of the humiliated people, including their desire for revenge." Morris concludes the review with her comment: "Tripathi's excellent summation of past events in the Middle East and his cogent analysis of their continuing implications should be required reading for all who are dealing directly with this troubled region, as well as those seeking to understand it and its relations with the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Morris.

'''DIPROMISTO''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: ДІПРОМІСТО) is a research and planning institute in the field of spatial and urban planning in Ukraine. It is a state enterprise within the field of governance of the [[Ministry of Regional Development (Ukraine)|Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine]]. It was established on September 12, 1930. Its full name is ''State Enterprise Y.Bilokon Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design "DIPROMISTO"''.
&lt;br /&gt;In Russian language sources it is also known as Giprograd ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Гипроград). During Soviet times it was a system of planning institutes consisting of the central institute in Kyiv and a range of affiliates in oblasts' centres of USSR. In due time, most of the affiliates separated from the Dipromisto system into separate institutes. Currently the Institute has three affiliates: Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, and Volyn affiliates.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 3 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dipromisto Team1930.jpg|thumb|300px|Dipromisto's team in 1933 or 1934.|left]]
The Institute “DIPROMISTO” was established on September 12, 1930. According to the Government of Ukrainian SSR Statute, the Institute had been assigned the tasks of urban planning, design residential and community buildings, and scientific work in the field of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; During the pre-war period, Dipromisto’s team had produced a great amount of projects on regional planning in the most significant industrial regions, planning of cities and villages, design of community facilities, residential and public buildings, allocation of new industrial development, guidance and control on construction, scientific elaboration of key issues in spatial and urban planning, and experimental and standard design.&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 6 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During 1943-44 the key task of the Institute was to identify the loss to urban economies caused by war and define top-priority measures to assist the recovery of the cities of Ukrainian SSR. The huge destruction caused by war events in cities and villages demanded not only wide planning measures, but also new approaches to solving problems in the sphere of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; In the 1950s, the attention of planners turned to verdurization and improvement of cities and villages, and the formation of their architectural view and landscape. In relation to such tendencies in 1962 a new architectural-planning workshop on resort-recreational objects design was created in the Institute in which both theoretical and practical works on resort design and typification have been made. In 1960-70s a landscape workshop was formed in the Institute in which the works on landscape reconstruction of green plantations and natural landscapes organisation have been designed.
[[File:Dipromisto Bilokon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Yurii Mykolayovych Bilokon''', &lt;br /&gt; Director of the Institute in 1993-2009, &lt;br /&gt; People’s Architect of Ukraine]]Having started in late 1960s the work on schemes of regional planning for 25 Oblasts of Ukrainian SSR lasted until 1989. In 1985 the Institute “DIPROMISTO” started working on Summary Scheme of Regional Planning of Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="Book3"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 9 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex scheme the versatile analyses of territorial resources and the state of environment, settlement systems, social, engineer and transport infrastructure has been given. &lt;br /&gt; With obtaining the state independence by Ukraine the tasks of revaluation of factors of regions and the whole state development, defining new priority axes of development, reorganisation of settlement system in consideration with political and economic changes, providing the integrated intrastate system of spatial and urban development, taking into account a market relations in planning of settlements development had arisen ahead of the experts in the field of spatial and urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; Since the beginning of 1990s an active work on implementation of geographical information technologies into spatial and urban planning is carried out in the Institute. Already in 1991-1993 the experts of the Institute “DIPROMISTO” have elaborated geographical information system for the purposes of urban planning – MISTO. Since 1995 the Base Center on implementation of GIS into spatial and urban planning is functioning in the structure of the Institute. Already in the end of 1995 it became evident that further usage of own software wasn’t enough to solve the tasks arisen before the Center and the whole Institute. Consequently, an active implementation of software products by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] – the leader in GIS software production – had been started. Such technological re-equipment allowed not only to rise significantly the quality of spatial and urban planning works, but also to come to rethinking of methodology of both spatial and urban planning and of regions and settlements governing development.&lt;br /&gt;The strengthening of the Institute in conditions of independent Ukraine has been realized under the direction of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon, Doctor of Architecture, Professor, People’s Architect of Ukraine. The activity of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon in the Institute has been wide and versatile – as a talented architect, who was highly aware of the problems of both planning and architectural design, he made a lot for improvement and development of the Institute functioning. Yurii Bilokon became one of the initiators of spatial planning of cross-border regions and elaborated methodological basis for these works. Bilokon Y.M. paid a great attention to scientific activity development in the Institute, education of the next generation of experts having been created a scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud"&lt;ref name="АМБ"&gt;[http://www.knuba.edu.ua/ukr/?page_id=554 Information about the scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud" on the web-page of the Department of Urban Planning of Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; on the base of the Institute in collaboration with the Department of Urban Planning of [[Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]], implementation of the latest information technologies into the productive activity.&lt;br /&gt;In 2009 in gratitude for 16 years of the talented leadership and in memory of the passionate role of Yurii Bilokon’s personality in the development of the Institute, the staff has initiated to name the Institute “DIPROMISTO” after Y.M.Bilokon which was adopted by the Order of the Ministry of Regional Development of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;[http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/FIN60585.html The Order of the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine from October, 26, 2010 No. 415 “About Renaming of  the State enterprise Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design “Dipromisto”]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electrostatic generator''', or '''electrostatic machine''', is an [[electric generator|electromechanical generator]] that produces ''[[static electricity]]'', or electricity at [[high voltage]] and low [[continuous current]]. The knowledge of static electricity dates back to the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying [[phenomenon]], without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of [[electricity]]. Electrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform [[mechanical work]] into [[electric energy]]. Electrostatic generators develop [[electrostatic]] [[electrical charge|charge]]s of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only electric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry electric charge to a high [[Electric potential|potential]] [[electrode]].  The charge is generated by one of two methods: either the [[triboelectric effect]] (friction) or [[electrostatic induction]].

==Description==
Electrostatic machines are typically used in science classrooms to safely demonstrate electrical forces and high voltage phenomena. The elevated potential differences achieved have been also used for a variety of practical applications, such as operating X-ray tubes, medical applications, sterilization of food, and nuclear physics experiments. Electrostatic generators such as the [[Van de Graaff generator]], and variations as the [[Pelletron]], also find use in physics research.

Electrostatic generators can be divided into two categories depending on how the charge is generated:
*Friction machines use the [[triboelectric effect]] (electricity generated by contact or friction)
*Influence machines use [[electrostatic induction]]

===Friction machines===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Van de Graaff generator]] --&gt;

====History====
[[File:Elektrisiermaschine.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Typical friction machine using a glass globe, common in the 18th century]]

[[File:Electrostatic generator Teylers Museum.jpg|thumb|222px|Martinus van Marum's [[Large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|Electrostatic generator]] at [[Teylers Museum]]]]

The first electrostatic generators are called ''friction machines'' because of the [[friction]] in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by [[Otto von Guericke]], using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and was not intended to produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues),&lt;ref&gt;See:

[[Isaac Newton]] suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Opticks|Optics, 8th Query]]&lt;/ref&gt; About 1706 [[Francis Hauksbee]] improved the basic design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauksbee|first=Francis|title=Psicho-Mechanical Experiments On Various Subjects|year=1709|publisher=R. Brugis}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a woollen cloth.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Pumfrey|title=Hauksbee, Francis (bap. 1660, d. 1713)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=May 2009| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12618|accessdate=2011-12-11|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12618}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generators were further advanced when, about 1730, Prof. [[Georg Matthias Bose]] of Wittenberg added a collecting conductor (an insulated tube or cylinder supported on silk strings). Bose was the first to employ the "[[prime conductor]]" in such machines, this consisting of an iron rod held in the hand of a person whose body was insulated by standing on a block of resin.

In 1746, [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]]'s machine had a large wheel turning several glass globes, with a sword and a gun barrel suspended from silk cords for its prime conductors. [[Johann Heinrich Winckler]], professor of physics at [[Leipzig]], substituted a leather cushion for the hand. During 1746, [[Jan Ingenhousz]] invented electric machines made of plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;Consult Dr. [[Joseph Constantine Carpue|Carpue]]'s [https://archive.org/details/b22042684 'Introduction to Electricity and Galvanism'], London 1803.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery of the [[Leyden Jar]]. This early form of the [[capacitor]], with conductive coatings on either side of the glass, can accumulate a charge of electricity when connected with a source of electromotive force.

The electric machine was soon further improved by [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew (Andreas) Gordon]], a Scotsman and professor at Erfurt, who substituted a glass cylinder in place of a glass globe; and by Giessing of Leipzig who added a "rubber" consisting of a cushion of woollen material. The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]] about 1746, and in 1762, [[John Canton]] of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball electroscope) improved the efficiency of electric machines by sprinkling an amalgam of tin over the surface of the rubber.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;Maver, William Jr.: "Electricity, its History and Progress", The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol. X, pp. 172ff. (1918). New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768, [[Jesse Ramsden]] constructed a widely used version of a plate electrical generator.{{clarify|date=August 2018}}

In 1783, Dutch scientist [[Martin van Marum]] of Haarlem designed a [[large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|large electrostatic machine]] of high quality with glass disks 1.65 meters in diameter for his experiments. Capable of producing voltage with either polarity, it was built under his supervision by [[John Cuthbertson (instrument maker)|John Cuthbertson]] of Amsterdam the following year. The generator is currently on display at the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem.
 
In 1785, N. Rouland constructed a silk-belted machine that rubbed two grounded tubes covered with hare fur. [[Edward Nairne]] developed an electrostatic generator for medical purposes in 1787 that had the ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad. The [[Winter machine]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} possessed higher efficiency than earlier friction machines. 

In the 1830s, [[Georg Ohm]] possessed a machine similar to the Van Marum machine for his research (which is now at the [[Deutsches Museum]], Munich, Germany). In 1840, the [[Woodward machine]] was developed by improving the 1768 Ramsden machine, placing the prime conductor above the disk(s). Also in 1840, the [[Armstrong Hydroelectric Machine|Armstrong hydroelectric machine]] was developed, using steam as a charge carrier.

====Friction operation====
The presence of [[surface charge]] imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces.  This surface charge imbalance, which leads to static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomenon of the [[triboelectric effect]].  Rubbing two non-conductive objects generates a great amount of static electricity.  This is not the result of friction;  two non-conductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on top of the other.  Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing.  Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces.  Usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge.  Some examples of these substances are [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[pith]].  [[conductor (material)|Conductive]] objects in contact generate charge imbalance too, but retain the charges only if insulated.  The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Note that the presence of [[electric current]] does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the [[corona discharge]], or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.

===Influence machines===

====History====
Frictional machines were, in time, gradually superseded by the second class of instrument mentioned above, namely, ''influence machines''. These operate by [[electrostatic induction]] and convert mechanical work into electrostatic energy by the aid of a small initial charge which is continually being replenished and reinforced. The first suggestion of an influence machine appears to have grown out of the invention of [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]]'s ''[[electrophorus]]''. The electrophorus is a single-plate [[capacitor]] used to produce imbalances of [[electric charge]] via the process of [[electrostatic induction]].

The next step was when [[Abraham Bennet]], the inventor of the gold leaf [[electroscope]], described a "''doubler of electricity''" (Phil. Trans., 1787), as a device similar to the electrophorus, but that could amplify a small charge by means of repeated manual operations with three insulated plates, in order to make it observable in an electroscope. [[Erasmus Darwin]], W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. [[Francis Ronalds]] automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his [[Electric telegraph#First working systems|electric telegraph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

His instrument was described as "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (Phil. Trans., 1788, p.&amp;nbsp;403) Nicholson later described  a "spinning condenser" apparatus, as a better instrument for measurements.

Others, including [[Tiberius Cavallo|T. Cavallo]] (who developed the "[[Cavallo multiplier]]", a charge multiplier using simple addition, in 1795), [[John Read (inventor)|John Read]], [[Charles Bernard Desormes]], and [[Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette]], developed further various forms of rotating doublers. In 1798, The German scientist and preacher Gottlieb Christoph Bohnenberger, described the [[Bohnenberger machine]], along with several other doublers of Bennet and Nicholson types in a book. The most interesting of these were described in the "Annalen der Physik" (1801). [[Giuseppe Belli (physicist)|Giuseppe Belli]], in 1831, developed a simple symmetrical doubler which consisted of two curved metal plates between which revolved a pair of plates carried on an insulating stem. It was the first symmetrical influence machine, with identical structures for both terminals. This apparatus was reinvented several times, by [[C.&amp;nbsp;F. Varley]], that patented a high power version in 1860, by [[Lord Kelvin]] (the "replenisher") 1868, and by A.&amp;nbsp;D. Moore (the "dirod"), more recently. Lord Kelvin also devised a combined influence machine and electromagnetic machine, commonly called a [[mouse mill]], for electrifying the ink in connection with his [[siphon recorder]], and a water-drop electrostatic generator (1867), which he called the "''[[water-dropping condenser]]''".

=====Holtz machine=====
[[File:Holtz influence machine.jpg|thumb|160px|Holtz's influence machine]]

Between 1864 and 1880, [[Wilhelm Holtz|W. T. B. Holtz]] constructed and described a large number of influence machines which were considered the most advanced developments of the time. In one form, the [[Holtz machine]] consisted of a glass disk mounted on a horizontal axis which could be made to rotate at a considerable speed by a multiplying gear, interacting with induction plates mounted in a fixed disk close to it. In 1865, [[August Toepler|August J. I. Toepler]] developed an influence machine that consisted of two disks fixed on the same shaft and rotating in the same direction. In 1868, the [[Schwedoff machine]] had a curious structure to increase the output current. Also in 1868, several mixed friction-influence machine were developed, including the [[Kundt machine]] and the [[Carré machine]].  In 1866, the [[Piche machine]] (or [[Bertsch machine]]) was developed. In 1869, H. Julius Smith received the American patent for a portable and airtight device that was designed to ignite powder. Also in 1869, sectorless machines in Germany were investigated by [[Johann Christian Poggendorff|Poggendorff]].

The action and efficiency of influence machines were further investigated by [[Francesco Rossetti|F. Rossetti]], [[Augusto Righi|A. Righi]], and [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]]. [[Éleuthère Mascart|E. E. N. Mascart]], [[A. Roiti]], and [[E. Bouchotte]] also examined the efficiency and current producing power of influence machines. In 1871, sectorless machines were investigated by Musaeus. In 1872, [[Righi's electrometer]] was developed and was one of the first antecedents of the Van de Graaff generator. In 1873, Leyser developed the [[Leyser machine]], a variation of the Holtz machine. In 1880, [[Robert Voss]] (a Berlin instrument maker) devised a form of machine in which he claimed that the principles of Toepler and Holtz were combined. The same structure become also known as the ''Toepler-Holtz'' machine.

=====Wimshurst machine=====
[[File:Wimshurst.jpg|thumb|A small Wimshurst machine]]
In 1878, the British inventor [[James Wimshurst]] started his studies about electrostatic generators, improving the Holtz machine, in a powerful version with multiple disks. The classical [[Wimshurst machine]], that became the most popular form of influence machine, was reported to the scientific community by 1883, although previous machines with very similar structures were previously described by Holtz and Musaeus.  In 1885, one of the largest-ever Wimshurst machines was built in England (it is now at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Chicago Museum of Science and Industry]]). The [[Wimshurst machine]] is a considerably simple machine; it works, as all influence machines, with electrostatic induction of charges, which means that it uses even the slightest existing charge to create and accumulate more charges, and repeats this process for as long as the machine is in action. Wimshurst machines are composed of: two insulated disks attached to pulleys of opposite rotation, the disks have small conductive (usually metal) plates on their outward-facing sides; two double-ended brushes that serve as charge stabilizers and are also the place where induction happens, creating the new charges to be collected; two pairs of collecting combs, which are, as the name implies, the collectors of electrical charge produced by the machine; two Leyden Jars, the capacitors of the machine; a pair of electrodes, for the transfer of charges once they have been sufficiently accumulated. The simple structure and components of the Wimshurst Machine make it a common choice for a homemade electrostatic experiment or demonstration, these characteristics were factors that contributed to its popularity, as previously mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Queiroz|first=A.

In 1887, Weinhold modified the Leyser machine with a system of vertical metal bar inductors with wooden cylinders close to the disk for avoiding polarity reversals. [[M. L. Lebiez]] described the [[Lebiez machine]], that was essentially a simplified [[Voss machine]] (''L'Électricien'', April 1895, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–227). In 1893, Bonetti patented a machine with the structure of the Wimshurst machine, but without metal sectors in the disks.&lt;ref&gt;Bonetti, "Une machine électrostatique, genre Wimshurst, sans secteurs et invisible" [An electrostatic machine of the Wimshurst type, without visible sectors], French patent no. 232,623 (issued:  September 5, 1893).

On p. 418, French lighting engineer Georges Pellissier describes what is essentially a Bonetti machine:  " ''… la machine de Wimshurst pourrait, en effet, être construite avec des plateaux de verre unis et des peignes au lieu de brosses aux extrémités des conducteurs diamétraux.  L'amorçage au départ devrait être fait à l'aide d'une source étrangère, placée, par example, en face de A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, à l'extérieur.''"  ( … Wimshurst's machine could, in effect, be constructed with plain glass plates and with combs in place of brushes at the ends of the diametrical conductors.  The initial charging could be done with the aid of an external source placed, for example, opposite and outside of [section] A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [of the glass disk].)  Pellissier then states that "the role of the metallic sectors of the Wimshurst machine seems to be primarily, in effect, to facilitate its automatic starting and to reduce the influence of atmospheric humidity."&lt;/ref&gt; This machine is significantly more powerful than the sectored version, but it must usually be started with an externally applied charge.

=====Pidgeon machine=====
In 1898, the [[Pidgeon machine]] was developed with a unique setup by [[W. R. Pidgeon]]. On October 28 that year, Pidgeon presented this machine to the Physical Society after several years of investigation into influence machines (beginning at the start of the decade). The device was later reported in the ''Philosophical Magazine'' (December 1898, pg. 564) and the ''Electrical Review'' (Vol. XLV, pg. 748). A Pidgeon machine possesses fixed [[inductor]]s arranged in a manner that increases the [[electrostatic induction |electrostatic induction effect]] (and its electrical output is at least double that of typical machines of this type [except when it is overtaxed]). The essential features of the Pidgeon machine are, one, the combination of the rotating support and the fixed support for inducing charge, and, two, the improved insulation of all parts of the machine (but more especially of the generator's carriers). Pidgeon machines are a combination of a Wimshurst Machine and Voss Machine, with special features adapted to reduce the amount of charge leakage. Pidgeon machines excite themselves more readily than the best of these types of machines. In addition, Pidgeon investigated higher current "triplex" section machines (or "double machines with a single central disk") with enclosed sectors (and went on to receive British Patent 22517 (1899) for this type of machine).

Multiple disk machines and "triplex" electrostatic machines (generators with three disks) were also developed extensively around the turn of the 20th century. In 1900, [[F. Tudsbury]] discovered that enclosing a generator in a metallic chamber containing [[compressed air]], or better, [[carbon dioxide]], the [[Electrical insulation|insulating properties]] of compressed gases enabled a greatly improved effect to be obtained owing to the increase in the breakdown voltage of the compressed gas, and reduction of the leakage across the plates and insulating supports. In 1903, [[Alfred Wehrsen]] patented an ebonite rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the disk surface. In 1907, [[Heinrich Wommelsdorf]] reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; "[[Wehrsen machine]]").  Wommelsdorf also developed several high-performance electrostatic generators, of which the best known were his "Condenser machines" (1920). These were single disk machines, using disks with embedded sectors that were accessed at the edges.

===Modern electrostatic generators===
Electrostatic generators had a fundamental role in the investigations about the structure of matter, starting at the end of the 19th century. By the 1920s, it was evident that machines able to produce greater voltage were needed. 

====Van de Graaff====
The [[Van de Graaff generator]] was invented by American physicist [[Robert J. Van de Graaff]] in 1929 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] as a particle accelerator.&lt;ref name="Van de Graaff"&gt;{{cite journal

In the Van de Graaff machine, an insulating belt transports electric charge to the interior of an insulated hollow metal high voltage terminal, where it is transferred to the terminal by a "comb" of metal points.  The advantage of the design was that since there was no electric field in the interior of the terminal, the charge on the belt could continue to be discharged onto the terminal regardless of how high the voltage on the terminal was.  Thus the only limit to the voltage on the machine is [[ionization]] of the air next to the terminal.  This occurs when the electric field at the terminal exceeds the [[dielectric strength]] of air, about 30&amp;nbsp;kV per centimeter. Since the highest electric field is produced at sharp points and edges, the terminal is made in the form of a smooth hollow sphere; the larger the diameter the higher the voltage attained.  The first machine used a silk ribbon bought at a five and dime store as the charge transport belt. In 1931 a version able to produce 1,000,000 volts was described in a patent disclosure.

The Van de Graaff generator was a successful particle accelerator, producing the highest energies until the late 1930s when the [[cyclotron]] superseded it.  The voltage on open air Van de Graaff machines is limited to a few million volts by air breakdown.  Higher voltages, up to about 25&amp;nbsp;megavolts, were achieved by enclosing the generator inside a tank of pressurized insulating gas.  This type of Van de Graaff particle accelerator is still used in medicine and research.  Other variations were also invented for physics research, such as the [[Pelletron]], that uses a chain with alternating insulating and conducting links for charge transport. 

Small Van de Graaff generators are commonly used in [[science museum]]s and science education to demonstrate the principles of static electricity.  A popular demonstration is to have a person touch the high voltage terminal while standing on an insulated support; the high voltage charges the person's hair, causing the strands to stand out from the head.

====EWICON====
An electrostatic wind energy converter, the EWICON, has been developed by The School of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at [[Delft University of Technology]] (TU Delft). Its stands near Mecanoo, an architecture firm. The main developers were Johan Smit and Dhiradj Djairam. Other than the wind, it has no moving parts. It is powered by the wind carrying away charged particles from its collector.&lt;ref name=LAG41313&gt;{{cite web|author1=landartgenerator|title=EWICON (Electrostatic Wind Energy Converter)|url=http://landartgenerator.org/blagi/archives/2872|website=landartgenerator.org|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design suffers from poor efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.citylab.com/life/2013/04/how-long-must-we-wait-bladeless-windmill/5183/ How Long Must We Wait for the Bladeless Windmill?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch Windwheel====
The technology developed for EWICON has been reused in the Dutch Windwheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattisduurzaam.nl/3349/energie-opwekken/wind/elektrostatische-windmolen-zonder-molen/ Dutch Windwheel 2.0: Herontwerp zonder windenergie?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dutchwindwheel.com/en/ Dutch Windwheel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fringe science and devices==
These generators have been used, sometimes inappropriately and with some controversy, to support various [[fringe science]] investigations. In 1911, [[George Samuel Piggott]] received a patent for a compact double machine enclosed within a pressurized box for his experiments concerning [[radiotelegraphy]] and "[[antigravity]]". Much later (in the 1960s), a machine known as "Testatika" was built by German engineer, Paul Suisse Bauman, and promoted by a Swiss community, the [[Methernitha]]ns. Testatika is an electromagnetic generator based on the 1898 Pidgeon electrostatic machine, said to produce "free energy" available directly from the environment.

'''Frank Arthur Worsley''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100*|DSO*|OBE|RD}} (22 February 1872 – 1 February 1943) was a New Zealand [[sailor]] and [[explorer]] who served on [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s  [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1916, as [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]''. He also served in the [[Royal Navy Reserve]] during the [[First World War]].

Born in [[Akaroa, New Zealand]], on 22 February 1872, Worsley joined the [[New Zealand Shipping Company]] in 1888. He served aboard several vessels running trade routes between New Zealand, England and the South Pacific. While on South Pacific service, he became renowned for his ability to navigate to tiny, remote islands. He joined the Royal Navy Reserve in 1902 and served on [[HMS Swiftsure (1903)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] for a year before returning to the [[Merchant Navy]]. In 1914, he joined the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which aimed to cross the [[Antarctic]] continent.

After the expedition's ship ''Endurance'' was trapped in ice and wrecked, he and the rest of the expedition sailed three lifeboats to [[Elephant Island]], off the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. From here, he, along with Shackleton and four others, sailed the {{convert|22.5|ft|m|adj=on}} lifeboat ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' some {{convert|800|mi|km}} across the stormy [[South Atlantic Ocean]], eventually arriving at their intended destination, [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. His navigation skills were crucial to the safe arrival of the ''James Caird''. Shackleton, Worsley and seaman [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] then hiked and climbed through snow and ice across mountainous South Georgia in a 36-hour march to fetch help from [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]] [[whaling|whaling station]]. He and Shackleton returned to Elephant Island aboard the ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]'', a Chilean naval ship, to rescue the remaining members of the expedition, all of whom survived.
 
During the [[First World War]], Worsley captained the [[Q ship|Q-ship]] ''PC.61''. He was responsible for the sinking of a German [[U-boat]], {{SMU|UC-33||2}} on 26 September 1917 by carrying out a skilful ramming manoeuvre. For his role in the sinking of the ''UC-33'', Worsley was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Later in the war he worked in transportation of supplies in Arctic Russia, and in the [[North Russia Intervention]] against the [[Bolshevik]]s, earning a bar to his DSO. He was later appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. From 1921 to 1922 he served on Shackleton's last expedition to the Antarctic as captain of the [[Quest (ship)|''Quest'']]. In between berths in the Merchant Navy he led an expedition to the Arctic Circle and participated in a treasure hunt on [[Cocos Island]]. He also wrote several books relating to his experiences in polar exploration and during his sailing career.

During the [[Second World War]] he initially served with the [[International Red Cross]] in France and Norway. In 1941, he falsified his age so he could rejoin the Merchant Navy. When officials discovered his actual age, he was released from duty. He died from [[lung cancer]] in 1943 in England.

==Early life==
Frank Arthur Worsley was born on 22 February 1872 in [[Akaroa]], New Zealand, one of three children of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana.{{sfn|Dennerly|1996|p=577}} His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in England aboard the ''Cornwall'' to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cornwall |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nzbound/cornwall.htm |publisher=rootsweb |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSN-W-Z"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-W-Z.pdf |title=Christchurch Street Names W–Z|last=Harper |first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]] |page=57 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa.{{sfn|Wilson|2015a|p=3}} Worsley's mother died while he was a toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at [[Peraki]], he was homeschooled for a time.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=14–15}} From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing [[Dactylis|cocksfoot]].{{sfn|Wilson|2015a|p=3}} When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the [[New Zealand Shipping Company]] as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to [[Christchurch]]. Frank attended [[Fendalton Open Air School|Fendalton School]] and marked his final year of schooling by being made head boy.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=16–17}}

Like his brother, Frank was interested in a career at sea. In 1887, his application to join the New Zealand Shipping Company was declined because of his short stature, but he was successful six months later. He was signed on as a junior [[midshipman]] aboard the ''Wairoa'', a three-masted [[clipper]] which transported wool to [[London]].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=16–17}}

==Maritime career==
Worsley served on a number of sailing ships of the company, running the trade route between New Zealand and England for several years.{{sfn|Dennerly|1996|p=577}} He became a [[third mate]] by 1891, and then a [[Merchant marine officer|fifth officer]] the following year. In 1895, when a third officer, he left the New Zealand Shipping Company to join the [[New Zealand Government Steamer Service]] (NZGSS). His first posting was aboard the ''Tutanekai'', a NZGSS steamer which served the Pacific Islands, as second mate. He was considered to be a good and experienced officer, but was not averse to mischief.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=29}}  On one voyage in 1899, the ''Tutanekai'' was anchored in the harbour at [[Apia]], the capital city of [[German Samoa]]. That night, Worsley went ashore and stole the ensign that was flown from the flagpole of the [[Imperial Germany|German]] consulate on the harbour front. On discovering the theft, the consul suspected the culprit was from the crew of the ''Tutanekai'', the only merchant vessel in the harbour at the time. With a party of sailors from {{SMS|Falke}}, also anchored in the harbour, the consul boarded the ''Tutanekai'' looking for the ensign, but they left empty-handed after the ship's captain protested.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=30}} Even when the captain later found out Worsley was responsible, it did not affect his career prospects. He was posted to the [[NZGSS Hinemoa|''Hinemoa'']], another NZGSS steamer, as chief officer.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=31}}

In June 1900, Worsley sat the examination for a foreign master's certificate. He passed with good marks, and was one of two students commended for their efforts. He was now a qualified [[Sea captain|master]] and, as his first command, was given the ''Countess of Ranfurly''. This was a three-masted schooner of the NZGSS which sailed trade routes in the South Pacific, mainly around the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], both of which were New Zealand dependencies.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=31}} [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a travel writer based in [[Papua New Guinea]], said that "Any passenger he took had to work passage as well as pay" and that he encouraged her to learn practical seamanship, "to go aloft, to “hand, reef and steer,” and to use the sixteen-foot oar in the whaleboat".&lt;ref&gt;Autobiographical article from ''[[Blue Book (magazine)]]'' April 1939 transcribed onto website [http://grimshaworigin.org/prominent-grimshaw-individuals/beatrice-grimshaw-south-pacific/#Autobiography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy Reserve===
While in command of the ''Countess of Ranfurly'', Worsley joined the [[Royal Navy Reserve]] (RNR) and on 1 January 1902 was appointed a [[sub-lieutenant]].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=33}} In 1904, ''Countess of Ranfurly'' was sold, and this left Worsley without a command. Rather than stay in the employ of the New Zealand Government Steamer Service, he decided to look abroad for work. He travelled to Sydney and found a berth as chief officer on [[HMS Sparrow (1889)|HMS ''Sparrow'']], which was on its delivery voyage to New Zealand, having been recently purchased by the New Zealand Government. When the ''Sparrow'' arrived in Wellington in March 1905, he was selected to command the ship while it was converted to a training vessel. The conversion was still incomplete when he left for England in early 1906.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=34}}

On arrival in England in March 1906, Worsley presented himself for further training in the RNR. He was posted to HMS ''Psyche'' and received specialist training in [[torpedo]]es, gunnery and navigation. He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] the following May.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=35}}  He served on a number of Royal Navy ships, including 12 months on [[HMS Swiftsure (1903)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']], for the next two years. He then returned to the [[Merchant Navy]] and found a position with [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers]], which sailed regularly from England to Canada and South America. He would intermittently be called up for service in the RNR over the next several years. This included a month in 1911 spent aboard [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS ''New Zealand'']].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=36}}

==Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition==
{{main|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition}}
[[File:TheEnduranceInFullSail.jpg|thumb|right|alt= Frontal view of ship with sails all set, moving through thick sea ice|''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' in full sail c.&amp;nbsp;1915]]
In 1914, the explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]] began preparing an expedition which had the goal of completing the first crossing of the Antarctic continent. The failure of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] to beat the Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]] to the [[South Pole]] in 1911 was considered a blot on Britain's reputation in polar exploration. Shackleton's expedition was intended to return the country to the forefront of Antarctic endeavour. He set up his headquarters at Burlington Road in London, and was interviewing candidates for the expedition.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|pp=365–366}}  One available position was that of captain for the expedition's vessel, the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']].{{sfn|Huntford|1986|p=370}}

Worsley, in London while awaiting a new berth, joined the expedition as a result of a dream, in which he was navigating a ship around icebergs drifting down Burlington Street. He took it as a premonition and the next day hurried down to Burlington Street, where he noticed a sign on a building advertising what Shackleton called the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. After a few minutes of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of the ''Endurance'', which Worsley accepted.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=37}}

The ''Endurance'' left England on 8 August 1914 destined for [[Buenos Aires]], where Shackleton, travelling separately, would join the expedition.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=15}}  The departure of the expedition was troubled; the impending outbreak of the First World War prompted some members including Worsley, anticipating a call up to the RNR, to propose a postponement of the voyage. However, the Admiralty advised Shackleton to proceed with his plans even after Britain declared war on Imperial Germany on 4 August. Just prior to the departure of the ''Endurance'' Worsley approached the authorities and was advised that RNR personnel were not being called up at the time.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=38–39}} While steaming to South America, fuel ran low and wood intended for planned buildings at the expedition's base in Antarctica was used to keep the engine running. Worsley ran a relatively relaxed ship with little discipline or control of alcohol consumption. Four crew members got into a barroom brawl at a stopover in [[Madeira]], a neutral port.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=15}} While anchored in the harbour, a neighbouring German ship swung into the ''Endurance'', damaging it. Worsley, enraged, boarded the German ship with some other members of the expedition and forced the crew to repair the damage caused.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=39}}

Shackleton, briefed on Worsley's handling of the voyage to date once he had caught up with the expedition at Buenos Aires, began to have concerns about his choice of captain. Worsley was to be in command of the resupply expedition for the party that was to winter over in Antarctica, but Shackleton began to doubt whether his leadership skills were sufficient to achieve this.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|pp=389–390}}  After resupplying at Buenos Aires, the ''Endurance'' left for the remote island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], in the South Atlantic, on 26 October. It duly arrived at [[Grytviken]] Station, a Norwegian whaling outpost, on 5 November. The Norwegians confirmed initial reports from Buenos Aires that the Antarctic pack ice was much further north than usual.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=15–16}} Shackleton followed the Norwegians' advice to delay departure until later in the summer, and it was not until 5 December that the ''Endurance'' steamed south for the [[Weddell Sea]].{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=24}}

===Icebound===
[[File:Captain Worsley standing by a large pressure ridge RMG P00008.tiff|thumb|right|Worsley alongside a large pressure ridge on the ice, August 1915]]
The ''Endurance'' encountered the pack ice three days after leaving South Georgia, and Worsley began working the ship through the various bergs.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=25–26}} On occasion it was necessary to ram a path through the ice. Progress was intermittent; on some days little headway was made while on other days large stretches of open water allowed swift passage southwards.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=25–26}}  Worsley would often direct the helmsman from the crow's nest, from where he could see any breaks in the ice.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=44}}  It was during this time that Shackleton realised that his temperament was less suited to giving orders than to following them, which he would do with the utmost determination.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|p=402}}

On 18 January 1915, the ship became iced in. Within a few days, it was apparent that the ''Endurance'' was held fast and was likely to remain so for the upcoming winter.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=41}}  Trapped, the ship slowly drifted westwards with the ice, and the expedition settled in for the winter. The original plan had been to leave a shore party on the Antarctic mainland while Worsley took the ''Endurance'' northwards. There had been no expectation that the entire expedition would live aboard the ship in the long term. {{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=44}}  Worsley relished the challenge; he slept in the passageway rather than the cabins, and even in the depths of winter, would shock the rest of those aboard the ship by taking snow baths on the ice.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=63}} With little to do since the ''Endurance'' became trapped, he occupied himself taking soundings of the ocean and collecting specimens. He later wrote a report entitled ''Biological, Soundings and Magnetic Record, Weddell Sea, 1914–1916.''{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=47}}

By July, it was becoming obvious that the ice was likely to crush the ''Endurance'', which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley to be prepared to quickly abandon ship if the need arose.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=71–72}} Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: "You seriously mean to tell me that the ship is doomed?" Shackleton responded "The ship can't live in this, Skipper."{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=51}} Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the ''Endurance'' to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=84–89}}  Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, {{convert|200|mi|km}} to the northeast. After just three days, it was clear that the condition of the ice was too rough for sledging.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=95}} Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) from where the ''Endurance'' was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=98}}  The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=111}}

The conditions underfoot were slushy during the day, as the temperature warmed up. Shackleton resolved to do most of the trekking at night, sledging the three lifeboats of the ''Endurance'' behind them. The sledging was hard work and after little more than a week, Shackleton and his men were forced to camp once more.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=114}}  Underneath, the ice continued to move northwards, and by April 1916, the floe they were on was nearly within sight of [[Elephant Island]] but beginning to break up. Shackleton ordered the expedition to the lifeboats, placing Worsley in charge of one of them, the ''Dudley Docker''.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=118–119}}  It took a week to reach Elephant Island, the ice and currents inhibiting progress.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=120}}

The first few nights involved camping on nearby ice floes with the constant risk of them breaking up, but the last four nights were in the boats, with Worsley spending most of it at the tiller and going without sleep for 90 hours straight.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=120}} His experience with open boats came to the fore in his sound handling of the ''Dudley Docker'',{{sfn|Huntford|1986|p=506}} while his navigation was exemplary, guiding the fleet of lifeboats unerringly to Elephant Island once they found favourable wind conditions.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|p=513}}  On the final night at sea, with Elephant Island having been sighted earlier in the day, heavy seas separated his boat from the other two lifeboats. His boat taking on water and caught in a rip, Worsley steered the ''Dudley Docker'' all through the night. Relieved early in the morning, he promptly fell asleep and could only be awoken by kicks to the head. It was three years later that he eventually found out the method that was used by his companions to shake him from his deep sleep.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=62–63}}  The ''Dudley Docker'' made shore on 15 April, landing on the same shingle beach of Elephant Island as the other lifeboats. It was the expedition's first landfall in almost 18 months.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=120}}

===Voyage of the ''James Caird''===
{{main|Voyage of the James Caird}}
It quickly became apparent that Elephant Island, {{convert|20|mi|km}} of rock and ice with little shelter, was not a welcoming environment particularly with winter approaching and most of the expedition members weakened by their ordeal. Furthermore, the expedition could not be expected to be spotted by search parties or passing whalers. Within days of landing on Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to take a small party and sail the largest lifeboat, the ''James Caird'', named for one of the expedition's sponsors, to South Georgia, {{convert|800|mi|km}} away. From there he would obtain a ship and return for the remainder of his men.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|pp=523–524}}  Worsley, whose navigational skills had impressed Shackleton, volunteered to accompany him.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=134–135}}  The ''James Caird'', originally built to Worsley's specifications,{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=72}} was about {{convert|22|ft|m}} long and the expedition's carpenter, [[Harry McNish]], immediately set about improving its seaworthiness. On 24 April, the weather dawned clear and after being provisioned with 30 days of supplies, the boat left Elephant Island.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=134–135}} Worsley was faced with the task of navigating the [[Southern Ocean]] to South Georgia. There was no margin for error as the ''James Caird'' would sail into the South Atlantic if he missed the island; this would mean almost certain death for those in the lifeboat but also those remaining on Elephant Island.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=75}}  Fortuitously, the weather was fine on the day of departure from the island and this allowed Worsley to obtain a sun sighting to ensure that his chronometer was rated.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=138}}

[[File:LaunchingTheJamesCaird2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=A group of men pushing a boat from a rock beach into the sea, with a background of rocks.|Launching the ''James Caird'' from the shore of [[Elephant Island]], 24 April 1916]]
Shortly after the start of the voyage, the ''James Caird'' which, in addition to Shackleton and Worsley, also carried McNish, sailors [[John Vincent (sailor)|John Vincent]] and [[Timothy McCarthy (sailor)|Timothy McCarthy]], as well as the experienced [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]],{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=134}} encountered the ice but Worsley found a way through and into the open ocean. The crew set up two watches for the journey, which eventually would take 16 days, in strong and heavy seas, to reach South Georgia.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=143–144}}  For most of the voyage, the weather proved to be stormy and so overcast Worsley was unable to take more than a few sightings with his sextant.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=145}}  He described one sighting as "...cuddling the mast with one arm and swinging fore and aft round the mast, sextant and all..." and he would "...catch the sun when the boat leaped her highest on the crest of a sea...".{{sfn|Worsley|1999|p=133}} At times the sea conditions were so rough he was braced by the other crew members when taking his sightings.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=145}} On occasion, the temperature was bitter and each man would spend one minute shifts chipping away ice that coated the top surfaces of the ''James Caird'', affecting its buoyancy. The heavy seas meant there was considerable risk that a man could go overboard.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=83}}

After two weeks, Worsley began to worry about the lack of sightings and advised Shackleton he could not calculate their position to less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} accuracy. As a result, Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant, given the prevailing winds, that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island. The following day, they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead, indicating the presence of land ahead. On 8 May, through mists and squalls, the crew sighted South Georgia's Cape Demidov, precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=150}} He saw a "...towering black crag, with a lacework of snow around its flanks. One glimpse, and it was hidden again. We looked at each other with cheerful, foolish grins."{{sfn|Worsley|1999|p=140}}  Sea and wind conditions were such that they were unable to make their way to the Norwegian whaling stations, some {{convert|148|mi|km}} away, on the east coast; instead they made for [[King Haakon Bay]]. Now out of drinking water, they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and heave to for the night. A gale blew strongly the following day and despite their best efforts, they stayed offshore for a further night. Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts, Worsley carefully sailed the ''James Caird'' through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=149–150}}

===Trek===
[[File:South georgia Islands map-en.svg|thumb|300px|alt= Outline of a long, narrow irregular-shaped island with small islands around its coasts. The main island is labelled "South Georgia", and various place names are shown on its north coast including Stromness Husvik and Grytviken.|South Georgia. [[King Haakon Bay]], where the ''James Caird'' landed, is the large anvil-shaped indentation at the western end of the southerly side.]]
After slaking their thirst from a nearby stream, the crew unloaded the ''James Caird'' and spent the first night on South Georgia in a cave. The next day, Shackleton announced his intention to walk overland to the Norwegian whaling station at [[Stromness Bay]], on the other side of the island. The crew were too exhausted, and the ''James Caird'' too battered, for Shackleton to consider sailing around the island.  The trek to Stromness Bay was {{convert|22|mi|km}} and after resting for several days, he, along with Worsley and Tom Crean, set out on 19 May. The interior of South Georgia was mountainous and covered with glaciers. Their map of South Georgia showed only the coastline, and on several occasions, they were forced to backtrack when their route was found to be impassable. After a non-stop trek of 36 hours, the trio reached Stromness Bay and were taken to the manager of the whaling station. He was unable to recognise Shackleton, whom he had met during the expedition's stopover on the island nearly two years previously.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=163–164}}  After a hot bath and a large meal, Worsley set out on a whaler to collect the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. That night a strong blizzard struck the island. Had it developed while Worsley and the others were on their trek, it would have likely killed them.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=165–166}}  They were fortunate the weather had been relatively good for their trek across the island. Later, all three trekkers would talk of a "[[Third Man factor|fourth presence]]" that accompanied them.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=100}}  In his account of the walk, Worsley would write "...I again find myself counting our party—Shackleton, Crean, and I and—who was the other? Of course, there were only three, but it is strange that in mentally reviewing the crossing we should always think of a fourth, and then correct ourselves."{{sfn|Worsley|1999|p=197}}

The next day, McNish, McCarthy and Vincent were picked up. They were unable to recognise Worsley, freshly shaven, when he stepped ashore. The ''James Caird'', which had been pulled up the beach and turned over to serve as a shelter, was also retrieved.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=165–166}}

===Rescue===
Three days after McNish and the others were brought back to Stromness Bay, Shackleton, Crean and Worsley, along with a crew of volunteers from the whaling station, set out on a hired ship for Elephant Island. They got to within {{convert|60|mi|km}} of the island before ice prevented any further passage south. Unable to break a passage through the ice, they steamed to the Falkland Islands to obtain a more suitable vessel. By now news of the fate of the expedition had reached Britain. Despite messages of goodwill and support, the only British vessel that could be found was the {{Ship|RRS|Discovery}}, Robert Falcon Scott's old ship, but this would not be available until October. The war tied up all other available resources.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=167}}

Waiting for October was not acceptable to Shackleton who, desperately concerned for the men on Elephant Island, continued to search for a ship. The British Foreign Office prevailed on the governments of Uruguay, Chile and Argentina for a suitable vessel. The Uruguayans came forward with a small survey ship, and this was sailed to within sight of Elephant Island before it too had to turn back. An effort with an Argentinean vessel which set sail on 12 July also failed after three weeks of atrocious weather. Chile offered the use of the [[Yelcho (1906)|''Yelcho'']], and on this steel-hulled steamer, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean set out with a crew on 25 August.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=168–169}}  Fortunately, in contrast to their previous attempt, the weather was mild and on 30 August, they reached Elephant Island where, to their great joy, they found all 22 men left behind alive.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|p=183}}  Within an hour all were retrieved and, not wanting to risk being trapped by ice, the ''Yelcho'' quickly departed for Punta Arenas, where it was greeted with great fanfare.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|pp=185–186}} Worsley later wrote: "...I was always sorry for the twenty-two men who lived in that horrible place for four months of misery while we were away on the boat journey, and the four attempts at rescue ending with their joyful relief."{{sfn|Worsley|1999|p=92}}

While Worsley had been retrieving McNish and others from King Haakon Bay, Shackleton was advised of the fate of his [[Ross Sea party]]{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=99}} which had been tasked with laying depots on Shackleton's intended route across Antarctica. Ten men, forming a winter party, had set up a base at [[Hut Point Peninsula|Hut Point]], while their ship, the [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']], owned by Shackleton, wintered at [[Cape Evans]]. In May 1915, the ship broke free from its moorings and became trapped in the ice. Badly damaged, it drifted with the ice for over six months before it broke free and its captain, [[Joseph Stenhouse]], was able to sail it to New Zealand in March 1916. No one had heard from the stranded winter party at Hut Point for nearly two years.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=106–107}}  After journeying with the rest of the survivors of his own party to Argentina, Shackleton, along with Worsley, left for New Zealand. From here they hoped to find a ship to take them south to retrieve the Ross Sea party.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=105}}

Shackleton had brought Worsley along intending to use his services in the retrieval of the winter party. However, after their arrival in New Zealand in December 1916, they found themselves without a ship. They had expected to use the ''Aurora'' with Shackleton as its captain. In the meantime, the Australian, New Zealand and British governments had put forward funds for the rescue but influenced by the explorer [[Douglas Mawson]], who disliked Shackleton, the Australian government appointed its own captain.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=108–109}}  After protracted negotiations, Shackleton sailed on board the ''Aurora'' as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] officer. Worsley was left behind but was placated with a paid passage to Britain. The seven surviving members of the winter party were duly rescued.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=111}} Worsley was later awarded the [[Polar Medal]] for his service on the expedition.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=182}}

==First World War==
Shortly after Shackleton returned to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having picked up the survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS ''Makura''. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, he made his way to London and was quickly assigned to HMS ''Pembroke'', the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, he learned about fighting [[U-boats]], which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of [[Q-ship]]s, small merchant vessels fitted out with hidden armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol boats that carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness wore off as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=115–116}}

In July 1917, Worsley was appointed commander of the ''PC.61'', one of the later P-boats, with Joseph Stenhouse as his first officer.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=115–116}}  The ''PC.61'', commissioned on 31 July 1917, was equipped with a semi-automatic {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} gun that was hidden by a tarpaulin suspended from crane derricks when not in use. She also had a ram at her bow. Shortly after its commissioning he took his new command to sea on patrol. Most patrols were uneventful but sometimes U-boats were sighted and pursued but these invariably got away. Occasionally torpedoes were fired at his ship. Worsley felt the ''PC.61'' was too easily identified as a Royal Navy vessel against which U-boats were too cautious to make a surface attack. Instead, the submarine would use its torpedoes to attack the ship.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=117}}  
[[File:Worsley, 1917.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in dark naval uniform and wearing an officer's cap|Worsley, in the uniform of a lieutenant commander of the Royal Naval Reserve, 1917]]
In late September 1917, Worsley and the ''PC.61'' were on patrol to the south of [[Ireland]]. On 26 September 1917, a nearby tanker was struck by a torpedo from a U-boat, {{SMU|UC-33||2}}. Observing the explosion, Worsley gradually slowed his propellers, hoping to deceive the U-boat's crew into thinking his P-boat was leaving the area and luring the submarine to the surface.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=117}}  The deception was successful and the ''UC-33'' surfaced, intending to sink the tanker with its deck gun. Worsley immediately ordered full speed ahead and, realising that he would lose time in manoeuvring his ship into a position in which she could use her guns, set a collision course with the U-boat, intending to ram the submarine. At high speeds the bow, to which the ram was fitted, of the ''PC.61'' lifted out of the water considerably, and Worsley had to reduce speed at the right moment in order for it to be at the right height to strike the submarine. He timed the reduction of speed of the ''PC.61'' perfectly and she struck the ''UC-33'' midships as it was submerging. The submarine rapidly sunk with nearly all hands, the exception being the captain, who was rescued and later gifted Worsley a silver whistle. The damaged tanker was towed to [[Milford Haven]] in Wales, which took 12 hours in an area where other U-boats were known to be lurking.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=118–119}}

For his role in the sinking of the ''UC-33'', Worsley was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) and Shackleton sent him a telegraph congratulating him on his success.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=120}}  Worsley conducted patrols with the ''PC.61'' for several more months. In September 1918, he was given command of [[HMS Pargust|HMS ''Pangloss'']], a Q-ship operating in the [[Mediterranean]] and which was formerly commanded by [[Commander]] [[Gordon Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|Gordon Campbell]].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=121}} With the war nearly over, Worsley did not anticipate much excitement in his new posting.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=122}}

===Northern Russia===
Passing through London en route to [[Gibraltar]], where the ''Pangloss'' was based, Worsley met Shackleton,{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=122}} recently assigned by the War Office to the [[North Russia Intervention|International Contingent]] destined for Northern Russia to aid the [[White movement]] in its fight against the [[Bolsheviks]]. Shackleton's expertise in the polar regions had been recognised by the War Office, and with the temporary rank of major, he was preparing the contingent for a winter deployment to [[Murmansk]].{{sfn|Huntford|1986|p=663}} Shackleton had already recruited several veterans of the ''Endurance'' to serve with him and arranged for Worsley, keen for action, to be transferred to join the contingent. Worsley, by now a [[lieutenant commander]], left for Murmansk the following month.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=122}}

After he arrived in Russia, Worsley was selected to go to [[Archangel]] where he organised equipment and supplies for the British forces stationed there. He provided extensive advice, derived from his polar experience, to soldiers on how to best make use of their resources and trained them in the use of skis.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=124}}  He participated in several patrols and due to a shortage of officers, occasionally took command of [[platoon]]s of British infantry. In April 1919, he was posted back to Murmansk, where he took command of the gunboat [[HMS Cricket (1915)|HMS ''Cricket'']]. He took her up the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvinia River]] and targeted Bolshevik gunboats and villages along the river. He also provided support to British and White Russian units moving along the banks of the river in operations to seize ground lost to the Bolsheviks in the winter months.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=125}}

Worsley commanded ''Cricket'' for two months before becoming the captain of [[HMS M24|HMS ''M24'']], a [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] and tender to HMS ''Fox''. His time in command was short as he managed to attach himself to the [[Hampshire Regiment]]. In August, he participated in a raid behind Bolshevik lines. The raiding party of 25 men obtained useful intelligence by tapping telegraph lines and ambushing a Bolshevik convoy but their presence soon became known and they were pursued by a force of over 200 Bolsheviks. When the captain commanding the party became lost in a forest, he deferred navigation to Worsley, who successfully led all 25 men back to safety. For his efforts, he was awarded a [[medal bar|bar]] to his DSO.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=126–128}} The citation for his award read:
{{Quote|In recognition of the gallantry displayed by him at Pocha in North Russia between the 2nd and 5th August 1919.

When the Allied forces left Murmansk and Archangel in late 1919, Worsley returned to London. He was rewarded for his service in Russia by being appointed to the [[Order of St. Stanislaus]]. He was discharged from service on 2 January 1920 and placed on the RNR retired list. Later in the year, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, he was appointed Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] for his services to Great Britain.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Gazette, 30 March 1920|url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/31840/supplement/3811|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Quest''==
{{main|Shackleton–Rowett Expedition}}
Worsley remained in near constant contact with Shackleton, who was attempting to put together an expedition to the Arctic, and was hopeful of securing a suitable position in the endeavour. However, the expedition was still some way off and in the meantime, Worsley set up a shipping company with his friend Stenhouse. The company, Stenhouse Worsley &amp; Co, purchased a schooner, ''Annie'', with the intention of trading with the Baltic states.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=130}}  This plan collapsed when the Baltic freight market fell on hard times and eventually, the company started shipping freight along the British coast. In late 1920, Worsley and Stenhouse went on a trading voyage to Iceland. The ''Annie'' carried cargo on the outward trip but was nearly wrecked when sailing around the coast of Iceland to pick up cargo from a remote port for the return trip to England. Poor weather and sea conditions kept the ''Annie'' in Iceland until February 1921, when Worsley was able to carry freight back to Britain. By then Shackleton was ready to proceed with his expedition and wanted Worsley as the captain of his ship, the [[Quest (ship)|''Quest'']], an offer which he quickly accepted.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=131–132}}
[[File:Shackleton's Ship Quest 1921.JPG|thumb|alt= A ship with two tall masts is passing beneath the raised carriageways of a road bridge. The bridge has twin ornamental stone towers which are connected by a walkway high above the river.|''Quest'' passing through [[Tower Bridge]], London]]
After the Canadian government withdrew promised financial support for the expedition, the delay in finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]] (John Rowett, an old friend of Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several ''Endurance'' veterans in addition to Worsley; [[Frank Wild]] was again second in command, and [[Leonard Hussey]] was the meteorologist. Worsley was the master of the ''Quest'', but would also be the expedition's hydrographer.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=134–135}}

The ''Quest'', a {{convert|111|ft|m|adj=on}} two-masted sealing ship sourced from Norway, set sail on 18 September 1921.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=134–135}} Problems soon arose; the ship did not sail well and it leaked. There were also problems with the engine. A week was spent in Portugal undergoing repairs, and after crossing the Atlantic, the ''Quest'' spent a month in the docks of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. While in Brazil, Shackleton, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a heart attack. After he declined treatment for his condition, the expedition left for South Georgia on 18 December.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=136–137}} The island was sighted on 4 January 1922 and both Worsley and Shackleton were "like a pair of excitable kids", pointing out landmarks from their walk across South Georgia back in 1916. The following day, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.{{sfn|Huntford|1986|pp=689–690}} Worsley described the loss of his friend as "...a terribly sad blow. I have lost a dear pal, one of the whitest men, in spite of his faults, that ever lived."{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=139}}

Despite this setback, the expedition continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the ''Quest'' had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs and had to rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey had returned to the island in late February to fulfil her request.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=139–140}}

Worsley and the rest of the expedition spent several weeks on South Georgia, and he assisted in the building of a memorial cairn to Shackleton in King Edward Cove.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=139–140}}  The expedition then sailed for [[Tristan da Cunha]], where Worsley carried out some mapping work. Other stops were made at [[Cape Town]], [[Ascension Island]] and [[Saint Helena]] before the expedition arrived back in England in September 1922.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=141}}

==Arctic==
The Atlantic shipping trade occupied Worsley after his return to England. He was master of the ''George Cochran'' for a time in 1923, shipping rum to [[Montreal]].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=141}}  The following year he was in command of the ''Kathleen Annie'' when it was wrecked in the [[Orkney Islands]]. He ensured the evacuation of his crew before leaving the stricken ship for the safety of the shore.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=142}}

During his time in Canada, Worsley had made the acquaintance of a young Canadian, [[Grettir Algarsson]], who was of Icelandic descent and was preparing a ship for a voyage to the Arctic. Algarsson's voyage proved short-lived, as his ship collided with floating wreckage while in the North Sea. Undeterred, he set about preparing an expedition for the following year and invited Worsley, who had provided advice for his previous voyage, to join him.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=142}} The plan was to sail to [[Spitzbergen]], in the [[Arctic Circle]], and Algarsson was to fly from there to the North Pole where he would crash the plane, and, with his pilot, sledge back. Worsley was to captain the ship that Algarsson had purchased for the expedition, a {{convert|99|ft|m|adj=on}} diesel-engined [[brigatine]] called the ''Island''. A lack of funds resulted in the cancellation of the planned flight as a suitable plane could not be found. However, the 15-man expedition, known as the [[Algarsson North Polar Expedition]], went ahead with certain mapping and scientific objectives,{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=143}} among them a search for [[Gillis Land]], northeast of Spitzbergen, which had not been sighted since 1707, as well as sounding the continental shelf between Spitzbergen and [[Franz Josef Land]].{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=144}}  With the plane flight no longer viable, and the focus of the expedition now primarily on maritime matters, Algarsson offered Worsley co-leadership of the expedition, which he accepted.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=143}} The ''Island'' sailed on 21 June 1925 from Liverpool.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=144}}

When sailing the western side of Spitzbergen, a blade of the propeller of the ''Island'' was damaged in a collision with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=146}}

The ''Island'' was now effectively without an engine, a prospect that did not daunt Worsley as he sailed for Franz Josef Land. He described it as "sail's last unaided battle with the polar pack [pack ice]".{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=147}}  In August he landed on [[Cape Barents]], one of the southern islands of Franz Josef Land, and planted a [[Union Jack]]. Together with the ship's engineer who was from [[Dunedin]], he claimed to be the first New Zealander to set foot on Franz Josef Land.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=148}}  The expedition, which had been renamed the British Arctic Expedition with the consensus of the participants, made several attempts to find a way northwards through the pack ice, Worsley harbouring hopes of being the first sailing ship to sail through the island group to Gillis Land and then back to Spitzbergen, but was unsuccessful. In one attempt, the ''Island'' nearly collided with a large iceberg, but Worsley ordered a rowboat to take to the water and the ship was towed out of harm's way.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=149}}

Finally, on 14 September, what was thought to be Gillis Land was spotted several miles away. The ''Island'' was unable to sail close enough to confirm the sighting, but Worsley noted that it was to the west of its charted position. If it was Gillis Land, it was the first sighting of the island for 200 years{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=150}} (Gillis Land no longer appears on modern charts).{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=153}}  The ship then sailed to [[North-East Land]], circumnavigating it and while doing so reaching the expedition's farthest north, 81°15′N. Worsley ensured the New Zealand flag was flown at the spot. The expedition then set sail for Spitzbergen, reaching the island's Green Harbour in mid-October.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=150}} The ship's engine could not be repaired before Green Harbour was closed for winter and Worsley accepted a tow to [[Tromsø]], the conclusion of which marked the end of the expedition.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=152}}  He later wrote a book of the voyage, ''Under Sail in the Frozen North'', which was published in 1927.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=156}}

==London life==
After the completion of his Arctic voyage, Worsley returned to life in London, where he had a reasonably high-profile due to his exploits with Shackleton and his wartime service. In 1926, he married Jean Cumming, who he had met in 1920 at [[New Zealand House]] in London while collecting his mail. It was his second marriage; in 1907 he had married Theodora Blackden but she had left him by the time of his return from Russia (the couple had no children).{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=154}}  It took several years for Worsley to obtain a divorce to allow his marriage to Jean, nearly 30 years his junior, to take place. For income in between trading voyages, Worsley wrote books and articles. Two of these, ''Shackleton's Boat Journey'' and ''Crossing South Georgia'' were published as serials in the periodical ''Blue Peter'' in 1924 and were well received.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=155}}  These books were published together as a single volume in 1931. His book was considered superior to Shackleton's own account, published as ''South'' in 1919.{{sfn|Wheeler|1999|pp=14–15}}  In 1938, a fourth book, ''First Voyage in a Square-rigged Ship'' was published.{{sfn|Dennerly|1996|p=577}}  When his financial circumstances required it, which was often, Worsley would write an article for money. His topics would range from the dogs used on the expedition to the pipe smoking habits of his Elephant Island cohabitants.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=157}}

Worsley also conducted lecturing tours for income, his profile enhanced by his publication record. As sailing commissions at this late stage of his life were in short supply, his lectures became more important as a source of income. He mainly lectured on his voyages with Shackleton, whose wife lent Worsley several of her late husband's slides to enhance his talks.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=156}}  In later years, he added talks on his own voyages to his repertoire. His lectures were well received with glowing reviews in local newspapers. His profile was boosted following his appearance in the film ''South'', released in 1933, for which he provided an accent-free narration. The film was based on Frank Hurley's cine film of the ''Endurance'' expedition, intercut with photographic slides. He made an onscreen appearance in the film, showing the audience several artefacts from the expedition. Like his books, the film was very well received.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=157–158}}

In the 1930s, Worsley was part of a yacht and ship delivery company, Imray Laurie Norie &amp; Wilson Limited. His personal experience was a key selling point in the company's commercial literature. In 1937, the company completed over 50 delivery voyages. The longest delivery was that of a steamer destined for Hong Kong, which took three months. On many of these voyages he was accompanied by Jean, who also enjoyed sailing.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=161}}

==Treasure hunting==
Even into his 60s, Worsley still sought adventure. In 1934, he was asked to join the Treasury Recovery Limited Expedition which was organised to locate treasure allegedly hidden at [[Cocos Island]] by pirates. In earlier times, the island had been used as a base by the pirates to attack Spanish ships transporting gold from South America back to Spain. At the time of mounting the expedition, it was believed that between £5 million and £25 million in gold and silver was buried on the island. Worsley sailed, with Jean for company, for Cocos Island in September 1934 aboard the ''Queen of Scots''.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=165–166}}  On arrival at the island in October, he assisted in unloading stores to set up a village at Wafer Bay, the safest landing point on Cocos. The island, off the coast of Costa Rica, was heavily forested and hard labour was necessary to clear likely spots for searching.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=168}}  As the ''Queen of Scots'' was found to be too large for the expedition's needs, Worsley left with the ship to return to England via the [[Panama Canal]]. He was to source a replacement vessel and bring back supplies.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=169}}

En route, Worsley found that the government of Costa Rica, unhappy at not being informed of the expedition's plans, intended to forcibly remove the treasure hunters from Cocos Island. Despite Worsley's dispatch of a personal cable to the Costa Rican president, and ensuing publicity in England, some of the expedition's men were forcibly taken to Panama. The others remained on Cocos under guard.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=169}}  By this time, the leaders of the expedition had returned to England, leaving Worsley as controller of the remaining men. He funded supplies for the remaining men from his own pocket but eventually those remaining on Cocos were shipped to Panama and discharged.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=171}}

The expedition regathered, and after obtaining a concession from the Costa Rican government, returned to the island the following year. He sailed the expedition's new yacht, ''Veracity'', from England to Cocos Island in a troubled voyage, again accompanied by Jean. The expedition was underfunded and supplies were lacking. Mechanical failure while en-route also hampered the voyage. By the time of his arrival on Cocos, he had been appointed the controller of the expedition.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=171}}  Despite extensive searching with a crude metal detector, no trace of the treasure had been found by September. Worsley, with a lecture season beginning in London in October, left the island in early September. This was his last involvement with the expedition which, after nine more months, failed to locate the treasure hunt. The expedition ended when funding ran out. Despite the lack of success, Worsley still believed treasure was to be found on the island and hoped to return. He never did, although his treasure hunting exploits provided plenty of material for his lecture tours.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=173}}

==Later life==
When the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939, Worsley was keen to contribute to the war effort. His age of 67 prevented his recall to the Royal Navy Reserve. He eventually joined the [[International Red Cross]] and travelled to France where he lectured troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the [[Phoney War]]. He also sought support from the War Office to provide equipment to Swedish volunteers travelling to Finland to assist its countrymen in fighting the Russians during the brief [[Winter War]]. When another BEF was sent to Norway in April 1940 to help secure railway links to Sweden, the Red Cross, intending to have a unit in the country as well, appointed Worsley as its ''Advance Agent – Norway''. He was to prepare the way for the unit but after the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] captured [[Narvik]], it became too dangerous for the Red Cross to be involved. After a brief visit to Norway, Worsley returned to Britain.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=174–175}}  
[[File:Worsley, 1940.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A man wearing hat and coat, gesturing with a pipe aboard a small ship|Worsley in 1940-1941, possibly aboard the ''Dalriada'']]
Worsley became the commander of a Red Cross training depot in Balham, London, but it later closed down due to a lack of recruits.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=174–175}}  He repeatedly wrote to the War Office offering his services and proposing various schemes involving Norway, including one to land guns at Spitzbergen, an area he knew well from his Arctic expedition in 1925.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=176–177}}

Eventually, Worsley found a command in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (he was actually 69), was appointed master of the ''Dalriada'' in August 1941. He worked to keep the harbour entrance at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command was only for a few months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the Merchant Navy Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=178}}

In April 1942, Worsley was appointed to the staff at a training establishment for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, [[HMS King Alfred (shore establishment 1939)|HMS ''King Alfred'']] in Sussex,{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=178}} giving lectures on charts and pilotage. After two months he was transferred to the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]], [[Greenwich]]. While in Sussex, his health began to deteriorate and he cut down on his pipe smoking. After a few months at Greenwich, he took ill and was hospitalised. Diagnosed with lung cancer, naval doctors found that they could do little for Worsley, and he was discharged. He opted to spend the last days of his life with his wife and the Bamford family, good friends who lived in [[Claygate]], Surrey. He died in the Bamford house on 1 February 1943.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=179}}  He was cremated after a well attended service held on 3 February at the chapel of the Royal Navy College. His casket was adorned with the New Zealand ensign and Worsley's personal standard that he had flown aboard the ''Quest'' in the 1921–22 expedition. His ashes were scattered at the mouth of the [[Thames River]], near the Nore lightship.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=180}}

After Worsley's death, Jean Worsley donated his unpublished diaries to the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]].{{sfn|Wheeler|1999|p=23}}  She returned to Aberdeen, where she had spent much of the previous months, to live with her mother. Jean later moved to Claygate following the death of her mother, and lived with the Bamfords. Her final years were spent in relative financial comfort; several years before his death, Worsley had invested in shares in Venezuela Oil, which later became Shell Oil and provided good returns for Jean. She died at the Bamford home in 1978, at the age of 78, and in the same room that her husband had occupied at the time of his death. The couple were childless.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=183–184}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Statue of Frank Worsley in Akaroa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A bronze bust of a man wearing a balaclava, the bust on a plinth in a park area with a backdrop of a park bench and buildings in the far distance|The bust of Frank Worsley in Akaroa]]
A bust of Frank Worsley stands in his home town of Akaroa, New Zealand. The sculpture was created by artist Stephen Gleeson of Christchurch, and unveiled in 2004.&lt;ref name="bust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamescairdsociety.com/shackleton-news.php?id=102901 |publisher=The James Caird Society |title=News about 'The Skipper' |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027151558/http://www.jamescairdsociety.com/shackleton-news.php?id=102901 |archivedate=27 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town's museum also displays the ensign from Worsley's former command, the ''PC.61''.&lt;ref name="rnzn"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.navy.mil.nz/know-your-navy/official-documents/navy-today/nt08webformat/sep08/salute-to-adventure.htm |title=Salute to Adventure |last=Dunlop |first=Wendy |year=2012 |publisher=Royal New Zealand Navy |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several geographical features are named for Worsley, including [[Mount Worsley]] on South Georgia, [[Cape Worsley]] in the [[British Antarctic Territory]], the [[Worsley Icefalls]] in the [[Ross Dependency]] and [[Worsley Harbour]] at Spitzbergen.{{sfn|Thomson|2000|p=183}} Worsleys Road in the Christchurch suburb of [[Cracroft, New Zealand|Cracroft]] is named for his grandfather; it was built by him as an access road for his farm.&lt;ref name=CSN-W-Z /&gt;

In 2015, {{convert|190|ha}} of land at Akaroa, on which his childhood home stood, were purchased by the New Zealand Native Forest Restoration Trust. The land borders onto [[Hinewai Reserve]], with its staff managing the long process of native forest establishing itself again and building walking tracks. The [[Rod Donald]] Banks Peninsula Trust, Akaroa Museum, and Hinewai staff will erect information panels at the house site.{{sfn|Wilson|2015b|pp=1–3}} As a teenager, Worsley helped with clearing bush on Banks Peninsula that is now being restored, and he wrote later in life:{{sfn|Wilson|2015a|p=3}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a mad waste. The colonists in their greed for more grass seed and sheep pasture burned millions of pounds worth of timber. They recklessly destroyed the wonderful beauty of the bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, and lowered the rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''Genetic Engineering'''" is a song by British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], released as the first single from their fourth studio album ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]''. The synthesized speech featured on the track is taken from a [[Speak and Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]], an educational electronic toy developed by [[Texas Instruments]] in the 1970s intended to teach children with spelling.

Charting at number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], "Genetic Engineering" ended the band's run of four consecutive Top 10 hits in the UK. It was also a Top 20 hit in several European territories, and peaked at number 5 in Spain. It missed the United States [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] but made number 32 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart.

==Reception and legacy==
Jim Reid in ''[[Record Mirror]]'' wrote: "Madly infectious [[Hook (music)|hook]]-line propels a song absolutely dripping with 'moderne' references. A cold record, whose raison d'être lies in the application of studio technology and the manipulation of hackneyed gobbledegook. Should be massive – won't touch my turntable again."&lt;ref name="messages115"&gt;Waller, Johnny; Humphreys, Mike. ''Messages''. [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]]. 1987. {{ISBN|0-283-99234-4}}. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Paul Simper dismissed the track as "a load of old tosh".&lt;ref name="messages115"/&gt;

US critic Ned Raggett praised the "soaring", "enjoyable" single in a retrospective piece for [[AllMusic]], asserting: "Why it wasn't a hit remains a mystery."&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

Frontman [[Andy McCluskey]] has noted that the song is not an attack on [[genetic engineering]], as many assumed at the time, including radio presenter [[Dave Lee Travis]] upon playing the song on [[BBC Radio 1]]. McCluskey stated: "I was very positive about the subject." "People didn't listen to the lyrics... I think they automatically assumed it would be anti."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Bob. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/07/popandrock1 How to lose 3 million fans in one easy step]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 7 March 2008. Retrieved 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music journalists have suggested that the first 45 seconds of the song were a direct influence on [[Radiohead]]'s "Fitter Happier", which appears on that band's 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]''.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1341011/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Dazzle Ships'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |first=Ned |last=Raggett |accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stylus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_first_listen/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark.htm |title=On First Listen: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark |publisher=[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]] |first=Theon |last=Weber |authorlink= |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-dazzle-ships |title=Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark: Dazzle Ships Review |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |first=John |last=Bergstrom |authorlink= |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoem Weber in [[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]] argued that the Radiohead track is "deeply indebted" to "Genetic Engineering".&lt;ref name="stylus"/&gt;

==B-side==
The new song "4-Neu" was featured on the B-side of both the 7" and 12" versions. The song was not included on the ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' album and remained exclusive to this release until its inclusion in the ''[[Navigation: The OMD B-Sides]]'' album in 2001 and then on the remastered special edition of ''Dazzle Ships'' in 2008. The song continues the band's tradition of including more experimental tracks as B sides to singles. The song title is a tribute to 70's German band [[Neu!]], a [[Krautrock]] band that were an important influence on Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys prior to OMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-messages.co.uk/disco/singles/html/s_16.html|title=OMD Discography - Genetic Engineering |publisher= omd-messages.co.uk|accessdate= 2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "4-Neu" was never performed live until the special performance of ''Dazzle Ships'' at [[Museum of Liverpool|The Museum of Liverpool]] in November 2014 and at the ''Dazzle Ships / Architecture &amp; Morality'' live performances in London and Germany in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-73d6ba31.html?song=4-Neu|title=Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark - 4-Neu |publisher= setlist.com|accessdate= 2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promo video==
A promotional video for ''Genetic Engineering'' was made and is included on the ''Messages - Greatest Hits'' CD/DVD release (2008).

==Alternative versions and live performances==
Apart from the extended '312&amp;nbsp;mm version' the band also recorded the song for a [[John Peel]] radio session in 1983. This version was made available on the [[Peel Sessions 1979-1983]] album release (2000).

OMD played the song live on [[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]] during its first series in February 1983.

The song was performed live during the ''Dazzle Ships'' promotional tour but rarely since then, until more recent live performances shows in 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-73d6ba31.html?song=Genetic+Engineering|title=Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark - Genetic Engineering |publisher= setlist.com|accessdate= 2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions==

'''HUDF-JD2''' ('''UDF 033238.7 -274839.8''' or '''BBG 3179''') is a distant, massive, post-[[starburst galaxy]]
that was discovered with the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] (HUDF) image.&lt;ref name=apj633_1_L1/&gt; It was the most distant galaxy identified in the HUDF, in 2005.&lt;ref name=mdsai81_49/&gt; It is located at {{RA|03|32|38.7268}} {{DEC|-27|48|39.885}} in the constellation of [[Fornax]].&lt;ref name=SIMBAD/&gt;&lt;ref name=NED/&gt;

In a 2005 search for very red galaxies in the HUDF that were not detected at wavelengths shorter than the near-infrared [[J band (infrared)|J band]], two objects were detected. The second, initially designated UDF033238.7-274839.8, displayed a high [[redshift]] and showed characteristics of a post-starburst galaxy. The derived photometric redshift yielded ''z'' approximately equal to 6.5, which indicates it is most likely being viewed from a time when the Universe was only 830&amp;nbsp;million years old. The estimated bolometric luminosity of this galaxy is a trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) times the [[solar luminosity]] (the luminosity of the Sun) and it has a mass of approximately {{nowrap|6 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es}}.&lt;ref name=apj633_1_L1/&gt;

The [[spectrum]] of this object indicates that most of its energy is being emitted by stars with three solar masses or less. Hence, as larger stars will exist for shorter periods, this galaxy has an age of more than 300&amp;nbsp;million years. The period of initial active star formation in this galaxy may have lasted less than 100&amp;nbsp;million years, during which the galaxy likely participated in the [[reionization]] event.&lt;ref name=apj633_1_L1/&gt;

The unusually high mass estimate for this object may be explained by other factors. If it has an [[active galactic nucleus]], this may reduce the mass estimate to half the current value. The estimate could also be effected by [[gravitational lensing]], although it is too far away from the nearest visible object that could produce that effect: a foreground [[spiral galaxy]] located 7&amp;Prime;.3 distant.&lt;ref name=apj635_2_832/&gt;

{{Science with neutrons}}
The High-Flux Advanced Neutron Application Reactor (HANARO) (하나로) is a 30 MW multi-purpose [[research reactor]] located at [[Daejeon]], [[Republic of Korea]]. It was designed by Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute ([[KAERI]]) as a facility for research and development on the neutron science and its applications.
HANARO has been playing a significant role as a national facility in the area of neutron science, the production of key radioisotopes, material testing for power reactor application, neutron transmutation doping ([[Doping (semiconductor)#Neutron transmutation doping|NTD]]), neutron activation analysis, and neutron radiography. After the installation of a cold neutron source in 2010, it has been also serving as a regional and international facility for neutron science.

In [[fluid mechanics]], a '''homentropic''' flow has uniform and constant [[entropy]]. It distinguishes itself from an [[Isentropic process|isentropic or particle isentropic flow]], where the entropy level of each fluid particle does not change with time, but may vary from particle to particle.  This means that a homentropic flow is necessarily isentropic, but an isentropic flow need not be homentropic.

'''Ibn al‐Ādamī''' (flourished in
[[Baghdad]], c. 925), was a 10th-century [[Islamic astronomer]] who wrote an influential work of [[zij]] based on Indian sources. The book, now lost, uses the Indian methods found in the ''[[Sindhind]]''. The 11th-century historian [[Sa'id al-Andalusi]] informs us that the theory of [[trepidation]] that became known to Europe and was ascribed to [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] can be found instead in the Zij of Ibn al-Adami, who himself may have known of this theory from Thabit's grandon, [[Ibrahim ibn Sinan]].{{sfn|Jamil Ragep|2007}} Ibn al-Adami is also the source for the story of how [[Indian astronomy]] reached the court of Caliph [[al-Mansur]] in the early 770s in Baghdad.{{sfn|Jamil Ragep|2007}}

Presumably, he is the son of [[Al-Adami]].

The '''Institute for Science and International Security''' ('''ISIS''') is a nonprofit, non-governmental institution to inform the public about "science and policy issues affecting [[international security]]."&lt;ref name=AboutISIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/about/ |title=Institute for Science and International Security: About ISIS |publisher=Isis-online.org |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1993, the group is led by founder and former United Nations [[IAEA]] nuclear inspector [[David Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/about/staff/ |title=Institute for Science and International Security: Staff |publisher=Isis-online.org |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISIS was founded on a belief that scientists have an obligation to participate actively in solving major problems of national and international security. ISIS focuses primarily on four parts: 1) prevent the spread of [[nuclear weapons]] and related technology to other nations and terrorists, 2) lead to greater transparency of nuclear activities worldwide, 3) reinforce the international [[non-proliferation]] regime, and 4) cut down nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, ISIS seeks to build stable foundations for various efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons to U.S. and international security by integrating technical, scientific and policy research. As the effectiveness of ISIS was appreciated and recognized in the Global “Go-To Think Tanks” rankings, ISIS consistently places in the top 25 Science and Technology Think Tanks in the world and in 2015 placed as one of the top United States and foreign policy think tanks in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/about/ |title=Institute for Science and International Security: About ISIS |publisher=Isis-online.org |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Advert inline|date=December 2013}}

==Focus and analysis==
[[File:Natanz isis annotated.jpg|right|frame|ISIS-DigitalGlobe satellite imagery analysis of the [[Natanz]] Uranium Enrichment Plant in Iran. February 25, 2006.]]
The institute regularly publishes technical analyses of nuclear proliferation programs by examining technical data and satellite imagery. ISIS is cited in non-proliferation circles and in international media regarding its analysis. The majority of the current material produced by ISIS is focused on the analysis and monitoring of the nuclear programs of North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, and cases of worldwide illicit nuclear trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isis-online.org |title=ISIS Website |publisher=Isis-online.org |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
In August 1991, David Albright and Mark Hibbs, writing for the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] wrote that there were many technological challenges unsolved with Iraq's nuclear program. Albright and Hibbs wrote that Iraq's nuclear program "was so primitive that the international sanctions put in place after the August 2 invasion may have had more substantive effect than the tons of bombs dropped by U.S. and allied planes five months later".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Iraq and the bomb: Were they even close?|first=David|last=Albright|author2=Mark Hibbs|date=March 1991|pages=16–25|volume=47|issue=2|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2002 posting ISIS published a report which said "One of the most significant accomplishments of the intrusive inspections mandated by UN Security Council in 1991 is that Iraq is not believed to have nuclear weapons now. This single accomplishment demonstrates both the power and value of intrusive nuclear inspections in Iraq." The report further argued that "the nuclear inspection process provided a powerful deterrent against Iraq reconstituting its nuclear weapons program until inspectors left in late 1998."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/intrusive-inspections-in-the-1990s-means-iraq-lacks-a-nuclear-arsenal-now/9 |title=Institute for Science and International Security: Intrusive Inspections in the 1990s Means Iraq Lacks a Nuclear Arsenal Now |publisher=Isis-online.org |date=October 7, 2002 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
ISIS has been following since the 1990s the circumstances surrounding the Iranian nuclear program and has created a website dedicated to informing  readers about the history of Iran's nuclear program and facilities, providing IAEA reports, providing information about diplomatic efforts, and providing ISIS technical assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isisnucleariran.org |title=Institute for Science and International Security |publisher=ISISNuclearIran |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Advert inline|date=December 2013}}

A June 2009 posting on ISIS argued that "we do know that a lasting, military solution to Iran’s nuclear program is not realistic.  This leaves diplomacy as the best route to bring about a suspension of Iran’s uranium enrichment program, regardless of who holds Iran’s presidency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isisnucleariran.org/news/detail/beware-the-neocon-agenda-for-iran/ |title=Institute for Science and International Security: Beware the neocon agenda for Iran |publisher=Isisnucleariran.org |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120803160012/http://www.isisnucleariran.org/news/detail/beware-the-neocon-agenda-for-iran/ |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myanmar===
In a January 28, 2010 report, ISIS found: "There remain sound reasons to suspect that the military regime in Burma might be pursuing a long-term strategy to make nuclear weapons. Despite the public reports to the contrary, the military junta does not appear to be close to establishing a significant nuclear capability.

==Reception to ISIS==
A ''[[National Journal]]'' profile in 2004 called Albright a “go-to guy for media people seeking independent analysis on Iraq’s [weapons of mass destruction] programs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gregg Sangillo and Mark Kukis |url=http://www3.nationaljournal.com/members/news/2004/05/0521nj7.htm |title=The Experts: Weapons Threat Nuclear, and Other, Worries |work=National Journal |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |date=May 25, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130129221314/http://www3.nationaljournal.com/members/news/2004/05/0521nj7.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, David Albright received the prestigious Joseph A. Burton Forum Award from the American Physical Society, a professional society of American physicists. He was cited for "his tireless and productive efforts to slow the transfer of nuclear weapons technology. He brings a unique combination of deep understanding, objectivity, and effectiveness to this vexed area.”&lt;ref name=APS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=David%20Albright&amp;year=2006 |title=2006 Joseph A.

{{Div col end}}

== Contestants and competition ==

Contestants are selected from regional, district, and state ISEF affiliated fairs. These fairs usually encompass multiple states or entire regions of a country. The regional fair committee is responsible for managing the fair when their city hosts the event.

Individual science projects and team science projects both compete for prizes. Teams are composed of two to as many as four high school students (grades 9-12).

The structure of the competition is as follows:
* Sunday: Arrival, project setup, fixing Display and Safety violations, and pin exchange
* Monday: Continual arrival and setup, opening ceremony
* Tuesday: Final project clearance
* Wednesday: Awards judging over 3 sessions, with both scheduled and unscheduled interviews
* Thursday: Public visitation day, special awards ceremony
* Friday: Grand awards ceremony, project teardown

Additionally, time is set aside for students to experience the host city, with ISEF coordinating signups for various tours and activities. A significant component of the program is social, as students interact with each other during mixers and ceremonies. Throughout much of the week, various seminars are also held for students, mentors, and teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">'''John Elliott (Jack) Nafe''' (July 22, 1914 in [[Seattle]] &amp;ndash; April 6, 1996) was an American oceanographer and geophysicist best known for his work on acoustic propagation in the oceans and solid earth.

Born in Seattle, Nafe received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1938.  He then served in the [[United States Merchant Marine]], leaving to begin graduate studies at [[Washington University]].  He obtained an MS degree in 1940, then joined the Navy during World War II, during which he taught physics and engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy.

Returning to graduate studies at [[Columbia University]] after the war, he worked with [[I.I. Rabi]] on a celebrated experiment that determined the magnetic moment of the hydrogen atom.  He received his Ph.D. in 1948.

Nafe was for three years a faculty member at the [[University of Minnesota]], then returned to Columbia's [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]], where he began to study the acoustic properties of the oceans as they are affected by temperature, salinity and pressure.  For the U.S. Navy, he worked on a listening system for detecting submerged submarines at long distances.

Nafe's acoustical research later turned to the solid earth, where he was among the first to develop an accurate relation between density and seismic velocity, allowing inferences about the structure of the Earth.

Nafe was chair of Columbia's geology department from 1962 to 1965. He suffered a severe stroke in 1976 and retired to Vancouver in 1980.

Pattison (2005), A Standard Approach to Measurement Uncertainties for Scientists and Engineers in Medicine, ''Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine'' '''28'''(2):131-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GUM provides a way to express the perceived quality of the result of a measurement. Rather than express the result by providing an estimate of the measurand along with information about systematic and random error values (in the form of an "error analysis"), the GUM approach is to express the result of a measurement as an estimate of the measurand along with an associated measurement uncertainty.

One of the basic premises of the GUM approach is that it is possible to characterize the quality of a measurement by accounting for both systematic and random errors on a comparable footing, and a method is provided for doing that. This method refines the information previously provided in an "error analysis", and puts it on a probabilistic basis through the concept of measurement uncertainty.

Another basic premise of the GUM approach is that it is not possible to state how well the true value of the measurand is known, but only how well it is believed to be known. Measurement uncertainty can therefore be described as a measure of how well one believes one knows the true value of the measurand. This uncertainty reflects the incomplete knowledge of the measurand.

The notion of "belief" is an important one, since it moves metrology into a realm where results of measurement need to be considered and quantified in terms of [[Probability|probabilities]] that express degrees of belief.

=== VIM: International vocabulary of metrology ===
The '''International vocabulary of metrology''' ('''VIM''') &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf |title=International vocabulary of metrology — basic and general concepts and associated terms |publisher= Joint Committee on Guides for Metrology (JCGM) |year=2008 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an attempt to find a common language and terminology in [[metrology]], i.e. the science of measurements, across different fields of science, legislature and commerce. The 3rd edition was developed using the principles of terminology work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/47/3/003 |title=ISO terminological analysis of the VIM3 concepts ‘quantity’ and ‘kind-of-quantity’ |journal=Metrologia |year=2010 |volume=47 |pages=127–134|bibcode = 2010Metro..47..127D |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/47/3/003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ISO 704:2000 Terminology Work—Principles and Methods; ISO 1087-1:2000 Terminology Work—Vocabulary—Part 1:Theory and Application; ISO 10241:1992 International Terminology Standards—Preparation and Layout).

The VIM is the most global attempt to standardize terminology across different fields of science, legislature, commerce and trade. The vocabulary has the following content:

: Foreword
: Introduction
: Conventions
: Scope
:: 1. Quantities and units
:: 2. Measurement
:: 3. Devices for measurement
:: 4. Properties of measuring devices
:: 5. Measurement standards (Etalons)
: Annex A (informative) Concept diagrams
: Bibliography
: List of acronyms
: Alphabetical index

Newer versions and corrigenda are available here: [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/vim.html]

==== Usage ====
Acceptance of VIM standards is rather good in legislature, commerce and trade where it is often legally required. Acceptance is also good in textbooks and many fields of sciences. There are, however, some fields of science that stick to their traditional jargon, most notably [[theoretical physics]] and [[mass spectrometry]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Lindsay Atkins Eddie''' (1845 &amp;ndash; 13 October 1913) was a [[South Africa|South-African]] amateur [[astronomer]]. The son of an Army surgeon, Eddie also saw active military service, serving with distinction during the [[Kafir invasion]] in 1876. His final rank was that of a [[Major]].

During his career he observed 21 [[comet]]s, mostly from [[Grahamstown, South Africa]]. He observed a transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1894. In 1907 he studied the [[planet]] [[Mars]] with great detail and published drawings that were highly acclaimed.

He was an elected fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. A [[Eddie (crater)|crater]] on Mars is named in his honor.

This is a '''list of countries by southernmost point''' on land.  Where borders are contested, the southernmost point under the control of a nation is listed, excluding points within [[Antarctica]] and its outlying islands south of 60°S.  A selection of dependent territories is listed, but not ranked.

The [[Solomon Islands]] currently exercises [[de facto]] sovereignty over Sikaiana, but the natives have claimed that it is legally a territory of the United States as the successor of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

'''Partial impact theory''' is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] theory describing the partial collision of two [[star]]s and the temporary creation of a bright third [[star]] as a consequence. The theory was explained in [[Alexander William Bickerton]]'s book ''The Romance of the Heavens'' published in 1901.

In ''The Romance of the Heavens'' [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] states that a slight ''"grazing"'' collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars. So he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days.

The theory explains that when the two [[Star|stellar]] bodies graze each other, the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star. Their velocity will cancel each other's out transforming this energy into heat. While the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision. The third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars.

The temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light, after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a [[planetary nebula]], and eventually dissipates into [[space]]. [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] explains this bright temporary star by saying that it doesn't disappear due to cooling, but that it was too hot to hold together.

The temperature of the third star, isn't dependent on the amount of contact between the two original stars, but rather the chemical makeup of the stars and their velocities going into the collision. The stability of the third body depends on the size of the contact of the original stars, if the contact was small then the mass of the newly created third body will find it harder to attract [[molecules]] to it. Rather than if it had a larger mass where molecules would find it more difficult to escape from its larger gravitational pull.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, A.W, (1901).''The Romance of the Heavens''. London. Swan Sonnencchein &amp; Co., Lim.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image is not the original publication of Bekker's recension from which the standard [[Bekker numbering|Bekker numbers]] are derived. Indeed, Bekker numbers do not appear at all, though the recension is Bekker's, and the book and chapter numbers derived from the age of manuscripts (not known when) are used. For Bekker's arrangement, see the 1831 edition published by the Academia Regia Borussica in Berlin.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;An explanation of Bekker numbering along with an image of Page 184, the start of ''Physics'', is to be found in {{cite web | title=How to Cite Aristotle | url=http://minerva.union.edu/wareht/aristotle/how_to_cite_aristotle.pdf | publisher=Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. | accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Physics''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Φυσικὴ ἀκρόασις ''Phusike akroasis''; [[Latin]]: ''Physica'', or ''Naturalis Auscultationes'', possibly meaning "[[Natural philosophy|lectures on nature]]") is a named text, written in ancient Greek, collated from a collection of surviving manuscripts known as the [[Corpus Aristotelicum]] because attributed to the 4th-century BC philosopher, teacher, and mentor of Macedonian rulers, [[Aristotle]]. Due to the unique educational methods of the Athenian school founded by Aristotle, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], at the period of its greatest success, and the accidental circumstances surrounding the disposition and rediscovery of its library after his death, it is possible to say that without a doubt some of that library descends to the ''Corpus'' and that some must be attributed mainly or entirely to Aristotle, but it is not possible to say for sure which works. The two answers excluded by the circumstances are "all" and "none".

Standard epistemological method has been to accept the entire ''Corpus'' tentatively as genuine; that is, transmitted by manuscript copying from one or more original manuscripts in the library. As soon as evidence is perceived or discovered to make a case that a work is not Aristotle's, it is crossed out, but left in the list. Such a cross-out does not mean that its author was not influenced by Aristotle, or did not have Aristotle's work in front of him.

== The meaning of physics in Aristotle ==
It is a collection of treatises or lessons that deal with the most general (philosophical) principles of natural or moving things, both living and non-living, rather than physical theories (in the modern sense) or investigations of the particular contents of the universe. The chief purpose of the work is to discover the principles and causes of (and not merely to describe) change, or movement, or motion (κίνησις ''kinesis''), especially that of natural wholes (mostly living things, but also inanimate wholes like the cosmos).  In the conventional [[Andronicus of Rhodes|Andronicean]] ordering of Aristotle's works, it stands at the head of, as well as being foundational to, the long series of physical, cosmological and biological treatises, whose ancient Greek title, τὰ φυσικά, means "the [writings] on nature" or "[[natural philosophy]]".

== Description of the content ==

The ''Physics'' is composed of eight books, which are further divided into chapters. This system is of ancient origin, now obscure. In modern languages, books are referenced with Roman numerals, standing for ancient Greek capital letters (the Greeks represented numbers with letters; i.e., I for A). Chapters are identified by Arabic numerals, but the use of the English word "chapter" is strictly conventional. Ancient "chapters" (capita) are generally very short, often less than a page. Additionally, the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] give the page and column (a or b) used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences' edition of Aristotle's works, instigated and managed by Bekker himself. These are evident in the 1831 2-volume edition. Bekker's line numbers may be given. These are often given, but unless the edition is the Academy's, they do match any line counts.

===Book I (Α; 184a–192b)===
Book I introduces the Aristotle's approach to nature, which is to be based on principles, causes, and elements. Before offering his particular views, he engages previous theories, such as those offered by Melissus and Parmenides.  Aristotle's own view comes out in Ch. 7 where he identifies three principles: substances, opposites, and privation.

Chapters 3 and 4 are among the most difficult in all of Aristotle's works and involve subtle refutations of the thought of Parmenides, Melissus and Anaxagoras.

In chapter 5, he continues his review of his predecessors, particularly how many first principles there are. Chapter 6 narrows down the number of principles to two or three.  He presents his own account of the subject in chapter 7, where he first introduces the word '''matter''' (Greek: ''[[hyle]]'' to designate fundamental essence (ousia). He defines matter in chapter 9: "For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result."

Matter in Aristotle's thought is, however, defined in terms of sensible reality; for example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it{{spaced ndash}}its matter{{spaced ndash}}does. Matter is not specifically described, but consists of whatever is apart from quality or quantity and that of which something may be predicated. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e. as a [[Substance theory|substance]]), but exists interdependently (i.e. as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. Matter and form are [[Analogy|analogical]] terms.

===Book II (Β; 192b–200b)===
Book II identifies "nature" (''physis'') as "a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily" (1.192b21). Thus, those entities are natural which are capable of starting to move, e.g. growing, acquiring qualities, displacing themselves, and finally being born and dying. Aristotle contrasts natural things with the artificial: artificial things can move also, but they move according to what they are made of, not according to what they are. For example, if a wooden bed were buried and somehow sprouted as a tree, it would be according to what it is made of, not what it is. Aristotle contrasts two senses of nature: nature as matter and nature as form or definition.

By "nature", Aristotle means the natures of particular things and would perhaps be better translated "a nature." In Book II, however, his appeal to "nature" as a source of activities is more typically to the [[Genus–differentia definition|genera]] of natural kinds (the [[Substance theory|secondary substance]]). But, contra [[Plato]], Aristotle attempts to resolve a philosophical quandary that was well understood in the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Hankinson1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxian planetary model]] sufficed for the [[wandering stars]], but no deduction of terrestrial substance would be forthcoming based solely on the mechanical principles of necessity, (ascribed by Aristotle to material causation in chapter 9). In [[the Enlightenment]], centuries before modern science made good on [[atomism|atomist intuitions]], a nominal allegiance to [[mechanistic materialism]] gained popularity despite harboring Newton's [[action at a distance (physics)|action at distance]], and comprising the native habitat of [[teleological argument]]s: Machines or artifacts composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other with their order imposed from without. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts. While Aristotle asserts that the matter (and parts) are a necessary cause of things{{spaced ndash}}the material cause{{spaced ndash}}he says that nature is primarily the essence or formal cause (1.193b6), that is, the information, the whole species itself.

{{quote
 | The necessary in nature, then, is plainly what we call by the name of matter, and the changes in it. Both causes must be stated by the physicist, but especially the end; for that is the cause of the matter, not vice versa; and the end is 'that for the sake of which', and the beginning starts from the definition or essence…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#646 |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |editor=trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye |at=II 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 |Aristotle |''Physics'' II 9
}}

In chapter 3, Aristotle presents his theory of the [[four causes]] (material, efficient, formal, and final&lt;ref&gt;For an especially clear discussion, see chapter 6 of Mortimer Adler, ''Aristotle for Everybody: Difficult Thought Made Easy'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;). Material cause explains what something is made of (for example, the wood of a house), formal cause explains the form which a thing follows to become that thing (the plans of an architect to build a house), efficient cause is the actual source of the change (the physical building of the house), and final cause is the intended purpose of the change (the final product of the house and its purpose as a shelter and home).

Of particular importance is the ''final cause'' or purpose (''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'').  It is a common mistake to conceive of the four causes as additive or alternative forces pushing or pulling; in reality, all four are needed to explain (7.198a22-25). What we typically mean by cause in the modern scientific idiom is only a narrow part of what Aristotle means by efficient cause.
He contrasts purpose with the way in which "nature" does not work, chance (or luck), discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Chance working in the actions of humans is ''tuche'' and in unreasoning agents ''automaton''.) Something happens by chance when all the lines of causality converge without that convergence being purposefully chosen, and produce a result similar to the [[teleology|teleologically]] caused one.

In chapters 7 through 9, Aristotle returns to the discussion of nature. With the enrichment of the preceding four chapters, he concludes that nature acts for an end, and he discusses the way that necessity is present in natural things. For Aristotle, the motion of natural things is determined from within them, while in the modern empirical sciences, motion is determined from without (more properly speaking: there is nothing to have an inside).

===Book III (Γ; 200b–208a)===
In order to understand "nature" as defined in the previous book, one must understand the terms of the definition. To understand motion, book III begins with the definition of change based on Aristotle's notions of [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality and actuality]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the topic with some interpretations of Aristotle's vocabulary, see {{cite encyclopedia | last=Sachs | first=Joe | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aris-mot.htm | title=Motion and its Place in Nature | encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change, he says, is the actualization of a thing's ability insofar as it is able.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brague|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the book (chapters 4-8) discusses the infinite (''apeiron'', the unlimited). He distinguishes between the infinite by addition and the infinite by division, and between the [[Actual infinity|actually infinite]] and potentially infinite.  He argues against the actually infinite in any form, including infinite bodies, substances, and voids.  Aristotle here says the only type of infinity that exists is the potentially infinite.  Aristotle characterizes this as that which serves as "the matter for the completion of a magnitude and is potentially (but not actually) the completed whole" (207a22-23).  The infinite, lacking any form, is thereby unknowable.  Aristotle writes, "it is not what has nothing outside it that is infinite, but what always has something outside it" (6.206b33-207a1-2).

===Book IV (Δ; 208a–223b)===
Book IV discusses the preconditions of motion: place (''topos'', chapters 1-5), [[The Void (philosophy)|void]] (''kenon'', chapters 6-9), and time (''khronos'', chapters 10-14).  The book starts by distinguishing the various ways a thing can "be in" another. He likens place to an immobile container or vessel: "the innermost motionless boundary of what contains" is the primary place of a body (4.212a20). Unlike space, which is a volume co-existent with a body, place is a boundary or surface.

He teaches that, contrary to the Atomists and others, a void is not only unnecessary, but leads to contradictions, e.g., making locomotion impossible.

Time is a constant attribute of movements and, Aristotle thinks, does not exist on its own but is relative to the motions of things. Tony Roark describes Aristotle's view of time as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristotle defines time as "a  number of motion with respect to the before and after" (''Phys.'' 219b1–2), by which he intends to denote motion’s susceptibility to division into undetached parts of arbitrary length, a property that it possesses both by virtue of its intrinsic nature and also by virtue of the capacities and activities of percipient souls. Motion is intrinsically indeterminate, but  perceptually determinable, with respect to its length. Acts of perception function as determiners; the result is determinate units of kinetic length, which is precisely what a temporal unit is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roark|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Books V and VI (Ε: 224a–231a; Ζ: 231a–241b)===
Books V and VI deal with ''how'' motion occurs. Book V classifies four species of movement, depending on where the opposites are located.  Movement categories include quantity (e.g. a change in dimensions, from great to small), quality (as for colors: from pale to dark), place (local movements generally go from up downwards and vice versa), or, more controversially, substance. In fact, substances do not have opposites, so it is inappropriate to say that ''something'' properly becomes, from not-man, man: [[On Generation and Corruption|generation and corruption]] are not ''kinesis'' in the full sense.

Book VI discusses how a changing thing can reach the opposite state, if it has to pass through infinite intermediate stages. It investigates by rational and logical arguments the notions of ''continuity'' and ''division'', establishing that change—and, consequently, time and place—are not divisible into indivisible parts; they are not mathematically [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] but continuous, that is, infinitely divisible (in other words, that you cannot build up a continuum out of discrete or indivisible points or moments). Among other things, this implies that there can be no definite (indivisible) moment when a motion begins. This discussion, together with that of speed and the different behavior of the four different species of motion, eventually helps Aristotle answer the famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], which purport to show the absurdity of motion's existence.

===Book VII (Η; 241a25–250b7)===
Book VII briefly deals with the relationship of the moved to his mover, which Aristotle describes in substantial divergence with '''[[Plato]]''''s theory of the soul as capable of setting itself in motion (''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' book X, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'').  Everything which moves is moved by another. He then tries to correlate the species of motion and their speeds, with the local change (locomotion, ''phorà'') as the most fundamental to which the others can be reduced.

Book VII.1-3 also exist in an alternative version, not included in the [[Bekker numbers|Bekker edition]].

===Book VIII (Θ; 250a14–267b26)===
Book VIII (which occupies almost a fourth of the entire ''Physics'', and probably constituted originally an independent course of lessons) discusses two main topics, though with a wide deployment of arguments: the time [[Cosmological argument|limits of the universe]], and the existence of a [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] — eternal, indivisible, without parts and without magnitude. Isn't the universe eternal, has it had a beginning, will it ever end? Aristotle's response, as a Greek, could hardly be affirmative, never having been told of a ''creatio ex nihilo,'' but he also has philosophical reasons for denying that motion had not always existed, on the grounds of the theory presented in the earlier books of the ''Physics''. Eternity of motion is also confirmed by the existence of a substance which is different from all the others in lacking matter; being pure form, it is also in an eternal actuality, not being imperfect in any respect; hence needing not to move. This is demonstrated by describing the celestial bodies thus: the first things to be moved must undergo an infinite, single and continuous movement, that is, circular. This is not caused by any contact but (integrating the view contained in the [[Aristotelian view of God|Metaphysics, bk. XII]]) by love and aspiration.

== Significance to some major modern philosophers and teachers ==
The works of Aristotle are typically considered foundational to Western science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote=''Aristotle's ''Physics'' is the hidden, and therefore never adequately studied, foundational book of Western philosophy.'' | first=Martin | last=Heidegger | chapter=On the Essence and Concept of φὐσις in Aristotle's ''Physics'' Β, 1 | title=Pathmarks | editor-first=William | editor-last=McNeill | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1998 | pages=183–230, 185}} (Emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt; The citations below are not given as any sort of final modern judgement on the interpretation and significance of Aristotle, but are only the views of some modern notables.

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]] writes:

{{quote
 | The ''Physics'' is a lecture in which he seeks to determine beings that arise on their own, τὰ φύσει ὄντα, with regard to their being. Aristotelian "physics" is different from what we mean today by this word, not only to the extent that it belongs to antiquity whereas the modern physical sciences belong to modernity, rather above all it is different by virtue of the fact that Aristotle's "physics" is philosophy, whereas modern physics is a positive science that presupposes a philosophy.... This book determines the warp and woof of the whole of Western thinking, even at that place where it, as modern thinking, appears to think at odds with ancient thinking. But opposition is invariably {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a decisive, and often even perilous, dependence. Without Aristotle's ''Physics'' there would have been no [[Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Martin | last=Heidegger | authorlink=Martin Heidegger | title=The Principle of Reason | translator-first=Reginald | translator-last=Lilly | location=Bloomington | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=1991 | series=Studies in Continental Thought | pages=62–63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWDUmlA6M98C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] says of ''Physics'' and ''[[On the Heavens]]'' (which he believed was a continuation of ''Physics'') that they were:

==The authorship paradox==
According to Diogenes Laertius, The library of the Lyceum at its peak under Aristotle comprised many types of books: works authored by the elders under their names, works authored by elders and young men, signatures uncertain, copies of works written by other authors on research topics, and research results of unspecified form. This same library continues under Theophrastus, acquiring more works of the same type, except that Aristotle is no longer a contributor. On the death of Theophrastus, we are led to believe, the library disappears for 200 years, having been safely abscended by Neleus. Just as suddenly it reappears, having been rescued, cared for by three editors and a powerful aristocrat, to be published in a new recension by Andronicus, and to descend to us this very day as Bekker pages. The paradox is that the recension that descends bears little resemblance to the library at Athens. It contains only books specifically authored by Aristotle with the inclusions of works later shown to be spurious. There are no works of Theophrastus or anyone else and no explanation of what happened to all the other books. The library that was rescued cannot possibly be the one that needed rescuing.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Grote takes note of the problem even before the discovery of the ''Constitution'', which he is embarrassed to relate, he says, considering the credibility invested in Aristotle: {{harvnb|Grote|1970|p=31}} "Here, then, we find several embarrassing facts in regard to the Aristotelian Canon. Most of the works now accepted and known as belonging to Aristotle, are neither included in the full Aristotelian Catalogue given by Diogenes, nor were they known to Cicero; who, moreover, ascribes to Aristotle attributes of style not only different, but opposite, to those which our Aristotle presents."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research at the Lyceum ==
Recent archaeological discoveries at Athens have verified that there was a school in the park called Lyceum and that one of the foundations fits the shape of a rectangular library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Corinne | last=Chandler | title=Aristotle's Lyceum | publisher=Matt Barrett's Athens Survival Guide | url=https://athensguide.com/aristotle-lyceum/index.htm | accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had in fact still been a park (or garden), and will remain one, according to the Greek government. Study of the ancient sources reveals that, regardless of its legal status, whether owned, rented, or just occupied, an organization did reside there, which called itself "the friends" (''[[philoi]]'') and the establishment "the school (''[[wikt:διατριβή|diatribe]]'') of the friends.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was its own name, or [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]. It meant that the relationship of belonging to the school was "completely informal." The name ''[[wikt:περιπατητικός|peripatetikoi]]'', those who inhabited the walkways, or ''[[wikt:περίπατος|peripatoi]]'', of the gymnasion in the park, is an exonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The friends lived in a "cooperative" (''[[koinonia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They dined together and together had responsibility for the facilities, including the library and the museum. They paid no one and received no pay from anyone. The expenses for the establishment were assumed by wealthy patrons, one of whom was Aristotle; however, during the time that [[Alexander the Great]] was a friend, there were no financial worries. For all these informalities, they were nevertheless considered to be either "young men" (''neaniskoi'') or "elders" (''[[wikt:πρεσβύτερος|presbuteroi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, did have some power, beginning with his position, described by English scholars as [[scholarch|scholiarch]], "ruler of the school."&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;''Scholiarch'' though a useful term in scholarship is a fantasy of the English language. It is based on ''scholarch'', which is used by the classical writers, but so rarely that it does not even appear in the standard Greek dictionaries. The head of a school, such as Plato or Aristotle, is generally called the ''archon'' or ''master'' or the "leader." Aristotle's transference of the title to any friend at random is believed indicative of his humanistic views. He was nevertheless the guiding light, with the power to name Theophrastus as successor.&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule did not include the day-to-day operation of the school, as he instituted the equivalent of a maritime "watch" to take care of that; i.e., every 10 days he appointed an [[archon]], "master," from the friends.

The business of the friends was not merely education in existing knowledge. As is expressed in the first few paragraphs of ''Physics'', they were interested in discovering the principles, or elements of the knowledge, which was an entirely new goal in Greek education. This research was divided into specific "fields" ([[wikt:μέθοδος|methodoi]]). First they collected written works representing the existing knowledge. Subsequently, they collected field data through interviews and specimen-hunting. Aristotle is the first known scientist to have sent out field workers, and to have sent them with military expeditions. Alexander's ethnic and political intelligence gathering as a friend of the school was certainly of greatest value in his ultimate goal, to create a new, multi-cultural world empire. His was the first known army to feature a military historian unit. He was said to have assigned thousands of men to the task of collecting specimens, presumably in addition to their military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1972|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step in a research project was analysis of all the information to ascertain "scientific knowledge" ([[episteme]]) of the "elements" ([[wikt:element|stoicheia]]), the "causes" ([[aitia]]), and the "first principles" ([[wikt:principle|archai]]) of the topic. These were written in a new type of document, which has survived in the ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;It has been called a "systematic treatise" in modern times: {{harvnb|Corazzon|2016|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a brief survey of the previous views, it launched into the definitions and conclusions in a style similar to a geometric presentation. The papers were then stored in the library. Their authors, analysts, contributors, whether or not they were emended, or corrected, and by whom, remain unknown for certain. Diogenes Laertius called these "notebooks" (hypomnemata) and said that Aristotle wrote "an unusual number."

== The question of the library ==
=== Transition from cooperative to private school ===
According to [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Strabo | title=Geography 13.1.54 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neleus of Scepsis|Neleus, son of Coriscus]], a friend at the Lyceum, "inherited the library ([[wikt:bibliotheke|bibliotheke]]) of [[Theophrastus]], which included that of Aristotle."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Novak|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus received Aristotle's library by being bequeathed it along with the school. Theophrastus was the first book collector, as far as Strabo knew. Apparently, the elders owned their own libraries and could dispose of them as they pleased.

The main problems with this view are, first of all, that Aristotle's Will survives credibly in [[Diogenes Laërtius|
Diogenes Laertius']] (D.L.'s) ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' under ''Aristotle''. There is not one word about a library. Moreover, Aristotle, a [[metic]], or foreign resident of Athens, was not allowed to own property or bequeath it, so he could not have either owned the school with its library or have left it to anyone by legal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Novak|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he were not a metic, he could not have disposed of the land and buildings, which were municipal property.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;A speculative theory by Baltussen supposes that the location outside the walls relieved the metics of their rights and responsibilities as metics making it possible for Aristotle to own the school, justifying Strabo: {{cite book | first=Hans | last=Baltussen | title=The Peripatetics: Aristotle's Heirs 322 BCE - 200 CE | location=New York; Abingdon | publisher=Routledge | year=2016 | chapter=Aristotle's Heirs | page=2 | quote=The Lykeion was located outside the city walls because as a metic (non-Athenian, 'immigrant') Aristotle was not allowed to own property in the city of Athens.}} On the contrary, the only thing the location got him was a beautiful park, a spring, a ready-made gymnasion, and a place to put a zoo and botanical garden, as the walls were a recent military defense and not any sort of border. The Academics used the park quite a lot. A recent study of the status of metics based on Athenian orations and passages from historians may be found in {{cite thesis | first=Matthew John | last=Kears | title=Metics and Identity in Democratic Athens | year=2013 | degree=PhD | location=Birmingham, GB | publisher=University of Birminham | url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5046/1/Kears14PhD.pdf}} According to Kears, the ancient requirement for citizenship was being autochthonous, "of the land," which was [[Attica]] and not some small area defined by wall. The citizens were registered in demes, or districts, throughout it. The law required both parents to be autochthonous.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the other friends could either. According to the laws in effect on the day Aristotle died, no one could own or bequeath the school to anyone. The city owned it. As to whether Aristotle and Theophrastus had additional personal libraries of their own, first, private ownership was not in the spirit of the school, and second, the fate of the school after Theophrastus suggests that the library was in fact the school library.

After the death of Alexander, Athens staged a brief revolt against the Macedonians. Turning their attention to the school, they went after Aristotle, who went into exile to escape the death penalty. He died in exile. Within a few years Athens was again under Macedon ruled by [[Cassander]]. Theophrastus returned in triumph to the school under the authority of the new vice-regent of Athens, [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a friend of the school and former student of Theophrastus. The school became even greater than before, but Demetrius made some changes to the administration. D.L. says only that Theophrastus "is said to have become the owner of a garden of his own after Aristotle's death, through the intervention of his friend, Demetrius of Phalerum." Apparently D.L. does not quite understand his source. The meaning was not "his friend." This was not a personal favor. A "friend" is an associate of the school. There were not two gardens; Theophrastus was not a poor man in need of some property of his own. His extensive will details the disposition of the assets of the school as his own property, including the garden. He names the friends and wants to make sure that they understand the ownership is to be treated as joint. Demetrius had simply instituted the legal convention prevalent at other schools of having the master own the school and its assets.

The very disposition of the property in Theophrastus' will is an attempt to restore the koinonia established by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Millett | year=1991 | title=Lending and borrowing in ancient Athens | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden, the walks, and the buildings around the garden are to go to ten named friends,&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes, Melantes, Pancreon, and Nicippus, with rights also to Aristotle, grandson of Aristotle, then a child. Most are not known further to the sources.&lt;/ref&gt; to be held in common, provided they use the property for the study of literature and philosophy. This is provisional ownership. If the provisions are not met, the property must revert to someone by law, probably the proprietor, or owner, of the school. The total property of Theophrastus as proprietor was much larger. The family estate at [[Eresos|Eresus]] and the Aristotelian property at [[Stagira]] went to individual friends. He also owned funds in trust managed by Hipparchus. The latter was enjoined to use them to rebuild the museum and other buildings. He also had slaves in his possession (as had Aristotle). They were either set free or given to friends. He had one [[freedman]] client, whom he rewarded richly for four more years of maintaining the buildings.

=== Abscondence of the library by Neleus ===
The will contains one more bequest that is rather peculiar. It has a bearing on the nature of the ''Corpus'', whether it is Aristotle's, Aristotle's and Theophrastus', or of all the friends. There is as yet no solution to the problem of authorship, or rather lack of it. Ancient sources on the topic are inconsistent. There is no general scholarly consensus and no agreed preponderance of evidence.

The will relates in translation "The whole of my library I give to Neleus." The heart of the school was its library, containing all the research results and analytical papers (the notebooks). Without it the friends could not produce current or meaningful lectures about the topics for which the school was known (physics, rhetoric, etc.) All the other school property was being redistributed to the friends in common (except that the foreign estates were given individual owners, probably for their management, while the slaves and the minor received individual guardians), but the heart of the school, without which it could not pump knowledge, was not to be common property, an anomalous approach for the circumstances. No explanation at all is to be found in ancient sources. The moderns almost universally retrieve one explanation, that Neleus was the intended heir of the archonship, although that, strangely, is nowhere suggested. The law still required an archon with property rights over the school.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is to be found in most books on the topic. As an example, see {{harvnb|Watson|2012|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the implied expectation, Neleus did not become the scholiarch; instead, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] did. Again, there are no details of how or why he acquired the position or any statement of Neleus's feelings about it, inviting speculation.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One popular speculation has Neleus losing an election to Strato ({{harvnb|Lynch|2010|p=81}}). The school was not democratic. Aristotle never held elections. The first proprietor to request replacement by election in his will was Lyco, but he had the option of requesting it or not. There was no expectation or process in place. The peripatetics did not share in the Athenian ideal as they were not Athenian. Certainly, the Macedonians, who were friends, decided nothing by democracy, yet it would be hard to find a figure as democratic in his relationships as Alexander. He listened to everyone within reason. When he had made up his mind, it was dangerous to oppose him.&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo then relates what is universally considered an act of perfidy against the school. He was given the library with the understanding that it would be shared as common property. Instead "Neleus took it to Skepsis and bequeathed it to his heirs, ordinary people, who kept the books locked up ...." The result, according to Strabo, was that the school "... had no books at all, with the exception of only a few, ... and were therefore able ... only to talk bombast about commonplace propositions ...." No details or motives are given. Speculations are rife.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One school of speculations is exculpatory, as in the following example: {{cite book | first=Rudolph | last=Blum | translator-first=Hans H. | translator-last=Wellisch | year=1991 | title=Kallimachos: The Alexandrian Library and the Origins of Bibliography | location=Madison | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | page=61 | quote=Perhaps he wanted to found a school himself ... That was of course a loss ... but not a catastrophe, because the members ... certainly had copies.}} To the contrary, no school was ever founded, and Blum is suggesting a duplicate library concept, which is in no way stated or implied by any source. It seems logical that some friends had copies of individual books in which they were interested, but a number of sources indicate a library in the thousands of books, which leads to the legitimate question of whether Neleus removed the entire library.&lt;/ref&gt; Every author has something to say, some judgement to render.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Jacob proposes the books were willed to Neleus' family, who were ''idiotoi anthropoi'', "uneducated men," as a "long-term investment" in rare books: {{cite book | first=Christian | last=Jacob | chapter=Fragments of a history of ancient libraries | editor1-first=Jason | editor1-last=König |  editor2-first=Katerina | editor2-last=Oikonomopoulou | editor3-first=Greg | editor3-last=Woolf | title=Ancient Libraries | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2013 | page=70}} But, the growing community of book collectors only knew the value of the books because they were educated men. The relatives could have been informed by Neleus, but this thought is a speculation on a speculation. By Strabo's report, the books were kept for several generations and sold in dilapidated, partly unreadable condition to Apellicon for an unrefusable price only after persuasion. In another example, Theophrastus allocates funds in his will for the repair of recent vandalism to the museum: {{harvnb|Watson|2012|p=273}}. Watson hypothesizes that Neleus removed the books to protect them. The ruination of the entire school to protect its library seems pointless.&lt;/ref&gt; All are conscious of the fact that, were it not for this perfidy, there would be no ''corpus'' as it is known today.

Strabo's anecdote is not the sole ancient authority on Neleus' disposition of the books. [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], in his work [[Deipnosophistae]], "Dinner Sophists," an imaginary portrayal of a series of banquets at which the guests are famous literary figures of the past (over 700), so that the reader is served up menus and snippets of sophistry together, has his main character, the host, ''Laurentius'' ("Lawrence") possessing 
:"such a library of ancient Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are remarkable for such collections; such as ... Aristotle the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say that our countryman Ptolemæus, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported them with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful Alexandria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Athenaeus | author-link=Athenaeus | translator-first=C.D. | translator-last=Yonge | title=The Deipnosophists. Or Banquet Of The Learned Of Athenaeus | location=London | publisher=Henry G. Bohn | year=1854 | chapter=Book I Chapter 4 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the rules of logic (Aristotle's very rules) both accounts may not be received as "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," as the American legal principle for courtroom testimony requires. The easiest solution would be to drop one in favor of the other, and many authors take it. The remaining solution is to accept both as partially true, creating a window of opportunity for speculatory explanation of differences between the Alexandrian and Skepsian traditions.

=== The dual tradition of texts ===
====The ambiguous name, Corpus Aristotelicum====
The tradition best known to moderns is the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'', [[New Latin]] for "Aristotelic body," a term not used by Bekker. The Prussian Academy published his 1831 edition under the name ''Aristoteles Graece'', "Aristotle in Greek," where Aristoteles is the [[nominative case]]. In most Latin and New Latin book titles the author is in the [[genitive case]], such as ''Aristotelis Opera'', "the works of Aristotle." Individual works are so named by Bekker, but none of this is any sort of ''corpus''.

In the late 19th century the ''corpus'' phrase began to appear in the notes of the German historians of philosophy, such as [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]] and [[Wilhelm Windelband|Windelband]].&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Zeller|1897a|p=40}} "We should look to find in Andronicus's edition those writings above all that are included in our extant Corpus Aristotelicum, which is derived, speaking broadly, from his own." The only comprehensive ''corpus'' he could possibly mean was Bekker's, by then the standard.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication they meant Bekker, but even as they wrote a new manuscript was being excavated from the trash-heaps of Egypt about which Bekker knew nothing at all, or anyone else for at least a few thousand years: the [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)]].&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;One of the 4th-century [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]. It was matched to a papyrus in the British Museum purchased from Cairo bearing the ''Constitution'' on one side and some 1st-century Egyptian business accounts on the other. The total find circumstances are related in the ''Introduction'' to Loeb L285, which is in the public domain and can be downloaded at {{cite web | first=Ryan | last=Baumann | title=Loebolus | url=https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified as being one of 158 political studies written by Aristotle and his students no earlier than 330 BC. It is in the "notebook" format. The content differs in that it is not an abstract treatise but is a history stating periods and dates. Not being able to fit it into an idea of the ''corpus'' based on Bekker, many rejected it. The date being quite ancient, the majority view is to accept it as of Alexandrian provenience, the only instance of an Aristotelicum from the library and school there.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;If Strabo's and Athenaeus' traditions are taken as purely true, the ''Constitution of the Athenians'' ought not to exist. Either it was not among the books that went to Skepsis (not being in Bekker) or it was destroyed by the first great fire among the books at Alexandria. The typical compromise solution is expressed by Sandys as follows: {{cite book | author=Aristotle | editor-first=John Edwin | editor-last=Sandys | editor-link=John Sandys (classicist) | title=Aristotle's Constitution of Athens: a revised text with an introduction, critical and explanatory notes, testimonia and indices | edition=Second | location=London | publisher=MacMillan and Co. | year=1912 | page=xxv | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVEzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg | quote=But, to shew that the fate of Aristotle’s writings did not entirely depend on the fortunes of the library buried in the vault at Scépsis, we have abundant proof of some of them being familiar to the philosophic world during the interval in which his library itself was lost to view; and it is probable that many of them, including those of more general interest, were at an early date transcribed at Athens and thence transmitted to the great library at Alexandria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the ''Constitution of the Athenians'' with the same credibility as the Bekkerian ''corpus'' lends a certain ambiguity to the meaning of ''corpus''. If it is to be only the works in Bekker, then such misleading phrases as "the original corpus" are possible, as though the works in Bekker are more authentic than any works out of it. Not even the works in Bekker are authentic beyond any doubt.

The next logical step is to attempt to modify the definition of the term so that it is not to be the Latin word ''corpus'' but some special use of it:
:"The Corpus Aristotelicum is the collection of Aristotle's works that have survived from antiquity through Medieval manuscript transmission. ... Reference to them is made according to Immanuel Bekker's nineteenth-century Royal Prussian Academy edition ... which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Aristotle | author2=Plato | editor=Catholic Way Publishing | title=Aristotle, Plato | chapter=Corpus Aristotelicum | series=The Philosophy Collection [97 Books] | year=2015 | location=London | publisher=Catholic Way Publishing Company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaP0CAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=corpus%20aristotelicum&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has such authority that it may not be used without meaning Bekker's collection, but it may be used to mean additional Aristotelica. It is often translated as "the works of Aristotle." In that English sense it ought to mean every work ever attributed to Aristotle as well as every fragment. George Grote had said 
:"Very different is the case when we attempt to frame an Aristotelian Canon, comprising all the works of Aristotle and none others. We find the problem far more complicated, and the matters of evidence at once more defective, more uncertain, and more contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grote|1880|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By "canon" Grote meant "the Berlin edition of Aristotle." He is totally innocent of any Aristotelian ''corpora''. Even if "canon" had survived instead of ''corpus'', such a meaning now would fail to distinguish Bekker. One translational solution is just to name Bekker, as in "Bekker pages." Such an elevation of Bekker as the authority raises the question of the source of this aura of conviction surrounding the name. It seems likely that it was inherent in the sources.

====The paper trail before Bekker====
Having determined to print all of Aristotle's authentic works, as far as could be ascertained, Bekker found himself looking back over a voluminous paper trail.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;For a view of the world of MSS such as was seen by Bekker, see {{cite web | title=aristotle original manuscripts | url=https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=aristotle+original+manuscripts&amp;chips=q:aristotle+original+manuscripts,online_chips:arabic,online_chips:al+farabi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8mpXk65fYAhWD8YMKHds0D5YQ4lYIKCgA&amp;biw=1000&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to use the texts found in 102 manuscripts (MSS), routinely identified by library name and access number. For use in the book, he gave each MS a letter code. These appear in the footnotes. The front material of the edition includes a list of MSS. His libraries are relatively few, including the [[Vatican Library]] at Rome, the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] at Venice, the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] (formerly the Royal Library of Paris), and the [[Austrian National Library]] at Vienna. Typically the Aristotelica are included in famous MSS publishing a number of works.&lt;ref&gt;See in the category list at the bottom of the page under Aristotelian manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker did not seek out all possible MSS. The number of MSS still extant remains unknown. Before the invention of the [[printing press]] ca. 1440 by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who combined [[moveable type]] with a [[screw press]], book reproduction was performed by copyists. It went on everywhere in institutions that could afford to undertake it.

In the 15th century copying slowed as the MSS were replaced by books. Due to cultural lag, some MSS production continued as late as the 17th century in the form of written books. For the most part the MSS were left where they were. Since Bekker, many previously unconsidered MSS have turned up. Their publication is ongoing.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Bekker's labor in having to peronally visit institutions to view MSS in person undoubtedly limited the number of MSS he could view. Today most of the larger MSS collectors, including the ones visited by Bekker, have adopted a system of digitizing MSS and making them available online, often as a free public service. For example, refer to {{cite web | title=Modern Language Translations of Byzantine Sources: Digitized Greek Manuscripts | url=http://library.princeton.edu/byzantine/manuscript-title-list?field_city_tid=All&amp;field_library_tid=All&amp;field_collection_tid=All&amp;field_number_tid=&amp;field_subject_theme_tid=2509&amp;field_subject_name_tid=2510&amp;field_script_tid=All&amp;field_century_ms__tid=All&amp;field_high_resolution_value=All | publisher=Princeton University Library | accessdate=20 December 2017}} Some knowledge of [[palaeography]] is required to read these.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on them, works considered spurious are now believed genuine, and vice versa. The jury is always out, so to speak.

The date of a copy is to be distinguished from the date of its recension. Most Aristotle MSS were copied during centuries 13-15 at various [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] in Europe. The sequence of text is the recension, which might be instanced by many copies at diverse locations. The recension is not just the text, but is all the idiosyncrasies, such as a specific set of errors (miscopies, misspellings or variant texts), associated with it. The similarities or differences make possible the reconstruction of a [[tree of descent]] by the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] defining families of MSS, each designated by a capital letter. A family also is a recension. Its first member is its original. Typically originals are not available now but their existence and date can be predicated from different types of historical and textual evidence.

Excluding anomalous archaeological finds, all the MSS copied most lately date to after 1000. Historical and internal clues point to originals in the last 3 centuries before 1000 and a provenience of the domain of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; that is, the Greek-speaking world as it was under the eastern Roman Empire. The [[crusaders]] broke the power of its capital city, [[Constantinople]], leaving it helpless before the [[saracen]]s, in this case the Turkish-language speakers from the plains of Central Asia, who became the [[Ottoman Turks]]. They soon colonized Anatolia, occupying the urban centers there and replacing the Greek-speakers, who escaped to Greece. As they were not much interested in copying Greek MSS, the task of transmitting them to posterity passed to Europe. (The Turkish people today have an abiding interest in antiquities). The Arabic-speaking saracens to the south after an initial zealous destruction of antiquities, including starting yet another fire in the library of Alexandria, seemed to be infused with the same magic of Aristotle and Alexander that had captured the Roman conquerors of Anatolia earlier. They began to translate Aristotle into Arabic, now the only source of some Aristotelica.

Hand-written MSS of Aristotle are missing from the 1st half of the 1st millennium. The ongoing sites of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and the [[Villa of the Papyri]] offer hope of the discovery of fragments outside the ''corpus'' tradition. Meanwhile, the [[commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries]], or explanations of the content of the ''corpus'', supply quotations and paraphrases filling in the gap. These ''lemmata'', or excerpts, are so close to the ''corpus'' that they can be assigned Bekker numbers, which is good evidence that ''corpus'' has been accepted as the work of Aristotle since the beginning of the Roman Empire. The ''corpus'' is universally attributed to a single recension, that of [[Andronicus of Rhodes]], dated to mid-1st-century BC, in the late Roman Republic. The diagnostic of Andronicus' work is the division of the text into treatises, the names of some of the treatises, and the order and grouping of the treatises. Any work that does not conform to that diagnostic is immediately suspected of being "spurious" or non-authentic; that is, not of the ''corpus'' and not of Aristotle (rightly or wrongly).

====Recension of Apellicon====
In the story by Strabo, after Neleus has removed the books to Skepsis — many thousands in broad daylight on a caravan of wagons and in a fleet of ships, without objection or notice of any officials at Athens or Skepsis — history knows no more of him, even though he must have had plans for the books. Evidently the plans did not materialize. To take the passage literally, he must have died shortly thereafter, as the relatives received disposition of the property willed to them (the books).

The books arrived at Skepsis and were stored in a large outbuilding at what must have been a country estate, as the space requirements would not have changed any since Athens. The few small rooms of an ordinary dwelling in town would not have been suitable. Perhaps the relatives were not so poor and uneducated as depicted. As one man could not possibly have moved an entire library by himself, Neleus must have had a retinue of servants.

Hearing that [[Eumenes II]], the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] king of [[Pergamon]], was hunting books, the Corascid family "hid their books underground in a kind of trench." The king must not even have suspected the presence of a huge underground cache at Skepsis, as kings have methods of investigation and confiscation not available to ordinary citizens. Apparently the king's system of "eyes and ears," so well developed under Alexander, failed totally, that an entire building full of books could have been received and buried without him being informed. Moreover, the event remained a family secret for the next 200 years.

Ordinary people do not keep property and family memory for so long, but the story is the story, and apart from the alternative by Athenaeus, is the only one available. Speculative answers are always possible.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;{{cite book | title=Aristotle: His Life and School | first=Carlo | last=Natali | location=Princeton | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2013 | page=150 | quote=It is much more probable, in my opinion, ... that the second collection of Aristotle's books (the ''corpus'') never left Athens, but was neglected by later peripatetics ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general view is that Neleus only brought, and his family only hid, a small part of a library that had already otherwise been sold.

For the next event in the creation of the ''corpus'' the historical clock must be advanced from the accession of [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]] as scholiarch (instead of Neleus) at 286 BC&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;D.L. states the dates in [[Olympiad]]s, in this case 123, which is 288-284 BC. The central date comes from R.D. Hicks, translator and editor of {{cite web | title=Loeb 184 | url=https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the confiscation of the first recension of the re-discovered ''corpus'' from the home of the deceased re-discoverer, {{nowrap|[[Apellicon of Teos]],&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;There are four sources on Apellicon: 1) Persons 1343 and 1363 containing fragments of [[Posidonius]], {{cite book | editor-first=Johannes | editor-last=Kirschner | title=Prosographia Attica | volume=1 | location=Berolini | publisher=Typis et Impensis Georgii Reimeri | language=Ancient Greek, Latin | year=1901 | pages=93, 95 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5npfAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source}} 2) {{cite web | title=Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, Chapter 5 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D390 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} 3) {{cite web | title=Plutarch, Sulla, Chapter 26 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0064%3Achapter%3D26 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} 4) {{cite web | title=Strabo, Geography, 13.1.54 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D54}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} by general [[Sulla]] on his return to Athens after his conquest of Anatolia in 84 BC. For that approximately 200 years, Strabo would have us believe, the scholars of the Lyceum were a simple folk, unable to understand, repeat, or reconstruct the work of Aristotle, nor could they add to any of the previous investigations without his guidance. Moreover, when they finally did obtain a glimpse into what they believed were the words of the master, the only scholarly activities of which they were capable were trying to puzzle out what they mean. Whatever this condition might have been, it certainly was not science. Considering the activities of some of the graduates, there has been some grounds for thinking the Lyceum was gone, and the property was being held by greedy charlatans utilizing the name of peripatetic as a mask. Athenaeus tells the story of "Athenion the Peripatetic philosopher" (a contemporary of Apellicon),
:"in order that we may come to a thorough understanding and appreciation of those men who profess to be philosophers, and that we may not be taken in by their ragged cloaks and unshaven chins."

The men to whom he refers did not wear ragged cloaks; they were among the richest in Athens, but they were so because they were charlatans, or, as would be said today, "crooks." The school and the society in which it had been placed were different now. The [[diadochi]] were gone, or nearly so, including the [[Attalids]]. The eastern Mediterranean was divided into provinces of the [[Roman Republic]], except that [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] was successfully contesting Roman rule in Anatolia. The citizenship laws at Athens had changed somewhat. Athenion's mother had been an Egyptian slave owned by his father, and yet based on his father's citizenship he was enrolled as a citizen and inherited his father's estate. [[Apellicon of Teos|Apellicon]] (not an Athenian name), an immigrant from [[Teos]] in Asia MInor, was enrolled as a citizen after his adoption into the family of Aristotle, son of Apolexis.

The fact that the family included two members named Aristotle leads to the suggestion that the adoptive family had connections to the Lyceum and that Apellicon learned of the books through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=T.Keith | last=Dix | chapter=Aristotle's 'Peripatetic' Library | editor-first=James | editor-last=Raven | title=Lost Libraries: The Destruction of Great Book Collections Since Antiquity | location=New York | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2004 | page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, references in the sources to Apellicon and Athenion as "peripatetics" may well be interpreted as meaning that they both went to the Lyceum, which would explain why they were later comrades-in-arms. The peripatetics never had a predictable philosophy. Both men were skilled orators, which was a specialty of the school at that time. Athenion went on to found a chain of schools for boys, on which account he is called a "sophist" (a teacher of conventional wisdom). Apellicon turned his love for books into something conceded to have been illegal for the times:
:"For at one time he was a philosopher, and collected all the treatises of the Peripatetics, and the whole library of Aristotle, and many others; for he was a very rich man; and he had also stolen a great many autograph decrees of the ancients out of the temple of the Mighty Mother, and whatever else there was ancient and taken care of in other cities; and being detected in these practices at Athens he would have been in great danger if he had not made his escape"

As there is no indication that the Apolexidis family were fabulously wealthy or that, being numerous, they had much to leave to their adopted son, Apellicon very likely made his money from the resale of rare documents he acquired for nothing except the cost of stealing them. These were the originals of the decrees, first written on paper and signed before they were carved in stone for public benefit. In describing the ideal library of "Lawrence," Athenaeus points out that even then historians were expected to verify their claims against public documents. In one source Apellicon himself had written a book on Aristotle. Initially he might have yielded to the temptation to walk away with the source rather than return it to display in the temple. Becoming rich through the sale of stolen documents he decided to redeem the old cache, which was said to have been hidden not far from his home town.

Examining the books, and finding that moths and mold had removed portions of the text, Apellicon created another recension, supplying the missing information himself. There is no indication of how much was missing or of what source Apellicon used, if any, or whether the supplied material was grammatical, orthographic, or epigraphic, or included philosophy as well. Subsequent editors judged his recension to have been full of errors, but no ancient source has said what sort of errors, or how they were judged to be errors. These editors made corrections, but the sources of information used for correction remain unknown. In short, the only thing known from ancient sources is that Apellicon made a recension that was later criticised for being erroneus. The contradiction of such a statement is that if they knew enough to correct Apellicon, why would the rediscovery of the books have added anything different to the obviously already known ''corpus''?&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;There is no credible answer not entirely speculative. Speculations are easily made, such as that some texts were known, or the errors were of an epigraphic character only. Proof awaits further discoveries. A popular speculation is that Apellicon as a book dealer was too ignorant to have attempted a recension; therefore, he did not. There is nothing in book dealers, however, that makes them per se ignorant.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage from Athenaeus also provides a rough time table for the recension of Apellicon. It was created toward the end of his years as a successful thief, presumably at his home in Athens. What happened to the damaged originals remains a total mystery. Perhaps they were repasted and sold. How many copies were made if any, and who got them, also is not known. Apellicon probably left town in such a hurry that the books remained in Athens under the care of friends or servants. There is no record that the city moved against his property. Thus in a short time when he returned under the protection of Athenion he took up residence in the same home housing the same library, which was found there by Sulla after Apellicon's death.

====Sulla's victory over the peripatetics====
In the pages of Athenaeus, evil men come to a bad end, and the peripatetics are not good men. These were shortly to be tested in the [[First Mithridatic War]] with disastrous results.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Their rise to power is detailed in {{cite web | title=Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, Book V, Chapter 28 (Ath.5.pos=385) - 53 (pos.=390) | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ath.+5.pos%3D385&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0003}} Their fall is described in {{cite web | title=Plutarch, Sulla, Chapters 12-26 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Sull.+12&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0064L}}. Complementary detail is given in Plutarch's ''Lucullus''. Another valuable source differs in some major detail from Plutarch: {{cite web | title=Appian, Mithridatic Wars, Chapters 3-6 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0230%3Atext%3DMith.%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D20 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library}} Plutarch is generally preferred, because he claims to have had access to Sulla's ''Memoirs'' (now missing). Appian, however, fills in some gaps in Plutarch, even though sometimes variant.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bithynia and Pontus]] were independent kingdoms descending from Persian satrapies on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]] never taken by Alexander. The descendants of the [[satrap]]s remained as the Nicomedid and Mithridatid dynasties respectively.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Use of the -id suffix to designate a dynasty is an English-language fantasy. In Homer it is the predominant patronymic, but only there. Ancient Greek had many methods of designating patronymic. Today's uses are generally not Greek and not substantiated, but the terms are useful as formed nouns; for example, Mithridatids is all the kings in a descent named Mithridates. Not enough cultural data survives to know what they really used, if anything, possibly nothing to do with Mithridates. The numbers after the kings similarly are English ideas, while the knicknames were assigned as convenient identifiers by historians. For example, Ptolemy I Soter did not know he was to be either I or Soter.&lt;/ref&gt; Walking a fine diplomatic balance they managed to coexist with the reigning diadochi (Attalids, Seleucids, etc.), but they made war on each other. When the diadochi were replaced by Roman provincial governors,  [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] attacked [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]], claiming tort at the hands of Nicomedes supported by Rome, and further developing an Anatolian alliance defeated all the Roman commanders, massacring as well the helpless Roman citizens. Rome could not ignore these events.

=====Revolution at Athens=====
The rise of Mithridates offered some hope of independence to the cities of Greece. The Athenian people made Athenion the ambassador to Mithridates on the basis of his skill at oratory and experience of the east. Mithridates had other ideas. Winning the ambassador by banquets and promises he sent him back to Athens, where he set up headquarters in front of the [[Stoa of Attalus]]. The Roman officers were accustomed to address the people at that location. After a running harangue, voting to declare independence, the Athenians elected Athenion as commander-in-chief of their armed forces. The historians refer to him as a [[tyrant]].

The wealthy made it clear that the vote had not been theirs by attempting to escape the city. Posting a guard on the gates and dispatching cavalry to hunt the escapees Athenion held a sequence of drum-head trials for treason of which the result was always the same: death and confiscation of property. Athenaeus' account of other peripatetic tyrants at this time makes it clear that the issue was ideologic, the redistribution of wealth. Athenaeus, however, portrays it as thievery due to greed. He says that Athenion "collected such a quantity of money as to fill several wells." Furthermore, he was lavish in his expenditures. Whether the motives were ideologic or personal is a difficult question to answer either then or now, but Athenion went to extremes. He took to torture to extort money. A curfew was set. The economy declined from want. Rationing was instituted.

Athenion replaced all the magistrates with his own men. Choosing this moment to return to Athens, Apellicon was welcomed as an old comrade. Athenion sent him to [[Delos]] in command of a force with instructions to recapture the Athenian national treasury there and bring the money to Athens. It is peculiar that the force he was given is more of a mob than a detachment of soldiers, and that Apellicon evidences total ignorance of military matters. Landing on the shore at night they encamp without a palisade, fail to set a proper watch, and proceed to drink into the small hours. The commander of the Roman guard, [[Orobius]], leads his soldiers into the camp, slaughters 600 men, takes another 400 captive, and hunts the escapees through the countryside, burning them up in their hiding places. Better at running than fighting, Apellicon manages to escape to Athens, where he disappears from politics, at least in the sources, until the brief notice of his death, apparently not of interest to Sulla until then.

On either side, victory depended on intervention. The Pontians moved first. Accompanying his fleet commander, [[Archelaus (general)|Archelaus]], as admiral Mithridates sails to [[Rhodes]] with his entire fleet. Lucius Cassius, [[Proconsul]] of Asia, had escaped to the fortified harbor in the city of the same name there with whatever refugees he could locate. All the Italians had been struck on a day pre-arranged by Mithridates. Their property was seized by [[Asset forfeiture|forfeit]] under pretext of being for the public good, a motive that Appian, like Athenaeus, tears to shreds. The friends of Mithridates revelled in riches. Their cause was amply funded. Commanding from a state [[quinquereme]], Mithridates throws all his naval resources at Rhodes. Failing to take the place, he retreats to his headquarters at [[Pergamon]], instructing Archelaus to complete the conquest of the [[Cyclades]]. Archelaus overwhelms Delos, sending the treasury back to Athens with one Aristion under guard of 2000 men. He then anchors at [[Piraeus]], fortifies [[Munichia]], and uses the place as a headquarters, sending out forays to subdue new islands and new coastal cities. During this time Aristion is tyrant of Athens, and no more is heard of Athenion.

The sources on these two men are again contradictory. They are both tyrants of Athens. Athenaeus uses "Athenion," as did his source, [[Posidonius]], without mention of "Aristion." Pausanias, Appian, and Plutarch refer to "Aristion" without mentioning "Athenion." The main difference is that Athenion is a peripatetic, while Aristion is an [[Epicureanism|epicurean]]. The scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], proposed without further evidence that they were the same man, that, enrolling as a citizen, Athenion changed his name to Aristion (there was one other instance of the practice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |  last=Cotton | first=George Edward Lynch | year=1870 | title=Aristion | editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume=Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference continued to be troubling, as the two philosophies were at upposite poles: the Epicureans were [[Atomism|atomists]] following [[Democritus]], while the peripatetics were [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphs]], following [[Plato]]. The sources would have known the difference, even just to be men of letters.

In 1935 fragments of a monument were excavated from the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]], which when joined formed part of a decree (I 2351) establishing a new government at Athens. According to Woodhead,

:”... officials have been chosen by lot or direct election, and a Constitution is being ratified by the ''demos''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=A. Geoffrey | last=Woodhead | title=Inscriptions: the Decrees | series=The Athenian Agora | volume=Volume XVI | year=1997 | location=Princetom | publisher=American School of Classical Studies at Athens | pages=467–469}}. The inscription can be found online at {{cite web | title=Agora XVI 333 |url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/233282?&amp;bookid=395&amp;location=1365 | publisher=The Packard Humanities Institute | website=Searchable Greek Inscriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first analysis dated the Constitution to 84/83 BC, the time of Sulla’s visit after reaching an agreement with Mithridates. On subsequent revision of the text J.H. Oliver noticed that two of the provisions were so close to recommendations in Aristotle’s ''Politics'' that Bekker numbers could be {{nowrap|assigned.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Aristotle 1320b lines 11-14 recommends the combination of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] for the most balanced form of government, to be implemented by two types of magistrates, those chosen by lot (democratic) and those chosen by vote (oligarchic). I 2351 Line 9 places the government in the hands of those chosen by “[[sortition|lot]]” (''kleros'') and by “election” (''cheirotonia'', “show of hands,” not the Christian “laying on of hands”). Aristotle 1294a lines 41-42 recommends the “common or middle term” between democracy and oligarchy. I 2351 Line 14 is establishing the ''koine kai mese politeia'', direct quote.&lt;/ref&gt;}} As a peripatetic constitution would not be being restored in 84 BC after the final overthrow of the peripatetics. Oliver redates it to 87/86 BC suggesting that the author was a peripatetic; that is, Athenion with his friends. Furthermore, I 2351 is strong evidence that the recension of Apellicon was in fact close to the ''corpus Aristotelicum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Borja | last=Antela-Bernardez | title=Between Medeios and Mithridates: The Peripatetic Constitution Of Athens (Agora I 2351) | journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik | year=210 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277952468_BETWEEN_MEDEIOS_A_N_D_MITHRIDATES_THE_PERIPATETIC_CONSTITUTION_OF_ATHENS_AGORA_I_2351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antela-Bernardez suggests that after the Delian debacle Mithridates sacked all the peripatetics and elevated his own man, Aristion, to tyrant.

=====Civil war at Rome=====
On the Roman side, the [[Asiatic Vespers]] (the massacre)  resulted in an immediate declaration of war.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;They were perhaps less ethnic than military: the [[Marian Reforms]] of 107 BC had opened the army to propertyless men and provided that at the end of a successful career veterans receive free land, notably in foreign countries. Communities of veterans were becoming an indispensable adjunct to Roman bases.&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were due for the year 88 BC, which began January first. [[Sulla]] and [[Quintus Pompeius Rufus (consul 88 BC)|Rufus]] (“red”) stood for [[consul]]es and won (see [[List of Roman consuls]]). Rufus’ son, an officer under Sulla, had asked for Cornelia’s (Sulla’s eldest daughter’s) hand in marriage and won, a marriage which ended tragically. Sulla himself made a marriage with the daughter of the Chief Priest (Pontfex Maximus). The two consules cast lots for the major obligations, as required by law. Sulla won prosecution of the Mithridatic War.

These electoral victories represent a break-away from the political machine of which [[Gaius Marius]] was boss. He headed the [[Populares]] party; Sulla and Rufus were of the [[Optimates]]. Marius had nevertheless until now sponsored the career of Sulla. Born to the aristocratic [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], Sulla was said to have had a way with women. His step-mother left him her fortune. He married into more wealth. His personal name, Sulla, was actually a food dish of white cheese sprinkled over a red sauce (pizza?) giving the same appearance as his face. He had joined a troupe of comedians who sang and danced making a mockery of famous people, leaving that to enter government service under Marius’ sponsorship. His taking for himself a position Marius had hoped to control was an unforgivable betrayal.

The animosity between them had begun previously when the ambitious Sulla ran for [[Praetor]], lost, ran again, bought some votes and won, to be ridiculed for it by Julius Caesar. Sent to Asia without troops he brought about peace using the troops of his allies there. On his return the Populares impeached him for extorting an ally but the case was dropped. At the outbreak of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]] both parties put their differences aside until victory was achieved and the Italians were restored to Roman rule.  Sulla, leading troops recruited at Rome itself, had acquired “the name of a great commander,” but the aging Marius accomplished nothing of note.

Wasting no time, Marius subverted one of the [[Tribune|Tribuni plebis]], “Tribunes of the People,”  [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus]],  a feared politician with a private army of 3000 men, to pass an ordinance giving conduct of the war to Marius. Sulpicius had changed allegiance from the ''optimates'' to the ''populares'' to qualify for the magistracy. As blandishment, Marius promised the relief of Sulpicius’ ruinous debt.  Declaring a preventative cessation of business,  the two consuls were attacked by Sulpicius’ men in assembly. Rufus escaped somehow. His son was killed. Marius offered shelter to Sulla for old time’s sake and in exchange for withdrawal of the cessation.

The tribunes sent to take command of the army at [[Nola]] (near Naples) were stoned to death by it. Sulla had gotten there first. Marius began to murder Sulla’s partisans and confiscate their property. Sulla marched on Rome with six legions. He was met by emissaries from the Senate, who would, they assured him, make things right. Sulla agreed but lied, following the emissaries back to Rome to capture the gate. Halted there by a mob, he set fire to Rome.&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Appian paints these violent partisan instances as episodes in the [[Roman civil wars]], defining civil war in the ''Foreward'' of his work of the same name as a sanguinary conflict between factions of the same people, each claiming jurisdiction under the authority of the same government. In their attempt to find a Constitution that would satisfy both the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] and the [[Plebs|Plebeians]] the Romans had created two categories of senior magistrates: the [[Consul]]s and [[Praetors]], and the [[Tribune]]s. With competing duties and of parallel authorities they were expected to cooperate, yielding when superseded. The cooperation vanished in the period of the civil wars. In its place was the ''phonos'', the "slaughter." [[Pliny the Elder]] appears to have supported these historical ideas by terming Sulla's activities the ''bellum civile Sullanum'', "Sullan Civil War." (''Natural History 38.46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marius fled for his life. Sulla passed a death sentence in absentia (later rescinded). Sulpicius was executed. The elections for 87 were upon them. Rufus had been killed in a mutiny. Knowing he could not win, Sulla did not run. He did control who did win, making it possible for them to perform their duties or preventing them. His choices were [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)]], an optimate (although he disliked Sulla) and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], a popular. The price for Sulla’s support was that they swear a personal oath to leave Sulla in his command, now as [[Proconsul]]. Cinna broke it immediately, suborning a low-level tribune to trump up an accusation (not known what) on the basis of which he began impeachment proceedings against Sulla.

=====The paradox of the ships=====
Over a year had passed since the hapless Romans in Asia had sent urgent appeals for assistance. Mithridates had established sovereignty over nearly all of Greece. The Roman government seemed paralyzed by incidents of partisan contention. Meanwhile, Bruttius Sura, a [[Legatus|Legate]] of one Gaius Sentius, Praetor of Macedonia, was conducting small-unit operations quasi-autonomously against the Pontians in [[Boeotia]] with minimal success. Boeotia though anti-Pontian was being compelled to submit. In the autumn of 88 BC Sulla's [[Quaestor]] (chief supply officer), one [[Lucullus]] (undoubtedly the same as Lucius Licinius Lucullus, written about by Plutarch), arrived to order Sura back to Macedonia and to make supply arrangements with Boeotia and the states of central Greece. In the spring of 87, Sulla abandoned the suite of impeachment and the Civil War to strike suddenly across the Adriatic into central Greece with 5 [[Roman legion|legions]] and some cavalry, in very round numbers, about 30,000 men, mainly veterans of the Social War, many no doubt from his prior command.

Implied by the sudden strike story is the paradox of the ships. During the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87-86 BC)|siege of Athens]], lacking ships to conduct an amphibious assault on Piraeus, Sulla sends Lucullus to Egypt by night in disguised vessels to beg ships from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]]. Denied and redirected to [[Cyprus]], Lucullus avoids an ambush there and collects a motley fleet from the islands. Meanwhile, Sulla has no ships, it is said. When history last saw Sulla’s five legions they had been sent back to the camp at Nola. Either Sulla acquired ships there and sailed around the south of Italy or they marched overland to [[Brindisi]], the preferred port of embarcation for voyages to Greece. The sources give no clue.

The troops next appear at Athens without ships. How did they cross the [[Adriatic Sea]]? Mommsen says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Theodor | last=Mommsen | author-link=Theodor Mommsen | editor-first=Arthur C. | editor-last=Howland | title=Rome From Earliest Times to 44 B.C. | volume=Volume III | year=1906 | publisher=John D. Morris &amp; Company | series=The History of Nations | page=217 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzosAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:”...in the spring of 87 B.C. he landed in Epirus—but with only thirty thousand men: he was without a single ship and his treasury was empty.”

He could not have landed in [[Epirus]] without a single ship except by extraordinary means not explained by Mommsen. Similarly, the contemporaneous Long says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=George | last=Long | author-link=George Long (scholar)  | title=The Decline of the Roman Republic  | volume=Volume 2 | publisher=Bell and Daldy | year= 1866 | page=281 | location=London | url= https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA281&amp;lpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:”Sulla left Italy in b.c. 87 with five legions and some auxiliary cohorts and cavalry. He would sail from Brundisium and land somewhere on the opposite coast of the continent. It was a long and difficult march to Athens.”

The ships have appeared in this scenario (one cannot sail without them) but the march is unnecessarily laborious. There is no need to disembark at all: one enters the [[Gulf of Corinth]], which is 81 miles long, and no more than a few days later arrives off the shores of Attica and Boeotia. If the ships are allowed, there is no necessity to have any “landing” or any “march” at all.

The current solution implied or expressed by the scholars is that by “ships” the sources mean warships capable of defeating Archelaus’ warships, which would otherwise ram and sink any troop transports. Sulla’s quaestorial organization would have acquired sufficient transports  for the crossing in Italy. They did not sail to Athens with them as the seas were ruled by Archelaus. The only other route is through the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. It requires that either the ships be dragged across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] on an overland route through enemy territory or be left behind in the Gulf.

What the army did do depended on the disposition of the states on the east side of the Gulf and the moot question of supply. Mommsen and Long (and many others) speculate that the troops arrived in Epirus with empty larders, so to speak. On the contrary, as the master of Rome, Sulla would have had no trouble commandeering whatever initial supplies and ships he needed. His was not a poverty-stricken army. Armies on the move, however, require supply lines, which is what the Civil War would deny Sulla. As soon as he had departed his enemies assumed power, and they had no intention of supplying his army. He was on his own.

Appian gives the most detail:&lt;ref&gt;''Mithridatic Wars'', 5.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
:”Sulla ...  now for the first time passed over to Greece with five legions and a few cohorts and troops of horse and straightway called for money, reënforcements and provisions from Ætolia and Thessaly.”

There is no mention of any land campaign. [[Aetolia]] was on the north shore of the Gulf. [[Thessaly]] was far to the north on the east coast of central Greece. This distance is the basis for Mommsen’s land campaign, as though Thessaly required one. Thessaly, however, was still pro-Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'', 11.3.&lt;/ref&gt; One does not devastate the country of an ally to acquire supplies. Apparently, Sulla  landed in Aetolia to receive the assistance promised by both states to Lucullus the previous year.

=====The quaestor's road auction=====
Supplied and augmented by Aetolians Sulla’s force marched through the adjoining country of [[Boeotia]]. As a symbol of Roman presence it was immensely successful. Every city of Boeotia, including the recalcitrant [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], rallied to the Roman cause. His flank now covered, Sulla entered [[Megaris]], which had thrown in its lot with Boeotia. It was an important land link between Attica and the Gulf of Corinth. It had a fortified port, [[Aigosthena]], on the [[Alkyonides Gulf]]. Arriving in the vicinity of Athens, Sulla constructed a larger [[castra]] (base) at [[Eleusis]] to support siege operations, supply {{nowrap|operations,&lt;ref group="topic note"&gt;Roman accounting was more precise than was believed before the excavations at [[Vindolanda]] uncovered the [[Vindolanda tablets]], records written in [[Roman cursive]] on thin wooden leaves, including accounting records. The quaestorium was a well-organized warehouse.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and winter quarters for the men should that become necessary (it did).

After constructing their castra — a Roman legion was prepared to throw up one of those in a single late afternoon, although a permanent camp may have taken longer — the Romans moved to the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87–86 BC)|siege of Athens]] on the north side. If Sulla had faced the full weight of the Athenian army as it had been, he would perhaps simply have been cleared out of Attica. As it was, Aristion and his Mithridatic ally, Archelaus, were to demonstrate an astounding incompetence (the sources were astounded) against Roman veteran troops; nevertheless, they put up a strong resistance, Archelaus most of all.

The Athenians had created two fortified defensive communities: the city itself with the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the Marketplace (''[[agora]]''), and the port, [[Piraeus]], with a defensible elevation. The path between them was protected by two parallel “[[Long Walls]].” Thinking them unimportant, the defenders allowed these walls to be taken and demolished, thus splitting their forces in two. Archelaus defending Piraeus could be resupplied and reinforced by sea. Aristion in Athens itself could not. Sulla threw the entire weight of his attack against Aristion.

The defenders did have a defense strategy, plotted between Mithridates and Archelaus, who were in relatively rapid communication by swift vessel. Mithridates dispatched a strike force of 120,000 men under his son, [[Arcathias]] (or Ariathes). He took Macedonia and Thessaly but the force was delayed by the natural death of the son. Had he succeeded in reaching Attica in a timely manner Sulla would have been pinned between three forces. This remedy offers some explanation for Aristion’s strange behavior: he sang and danced on the walls of Athens, mocking Sulla by recalling his early career as an entertainer. One source proposes that he was just a fool who liked to entertain the men of his command. Another informs us that he was trying to anger Sulla to keep him on the attack, which also would be a strange thing to do if he did not expect a relieving force. He succeeded all too well, but the timing went wrong.

Sulla sent for some siege engines from Thebes. It was at this time that he crossed paths unkowingly with Aristotle and also made the originally honest decisions that would lead to the plundering of Greek ''objects d’art''. A mere agreement with the allies to provide supplies in kind was grossly insufficient. Cash was needed to pay the men and to buy the goods and services needed for the siege, such as thousands of working mules, drivers and wagons. Just after he was assigned the Mithridatic War, the Senate voted to:&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Mithridatic War'', 4.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

:”sell the treasures that King [[Numa Pompilius]] had set apart for his sacrifices to the gods.”

That money was gone and Sulla was cut off from Rome, but there were plenty of temples in Greece, each of which served as a repository of wealth. He and Lucullus made the decision to tax these temples for their valuable objects. Letters of appropriation were sent forthwith, delivered by revenue agents in wagons and ships.

The sources concentrate on the three most famous temples:  the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]], the [[Asclepeion]] at [[Epidaurus]], and the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia]], which latter yielded “a vast fortune” according to [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;37.7.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not the only temples taxed; there is evidence that the tax might have been on all temples. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions the removal of the statue of Athena from a temple in [[Aliartos|Haliartus]], Boeotia.&lt;ref&gt;9.33.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Sulla was still arguing national security as a motive. After the war he compensated at least some of the temples by giving them confiscated farmland for a yearly income.

Sulla was primarily interested in currency. He could obtain it either by resale of the art objects or by melting them and issuing coin. We are told he founded a mint in the Peloponnesus and that he issued gold and silver coins of greater than standard weight for “purchasing the services of their soldiers with lavish sums.”&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'', chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  This money was subsequently called “Lucullian,” according to Plutarch.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucullus'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The coin discoveries from the region are consistent with this view, although not conclusive. A gold [[aureus]] and a silver [[denarius]] believed from the times are overweight and bear an image of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Sulla’s patron goddess, on one side with a double cornucopia and the letter Q for Quaestor on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marvin | last=Tameanko | title=Lucullus, a Second Best Hero Of The Roman Republic | journal=The Journal of Ancient Numismatics | volume=3 | number=1 | year=2009 | url= http://coinproject.com/jan/volume1/issue3/volume1-3-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minting was not the only disposition of the antiques; Sulla was aware of the high resale value of such objects. He took many objects not of precious metal, such as the antique shields of the Greeks who had stopped [[Brennus (3rd century BC)]] at Thermopylae. These must have been sold to the highest bidder.

=== Recensions of ''Physics'' in the ancient Greek ===
A [[recension]] is a selection of a specific text for publication. The manuscripts on a given work attributed to Aristotle offer textual variants. One recension makes a selection of one continuous text, but typically gives notes stating the alternative sections of text. Determining which text is to be presented as "original" is a detailed scholarly investigation. The recension is often known by its scholar's name.

=== Classical and medieval commentaries on the ''Physics'' ===
A [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] differs from a [[Note (typography)|note]] in being a distinct work analyzing the language and subsumed concepts of some other work classically notable. A note appears within the annotated work on the same page or in a separate list. Commentaries are typically arranged by lemmas, or quotes from the notable work, followed by an analysis of the author of the commentary.

The commentaries on every work of Aristotle are a vast and mainly unpublished topic. They extend continuously from the death of the philosopher, representing the entire history of Graeco-Roman philosophy. There are thousands of commentators and commentaries known wholly or more typically in fragments of manuscripts. The latter especially occupy the vaults of institutions formerly responsible for copying them, such as monasteries. The process of publishing them is slow and ongoing.

Below is a brief representative bibliography of published commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics'' available on or through the Internet. Like the topic itself, they are perforce multi-cultural, but English has been favored, as well as the original languages, ancient Greek and Latin.

{{About|the U.S ocean observatory on the Juan de Fuca plate|the Canadian observatory|NEPTUNE|}}

The [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation's]] (NSF) [[Ocean Observatories Initiative]] (OOI) [http://oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/regional-scale-nodes/ '''Regional Scale Nodes'''] (RSN) [[system|component]] is an [[electro-optic]]ally [[cabled observatory|cabled underwater observatory]] that directly connects to the global [[Internet]].  It is the largest [[shielded cable|cable-linked]] [[seafloor|seabed]] [[ocean observations|observatory]] in the [[Earth|world]], and also the first of its kind in the [[United States of America|United States]].

Located on the southern part of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], off the [[Pacific coast|coast]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], it is the first [[ocean]] observatory to span a [[tectonic plate]].

RSN utilizes several [[Electric power|high-power]], [[Bandwidth (computing)|high-bandwidth]] sub-sea terminals called primary nodes which are linked together by [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic cable]] and provide support to [[oceanography|oceanographic]] sensors at key [http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/V14_Science locations].

Upon completion of the network in 2014, RSN will cover a distance of over 900 [[kilometer]]s at depths of up to 3000 meters.  Implementation of the OOI Regional Scale Nodes is led by the [[University of Washington|University of Washington’s]] (UW) [http://www.ocean.washington.edu School of Oceanography], the [http://www.apl.washington.edu UW Applied Physics Laboratory], and [http://www.l-3mps.com/maripro/index.aspx L-3 MariPro].

Live RSN data from &gt;100 seafloor and [[water column]] instruments will be made available [[telepresence|live]] on the Internet.  This will allow both [[scientist]]s and the [[public|general public]] to study long-term changes in ocean systems over the next 25 years.

Construction of RSN will be completed in 2014.  Efforts are substantially aided by the crews of [http://www.ropos.com/ ROPOS (Remotely Operated Platform for Observation Sciences].  The [http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/VISIONS_14 83-day VISIONS ’14 expedition] aboard the 274-foot global-class [[RV Thomas G. Thompson (T-AGOR-23)|R/V ''Thomas G. Thompson'']] is responsible for the observatory's final implementation.

==Overview==

The Regional Scale Nodes (RSN) is a component of the National Science Foundation's (NSF’s) Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). The NSF’s OOI is managed and coordinated by the OOI Project Office at the [http://www.oceanleadership.org Consortium for Ocean Leadership] (COL) in [[Washington, D.C.]]  The UW, located in [[Seattle]], Washington, is the RSN Implementing Organization for the COL.

The [http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/Mission_and_Vision vision] behind RSN is to launch a new era of scientific discovery and understanding of the oceans.

The RSN consists of two [[infrastructure]]s: primary and secondary.  The primary infrastructure network, which was designed, qualified, manufactured, and installed in 2012 by [http://www.l-3mps.com/maripro/index.aspx L-3 Maripro], consists of a shore facility located in [[Pacific City, Oregon]]; two fiber-optic cable lines covering a distance of 800 kilometers, and seven primary science nodes.

The RSN system delivers 200 [[kilowatt]]s of power and [[gigabyte|240Gbit/s]] of [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] Internet data communications to the seven primary science nodes.  RSN is designed to last for 25 years and is capable of significant expansion to serve [[future]] science needs.

==History==
Prior to the emergence of underwater cabled observatories, oceanographers and other researchers studying the global ocean tended to rely on the use of research vessels and manned submersibles in order to collect data.  This was followed by a shift toward [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|Remote Operated Vehicles]] (ROV’s) and space-based research [[satellite]]s.  The limitation to these methods was that they were either not cost-effective, or data could only be collected for short durations.  While the importance of [[exploration|expedition-based]] exploration was recognized, a solution was needed.

In 1987, the concept of utilizing high-power, high-bandwidth underwater cabled observatories emerged as a long-term, cost-effective solution for conducting real-time monitoring of ocean systems.

In the early 1990s, the United States and [[Canada]] formed an agreement to develop a plate-scale submarine electro-optically cabled ocean observatory in the northeast Pacific Ocean.  This region is home to the smallest of Earth’s tectonic plates – the Juan de Fuca plate.  The small size and close coastal proximity of the Juan de Fuca plate presents a unique opportunity to observe the dynamic systems in submarine volcano regions.

The partnership between the U.S. and Canada developed into a plan to build a Canadian cabled array that would cover the upper 1/3 of the Juan de Fuca plate, and a U.S. system spanning the lower 2/3 of the plate (cite).  Together, this plate-scale observatory would be called [[NEPTUNE]] (Northeast Pacific Time Series Underwater Networked Experiments) and would provide continuous observations for 25 years.

By the mid-2000s, NEPTUNE Canada had received full funding and their cabled array was completed and online by 2009.  It was brought under the umbrella network of [[Ocean Networks Canada]] (ONC).  Meanwhile, NEPTUNE U.S. was renamed to Regional Scale Nodes and became a component of the OOI.  It is slated for completion in 2014.  Both NEPTUNE Canada and RSN will be integrated through the ONC’s digital infrastructure and the [[Cyberinfrastructure|OOI Cyberinfrastructure]] providing real-time access to anyone connected to the Internet.

 |quote  = "The goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins, utilizing widely accessible, interactive telepresence. It's a new world.  We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean, at will, communicating in real time...So what can we actually do tomorrow? We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography, which we will incorporate into oceanography, and through that convergence, we will transform oceanography into something even more magical."

==Scientific Motivation==
The scientific goals of RSN are significant.  A vast array of natural phenomena that occur throughout the [[sea|world's oceans]] and [[seafloor]] are found in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. As a whole, the mission of RSN is to provide a human [[telepresence]] in the ocean that will serve researchers, students, educators, policymakers, and the public.  Scientists will be able to conduct local investigations of such global processes as major [[physical oceanography|ocean currents]], active earthquake zones, [[plate tectonics|creation of new seafloor]], and rich [[aquatic ecosystems|environments of marine plants and animals]].

[[File:OOI Seafloor Science Themes.jpg|300px|thumb|right|OOI Seafloor processes. Image Credit: OOI Regional Scale Nodes program and the Center for Environmental Visualization, University of Washington]]

RSN is also designed to help anticipate both short and long-term ocean-generated threats and opportunities.  Notably, RSN will be able to monitor the [[Geology of the Pacific Northwest|tectonic activity along the plate boundary]].  There is hope that [[seismometer|seismic sensors]] could be installed at key areas along the [[divergent boundary|spreading center]] which would serve as an early warning system for [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s.

The existence of a long-term [[cabled observatory]] will allow for long-term measurements of [[biological oceanography|biological communities]].  In particular, the Juan de Fuca plate’s divergent plate boundary has resulted in the existence of seafloor [[hydrothermal vent]]s ecosystems, and other similar groups.  These [[deep sea communities]], thriving in extremely harsh environments, pose a number of unsolved scientific questions which RSN will be capable of investigating.

'''Primary Infrastructure'''

The primary infrastructure of RSN consists of seven primary nodes which were installed in 2012 by [http://www.l-3mps.com/maripro/index.aspx L-3 Maripro].  They are terminal points which help distribute power and bandwidth to the networks of deployed sensors.

Approximately 900 kilometers of cable (referred to as backbone cable) have been used to connect the primary nodes together.  These cables make landfall at the shore station in [[Pacific City|Pacific, City, Oregon]].

In 2005, over 175 scientists across the United States responded to a Request for Assistance from the National Science Foundation to develop a cabled observatory on the Juan de Fuca Plate.  Nodes are located at pre-selected experimental sites throughout the Juan de Fuca plate.  [[Axial Seamount]], [[Hydrate Ridge]] on the Cascadia Margin and shallow water sites west of [[Newport, Oregon]] (the Endurance Array) all have primary nodes installed.  The primary nodes are all located in environmentally benign areas.

Nodes also convert the 10kVdc [[volt]]age levels from the backbone cable to 375Vdc which is then directed to the secondary infrastructure. The 375V switching systems and Node telemetry systems were designed and manufactured by Texcel Technology Plc based in England. The software to manage the ports and telemetry protection systems was also supplied by Texcel as a element manager sitting under a Network Management System (NMS).

The primary nodes have a number of extra ports which offer the potential for large-scale future expansion (&gt;100 kilometers).



'''Secondary Infrastructure'''

The converted 375Vdc voltage from the primary nodes is then directed at low-and medium-power nodes and junction boxes.  The nodes and junction boxes (similar to power strips) offer direct power and communications to the instruments at the experimental sites.  In concert, these parts make up the RSN secondary infrastructure. 
Extension cables are used to link the primary nodes to the secondary infrastructure, providing power and communications.

Equipment is linked using wet-mate connectors.  Different types of cable were installed depending on load requirements.  Bandwidth from these cables ranges from 10 Gbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.

During the VISIONS ’13 expedition to continue construction of RSN, over 22,000 meters of extension cables were installed on the ocean floor.  The cables all successfully went online.



Upon completion in 2014, over 100 cabled seafloor and water column instruments will be operational.  These instruments will allow monitoring of biological, chemical, geological, and geophysical processes in the ocean.  The secondary infrastructure will also include six mooring systems for water-column profilers.  
	
Cables are frequently deployed all across the world in ocean basins and margins.  They have considerably long lifetimes.  The backbone cable was installed in the summer of 2011.  The commercial cable-laying ship, [http://www.subcom.com/process/install-and-test/fleet.aspx TE SubCom Dependable], carried out this phase of the project.

Special environmental requirements were also taken into account.  Certain cables are substantially well-armored, especially those deployed in volcanic areas, such as Axial Seamount.

==Instruments==

In order to fully understand complex ocean systems, a wide variety of sensor arrays, capable of surviving for long periods of time in harsh conditions, are necessary.  A suite of sensors (over 100) were selected and strategically placed throughout RSN.  They are located at Axial Seamount, Hydrate Ridge, and also on the water-column moorings.

Instruments connected to the RSN include:  
*  Conductivity Temperature Depth (located on profilers)
*  Dissolved Oxygen, 
*  3-D Single Point Current Meter 
*  Temperature
*  Fluorometers 
*  CDOM, 
*  Chlorophyll-a, 
*  Optical Backscatter

The instruments are the final spot of each regional network branch.

===Cyberinfrastructure===

[[File:Ci deployment topology for OOI.png|thumb|right|CI Deployment Topology. Graphic created by J.B. Matthews.]]

The Regional Scale Nodes is connected into the OOI Cyberinfrastructure.

The Cyberinfrastructure component of the OOI links marine infrastructure to scientists and users.  The OOI Cyberinfrastructure manages and integrates data from all the different OOI sensors.  It will provide a common operating infrastructure, the Integrated Observatory Network (ION), connecting and coordinating the operations of the marine components (global, regional, and coastal scale arrays). It will also provide resource management, observatory mission command and control, product production, data management and distribution (including strong data provenance), and centrally available collaboration tools.

The Integrated Observatory Network (ION) connects and coordinates the operations of the OOI marine components with the scientific and educational pursuits of oceanographic research communities.  The cyberinfrastructure is being designed and constructed by the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Status==

Construction of RSN is ongoing.  As of September 19, 2014, the primary infrastructure and most of the secondary infrastructure was successfully in place, and OOI RSN and UW APL crews were working to complete the vertical moorings for the shallow profiler.



==Outreach==
The University of Washington has welcomed student participation in the implementation of RSN.  As of 2014, there have been eight expeditions in which students have had the opportunity to work aboard the R/V Thomas G. Thompson and witness the construction of the cabled observatory.  During these cruises, students develop projects utilizing the array of technology and scientific equipment on board.

Students who participate in these expeditions go on to share their experiences with others.

In 2014, over 30 graduate and undergraduate students worked alongside the researchers, engineers, educators, and crew during the 83-day VISIONS ’14 expedition.

'''Robert M. Place''' (born 1947) is an American artist and author known for his work on [[tarot]] history, symbolism, and [[divination]].

==Work as an artist==
Place has worked since the 1970s as a sculptor, jeweler and illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;“Lapidary Journal," February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  His sculpture has been exhibited on the [[White House]] Christmas tree, in the [[New York State Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;“American Craft," April/May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“American Craft," June/July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Delaware Art Museum]], and the [[Irish American Heritage Museum]].  Place’s jewelry has been exhibited in the [[American Craft Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;“Ornament," 1992&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;“Kaatskill Life: A Regional Journal," Sommer 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Montclair Art Museum]], the [[Summit Art Center]],&lt;ref&gt;“American Craft," October/November 1985&lt;/ref&gt; the International Wilhelm Muller Competition (which toured museums in Germany),&lt;ref&gt;“Ornament," August 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Ornament," Spring 1989&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Birmingham Institute of Art and Design]], and in numerous galleries in the United States, Ireland, Britain, and Japan.  He was awarded a 1984-85 New Jersey State Council on the Arts Fellowship &lt;ref&gt;Bishop Gordon (1985) ''Gems of New Jersey'', Prentice Hall, Englewood Clifts, NJ {{ISBN|0-13-347436-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Niche Magazine]] award for outstanding achievement in metal sculpture in 1990&lt;ref&gt;“Niche," Spring 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;“Niche," Spring 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as tarot designer and author==
In the 1990s, Place turned his attention as an illustrator to the creation of tarot decks and began his career as an author. Place is best known as the creator of ''The [[Alchemical Tarot]]'', his first deck and book combination, which is illustrated in the style of 17th century alchemical engravings and presents a parallel between the “great work” of [[alchemy]], which leads to the creation of the [[philosopher’s stone]] and the allegory in the tarot’s trumps.&lt;ref&gt;"Gnosis: A Journal of Western Inner Traditions," Fall 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gnosis: A Journal of Western Inner Traditions," Summer 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In his other decks, ''The Angels Tarot, The Tarot of the Saints'', and ''The Buddha Tarot'', Place has explored the connection between religion, [[mysticism]], and the tarot’s symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/learn/interview_place.shtml Interview with Robert M. Place&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his fifth book, ''The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination'', his first book published not in connection with a tarot deck, Place contributes to the field of tarot history by discussing the images in the tarot in relation to the iconography of the 15th century [[Italian Renaissance]], the era when the tarot was created.  Place relates each image in the tarot to similar images created at that time and presents a theory of interpretation that is rooted in the art and philosophy of the time.  The book also discusses contrasting occult theories and champions [[Pamela Colman Smith]] as the primary designer of the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Waite-Smith Tarot]].&lt;ref&gt;Robles-Smith, Kimberley,"Library Journal," 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Patricia, "Booklist," March 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tarotpedia says that ''The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination'' “is bound to find a place amongst the most important works published this decade.”{{cite this quote|date=June 2018}}

"[[Booklist]]", the publication of the [[American Library Association]], says that ''The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination'' “may be the best book ever written on that deck of cards decorated with mysterious images called the tarot.”&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Place has been a frequent lecturer on and teacher of Western mysticism and the history and use of the tarot. Besides teaching regularly at the New York Open Center since 1996 and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 2009, he has taught at the World Tarot Congress, in Chicago and in Dallas; The Southeast Tarot Congress, in Florida; the [[New York Reader's Studio]]; The Third International Conference of the [[Association for Esoteric Studies]], in Charleston; The [[Omega Institute]], in New York; The [[New York Theosophical Society]]; Columbia University; The [[Museo Dei Tarocchi]], in Riola, Italy; The [[Tarot Guild of Australia]], Melbourne; Cartomancia, in Sao Paulo, Brazil; and he has given workshops in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and in 2017, in Beijing, China. His lectures have appeared on the [[BBC]], the [[Learning Channel]], [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]], and [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]].&lt;ref&gt;Place, Robert M., The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination New York, Tarcher/Penguin: 2005, p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2007, Place had the honor of cutting the ribbon at the grand opening of the Museo dei Tarocchi, in Riola, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museodeitarocchi.it/robert.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Place was also the curator of an exhibition on the art and history of the tarot, which was held at the Los Angeles [[Craft and Folk Art Museum]], from January 23, 2010, to May 9, 2010 and is the subject of his book, ''The Fool's Journey: the History, Art, &amp; Symbolism of the Tarot''. His facsimile of one of the earliest Italian Renaissance woodcut Tarots is included in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

[[File:Congruent non-congruent triangles.svg|thumb|370px|An example of the different definitions of '''shape'''.  The two triangles on the left are congruent, while the third is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to them.  The last triangle is neither similar nor congruent to any of the others, but it is homeomorphic.]]

A '''shape''' is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]], as opposed to other properties such as color, texture or material composition.

== Classification of simple shapes ==
{{Main|Lists of shapes}}
[[File:Polygon types.svg|thumb|right|300px|A variety of [[polygon]]al shapes.]]

Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, [[polygon]]s are classified according to their number of edges as [[triangle]]s, [[quadrilateral]]s, [[pentagon]]s, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be [[equilateral]], [[isosceles]], [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]], [[Triangle#By internal angles|acute]], [[Triangle|scalene]], etc. while quadrilaterals can be [[rectangle]]s, [[rhombi]], [[trapezoids]], [[squares]], etc.

Other common shapes are [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s, and [[conic sections]] such as [[ellipse]]s, [[circle]]s, and [[parabola]]s.

Among the most common 3-dimensional shapes are [[polyhedra]], which are shapes with flat faces; [[ellipsoid]]s, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects; [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s; and [[cone]]s.

If an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately, we can use it to describe the shape of the object. Thus, we say that the shape of a [[manhole cover]] is a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], because it is approximately the same geometric object as an actual geometric disk.

==Shape in geometry==

There are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects:

* [[Congruence (geometry)|Congruence]]: Two objects are '''congruent''' if one can be transformed  into the other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.
* [[Similarity (geometry)|Similarity]]: Two objects are '''similar''' if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.
* [[Homotopy#Isotopy|Isotopy]]: Two objects are '''isotopic''' if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put holes in it.

Sometimes, two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other. For instance, the letters "'''b'''" and "'''d'''" are a reflection of each other, and hence they are congruent and similar, but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape. Sometimes, only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape. For instance, an hollow sphere may be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere. [[Procrustes analysis]] is used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same shape, or to measure the difference between two shapes. In advanced mathematics, [[quasi-isometry]] can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes are approximately the same.

Simple shapes can often be classified into basic [[geometry|geometric]] objects such as a [[Point (geometry)|point]], a [[line (geometry)|line]], a [[curve]], a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], a [[plane figure]] (e.g. [[square (geometry)|square]] or [[circle]]), or a solid figure (e.g. [[cube]] or [[sphere]]). However, most shapes occurring in the physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and coastlines, may be so complicated as to defy traditional mathematical description&amp;nbsp;– in which case they may be analyzed by [[differential geometry]], or as [[fractal]]s.

=== Equivalence of shapes ===

In geometry, two subsets of a [[Euclidean space]] have the same shape if one can be transformed to the other by a combination of [[translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotation]]s (together also called [[rigid transformation]]s), and [[Scaling (geometry)|uniform scaling]]s. In other words, the ''shape'' of a set of points is all the geometrical information that is invariant to translations, rotations, and size changes. Having the same shape is an [[equivalence relation]], and accordingly a precise mathematical definition of the notion of shape can be given as being an [[equivalence class]] of subsets of a Euclidean space having the same shape.

Mathematician and statistician [[David George Kendall]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|
doi = 10.1112/blms/16.2.81|
author = Kendall, D.G.|
title = Shape Manifolds, Procrustean Metrics, and Complex Projective Spaces|
journal = Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society|
year = 1984|
volume = 16|
issue = 2|
pages = 81–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this paper ‘shape’ is used in the vulgar sense, and means what one would normally expect it to mean. [...] We here define ‘shape’ informally as  ‘all the geometrical information that remains when location, scale&lt;ref&gt;Here, scale means only [[uniform scaling]], as non-uniform scaling would change the shape of the object (e.g., it would turn a square into a rectangle).&lt;/ref&gt; and rotational effects are filtered out from an object.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shapes of physical objects are equal if the subsets of space these objects occupy satisfy the definition above. In particular, the shape does not depend on the size and placement in space of the object. For instance, a "'''&lt;small&gt;d&lt;/small&gt;'''" and a "'''&lt;big&gt;p&lt;/big&gt;'''" have the same shape, as they can be perfectly superimposed if the "'''&lt;small&gt;d&lt;/small&gt;'''" is translated to the right by a given distance, rotated upside down and magnified by a given factor (see [[Procrustes superimposition]] for details). However, a [[mirror image]] could be called a different shape. For instance, a "'''&lt;big&gt;b&lt;/big&gt;'''" and a "'''&lt;big&gt;p&lt;/big&gt;'''" have a different shape, at least when they are constrained to move within a two-dimensional space like the page on which they are written. Even though they have the same size, there's no way to perfectly superimpose them by translating and rotating them along the page. Similarly, within a three-dimensional space, a right hand and a left hand have a different shape, even if they are the mirror images of each other. Shapes may change if the object is scaled non-uniformly. For example, a [[sphere]] becomes an [[ellipsoid]] when scaled differently in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, preserving axes of [[symmetry]] (if they exist) is important for preserving shapes. Also, shape is determined by only the outer boundary of an object.

===Congruence and similarity===
{{Main|Congruence (geometry)|Similarity (geometry)}}
Objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations and mirroring (but not scaling) are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. An object is therefore congruent to its [[mirror image]] (even if it is not symmetric), but not to a scaled version. Two congruent objects always have either the same shape or mirror image shapes, and have the same size.

Objects that have the same shape or mirror image shapes are called [[Similarity (geometry)|geometrically similar]], whether or not they have the same size. Thus,  objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations, mirroring, and uniform scaling are similar.  Similarity is preserved when one of the objects is uniformly scaled, while congruence is not. Thus, congruent objects are always geometrically similar, but similar objects may not be congruent, as they may have different size.

=== Homeomorphism ===
{{Main|Homeomorphism}}
A more flexible definition of shape takes into consideration the fact that realistic shapes are often deformable, e.g. a person in different postures, a tree bending in the wind or a hand with different finger positions.

One way of modeling non-rigid movements is by [[homeomorphism]]s. Roughly speaking, a  homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of an object into a new shape. Thus, a [[square (geometry)|square]] and a [[circle]] are homeomorphic to each other, but a [[sphere]] and a [[torus|donut]] are not. An often-repeated [[mathematical joke]] is that topologists can't tell their coffee cup from their donut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach. Part II: Higher-Dimensional Systems|first1=John H.|last1=Hubbard|first2=Beverly H.|last2=West|publisher=Springer|series=Texts in Applied Mathematics|volume=18|year=1995|isbn=978-0-387-94377-0|page=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHBj2oaSALoC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22coffee+cup%22+topologist+joke#v=onepage&amp;q=%22coffee%20cup%22%20topologist%20joke&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.

== Shape analysis ==
{{main|Statistical shape analysis}}
The above-mentioned mathematical definitions of rigid and non-rigid shape have arisen in the field of [[statistical shape analysis]]. In particular, [[Procrustes analysis]] is a technique used for comparing shapes of similar objects (e.g. bones of different animals), or measuring the deformation of a deformable object. Other methods are designed to work with non-rigid (bendable) objects, e.g. for posture independent shape retrieval (see for example [[Spectral shape analysis]]).

==Similarity classes==
All [[similar triangles]] have the same shape. These shapes can be classified using [[complex number]]s ''u, v, w'' for the vertices, in a method advanced by J.A. Lester&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Lester (1996) "Triangles I: Shapes", ''[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]'' 52:30&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rafael Artzy]]. For example, an [[equilateral triangle]] can be expressed by the complex numbers 0, 1, (1 + i √3)/2 representing its vertices. Lester and Artzy call the ratio
:&lt;math&gt;S(u, v, w) = \frac{u - w}{u - v} &lt;/math&gt; 

the '''shape''' of triangle (''u, v, w''). Then the shape of the equilateral triangle is
:(0–(1+ √3)/2)/(0–1) = ( 1 + i √3)/2 = cos(60°) + i sin(60°) = exp( i π/3).
For any [[affine transformation]] of the [[complex plane]], &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto a z + b,\quad a \ne 0,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; a triangle is transformed but does not change its shape. Hence shape is an [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] of [[affine geometry]].
The shape ''p'' = S(''u,v,w'') depends on the order of the arguments of function S, but [[permutation]]s lead to related values.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;1 - p = 1 - (u-w)/(u-v) = (w-v)/(u-v) = (v-w)/(v-u) = S(v,u,w).&lt;/math&gt; Also &lt;math&gt;p^{-1} = S(u,w,v).&lt;/math&gt;
Combining these permutations gives &lt;math&gt;S(v,w,u) = (1 - p)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; Furthermore,
:&lt;math&gt;p(1-p)^{-1} = S(u,v,w)S(v,w,u)=(u-w)/(v-w)=S(w,v,u). &lt;/math&gt; These relations are "conversion rules" for shape of a triangle.
The shape of a [[quadrilateral]] is associated with two complex numbers ''p,q''. If the quadrilateral has vertices ''u,v,w,x'', then ''p'' = S(''u,v,w'') and ''q'' = S(''v,w,x''). Artzy proves these propositions about quadrilateral shapes:
#If &lt;math&gt; p=(1-q)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;  then the quadrilateral is a [[parallelogram]].
#If a parallelogram has | arg ''p'' | = | arg ''q'' |, then it is a [[rhombus]].
#When ''p'' = 1 + i and ''q'' = (1 + i)/2, then the quadrilateral is [[square]].
#If &lt;math&gt;p = r(1-q^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;  and sgn ''r'' = sgn(Im ''p''), then the quadrilateral is a [[trapezoid]].
A [[polygon]] &lt;math&gt; (z_1, z_2,...z_n)&lt;/math&gt;  has a shape defined by ''n'' – 2 complex numbers &lt;math&gt;S(z_j,z_{j+1},z_{j+2}), \  j=1,...,n-2.&lt;/math&gt;  The polygon bounds a [[convex set]] when all these shape components have imaginary components of the same sign.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Artzy]] (1994) "Shapes of Polygons", ''Journal of Geometry'' 50(1–2):11&amp;ndash;15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human perception of shapes ==

Psychologists have theorized that humans mentally break down images into simple geometric shapes called [[geon (psychology)|geons]].&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D., &amp; Nishihara, H. (1978). Representation and recognition of the spatial organization of three-dimensional shapes. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 200, 269-294.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of geons include cones and spheres. A wide range of other shape representations have also been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cviu.2013.04.005|title=50 Years of object recognition: Directions forward|journal=Computer Vision and Image Understanding|volume=117|issue=8|pages=827–891|year=2013|last1=Andreopoulos|first1=Alexander|last2=Tsotsos|first2=John K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There also seems to be something about shape that can guide human [[visual spatial attention|attention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=R.

A '''Space Shuttle external tank''' ('''ET''') was the component of the [[Space Shuttle]] [[launch vehicle]] that contained the [[liquid hydrogen]] [[Rocket propellant|fuel]] and [[liquid oxygen]] [[oxidizer]].  During lift-off and ascent it supplied the fuel and oxidizer under pressure to the three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSME) in the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. The ET was jettisoned just over 10 seconds after MECO (Main Engine Cut Off), where the SSMEs were shut down, and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Boosters]], external tanks were not re-used.  They broke up before impact in the [[Indian Ocean]] (or [[Pacific Ocean]] in the case of direct-insertion launch trajectories), away from [[shipping lane]]s and were not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|image2=STS-3 launch.jpg|caption1=The External Tank was painted white for the first two Space Shuttle launches.|caption2=From [[STS-3]] on, it was left unpainted.}}
The ET was the largest element of the space shuttle, and when loaded, it was also the heaviest. It consisted of three major components:
*the forward liquid [[oxygen]] (LOX) tank
*an unpressurized intertank that contains most of the electrical components
*the aft liquid [[hydrogen]] (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tank; this was the largest part, but it was relatively light, due to liquid hydrogen's very low density.

The ET was the "backbone" of the shuttle during launch, providing structural support for attachment with the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs) and orbiter. The tank was connected to each SRB at one forward attachment point (using a crossbeam through the intertank) and one aft bracket, and it was connected to the orbiter at one forward attachment bipod and two aft bipods. In the aft attachment area, there were also [[Umbilical cable|umbilicals]] that carried [[fluid]]s, [[gas]]es, [[electric]]al signals and electrical power between the tank and the orbiter. Electrical signals and controls between the orbiter and the two solid rocket boosters were also routed through those umbilicals.

Although the external tanks were always discarded, it could have been possible to re-use them in orbit.&lt;ref name=etuse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/stsation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407010201/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/stsation.htm |archivedate=2015-04-07 |df= }} astronautix.com (NASA Report, ''Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system''  https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for re-use ranged from incorporation into a space station as extra living or research space, as rocket fuel tanks for interplanetary missions (e.g. Mars), to raw materials for orbiting factories.&lt;ref name=etuse/&gt;

Another concept was to use the ET as a cargo carrier for bulky payloads.&lt;ref name=vlst/&gt; One proposal was for the primary mirror of a 7-meter aperture telescope to be carried with the tank.&lt;ref name=vlst&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept was the Aft Cargo Carrier (ACC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/shuttle-with-aft-cargo-carrier-1982/ D. Portree - Space Shuttle with Aft Cargo Carrier - Beyond Apollo (wired.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Over the years, NASA worked to reduce the weight of the ET to increase overall efficiency. For each pound of weight reduction, the cargo-carrying capability of the shuttle spacecraft was increased almost one pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/et.html|title=External Tank|publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov|date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Weight Tank===
The original ET is informally known as the Standard Weight Tank (SWT) and was fabricated from 2219, a high-strength aluminum–copper alloy used for many aerospace applications. The first two, used for [[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]], were painted white to protect the tanks from ultraviolet light during the extended time that the shuttle spends on the launch pad prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia's White External Fuel Tanks|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/060412_sts1_whitetank.html|publisher=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this did not turn out to be a problem, Lockheed Martin (at that time, Martin Marietta) reduced weight by leaving the rust-colored spray-on insulation unpainted beginning with [[STS-3]], saving approximately {{convert|272|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="et_paint"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration [http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/1999/99-193.html "NASA Takes Delivery of 100th Space Shuttle External Tank."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311004932/http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/1999/99-193.html |date=2007-03-11 }} Press Release 99-193. 16 Aug 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[STS-4]], several hundred pounds were eliminated by deleting the anti-geyser line. This line paralleled the oxygen feed line, providing a circulation path for liquid oxygen. This reduces accumulation of [[gas]]eous oxygen in the feed line during prelaunch tanking (loading of the LOX). After [[propellant]] loading data from ground tests and the first few space shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions. The total length and diameter of the ET remain unchanged. The last SWT, flown on [[STS-7]], weighed approximately {{convert|35000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} inert.

===Lightweight Tank===
[[Image:Externaltank.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Space Shuttle]] External Tank (ET) on its way to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]].]]
Beginning with the [[STS-6]] mission, a lightweight ET (LWT), was introduced. This tank was used for the majority of the Shuttle flights, and was last used on the ill-fated [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] ([[STS-107]]). Although tanks vary slightly in weight, each weighed approximately {{convert|30000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} inert.

The weight reduction from the SWT was accomplished by eliminating portions of stringers (structural stiffeners running the length of the hydrogen tank), using fewer stiffener rings and by modifying major frames in the hydrogen tank. Also, significant portions of the tank were [[milling machine|mill]]ed differently so as to reduce thickness, and the weight of the ET's aft [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] attachments was reduced by using a stronger, yet lighter and less expensive [[titanium]] alloy.

===Super Lightweight Tank===
The Super Lightweight Tank (SLWT) was first flown in 1998 on [[STS-91]] and was used for all subsequent missions with two exceptions ([[STS-99]] and [[STS-107]]).&lt;ref name=LMFS07&gt;http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/12742.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "FACT SHEET
SPACE SHUTTLE EXTERNAL TANK" April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The SLWT had basically the same design as the LWT except that it used an [[aluminium-lithium alloy]] ([[2195 aluminium alloy|Al 2195]]) for a large part of the tank structure. This alloy provided a significant reduction in tank weight (~3,175&amp;nbsp;kg/7,000&amp;nbsp;lb) over the LWT.  Manufacture also included [[Friction stir welding#Aerospace|friction stir welding]] technology.  Although all ETs produced after the introduction of the SLWT were of this configuration, one LWT remained in inventory to be used if requested until the end of the shuttle era. The SLWT provided 50% of the performance increase required for the shuttle to reach the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="by the numbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ssc/michoud/ExternalTank/ByNumbers.html|title=External Fuel Tank by the Numbers|publisher=Lockheed Martin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080103111431/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ssc/michoud/ExternalTank/ByNumbers.html|archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in weight allowed the Orbiter to carry more payload to the [[International Space Station#Orbit|highly inclined orbit of the ISS]].

==Contractor==
The contractor for the external tank was [[Lockheed Martin]] (previously [[Martin Marietta]]), New Orleans, Louisiana. The tank was manufactured at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]], [[New Orleans]], and was transported to [[Kennedy Space Center]] by [[barge]].

==Components==
The ET has three primary structures:  an LOX tank, an intertank, and an LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank.  Both tanks are constructed of aluminium alloy skins with support or stability frames as required. The intertank aluminium structure utilizes skin stringers with stabilizing frames.  The primary aluminium materials used for all three structures are 2195 and 2090 alloys.  [[2195 aluminium alloy|AL 2195]] is an Al-Li alloy designed by Lockheed Martin and Reynolds for storage of cryogenics (and used for the SLW version of the ET - earlier versions used Al 2219&lt;ref name=Nasa-SLW&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/113020main_shuttle_lightweight.pdf Super Lightweight External Tank], NASA, retrieved 12 Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).  [[Al 2090]] is a commercially available Al-Li alloy.
[[Image:Sts et cutaway.jpg|thumb|300px|Anatomy of the External Tank.]]

===Liquid oxygen tank===
The LOX tank is located at the top of the ET and has an [[ogive]] shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and aerothermodynamic heating. The ogive nose section is capped by a flat removable cover plate and a [[nose cone]].  The nose cone consists of a removable conical assembly that serves as an aerodynamic fairing for the propulsion and electrical system components. The forward most element of the nose cone functions as a cast aluminium lightning rod.  The LOX tank volume is {{convert|19744|cuft|m3|abbr=on}} at 22 psig (250 kPa absolute) and {{convert|-297|°F|K °C|abbr=on}} ([[cryogenic]]).

The tank feeds into a {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter feed line that conveys the liquid oxygen through the intertank, then outside the ET to the aft right-hand ET/orbiter disconnect umbilical. The {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter feed line permits liquid oxygen to flow at approximately 2,787&amp;nbsp;lb/s (1264&amp;nbsp;kg/s) with the SSMEs operating at 104% or permits a maximum flow of 17,592 gal/min (1.1099 m³/s).

All loads except aerodynamic loads are transferred from the LOX tank at a bolted, flange-joint interface with the intertank.

The LOX tank also includes an internal slosh baffle and a vortex baffle to dampen fluid slosh.  The vortex baffle is mounted over the LOX feed outlet to reduce fluid swirl resulting from slosh and to prevent entrapment of gases in the delivered LOX.

===Intertank===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[STS-51-L Mission timeline]] --&gt;
The intertank is the ET structural connection which joins both the LOX and LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks.  Its primary functions are to receive and distribute all thrust loads from the SRBs and transfer loads between the tanks.

The two SRB forward attach fittings are located 180° apart on the intertank structure.  A beam is extended across the intertank structure and is mechanically fastened to the attach fittings.  When the SRBs are firing, the beam will flex due to high stress loads.  These loads will be transferred to the fittings.

Adjoining the SRB attach fittings is a major ring frame.  The loads are transferred from the fittings to the major ring frame which then distributes the tangential loads to the intertank skin.  Two panels of the intertank skin, called the thrust panels, distribute the concentrated axial SRB thrust loads to the LOX and LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  tanks and to adjacent intertank skin panels.  These adjacent panels are made up of six stringer-stiffened panels.

The intertank also functions as a protective compartment for housing the operational instrumentation.

===Liquid hydrogen tank===
[[Image:Sts et1.jpg|thumb|300px|The {{convert|70|ft|m|0|sing=on}}-long, 17-inch-diameter liquid oxygen feedline runs externally along the right side of the liquid hydrogen tank up and into the intertank. Two {{convert|5|in|mm|sing=on}} diameter re-pressurization lines run beside it. One supplies hydrogen gas to the liquid hydrogen tank and the other supplies oxygen gas to the liquid oxygen tank. They are used to maintain the [[Ullage (rocketry)|ullage]] pressure in each tank during the launch.]]
The LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank is the bottom portion of the ET. The tank is constructed of four cylindrical barrel sections, a forward dome, and an aft dome.  The barrel sections are joined together by five major ring frames.  These ring frames receive and distribute loads.  The forward dome-to-barrel frame distributes the loads applied through the intertank structure and is also the flange for attaching the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank to the intertank.  The aft major ring receives orbiter-induced loads from the aft orbiter support struts and SRB-induced loads from the aft SRB support struts.  The remaining three ring frames distribute orbiter thrust loads and LOX feedline support loads.  Loads from the frames are then distributed through the barrel skin panels.  The LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank has a volume of {{convert|53488|cuft|m3}} at 29.3 psig (3.02 bar absolute) and {{convert|−423|°F|K °C|abbr=on}} (cryogenic).

[[File:Space Shuttle external tank assembly 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of a liquid hydrogen tank during assembly at the NASA rocket factory; with humans for scale]]

The forward and aft domes have the same modified ellipsoidal shape.  For the forward dome, mounting provisions are incorporated for the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vent valve, the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressurization line fitting, and the electrical feed-through fitting.  The aft dome has a manhole fitting for access to the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feedline screen and a support fitting for the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feedline.

The LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank also has a vortex baffle to reduce swirl resulting from slosh and to prevent entrapment of gases in the delivered LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The baffle is located at the siphon outlet just above the aft dome of the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank.  This outlet transmits the liquid hydrogen from the tank through a {{convert|17|in|mm}} line to the left aft umbilical. The liquid hydrogen feed line flow rate is 465&amp;nbsp;lb/s (211&amp;nbsp;kg/s) with the SSMEs at 104% or a maximum flow of 47,365 US gal/min (2.988 m³/s).

===Thermal protection system===
[[Image:Sts et.jpg|thumb|300px|The Orbiter attachment hardware, liquid hydrogen umbilical connection (left), and liquid oxygen umbilical connection (right) are visible at the bottom of the tank.]]
The ET thermal protection system consists primarily of spray-on [[foam]] [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] (SOFI), plus preformed foam pieces and premolded [[ablate|ablator]] materials. The system also includes the use of [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]] [[thermal]] insulators to preclude air liquefaction. Thermal isolators are required for liquid hydrogen tank attachments to preclude the liquefaction of air on exposed metal, and to reduce heat flow into the liquid hydrogen. While the warmer liquid oxygen results in fewer thermal requirements, the aluminum of the liquid oxygen tank forward areas require protection from [[Aerodynamic heating|aeroheating]].  Meanwhile, insulation on the aft surfaces prevents liquified air from pooling in the intertank.  The middle cylinder of the oxygen tank, and the propellant lines, could withstand the expected depths of frost accumulation condensed from humidity, but the orbiter could not take the damage from ice breaking free.  The thermal protection system weighs {{convert|4823|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

Development of the ETs thermal protection system was problematic.  Anomalies in foam application were so frequent that they were treated as variances, not safety incidents.  NASA had difficulty preventing fragments of foam from detaching during flight for the entire history of the program:

*[[STS-1]], 1981: Crew reports white material streaming past windows during orbiter-external-tank flight.  Crew estimated sizes from 1/4-inch to fist-sized.  Post-landing report describes probable foam loss of unknown location, and 300 tiles needing outright replacement due to various causes.
*[[STS-4]], 1982: PAL ramp loss; 40 tiles require outright replacement.
*[[STS-5]], 1982: Continued high rate of tile loss.
*[[STS-7]], 1983: {{convert|50|by|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} Bipod ramp loss photographed, dozens of spot losses.&lt;ref name="sts7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sts7.htm |title=STS-7 |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129060148/http://astronautix.com/flights/sts7.htm |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[STS-27]], 1988: One large loss of uncertain origin, causing one total tile loss.  Hundreds of small losses.
*[[STS-32]], 1990: Bipod ramp loss photographed; five spot losses up to 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, plus tile damages.&lt;ref name="flatoday"&gt;[http://www.floridatoday.com/columbia/shuttlechart.html Insulation problems seen before] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715124906/http://www.floridatoday.com/columbia/shuttlechart.html |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[STS-50]], 1992: Bipod ramp loss. 20×10×1&amp;nbsp;cm tile damage.&lt;ref name="flatoday"/&gt;
*[[STS-52]], 1992: Portion of bipod ramp, jackpad lost. 290 total tile marks, 16 greater than an inch.
*[[STS-62]], 1994: Portion of bipod ramp lost.

In 1995, [[Trichlorofluoromethane|chlorofluorocarbon-11]] (CFC-11) began to be withdrawn from large-area, machine-sprayed foams in compliance with an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] ban on CFCs under section 610 of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. In its place, a [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] known as [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane|HCFC-141b]] was certified for use and phased into the shuttle program.  Remaining foams, particularly detail pieces sprayed by hand, continue to use CFC-11 to this day.  These areas include the problematic bipod and PAL ramps, as well as some fittings and interfaces.  For the bipod ramp in particular, "the process of applying foam to that part of the tank had not changed since 1993."&lt;ref name="Deseret"&gt;Bridis, Ted.  "Foam called a concern on flight before Columbia," Deseret News (Salt Lake City), Mar. 22, 2003, pp. 1: http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20030322/ai_n11384413&lt;/ref&gt;  The "new" foam containing HCFC 141b was first used on the aft dome portion of ET-82 during the flight of [[STS-79]] in 1996. Use of HCFC 141b was expanded to the ETs area, or larger portions of the tank, starting with ET-88, which flew on [[STS-86]] in 1997.

During the lift-off of [[STS-107]] on January 16, 2003, a piece of foam insulation detached from one of the tank's bipod ramps and struck the leading edge of [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']]'s wing at a few hundred miles per hour.  The impact is believed to have damaged one comparatively large reinforced carbon-carbon panel on the leading edge of the left wing, believed to be about the size of a basketball which then allowed super-heated gas to enter the wing superstructure several days later during re-entry.  This resulted in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction of ''Columbia'']] and the loss of its crew.  The report determined that the external fuel tank, ET-93, "had been constructed with BX-250", a closeout foam whose blowing agent was CFC-11 and not the newer HCFC 141b.&lt;ref name="D07"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/caib/PDFS/VOL2/D07.PDF Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Volume 2, Appendix D], Section 11.3 and figure 11-1, p222, Columbia Accident Investigation Board,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the problem of foam shed had not been fully cured; on [[STS-114]], additional cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, and are more likely to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.

Reports published concurrent with the [[STS-114]] mission suggest that excessive handling of the ET during modification and upgrade may have contributed to the foam loss on ''Discovery'''s Return to Flight mission. However, three shuttle missions ([[STS-121]], [[STS-115]], and [[STS-116]])  have since been conducted, all with "acceptable" levels of foam loss. However, on [[STS-118]] a piece of foam (and/or ice) about 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter separated from a feedline attachment bracket on the tank, ricocheted off one of the aft struts and struck the underside of the wing, damaging two tiles. The damage was not considered dangerous.

===Hardware===
[[File:STS-116 PreLaunch (NASA KSC-06PD-2670).jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' before the scheduled launch of [[STS-116]] in December 2006. Beneath ''Discovery'''s wings are the tail masts, which provide several umbilical connections to the orbiter, including a liquid-oxygen line through one and a liquid-hydrogen line through another. Seen above the golden external tank is the vent hood (known as the "[[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie cap]]") at the end of the gaseous oxygen vent arm, extending from the fixed service structure. Vapor boils off the liquid oxygen in the external tank. The hood vents the oxygen vapor away from the Space Shuttle vehicle.]]The external hardware, ET–orbiter attachment fittings, umbilical fittings, and electrical and range safety system weigh {{convert|9100|lb|t|abbr=on|lk=out}}.

====Vents and relief valves====
Each propellant tank has a vent and [[relief valve]] at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by ground support equipment for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the [[ullage]] (empty space) pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).

On early flights, the liquid oxygen tank contained a separate, [[pyrotechnic]]ally operated, propulsive tumble vent valve at its forward end. At separation, the liquid oxygen tumble vent valve was opened, providing impulse to assist in the separation maneuver and more positive control of the entry aerodynamics of the ET. The last flight with the tumble valve active was STS-36.

Each of the two aft external tank umbilical plates mate with a corresponding plate on the orbiter. The plates help maintain alignment among the umbilicals. Physical strength at the umbilical plates is provided by bolting corresponding umbilical plates together. When the orbiter GPCs command external tank separation, the bolts are severed by pyrotechnic devices.

The ET has five propellant umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: two for the liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid hydrogen tank. One of the liquid oxygen tank umbilical valves is for liquid oxygen, the other for gaseous oxygen. The liquid hydrogen tank umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during prelaunch.

[[File:Technicians inspecting the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate on Space Shuttle Endeavour's external fuel tank during STS-127 - 20090624.jpg|thumb|Technicians inspect the GUCP following a scrub of [[STS-127]] due to elevated hydrogen levels at this connector]]
As the ET is filled, excess gaseous hydrogen is vented through umbilical connections over a large diameter pipe on an arm extended from the fixed service structure.  The connection for this pipe between the ET and service structure is made at the ground umbilical carrier plate (GUCP).  Sensors are also installed at the GUCP to measure Hydrogen levels.  Countdowns of  [[STS-80]], [[STS-119]], [[STS-127]] and [[STS-133]] have been halted and resulted in several week delays in the later cases due to hydrogen leaks at this connection.  This requires complete draining of the tanks and removal of all hydrogen via helium gas purge, a 20-hour process, before technicians can inspect and repair problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate|url=http://www1.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/gucp_prt.htm|publisher=NASA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043253/http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/gucp_prt.htm|archivedate=2010-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cap mounted to the swing-arm on the fixed service structure covers the oxygen tank vent on top of the ET during the countdown and is retracted about two minutes before lift- off. The cap siphons off oxygen vapor that threatens to form large ice accumulations on the ET, thus protecting the orbiter's thermal protection system during launch.

====Sensors====
[[File:Sts et ecographic.jpg|thumb|300px|The location of ECO sensors in the LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank]]
There are eight propellant-depletion sensors, four each for fuel and oxidizer. The fuel-depletion sensors are located in the bottom of the fuel tank. The oxidizer sensors are mounted in the orbiter liquid oxygen feed line manifold downstream of the feed line disconnect. During SSME thrusting, the orbiter general-purpose computers constantly compute the instantaneous mass of the vehicle due to the usage of the propellants. Normally, main engine cutoff is based on a predetermined velocity; however, if any two of the fuel or oxidizer sensors sense a dry condition, the engines will be shut down.

The locations of the liquid oxygen sensors allow the maximum amount of oxidizer to be consumed in the engines, while allowing sufficient time to shut down the engines before the oxidizer pumps [[cavitation|cavitate]] (run dry). In addition, {{convert|1100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of liquid hydrogen are loaded over and above that required by the 6-1 oxidizer / fuel engine mixture ratio. This assures that cutoff from the depletion sensors is fuel-rich; oxidizer-rich engine shutdowns can cause burning and severe erosion of engine components, potentially leading to loss of the vehicle and crew.

Unexplained, erroneous readings from fuel depletion sensors have delayed several shuttle launch attempts, most notably [[STS-122]]. On 2007-12-18 a tanking test determined the cause of the errors to be a fault in a wiring connector, rather than a failure of the sensors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwoRZdYGkG1X3lZOF3x4GduJuKNQ | title = NASA eyes faulty gauge wires as source of shuttle problems | date = 2007-12-18 | publisher = AFP | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218101202/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwoRZdYGkG1X3lZOF3x4GduJuKNQ | archivedate = 2008-02-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[pressure transducer]]s located at the top of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks monitor the ullage pressures.

The ET also has two electrical umbilicals that carry electrical power from the orbiter to the tank and the two SRBs and provide information from the SRBs and ET to the orbiter.

The ET has external cameras mounted in the brackets attached to the shuttle along with transmitters that can continue to send video data long after the shuttle and the ET have separated.

===Range safety system===

Earlier tanks incorporated a range safety system to disperse tank propellants if necessary. It included a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] power source, a receiver/decoder, antennas and [[Explosive material|ordnance]].  Starting with [[STS-79]] this system was disabled, and was completely removed for [[STS-88]] and all subsequent flights.

==Future use==
In 1990, it was suggested that the external tank be used as a [[lunar habitat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King CB, Butterfield AJ, Hypes WD, Nealy JE, Simonsen LC |title=Lunar habitat concept employing the space shuttle external tank |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=225–6 |year=1990 |pmid=11539123|bibcode=1990JSpRo..27..225K |doi=10.2514/3.26128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an orbital station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.permanent.com/ext-tank.htm|title=SHUTTLE'S THROWAWAY EXTERNAL TANK -- INSTEAD, COLLECTING AND USING THEM IN ORBIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals did not come to fruition.

===As basis for Ares in Constellation===
With the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011,&lt;ref name="NASAlaunchschedule"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html NASA launch schedule], accessed 2009/09/23&lt;/ref&gt; NASA, with its planned [[Project Constellation]], which features the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]]-derived [[Orion spacecraft]], would also have featured the debut of two Shuttle-derived launch vehicles, the [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]] [[Ares I]] crew-launch vehicle and the heavy-lift [[Ares V]] cargo-launch vehicle.

While both the Ares I and Ares V would have utilized a modified five-segment Solid Rocket Booster for its first stage, the current ET would have served as a baseline technology for the first stage of the Ares V and the second stage of the Ares I; as a comparison, the Ares I second stage would have held approximately {{convert|26000|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of LOX, versus the ET holding {{convert|146000|USgal|l|abbr=on}}, more than 5 times that amount.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Ares V first stage, which would have been fitted with five [[RS-68 (rocket engine)|RS-68]] rocket engines (the same engine used on the [[Delta IV rocket]]), will be {{convert|33|ft|m|0}} in diameter, as wide as the [[S-IC]] and [[S-II]] stages on the [[Saturn V]] rocket.  It would have utilized the same internal ET configuration (separate LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LOX tanks separated with an intertank structure), but would have been configured to directly accept LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LOX fill and drain, along with LOX venting on a retractable arm like that used on the Shuttle for LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (as the "beanie cap" would have been useless due to the in-line design of the three-stage vehicle).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[Image:Rocket size comparison.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of the [[Saturn V]], [[Space Shuttle]], [[Ares I]], [[Ares IV]] and [[Ares V]].]]

The Ares I second stage, on the other hand, would have only used the spray-on insulation foam currently used on the current ET.  Originally configured like that of the Ares V and the Shuttle ET, NASA, upon completing its design review in 2006, decided, in order to save weight and costs, to reconfigure the internal structure of the second stage by using a combined LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LOX tank with the propellants separated by a common bulkhead, a configuration successfully used on the S-II and [[S-IVB]] stages of the Saturn V rocket.  Unlike the Ares V, which would have used the same fill/drain/vent configuration used on the Shuttle, the Ares I system would have utilized a traditional fill/drain/vent system used on the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets, but with quick-retracting arms due to the "leap frog" speed the Ares I will expect upon SRB ignition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

As originally envisioned, both the Ares I and Ares V would have used a modified "throw away" version of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSME]], but in due course, because of the need to keep R&amp;D costs down and to maintain a schedule set by NASA Administration [[Michael D. Griffin]] to launch the Ares and Orion by 2011, NASA decided (after the 2006 review) to switch to the cheaper [[RS-68]] engine for the Ares V and to an uprated [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine for the Ares I.  Because of the switch to the less efficient RS-68, the Ares V was widened from {{convert|28.6|to|33|ft|m|2}} to accommodate the extra propellants, while the Ares I was reconfigured to incorporate a fifth solid-rocket segment with the J-2X upper stage, as the new engine has less thrust than the original SSME.  Because of the trade-off, NASA would save an estimated [[USD]] $35 million by using simplified, higher thrust RS-68 engines (reconfigured to fire and perform like the SSME), while at the same time, eliminate the costly tests needed for an air-startable SSME for the Ares I (as the J-2X and its predecessor were designed to be started in both mid-air and in a near vacuum).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Proposed for DIRECT===
The [[DIRECT]] project, a proposed alternative shuttle-derived vehicle,would have used a modified, standard diameter, external tank with three SSMEs, with two standard SRBM, as a Crew Launch Vehicle. The same vehicle, with one extra SSME, and an EDS upper stage, would have served as the Cargo Launch Vehicle.

'''Sue Biggins''' (born 1968) is an American cell biologist who studies [[kinetochore]]s and the transfer of [[chromosomes]] during [[cell division]]. Her team isolated kinetochores from cells, enabling them to be studied separately under laboratory conditions. They also discovered that tension helps kinetochores to attach to microtubules and move from the mother cell to the daughter cells when cells divide. The methodology and concepts she developed for yeast kinetochores are being adopted in laboratories around the world.
Biggins was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] (AAAS) in 2018.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tompa |first1=Rachel |title=Dr. Sue Biggins elected to American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |url=https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2018/04/biggins-elected-american-academy-arts-sciences.html |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=Fred Hutch News Service |date=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3140">'''Talking past each other''' is an English phrase describing the situation where two or more people talk about different subjects, while believing that they are talking about the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;The English phrase is like the Chinese idiomatic expression "chicken talking to a duck" ([[wikt:鸡同鸭讲|鸡同鸭讲]] or [[wikt:雞同鴨講|雞同鴨講]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idiomatic expression is an allusion to the interaction between [[Thrasymachus]] and [[Socrates]] over the question of "justice" in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic I]].'' In their dialogue, neither man addressed any of the issues raised by the other and two different concepts which need not have been disputed are  somehow confused.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Bryce Gallie|Gallie, Walter Bryce]], "[[Essentially Contested Concepts]]," ''Proceedings of the [[Aristotelian Society]]'', Vol. 56, (1956), pp.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In common use ==
In fictional dialogue, when characters "''&lt;u&gt;talk past each other''&lt;/u&gt;, ...[they are said to] expose an unbridgeable gulf between their respective perceptions and intentions. The result is an exchange, but never an interchange, of words in fragmented and cramped utterances..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marieluise Fleisser|Fleisser, Marieluise]] (author), Horton, David (ed.), {{Google books|v3y7AAAAIAAJ|''Pioniere in Ingolstadt,'' p. 25.|page=25|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in widely varying contexts.  For example, in 1917 [[Albert Einstein]] and [[David Hilbert]] had dawn-to-dusk discussions of physics; and they continued their debate in writing, although [[Felix Klein]] records that they ''&lt;u&gt;talked past each other''&lt;/u&gt;, as happens not infrequently between simultaneously producing mathematicians.'"&lt;ref&gt;Mehra, Jagdish. (1974). ''Einstein, Hilbert, and the Theory of Gravitation,'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theophilus Shickel Painter''' (August 22, 1889 – October 5, 1969) was an American [[zoology|zoologist]] best-known for his work on the structure and function of chromosomes, especially the [[sex-determination system|sex-determination genes X and Y]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/theophilus-shickel-painter-1889-1969 Entry on Painter by Dorothy Haskett in The Embryo Project Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; He also carried out work in identifying [[gene]]s in fruit flies (''[[Drosophila]]''). His work exploited the giant [[polytene]] chromosomes in the salivary glands of Drosophila and other [[Diptera]]n [[larva]]e.

Painter joined the faculty at the [[University of Texas]] in 1916 and, except for military duty during World War I, stayed there his whole career. He was, in succession, associate professor, professor and distinguished professor of zoology. He served as acting president (1944–1946) and president (1946–1952) of the University of Texas and retired from active teaching in 1966.

Painter was president of the University of Texas when Texas resident [[Heman Marion Sweatt]] applied for and was denied admission due to his race.  Subsequently, Painter was the named defendant in the civil rights case ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'', 339 U.S.629 (1950), which proved an integral stepping stone in the landmark case [[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas]] that held that "separate is inherently unequal" and led to the integration of America's public schools.

Painter is also known for his early study of human chromosomes. In 1921 he first gave the number 24 for the count of human [[meiotic]] [[chromosome]]s. He had tried to count the tangled mass of chromosomes he could see under a microscope in [[spermatocyte]]s in slices of [[testicle]] and arrived at the figure of 24. Others later repeated his experiment in other ways and agreed upon the number of 24. Popular thinking held that if there were 24 chromosomes in spermatocytes, there must be an equal number contributed by the female and the human chromosome number must be 48, which was undisputed for more than 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The bizarre case of the chromosome that never was|first=Robert|last=Matthews|url=http://blogs.saschina.org/pudongtok/files/2010/03/Problems-with-authority-in-Science.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215103947/http://blogs.saschina.org/pudongtok/files/2010/03/Problems-with-authority-in-Science.pdf|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1955, [[Joe Hin Tjio]], using more advanced techniques, looked at the chromosomes in human [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells and found 46 chromosomes. Together with [[Albert Levan]], Tjio published his finding in early 1956, and the human chromosome number was finally revised.

In 1934 Painter was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Career ==
After Harvard, Cheng took a position at [[Warner–Lambert|Warner-Lambert]] Research, later [[Pfizer|Pfizer,]] in Michigan. Work there included ketopiperazine-based renin inhibitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-05-01|title=Ketopiperazine-based renin inhibitors: Optimization of the “C” ring|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X06001296|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|language=en|volume=16|issue=9|pages=2500–2504|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2006.01.084|issn=0960-894X}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMG-CoA inhibitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-08-15|title=Design and synthesis of hepatoselective, pyrrole-based HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X07006762|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|language=en|volume=17|issue=16|pages=4538–4544|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2007.05.096|issn=0960-894X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and molecules against multiple other cardiovascular targets.

The '''Zytglogge''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Bernese German]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-gsw|ˈtsiˌkːlɔkːə|}}) is a [[landmark]] [[medieval]] [[tower]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Built in the early 13th century, it has served the city as [[Defensive wall|guard tower]], [[prison]], [[clock tower]], centre of urban life and civic [[memorial]].

Despite the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800&amp;nbsp;years of existence, the Zytglogge is one of Bern's most recognisable symbols and, with its 15th-century [[astronomical clock]], a major tourist attraction. It is a [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] (1995), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the [[Old City of Bern]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Cultural Heritage]] site.

==History==
[[Image:Merian Bern - Guard towers.jpg|thumb|left|Bern in 1638 with its three medieval [[guard tower]]s, from left to right: [[Christoffelturm]], [[Käfigturm]], Zytglogge. &lt;small&gt;([http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/MerianBern.jpg See full map])&lt;/small&gt;]]
When it was built around 1218–20,&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 2"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern's western fortifications. These were erected after the city's first westward expansion following its [[Golden Charter of Bern|''de facto'' independence]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. At that time, the Zytglogge was a squat building of only {{convert|16|m}} in height. When the rapid growth of the city and the further expansion of the fortifications (up to the [[Käfigturm]]) relegated the tower to second-line status at around 1270–75, it was heightened by {{convert|7|m}} to overlook the surrounding houses.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 2"/&gt;

Only after the city's western defences were extended again in 1344–46 up to the now-destroyed [[Christoffelturm]], the Zytglogge was converted to a women's prison, notably housing ''Pfaffendirnen'' – "priests' whores", women convicted of sexual relations with clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Swissinfo]]|date= 8 October 2005|author=Clare O'Dea|title=Time marches on at the Zytglogge|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=108&amp;sid=6145735}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zytglogge 1542.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zytglogge as shown on a 1542 glass painting.]]
In the great fire of 1405, the tower burnt out completely. It suffered severe structural damage that required thorough repairs, which were not complete until after the last restoration in 1983. The prison cells were abandoned&lt;ref name="Hofer, 107"&gt;Hofer, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[clock]] was first installed above the gate in the early 15th century, probably including a simple astronomical clock and musical mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This clock, together with the great [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1405, gave the Zytglogge its name, which in [[Bernese German]] means "time bell".&lt;ref name="Hofer, 107"/&gt;

In the late 15th century, the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower.&lt;ref name="Hofer, 108"&gt;Hofer, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by [[Kaspar Brunner]], and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 6"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zytglogge 1830.jpg|thumb|left|The Zytglogge's west façade in 1830, after the 1770 restructuring.]]
The Zytglogge's exterior was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607–10, who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west façades of the tower.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 6"/&gt; The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603.&lt;ref name="Hofer, 108"/&gt; In 1770–71, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late [[Baroque]], giving the tower its contemporary outline.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 9"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both façades were again repainted in the [[Rococo]] style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890. The idealising [[historicism (art)|historicism]] of the design came to be disliked in the 20th century, and a 1929 competition produced the façade designs visible today: on the west façade, [[Victor Surbek]]'s fresco "Beginning of Time" and on the east façade, a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt Indermühle.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 9"/&gt; In 1981–83, the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[advent]] season and from [[Easter]] until the end of October, it is illuminated after [[dusk]].&lt;ref name=Bund_2008&gt;{{cite news|title=Zytglogge tickt nicht richtig: Das Uhrwerk kennt kein Schaltjahr|publisher=[[Der Bund]]|date=2008-02-29|author=Philipp Schori|url=http://www.espace.ch/artikel_489623.html|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
The Bernese German ''Zytglogge'' translates to ''Zeitglocke'' in [[Standard German]] and to ''[[time]] bell'' in [[English language|English]]; 'Glocke' means 'bell' in German, as in the related term '[[glockenspiel]]'. A "time bell" was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a [[clockwork]] connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour.&lt;ref name="Marti 2005, 19"&gt;Marti (2005), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a device was installed in the ''Wendelstein'' in Bern – the tower of the ''Leutkirche'' church which the [[Münster of Bern|Münster]] later replaced – in 1383 at the latest; it alerted the bell-ringer to ring the tower bells.&lt;ref name="Marti 2005, 19"/&gt;

The name of ''Zytglogge'' was first recorded in 1413.&lt;ref&gt;Messerli, 581.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the tower was referred to as the ''kebie'' ("cage", i.e., prison) and after its post-1405 reconstruction, the ''nüwer turm'' ("new tower").&lt;ref&gt;Messerli, 581; Marti (2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exterior==

===External structure===
[[Image:Zytglogge corner detail.jpg|thumb|Detail: wooden Gothic whisker cornice, corner towerlet base and decorative plating.]]
The Zytglogge has an overall height of {{convert|54.5|m}}, and a height of {{convert|24|m}} up to the roof-edge. Its rectangular floor plan measures {{convert|11.2|by|10.75|m}}. The wall strengths vary widely, ranging from {{convert|260|cm}} in the west, where the tower formed part of the city walls, to {{convert|65|cm}} in the east.&lt;ref name="Hofer, 111"&gt;Hofer, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outward appearance of the Zytglogge is determined by the 1770 renovation. Only the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[cornice]] below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history.&lt;ref name="Hofer, 111"/&gt;

The main body of the tower is divided into the two-storey [[plinth]], whose exterior is made of alpine [[limestone]], and the three-storey tower shaft sheathed in [[sandstone]]. The shaft's seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still-visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two-story [[attic]] is covered by  the sweeping, red-tiled, late Gothic [[spire]], in which two [[spire light]]s are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental [[urn]]s with [[Pine#Cones|pinecone]] knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th-century drawings.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 15"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

From atop the spire, the  wooden [[pinnacle]], [[copper]]-sheathed since 1930, rises an additional {{convert|15|m}} into the skies, crowned with a [[gilded]] knob and a [[weather vane]] displaying a cut-out [[coat of arms of Bern]].&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 15"/&gt;

===Bells and bell-striker===
[[Image:Zytglogge - Hans von Thann.jpg|thumb|Detail: Gilded [[Jacquemart (bellstriker)|Jacquemart]] and hour bell. Below, the top of the smaller quarter-hour bell.]]
The tower's two namesake [[bronze]] bells hang in the [[cupola]] at its very top.{{fact|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Zytglogge bellworks.jpg|thumb|upright|Zytglogge bellworks]]

The great hour bell, cast by Johann Reber, has remained unchanged since the tower's reconstruction in 1405. It has a diameter of {{convert|127|cm}}, a weight of {{convert|1400|kg}} and rings with a nominal tone of ''e'''.&lt;ref name="Marti 2005, 32–33"&gt;Marti (2005), 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the bell reads, in [[Latin]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the October month of the year 1405 I was cast by Master John called Reber of [[Aarau]]. I am vessel and wax, and to all I tell the hours of the day."&lt;ref name="Marti 2005, 32–33"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the great bell rings out every full hour, struck by a large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded [[Chronos]], the Greek personification of time, is traditionally nicknamed ''Hans von [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]]'' by the Bernese.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden [[Jacquemart (bellstriker)|bell-striker]], which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden ''Chronos'' might have been created by master craftsman [[Albrecht von Nürnberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 15; Hofer (122) is more doubtful.&lt;/ref&gt; while the current and most recent ''Hans'' is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 15"/&gt;

Below the hour bell hangs the smaller quarter-hour bell, also rung by a clockwork hammer. It was cast in 1887 to replace the cracked 1486 original.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 15"/&gt;

===Clock faces and façade decorations===

[[Image:Zytglogge-Bern-Movement from 1530 by Kasper Bruner.jpg|thumb|The movement forged ''[[in situ]]'' in 1530 by Kaspar Brunner, "cannon ball" pendulum bob on the left.]]
Both principal façades, East and West, are dominated by massive [[clockface]]s. The Zytglogge's first clockface was likely located on the plinth, but was moved up to the center of the shaft during the tower's 15th-century reconfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern clock face features an outer ring of large golden [[Roman numerals]], on which the larger hand indicates the hour, and an inner ring on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes. The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1983), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of [[House of Zähringen|Zähringen]]. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The western clock face has similar hands, but is an integral part of Victor Surbek's 1929 [[fresco]] "Beginning of Time". The painting depicts [[Chronos]] swooping down with cape fluttering, and, below the clockface, [[Adam and Eve]]'s [[The Fall of Man|eviction from Paradise]] by an [[angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, 119; Bellwald (1983), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical clock===
The [[Clock face|dial]] of the Zytglogge's astronomical clock is built in the form of an [[astrolabe]]. It is backed by a [[Stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] [[planisphere]] divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of [[dawn]] and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the [[horizon]], dawn, the [[Circle of latitude#Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn|tropics]] and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 19"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the planisphere moves the ''rete'', a web-like metal cutout representing the [[zodiac]], which also features a [[Julian calendar]] dial. Above the ''rete'', a display indicates the day of the week. Because [[leap day]]s are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each [[leap year]] on 29 February.&lt;ref name=Bund_2008/&gt; A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the [[moon phase]]. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the ''rete'''s calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 20"&gt;Bellwald (1983), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painted [[frieze]] above the astronomical clock shows five deities from classical antiquity, each representing both a day of the week and a planet in their order according to [[Almagest#Ptolemy's cosmos|Ptolemaic cosmology]]. From left to right, they are: [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] with sickle and club for Saturday, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] with thunderbolts for Thursday, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] with sword and shield for Tuesday, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] with [[Cupid]] for Friday and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] with staff and bag for Wednesday.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 19"/&gt; The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

====Movement====
The clock dial has been dated to either the building phases of 1405 or 1467-83,&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 20"/&gt; or to the installation of the Brunner clockwork in 1527-30.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1983, 19"/&gt;

A clock is documented in this tower since 1405,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Marti
  | first = Markus
  | title = 600 Jahre Zytglogge Bern - Eine kleine Chronik der Zeitmessung
  | publisher = Staempfli
  | date = 2005
  | location = Bern
  | page = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when a new bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The [[jacquemart (bellstriker)]] is also documented in the same 1534 source.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

In the first two decades of the sixteenth century many craftsmen unsuccessfully tried to improve the clockworks.  The current [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] was made in 1530 by clockmaker Kaspar Brunner and is dated and signed by a forged nameplate. No other clockworks by this master are known. The core of the movement was forged ''[[in situ]]'', in the very room it is still located, and the fire pit of the forge remains in the room.  One of the more unusual features of the movement is that each individual tooth of the major gears is removable (i.e., replaceable as it wears).{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Originally, the movement had a [[verge escapement]] with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]], as it was built 127 years before the [[pendulum clock]] was invented. The Zytglogge movement was converted to a much more accurate pendulum mechanism by the French clockmaker Pierre Angely between 1686 and 1688.  The current pendulum bob, a "recycled" iron cannonball, possibly dates from that time.  The pendulum suspension is made from leather rather than using a metal spring.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The weight-driven movement is wound daily by hand. That task, a role known as the "Zytgloggenrichter", has been held for over 25 years by the same individual.{{who|date=May 2017}}{{fact|date=May 2017}}

==Interior==
The Zytglogge's internal layout has changed over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was not much more than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Messerli, 580.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1979), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rooms above the clockwork mechanism were used by the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an [[air raid shelter]].&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1979, 11"&gt;Bellwald (1979), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Bellwald 1979, 11"/&gt; Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwald (1979), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only accessed for maintenance and in the course of regular guided tours.
