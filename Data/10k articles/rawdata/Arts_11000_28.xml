'''Africa Beyond''' is a project celebrating African arts and culture in the UK, supported by [[Arts Council England]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Southbank Centre]], iniva (Institute for International Visual Arts) and other partners.

Africa Beyond was founded in March 2006, based in [[London]]. It was created as a legacy of Africa 05, a major celebration of African arts, held throughout 2005. It organises artist residencies linking Africa and the UK, runs public events such as the Word from Africa festival (first hosted at the British Museum in May 2007), and works with arts venues to improve their links with African audiences and artists.

The BBC hosted the Africa Beyond website, which features articles on African music, film, theatre, dance, literature and visual arts, with a special focus on artists and stories relevant to audiences in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/bbc-launches-africa-beyond/ "BBC launches Africa Beyond"], TheSouthAfrica.com, 27 march 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is no longer updated.

The '''Amazon Theatre''' ({{Lang-pt|Teatro Amazonas}}) is an [[opera house]] located in [[Manaus]], in the heart of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]]. It is the location of the annual ''[[Festival Amazonas de Ópera]]'' (Amazonas Opera Festival) and the home of the [[Amazonas Philharmonic|Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra]] which regularly rehearses and performs at the Amazon Theater along with choirs, musical [[concert]]s and other performances.

==History==
The Amazonas Theatre was built during the [[Belle Époque]] at a time when fortunes were made in the [[rubber boom]]. Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a "jewel" in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/14/manaus-amazon-theatre-brazil-history-cities-50-buildings The Guardian UK, Tuesday 14 April 2015 11.29 BST]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the State legislature approved some limited financing, but this was considered insufficient. Later that year, the president of the Province, [[José Lustosa Paranaguá]], approved a larger budget and initiated a competition for the presentation of plans. The chosen project was made by the ''Gabinete Português de Engenharia e Arquitectura'', an engineering and architecture office from [[Lisbon]]. By 1884, construction was ready to begin under the Italian architect [[Celestial Sacardim]]. Work proceeded slowly over the following fifteen years with some stops and restarts from 1885 to 1892.

By 1895, when the masonry work and exterior were completed, the decoration of the interior and the installation of electric lighting could begin more rapidly. The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1896, with the first performance occurring on January 7, 1897, with the [[Italian opera]], ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', by [[Amilcare Ponchielli]].

==Architecture and style==
The theatre's architectural style is considered typically [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]]. The roofing tiles were imported from [[Alsace]], the steel walls from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Carrara marble]] for the stairs, statues and columns, from [[Italy]]. The [[dome]] is covered with 36,000 decorated [[ceramic tile]]s painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from [[France]] in the [[Louis Quinze|Louis Quinze style]]. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber. The curtain, with its painting "Meeting of the Waters", was originally created in Paris by [[Crispim do Amaral]]. The theatre's 198 [[chandelier]]s were imported from Italy, including 32 of [[Murano glass]].

==Internal Structure==

*The theatre is featured in the film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]''&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Werner (2001). Herzog on Herzog. Faber and Faber. {{ISBN|0-571-20708-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; directed by the German director [[Werner Herzog]] in 1982.  At the beginning of the film, the opera-obsessed character Brian Sweeney "Fitzcarraldo" Fitzgerald makes his way by paddling his own boat to the opera house to hear [[Enrico Caruso]] sing in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanfiles-vm.williams.edu/mbrown/Brown_ArtOfDarkness_1982.pdf Art of Darkness, The Progressive, August 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; which also features aging [[Sarah Bernhardt]] whose role is sung by an off-stage soprano. (Sarah seems to think she is in [[Lucia di Lammermoor]], with its mad scene). Fitzcarraldo arrives right at the end of the opera, and there are scenes of the interior of the opera house. While it is believed that the opera house was constructed to attract Caruso to perform at its opening, there is some doubt that he actually did perform there.
*It is featured twice in novels by [[Eva Ibbotson]]: ''[[Journey to the River Sea]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/09/guardianchildrensfictionprize2001.awardsandprizes18 "And the winner is ... : ... a book that lasts.

Both are adventure stories set principally in the city of [[Manaus]] (where the theatre is situated) and surroundings in 1912. In the former (children's) book a visiting acting group performs the play, [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] at the theatre, which is briefly described.  In the latter (young adult) novel a visiting ballet troupe performs [[Swan Lake]], [[Giselle]], [[The Nutcracker]] and [[La Fille Mal Gardee]] at the theatre.
*The theatre was featured in [[Ann Patchett]]'s 2011 novel, "State of Wonder".

An '''artist's statement''' (or '''artist statement''') is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, his or her own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.

==Description==
The artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize his or her body of work. It places or attempts to place the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a "vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world." &lt;ref&gt; College Art Association (Producer). (2011, Jan 26). "Developing Your Artist Statement" [Audio Podcast]. Retrieved from http://www.collegeart.org/podcasts/ &lt;/ref&gt; Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, hand outs at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.   


Artists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. &lt;ref&gt;''Tom Palin: Artist Statements 1992-2012''. Workshop Press Leeds, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or [[call-out]]s as part of the application process.

==History==
The writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Detterer, Gabriele. Ed.  ''Art Recollection: Artists' Interviews &amp; Statements in the Nineties']'. Florence: Danilo Montanari, Exit, and Zona Archives Editori, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some respects, the practice resembles the [[art manifesto]] and may derive in part from it.  However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with [[polemic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Rather, a [[contemporary art]]ist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.

In their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or "didactic") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett-Petts, W.F., and Rachel Nash. "Re-Visioning the Visual: Making Artistic Inquiry Visible." ''Rhizomes'' 18 (Winter 2008). Spec. issue on "Imaging Place".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As subject matter==
On at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, ''The Art of the Artist's Statement'',  was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, [[Chicago]], in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, ''Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works'', was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, [[Kamloops, British Columbia]]. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist’s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.

Artist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article ''International Art English,'' published in the American art journal [[Triple Canopy (online magazine)|Triple Canopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english|title=Triple Canopy – International Art English by Alix Rule &amp; David Levine|newspaper=Triple Canopy|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine &amp; Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery [[Press release|press releases]], published by [[e-flux]] since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/27/users-guide-international-art-english|title=A user's guide to artspeak|last=Beckett|first=Andy|date=2013-01-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bad Girls''''' is a 1994 American [[Western (genre)|western]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[film]] directed by [[Jonathan Kaplan]], and written by [[Ken Friedman]] and [[Yolande Turner]]. It stars [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Drew Barrymore]].

The film follows four former [[prostitution|prostitutes]] on the run following a [[justifiable homicide]] and [[prison escape]], who later encounter difficulties involving [[bank robbery]] and [[Pinkerton Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detectives.

Kaplan previously directed two of the film's stars: Masterson in ''[[Immediate Family (film)|Immediate Family]]'' (1989) and Stowe in ''[[Unlawful Entry (film)|Unlawful Entry]]'' (1992).

==Plot==
Cody, Anita, Eileen and Lily work together in a brothel. When Anita is abused by a customer, Cody kills the man.

Narrowly escaping from a lynch mob, they are pursued by Pinkerton detectives hired by the widow of the man they'd shot. A man they meet on the road, McCoy, warns them of the pursuit. 

They discuss riding to Oregon and starting a new life by taking up a claim to land inherited by Anita when her husband died of cholera. Cody offers to fund their new start from savings she has accumulated over the years. They go to the bank where Cody's savings are held. As she tries to close her account and make a withdrawal, the Pinkerton detectives catch up with her and try to arrest her. Leaving the bank manager's office, they find themselves in the middle of a bank robbery being staged by Kid Jarrett, a former lover of Cody. He helps her escape from arrest but takes her money and tells her to find him.

During the escape, Eileen is arrested. Cody decides to go after the money and Kid Jarrett, telling Anita and Lilly to wait in hiding. Anita and Lilly return to town to break Eileen out of jail. 

Cody's meeting with Kid Jarrett and Frank Jarrett does not go well. Kid Jarrett has not forgiven her for running out on him. He flogs her. Later, she is found unconscious by McCoy, who brings her to a healer in town and puts the Pinkerton detectives off her trail.

McCoy, Cody and the other three women meet up on the ranch of a farmer who'd been guarding Eileen's cell (and whom they'd tricked into releasing her). Cody plans revenge on Kid Jarrett. They foil a train robbery and steal his loot, at the cost of Lilly being abducted. In turn, they abduct Frank Jarrett, Kid's father.

Regrouping again on the ranch, Anita leaves the others, frustrated with their revenge-motivated misadventures. She goes to a lawyer in town and finds out that the claim to land is only valid in the hands of her husband - as a woman, she cannot claim the land in Oregon.

Frank Jarrett antagonizes his captors until McCoy shoots him. Cody sends away McCoy. Meanwhile, Lilly is being raped by her captors. McCoy stages a one-man rescue attempt and is captured, but Lilly escapes.

Reunited, Cody, Anita and Eileen go to rescue Lilly and meet her on the road. When she tells them that McCoy has been captured, they continue towards Kid Jarrett's hide out, and offer to trade the stolen loot for McCoy, who has been flogged and tortured. Kid agrees, then shoots McCoy as soon as the loot is handed over. He gives Cody the money he stole from her (although in close up it clearly is mid-20th century currency).

While retreating, one of Lilly's would-be rapists taunts her, triggering a shootout that results in the deaths of Kid's entire gang.

After the shootout, Eileen marries the rancher, while Lilly, Cody and Anita head west to start a new life, mentioning the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of 1896.  On the trail they overtake the Pinkerton detectives, who do not see them.

[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]]]
'''Bagism''' is a satire of prejudice, where by living in a bag a person could not be judged on their bodily appearance. Bagism was created by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize [[prejudice]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total [[communication]]: instead of focusing on outward [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], the listener would hear only the bagist's [[message]].

== Purpose and origins ==

John and Yoko introduced the idea during a well-received [[press conference]] in [[Vienna]] on 31 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1969.0331.beatles.html "John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono: Bagism Press Conference 3/31/1969"], The Beatles Ultimate Experience.&lt;/ref&gt; and explained it more thoroughly in a 14 June 1969 interview with [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/06/14/television-john-lennon-yoko-ono-david-frost-show/ "Television: John Lennon and Yoko Ono on The David Frost Show"], The Beatles' Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagism reflected the whimsical, carefree, and often [[comedy|comedic]] mood of John and Yoko's other peace efforts, such as their [[Bed-In]]s. By catching the attention of the masses with its outlandish premise, bagism presented a powerful social and [[politics|political]] message to the world. As Lennon stated, "Yoko and I are quite willing to be the world's [[clowns]]; if by doing it we do some good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iiRkfZ-UwE "John Lennon - Bagism"] Excerpt from the documentary ''Imagine: John Lennon'', (1988), YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoko said that bagism was inspired by the theme of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'', which was "One sees rightly only with the heart, the essential is invisible to the eyes."  She hoped that the bag (by hiding her and John's physical appearance) would make their essence, or the essence of their message, visible.

== The Alchemical Wedding ==

The couple had earlier appeared in a bag, at The Alchemical Wedding, an underground artists' gathering, at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in late 1968.  The event was put on by the [[Arts Lab]] and [[BIT (infoshop)]], which sought to challenge audiences to be participants rather than passive [[consumer]]s.  John and Yoko climbed into a large white bag on stage, sat cross-legged, knee-to-knee, hunkered down and closed the bag.  They moved only twice in 45 minutes, hunkering further down.  This was a strong challenge to the audience.

"Musicians played, poets ranted, and John and Yoko crept into their white sheet-like bag on the stage and stayed there out of sight for what seemed like ages. I watched a baby crawl slowly by. And that was the bag happening. All mayhem broke out when a young female member of the audience stripped off her clothes and danced in naked delight. When the police were called and attendants tried to remove her, groups of people started stripping off their clothes in solidarity. There was a retreat and a truce was worked out, and no-one was arrested. The nude girl incident, with accompanying photo, made the front pages of the London evening papers." As [[Lee Harris (South African artist)|Lee Harris]] noted later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeharris.co.uk/LeeHarris/Works/afootsol.htm Lee Harris' involvement with the Arts Lab and Alchemical Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bagism in the songs of John Lennon ==

Bagism is mentioned three times in the songs of John Lennon.  The first time is in "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]" where John refers to "eating chocolate cake in a bag", which was at the Vienna press conference, and the second is in the song "[[Come Together]]", where he sings: "He bag production".  This is a reference to Bag Productions Ltd, Lennon's public relations company, which derived its name from Bagism.  The third reference is in "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", with the line, "Everybody's talkin' about Bagism, Shagism, dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism, This-ism, That-ism, ism, ism, ism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hertzberg |first=Hendrik |date=5 July 2010 |title=Give John a Chance |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/give-john-a-chance |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |access-date=30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet following ==

A [[website]] called [http://www.bagism.com/ Bagism] was created c. 1994 by Sam Choukri, providing John Lennon and Beatles links, photographs, rare [[sound recording]] snippets and [[video]]. At one point, c. 1996, the precursor to Bagism.com, a website focused on Lennon, was sent a [[cease and desist]] request from the representatives of his estate over copyrighted John Lennon content. After an unsuccessful [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/letter-to-yoko.html appeal] to Ono and the John Lennon Estate and the [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/dear-yoko.html Dear Yoko] [[petition]] campaign, Choukri decided to focus his efforts on less legally volatile content and the website has since been a hub for [[discussion]], detailed [[discography|discographies]], letters, [[article (publishing)|article]]s, [[fan (person)|fan]] [[Work of art|artwork]] and [[poetry]], and many other types of content.

== Recent uses ==
[[Image:Liverpool John Lennon Airport-2006-09-28.jpg|thumb|150px|John Lennon Airport, September 2006]]
In 2006, [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] had the words "Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism" stickered along the front windows of the airport. This was done along with the branding of various John Lennon lyrics around the inside of the airport.

In 2010, the studio band Strawberry Walrus recorded a song entitled "Bagism" and released it on their album ''This Is Not Here''.

'''''Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco''''' is a book about the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO) of [[RJR Nabisco]], written by [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] [[Bryan Burrough]] and [[John Helyar]]. The book is based upon a series of articles written by the authors for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The book was later made into a [[made-for-TV movie]] by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], also called ''[[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|Barbarians at the Gate]]''. The book centers on [[F. Ross Johnson]], the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of RJR Nabisco, who planned to buy out the rest of the Nabisco [[shareholder]]s.

==Summary==
Those opposed to Johnson's bid for the company, [[Henry Kravis]] and his cousin [[George R. Roberts]], were among the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO). Kravis was the first person Johnson talked to about doing the LBO and feels betrayed after learning that Johnson wants to do the deal with another firm, [[American Express]]'s former [[Lehman Brothers|Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division. [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]] buyout firm also played a prominent role.

After Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences, a bidding war takes place which Johnson will eventually lose. The unfortunate side effect of the augmented buyout price to the shareholders is the creation of a worrying level of [[debt]] for the company.

The title of the book comes from a statement by Forstmann, in which he calls Kravis' money "phoney [[junk bond]] crap" and declares him and his cousin as "real people with real money," also stating that to stop raiders like Kravis: "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

==Important personalities==
*[[F. Ross Johnson]], president and CEO, RJR Nabisco
*[[Edward A. Horrigan, Jr.|Ed Horrigan]], president and chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division of RJR Nabisco

==Publishing information and reception==
In 2008, [[Harper Collins]] re-released ''Barbarians'' to mark the two-decade anniversary of the RJR deal. Media columnist Jon Friedman at [[MarketWatch]] opined on the occasion that it was "the best business book ever." Friedman spoke with the authors about the two-decade history of the book and of their ensuing careers (the two undertook no further joint projects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/barbarians-gate-authors-reflect-wall/story.aspx?guid={96E5F741-4FA2-4D8B-97F2-493F07358505}&amp;dist=msr_15 "'Barbarians at the Gate' authors reflect"] by Jon Friedman, ''MarketWatch'', 11-21-08. Retrieved 2-7-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Business reporter [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote in his book ''[[Too Big to Fail (book)|Too Big to Fail]]'' that this is his favourite business book of all time.

[[File:Bergamot Station Lofts.jpg|thumb|Bergamot, Santa Monica, California]]
'''Bergamot''' is a [[Santa Monica]] facility housing many different private [[art galleries]] and appears in most tourist guides as a primary cultural destination. Opened September 17, 1994 as '''Bergamot Station''' the campus-like complex is owned by the city of Santa Monica and presently managed by the Worthe Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bergamotstation.squarespace.com/|title=Farewell from Bergamot Station|website=Bergamot Station|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Monarda-fistulosa.jpg|thumb|Wild Bergamot still grows in clumps around the art center]]
Formerly "Bergamot Station" the site was previously a stop and car storage area from 1875 to 1953, first serving the steam-powered [[Los Angeles and Independence Railroad]] and later the [[Santa Monica Air Line (Pacific Electric)|Santa Monica Air Line]]. The station was named after [[Monarda fistulosa|Wild Bergamot (Monarda fistulosa)]], a wild flower native to North America, that once flourished in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://bergamotstation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After passenger service ceased, the line was used for light freight delivery only. Car storage was no longer needed and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] leased the land to various companies for light manufacturing. Warehouse buildings were constructed and housed a celery packing operation, then an ice-making plant, and finally, the manufacturing home base for American Appliance water heaters.

As the rail line fell into disuse and eventual abandonment in the late 1980s, the City of Santa Monica purchased the entire parcel from Southern Pacific Railroad in 1987 to prevent it from being split up and sold. At that time a future light rail service along the right of way was anticipated within 10 years, and the site would be needed as a service yard and passenger station.

===Transformation into an art gallery complex===
[[File:Bergamot Station at Night.jpg|thumb|Bergamot at night on Michigan Ave]]

American Appliance moved out in 1993, leaving a sprawling industrial complex sitting vacant.  Even under the most optimistic scenarios, plans for the light rail were years away.  The City, seeking a productive use for the site, approached Wayne Blank, developer and co-owner of the Shoshana Wayne Gallery. Blank's development expertise had already been tapped by the City of Santa Monica for an earlier project: the conversion of a vacant city-owned airport hangar into artists' studios.

Pleased with the airport project's outcome, The City asked Blank to conceive of an artistic use for the site. Blank along with acclaimed architect [[Lawrence Scarpa]] of the architecture firm Brooks + Scarpa, created a campus-like complex that retained its industrial and rudimentary look. "Blank's search for a limited partner began and ended with Tom Patchett, an art collector and TV writer who was looking for space to store and possibly exhibit his separate collections of contemporary art and Americana"&lt;ref&gt;"The Short Story of the Long History of Bergamot Station", Smart Art Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex has become so popular that the original rail intention has been usurped. When, in 2010, Phase 2 of the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] was approved, adjacent land was purchased to serve the purpose. [[26th Street/Bergamot (Los Angeles Metro station)|26th Street/Bergamot]], a stop on the new Expo Line light rail between Los Angeles and Santa Monica, located just North of the entrance of the new arts destination, was opened to the public on May 20, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, Mike (June 14, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-bergamot-station-20140616-story.html "Bergamot Station's tenants at odds over its future as Expo Line nears"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 1, 2018 the property was officially re-renamed '''26th Street Art Center''' and is managed by the Worthe Group who now refer to the facility in all marketing material as "Bergamot."

'''Båstad Church''' ({{lang-sv|Båstads kyrka}}), also known as '''St. Mary's Church''' (''Mariakyrkan''), is a medieval [[Lutheran]] church built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Located in [[Båstad]], seat of [[Skåne County]] in southern [[Sweden]], it belongs to the [[Diocese of Lund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjareslaktring.org/node/60 "Båstad"], Bjäre Släktring. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 9 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and architecture==
The church was built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 15th century. Remarkably large for its day, it consisted of a [[nave]] flanked on either side by [[aisle]]s. The hexagonal choir wall at the eastern end of the building was completed in the 1470s and is reminiscent of that in [[St. Mary's Church, Ystad|St Mary's Church]], [[Ystad]]. The brick tower was built around 1500, giving the church is present appearance.

==Interior==
The font, inscribed with runes, perpetuates the memory of a certain Per Knudsen. The wooden Madonna, bearing the infant Jesus, dates from the church's establishment. The other old Danish furnishings, including the altar, pulpit and epitaphs, were destroyed during an attack.

==Frescos==
The church walls and vaults contain [[Church frescos in Sweden|late Gothic frescos]] painted by different 15th century masters. On the chancel wall, there is a painting of the martyrdom of [[Saint Erasmus]] with two executioners opening his stomach while God leads his soul into heaven. In the nave, the east vault displays three male heads while an arch to the south aisle has vestiges of Christ as a man of sorrow. In the sacristy, there are well preserved frescos from the early 16th century  
depicting the emblems of the [[four Evangelists|Evangelists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyrkokartan.se/056126/B%C3%A5stads_kyrka "Båstads kyrka"], Kyrkokartan.se. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 9 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congress on Research in Dance''' was a professional organization for dance historians in the United States and worldwide that merged in 2017 with the [[Society of Dance History Scholars]] to form the [[Dance Studies Association]] (DSA). 

An international non-profit [[learned society]] for [[dance research]]ers, artists, performers and choreographers, CORD published the ''Dance Research Journal'' and sponsored annual conferences and awards for scholarship and contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;CORD award recipients. http://congressonresearchindance.camp7.org/pastwinners&lt;/ref&gt; The journal and awards have been absorbed into the DSA.

The society was founded in 1964 as the '''Committee on Research in Dance''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A pillar supporting research in dance for 40 years|author=Kolcio, Katja|journal=CORD Newsletter|publisher=Congress on Research in Dance|volume=XXVII|date=Spring 2007|accessdate=2008-06-08|format=Word doc|url=http://www.cordance.org/downloads/newsletter_spring_2007.doc|issue=1}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and based at [[New York University]]. It was formally incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization in 1969. The organization changed its name to Congress on Research in Dance in 1977. In 1991, it moved to the [[State University of New York College at Brockport]]. In 2007, the CORD National Office moved to the care of Prime Management Services based in Birmingham, Alabama. Membership generally includes performers, choreographers, artists and dance academics from colleges and universities.

==Publications==

The ''Dance Research Journal'' is a triannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] publishing scholarly articles, book reviews, and other reports of interest to the field of dance research, with its primary orientation being towards the historical and critical theory of dance. The journal was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of the Congress on Research in Dance until the merger in 2017. Now it is on behalf of the Dance Studies Association. The journal was established in 1968.

The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Academic ASAP]], [[Academic Search Elite]], [[Academic Search Premier]], [[Expanded Academic]], [[Humanities Index]], [[Index to Dance Periodicals]], [[International Index to Performing Arts]], and [[ProQuest]].

The '''Council of Fashion Designers of America, Inc.''' '''(CFDA)''', founded in 1962 by [[publicist]] [[Eleanor Lambert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfda.com/about/history|title=History|last=CFDA|website=CFDA|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[not-for-profit]] [[trade association]] of over 450 American [[fashion]] and accessory designers. The first president of the Council was [[Sydney Wragge]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfda.com/about/history|title=History|last=CFDA|website=CFDA|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;(till 1965). As of 2009, [[Diane von Fürstenberg]] was the group's president and [[Steven Kolb]] the CEO. The organization's stated mission is to strengthen the influence and success of American designers in the global economy.

In addition to hosting the annual CFDA Fashion Awards, the organization seeks to develop future American design talent through scholarships and support and resources in high schools, colleges, and post-graduate schools.  The CFDA also provides funds to support working designers during their careers and provides business opportunities for the membership.  Through the CFDA Foundation, it mobilizes its membership to support charitable causes.

==Collaborations==
In 2010 the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists Monique Péan, Patrik Ervell, and [[Sophie Theallet]] teamed up with [[Gap Inc.]].&lt;ref name="CFDA Runners Up of 2013"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://cfda.com/the-latest/the-winner-runners-up-of-the-2013-cfdavogue-fashion-fund |title=The Winner &amp; Runners-Up of the 2013 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund |publisher=CFDA |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 and 2013 the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winners and runners-up each created capsule collections with [[J. Crew]].

In celebration of the organization's 50th Anniversary, Target and [[Neiman Marcus]] partnered with 24 CFDA members to create a special holiday collection that was available at both retailers. Additionally, the CFDA has partnered with [[Kohl’s]] on designer collaborations such as Derek Lam for Kohl’s and most recently, Catherine Malandrino for Kohl’s.

On October 3, 2013 the CFDA and [[Google+]] launched an innovative shopping tool, titled “Shoppable Hangouts,” where users had the ability to shop Hangouts on Air (HOA). The CFDA kicked off the product launch with CFDA President Diane von Fürstenberg. [[Rachel Zoe]], Marcus Wainwright and David Neville of [[rag &amp; bone]], and [[Rebecca Minkoff]] also participated in the Shoppable Hangout experience.

==CFDA Programs==

===The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund===
The CFDA and Vogue Magazine have created an endowment for the stated purpose of funding significant financial awards to one or more designers and provide business mentoring. Award recipients are selected by a committee of industry experts.
 
The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Selection Committee annually selects three emerging fashion designers, who receive:

(1) Business mentoring from an established team of fashion industry professionals, in areas such as business planning, marketing, sourcing, production, exporting etc. and&lt;br /&gt;
(2) To encourage and enable the recipients to pursue his/her own independent design plan (one winner at $300,000 and two runners-up at $100,000 each).

===The CFDA {FASHION INCUBATOR} Program===
The CFDA {FASHION INCUBATOR} is a business development program designed to support the next generation of fashion designers in New York City. The program provides a creative professional environment with the mission of helping to grow and sustain the businesses of the 10 participating brands over the course of the two-year program. By offering low-cost design studio space, business mentoring, educational seminars, and networking opportunities, the program provides a way for participants to reach their full potential and become an integral part of the New York Fashion community. In 2010, the program partnered with New York University’s Stern School of Business to create a Masters Workshop that pairs their top MBA Students with the designers to work on business development projects.

Successful alumni of the Incubator program include [[Prabal Gurung]] and the 2013 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winners, Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne of Public School.

The 4.0 class (2016-2018) of the {FASHION INCUBATOR} includes Alexandra Alvarez of Alix, Aurora James of Brother Vellies, Charles Youssef, Daniel DuGoff of Ddugoff, Tim Joo and Dan Joo of [[Haerfest (fashion brand)|Haerfest]], Jason Alkire and Julie Alkire of [[Haus Alkire]], Ji Oh, Katie deGuzman and Michael Miller of K/ller Collection, Thaddeus O’Neil, and Molly Yestadt of Yestadt Millinery. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yotka |first=Steff |url=http://www.vogue.com/13440154/cfda-fashion-incubator-2016-2018/ |title=This Is the Next Wave of Young American Designers |publisher=Vogue |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Fashion Manufacturing Initiative===
The Fashion Manufacturing Initiative (FMI) is an investment fund to help revitalize New York City’s garment industry. The program offers matching financial grants to New York City’s fashion manufacturing production facilities.

In March 2018, the CFDA and NYCA announced that the following seven production facilities would receive a combined total of $480,000 in the fifth round of FMI grants: Atelier Amelia, Sunrise Studio, In Style USA, Mudo Fashion, New York Embroidery Studio, Season Wash, and Werkstatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sourcingjournalonline.com/cfda-nycedc-fmi-grant-fund-recipients/|title=CFDA and NYCEDC Present Fifth Round of FMI Grant Fund Recipients|last=Scarano|first=Genevieve|date=2018-03-02|work=Sourcing Journal|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion Targets Breast Cancer===
Fashion Targets Breast Cancer® (FTBC), a charitable initiative of the CFDA/CFDA Foundation, seeks to raise public awareness and funds for the [[breast cancer]] cause.

The Fashion Targets Breast Cancer name and symbol were created by [[Ralph Lauren]] and subsequently entrusted to the CFDA Foundation.  FTBC was first presented in the U.S. in the spring of 1994 during [[New York Fashion Week]], and was formally launched in September 1994 at a special White House reception hosted by then-First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]. During this initial campaign, 400,000 FTBC shirts were sold, raising $2 million to benefit the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Health at the Lombardi Cancer Center at [[Georgetown University Medical Center]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  This center was chosen as beneficiary at Ralph Lauren’s request, in memory of his friend Nina Hyde, the former fashion editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who died of [[breast cancer]] in 1990.

Since 2011, the Council has led an annual campaign to promote the initiative and partners with well known fashion icons. In 2017, Fabletics partnered with Fashion Targets Breast Cancer to produce an activewear collection. A portion of all sales for the collection would be donated to target breast cancer screening and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://stylecaster.com/kate-hudson-fabletics-breast-cancer-awareness-collection/%7C |title=Kate Hudson Launches Breast Cancer Awareness Collection with Fabletics| author=Eli Flesch| publisher=Stylecaster| access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://beta.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-wwd-kate-hudson-breast-cancer-fabletics-collection-20170927-story.html%7C |title=Kate Hudson unveils CFDA and Fabletics' Fashion Targets Breast Cancer collection| author=Marcy Medina| date=September 27, 2017| publisher=Los Angeles Times| access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, nearly $50 million has been granted to breast cancer charities worldwide from FTBC campaigns.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} CFDA Members have designed special FTBC branded or inspired merchandise, which was either sold or auctioned over the course of the campaign.

===CFDA Scholarship Program===
The Scholarship Program was created to award annual merit-based scholarship grants to students who study in a four-year, full-time college level design program. It has awarded $1,399,250 to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFDA Scholarship Program|url=http://cfda.com/programs/scholarships/cfda-scholarship-program|website=Cfda.com|publisher=Council of Fashion Designers of America|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geoffrey Beene Design Scholarship Award, the Liz Claiborne Design Scholarship Award, and the CFDA/Teen Vogue Scholarship Award in partnership with Target selected scholars from one of the CFDA’s 20 participating design schools and donated $25,000 towards tuition and educational expenses. The awards are based solely on merit and judged by a panel of industry experts.

A '''death mask''' is a likeness (typically in [[wax]] or [[plaster cast]]) of a person's face following [[death]], often made by taking a cast or impression directly from the corpse. Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of [[portrait]]s.  Such casts obviate idealised representations by revealing the actual features. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the [[Molding (process)|mold]].

The main purpose of the death mask from the [[Middle Ages]] until  the [[19th century]] was to serve  as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Almanac #2|last=WALLECHINSKY|first=Irving|last2=WALLACE|first2=Irving|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1978|isbn=0553011375|location=New York|pages=1189–1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other [[culture]]s a death mask may be a '''funeral mask''', an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[mummification]] process, such as [[Tutankhamun's mask]], and those from [[Mycenaean Greece]] such as the [[Mask of Agamemnon]].

In some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the [[effigy]] of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the [[coffin portrait]] was an alternative. [[Mourning portraits]] were also painted, showing the subject [[lying in repose]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by [[post-mortem photography]].

In the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]], the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which assassinated him in 1868.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{anchor|lifemask}}
When taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a '''life mask'''. Proponents of [[phrenology]] used both death masks and life masks for [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] purposes.

==History==

===Sculptures===
[[File:CairoEgMuseumTaaMaskMostlyPhotographed.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tutankhamun's mask]]]]

Masks of deceased persons are part of traditions in many countries. The most important process of the funeral ceremony in [[ancient Egypt]] was the mummification of the body, which, after prayers and consecration, was put into a sarcophagus enameled and decorated with gold and gems. A special element of the rite was a sculpted mask, put on the face of the deceased. This mask was believed to strengthen the spirit of the mummy and guard the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld. The best known mask is [[Tutankhamun's mask]]. Made of gold and gems, the mask conveys the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler. Such masks were not, however, made from casts of the features; rather, the [[Mummy|mummification]] process itself preserved the features of the deceased.

In 1876 the archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered in [[Mycenae]] six graves, which he was confident belonged to kings and ancient Greek heroes—[[Agamemnon]], [[Cassandra]], Evrimdon and their associates. To his surprise, the skulls were covered with gold masks. It is now thought most unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the [[Homer]]ic [[Epic poetry|epic]]s; in fact they are several centuries older.

The lifelike character of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] portrait sculptures has been attributed to the earlier Roman use of [[wax]] to preserve the features of deceased family members (the so-called ''imagines maiorum''). The wax masks were subsequently reproduced in more durable stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.W. Janson]] with Dora Jane Janson, ''History of Art: A Survey of the Major Visual Arts from the Dawn of History to the Present Day'', [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], [[Prentice-Hall]], and [[New York City|New York]], [[Harry N. Abrams]], 1962, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of masks in the [[ancestor cult]] is also attested in [[Etruria]]. Excavations of tombs in the area of the ancient city of [[Clusium]] (modern [[Chiusi]], [[Tuscany]]) have yielded a number of sheet bronze masks dating from the Etruscan Late [[Orientalising period]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8010712/_Some_considerations_on_the_function_and_meaning_of_the_Etruscan_bronze_masks_from_Chiusi_seventh_century_BC_._In_H._Duinker_E._Hopman_and_J._Steding_eds._2014._Proceedings_of_the_11th_annual_Symposium_Onderzoek_Jonge_Archeologen._Groningen_Stichting_Onderzoek_Jonge_Archeologen_pp._65-74  N. Steensma, Some considerations on the function and meaning of the Etruscan bronze "masks" from Chiusi (seventh century BC), in: H. Duinker, E. Hopman &amp; J. Steding (eds.),  ''Proceedings of the 11th annual Symposium Onderzoek Jonge Archeologen'', Groningen 2014, p. 65-74].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was thought that they were related to the Mycenaean examples, but whether they served as actual death masks cannot be proven. The most credited hypothesis holds that they were originally fixed to cinerary urns, to give them a human appearance. In Orientalising Clusium, the anthropomorphization of urns was a prevalent phenomenon that was strongly rooted in local religious beliefs.

In the late [[Middle Ages]], a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks, made of wax or plaster. These masks were not interred with the deceased. Instead, they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries, museums, and universities. Death masks were taken not only of deceased royalty and nobility ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[House of Sforza|Sforza]]), but also of eminent persons—composers, [[dramaturge]]s, military and political leaders, philosophers, poets, and scientists, such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (whose death mask was taken on the island of [[Saint Helena]]), [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] (whose death mask is preserved at [[Warwick Castle]]), [[Joseph Haydn]], [[John Keats]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Nikola Tesla]] (commissioned by his friend [[Hugo Gernsback]] and now displayed in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]]), [[Torquato Tasso]], and [[Voltaire]]. As in [[ancient Rome]], death masks were often subsequently used in making marble sculpture portraits, busts, or engravings of the deceased.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In Russia, the death mask tradition dates back to the times of [[Peter the Great]], whose death mask was taken by [[Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. Also well known are the death masks of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], and [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].  Stalin's death mask is on display at the [[Joseph Stalin Museum, Gori|Stalin Museum]] in [[Gori, Georgia]].

One of the first real [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] death masks was that of the poet [[Taras Shevchenko]], taken by [[Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathmask.kiev.ua Virtual Museum of Death Mask] URL accessed on December 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early spring of 1860 and shortly before his death in April 1865, two life masks were created of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portraits of the Presidents|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/travpres/lincs.htm|work=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
[[File:Making Death Mask Edit 4.jpg|right|thumb|Two men in the process of making a death mask, New York, c. 1908]]

Death masks were increasingly used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record variations in human [[physiognomy]]. The life mask was also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study [[Physiognomy|physiognomic]] features in famous people and notorious [[Crime|criminals]]. Masks were also used to collect data on [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] differences.

[[File:L'inconnue de la Seine (masque mortuaire).jpg|thumb|left|''[[L'Inconnue de la Seine]]'']]

Before the widespread availability of [[photography]], the facial features of [[unidentified decedent|unidentified bodie]]s were sometimes preserved by creating death masks so that relatives of the deceased could recognize them if they were seeking a missing person.

One mask, known as [[L'Inconnue de la Seine]], recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to one man's story, had been found drowned in the  Seine River at [[Paris]], [[France]] around the late 1880s. A morgue worker made a cast of her face, saying "Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved."  The cast was also compared to Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures. In the following years, copies of the mask became a fashionable fixture in Parisian Bohemian society.

The face of [[Resusci Anne]], the world's first [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training [[mannequin]], introduced in 1960, was modeled after ''L'Inconnue de la Seine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laerdal.com/docid/1117082/The-Girl-from-the-River-Seine Laerdal company website: The Girl from the River Seine] URL accessed on January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sca-aware.org/library/history/archer-gordon-story-of-resusci-anne.pdf A Death Mask to Help Save Lives] Archer Gordon, M.D., PH.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3759">[[Image:Deesis.jpg|thumb|Icon of the Deesis [[St. Catherine's Monastery]] Sinai, 12th century)]]
In [[Byzantine art]], and later [[Eastern Orthodox]] art generally, the '''Deësis''' or '''Deisis''' ({{lang-el|δέησις}}, "prayer" or "supplication"), is a traditional [[icon]]ic representation of [[Christ in Majesty]] or [[Christ Pantocrator]]: enthroned, carrying a book, and flanked by the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and [[St. John the Baptist]], and sometimes other saints and angels.  Mary and John, and any other figures, are shown facing towards Christ with their hands raised in [[supplication]] on behalf of humanity.  

In early examples, it was often placed on the [[templon]] beam in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches or above doors, though it also appears on [[icons]] and devotional ivories.

After the development of the full [[iconostasis]] screen there was room for a larger "Deesis row" or "Great Deesis" of full-length figures, and the number of figures expanded, in both Byzantium and Russia.  Usually this row is above the level of the doors, and below the row depicting the [[Twelve Great Feasts]], sometimes the Deesis is above the Feasts.  The central Christ is therefore above the main door in the screen.  Soon seven figures, usually one to a panel, were standard, in order of proximity to Christ in the centre: on the left (Christ's right) Mary, the [[Archangel Michael]] and [[Saint Peter]], and on the right John the Baptist, the [[Archangel Gabriel]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]].  Especially in Russian examples, a number of saints of local significance are often included behind these, as space allows.  [[Andrey Rublev]]'s row for the Cathedral of the Dormition in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] were 3.14 metres (over ten feet) high. &lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988-1988''; p.110-8; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Greek tradition the Apostles are more likely to occupy extra panels.

The presence of Mary and John, and other figures, is one of the differences with the Western ''Christ in Majesty'', where the [[Four Evangelists]] and/or their symbols are more commonly included around Christ.  The Deesis composition is also commonly found in the West, especially those parts of Italy under Byzantine influence, but also the rest of Europe.  It often forms part of a scene of the [[Last Judgement]].  The use of the image declined slowly throughout the Middle Ages, and it is never as common as the Western forms of Christ in Majesty.

In depictions of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] Christ on the cross is also very often flanked by the Virgin standing on one side, but [[Saint John the Evangelist]] on the other, not John the Baptist.

The '''Fresh Fruit Festival''' is a publicly supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id={70BDAACC-A2DD-4E6D-8706-1578D5B2002B}|title=Charities Division NY State|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, New York summer arts festival presented by All Out Arts, and featuring the work of [[LGBTQ]] artists as the primary expression of the All Out Arts mission of "Fighting prejudice and homophobia through the arts."  It presents a multi-week main-stage presentation every July, and ancillary events year-round. 

==History==

The Festival was founded by Carol Polcovar in 2002 as a merger of New Village Playwrights and New Village Productions reacted to a current reluctance on the part of major venues to present a truly representative array of LGBT arts. Originally sponsored by All Out Arts, Inc., a 501(c)(3) NY State non-profit since 1991, it shortly became a fully owned D.B.A. of All Out Arts. The Festival includes a wide range of plays, visual arts, dance, and film presentations. Along with the [[Hot! Festival]], it is among the most prominent LGBT-themed festivals in the New York artistic community. Carol Polcovar served as Founding Artistic Director of the festival for its first decade, and upon retirement in 2013 accepted an "Outstanding Achievement" Award for the Fresh Fruit Festival's mission from the Manhattan Borough President's Office.&lt;ref&gt;"I honor your commitment to the arts as a profoundly effective weapon against all forms of prejudice." -May 15, 2013- Gale A. Brewer, Borough President of Manhattan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancillary programs==

The Festival presented the first of several "OUTmusic" programs in New York City, consisting entirely of vocalists, musicians, and composers who were Lesbian, Gay, Bi, or Transgendered. As  Outmusic became an organization, All Out Arts served as their fiscal conduit and aided their becoming a unique organization. Outmusic is now a national foundation, sponsoring National Outmusic Awards since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outmusicawards.com/|title=Outmusic Awards The Biggest Night In LGBT Music &amp; Entertainment|website=Outmusic Awards The Biggest Night In LGBT Music &amp; Entertainment|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Festival presented the first event solely dedicated to and entirely by LGBT Native Americans. Native American elder Kent Lebsock presided over the opening convocation, and the event included members of the Cherokee, Mohawk, Chikasaw, Navajo, Creek , Lakota, Kumeyaay and Cree tribes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tafoya|first1=Patrick|title=Roger Kuhn: A Two-Spirit Evening Proves Two Is Better Than One|journal=Talking Stick - Native Arts Quarterly|date=October 2006|issue=9.4 Oct/Nov/Dec 2006|url=http://amerinda.org/talkingstick/9-4/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival produces an annual winter OUT-wright Program, which facilitates developmental readings by LGBT authors, underwriting the expense of such events, as well as presenting lecture-demonstrations and public panels featuring published LGBT authors and poets.

'''Friedrich Horst Winkler''' (5 March 1888 - 23 February 1965)&lt;ref name=kalliope&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler, Friedrich (1888-1965)|url=http://kalliope.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/de/eac?eac.id=118769340|website=Kalliope|publisher=Staatsbibliothek Berlin|accessdate=17 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German art historian specialised in German art, especially the works of [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] from the 15th and 16th century.

==Biography==
Friedrich Winkler was born at his family's farm in Prehna, a hamlet of [[Lumpzig]], Germany, in 1888.&lt;ref name="DAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistorians.info/winklerf|title=Winkler, Friedrich|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary of Art Historians|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied art history at the [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of Berlin]], and the [[University of Freiburg]], where he studied under [[Wilhelm Vöge]]. His [[thesis]] ''Der [[Robert Campin|Meister von Flemalle]] und [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'', written in 1912, was published in 1913.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

He then started working as the editor of the ''[[Thieme-Becker|Lexikon der bildenden Künstler]]'' by [[Ulrich Thieme]] and [[Felix Becker (art historian)|Felix Becker]], for which he wrote 34 entries. He also worked as a volunteer at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], but then joined the army during [[World War I]]. He left the army in 1915 to become the director of the [[Kunstbibliothek Berlin]]. he wrote a work on Early Netherlandish [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], and in 1924 reworked ''Die Altniederländisch Malerei von 1400-1600'', originally written by [[Max Jacob Friedländer]]. In 1925 appeared ''Die Flämische Buchmalerei'', about Flemish miniature painting. In this period he married Hermina Christina Schützinger.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

Winkler then started working on the ''[[Catalogue raisonné]]'' of the drawings by [[Albrecht Dürer]], which was started by [[Friedrich Lippmann]] (1838-1903). Winkler wrote the final two volumes of the catalog and a book about Dûrer, which were published in the late 1920s. In 1933 he succeeded the deceased [[Elfried Bock]] as Keeper of the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]. Between 1936 and 1939 he published a new catalogue of the drawings of Dürer in 4 volumes.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

In 1942 he published a work on the drawings of [[Hans von Kulmbach]] and [[Hans Leonhard Schäufelein]], both pupils of Dürer. In 1947 he became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and in 1951 he switched to Western Germany and the [[Free University of Berlin]], until he retired in 1957. That year he wrote ''Leben und Werke'', a biography of Dürer. After another work on Hans von Kulmbach, he published his final major work in 1964, ''Das Werk des [[Hugo van der Goes]]''.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt; In 1950 he was made a corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt;

A heart attack late in 1964 led to his death in February 1965.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

The '''International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam''' (IABR) is a bi-annual international event bringing together international knowledge and experience in various design disciplines (architecture, urban planning and landscape architecture), and presenting this knowledge and experience to a broader audience.

Unlike other events such as the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]], the IABR is a thematically designed research biennal; each edition addresses a pressing issue, from the perspective of current (Dutch) practices within an international context, and always with a focus on the future of the city. 

The IABR implements its agenda by means of international research projects, exhibitions, master classes, workshops, conferences, lectures, debates, essays, a website, blogs, a catalogue, book, brochures, film, DVD, etc. Since the fourth edition, in 2009, the IABR has increasingly combined its research projects with concrete urban planning assignments. Particularly in the cities of Rotterdam, Istanbul and São Paulo, the biennale is actively  involved in the actual development of the city.

The 7th edition of the IABR, THE NEXT ECONOMY–, opens in April 2016.

The '''Izad Khast Castle''' is located in [[Izadkhast]] in the [[Fars Province]], central [[Iran]]. The castle was built during the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224 to 651 AD)&lt;ref name="a5"&gt;{{cite web |title=Izadkhast Fortress |url=http://historicaliran.blogspot.com/2009/11/izadkhast-fortress.html |website=HISTORICAL IRANIAN SITES AND PEOPLE |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and functioned as fortified walled city on the ancient [[Silk Road]] that ran through central Iran. Izadkhast was the first castle in the world made from adobe.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; And it is the second largest adobe building in the world after [[Arg-e Bam]].&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The castle is built on a high bedrock overlooking the Izadkhast valley. Inside the castle walls are many narrow alleyways and passages criss-crossing through centuries old tiny houses and buildings.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Izad Khast Castle – Abadeh |url=https://travital.com/attraction/izad-khast-castle-abadeh/ |website=travital.com |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle and surrounding [[Complex of Izadkhast|Izadkhast complex]] has been nominated to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on August 9, 2007 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref name="unescopage"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5205/ The Complex of Izadkhast - UNESCO World Heritage Centre] Accessed 2018-09-23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Harold f Weston - Iran16.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1920s artwork of Izadkhvast Castle]]The Izad-khast castle is located on the ancient [[Silk Road]] between [[Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan]]. The site is in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by a desert land. But a high singular bedrock overlooking a valley was an ideal location for the development of a fortified desert city in the middle of nowhere.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Izadkhvast castle is built on this singular bedrock that juts out to the Izadkhast valley. The valley around it functions as a natural deep trench.  Castle fortification walls have been built around the bedrock, tall and almost  perpendicular, ranging from 6 to 15 meters on three sides. On the fourth and shorter side of the bedrock, a 30 meter (100 feet) long trench had been dug. The trench is 4 meters across and 4 meters deep. Access to the castle was over the trench, through a small bridge and a gate.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The entrance of the big castle in Izad Khast - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Entrance of the big castle over the trench.]]The site's natural topography and added fortifications made the castle one of the most unattainable buildings of the ancient times for robbers and enemies.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the valley below the castle bedrock are rocky fields, with a barren plateau behind. The [[Izadkhast Caravanserai|Izadkhast caravanserai]] roadside inn stands alone in this valley, in the middle of a rocky field.&lt;ref name="a4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Caravanserai as cultural crossroads along the Silk Roads: Iran’s Izadkhast |url=https://www.chasingtheunexpected.com/silk-road-iran-caravanserai/ |website=chasingtheunexpected.com |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The history of the castle complex dates back to the pre-Islamic era of Iran. Izad-Khast is a [[Sassanid]] castle, built during the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224 to 651 AD) which ruled [[Persia]] (Iran) and many parts of the surrounding countries.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was then used, added and improved on until [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] era (1794 to 1925). This has left works inside the castle belonging to different periods from  [[Sassanids]] to [[Qajar_dynasty|Qajars]] with different architectural styles.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire temple of Izad Khast Castle from the Sassanid era was turned into a [[mosque]] after the advent of [[Islam]] to Iran.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle and complex is now completely abandon. However until the turn of the millennium there were still people living in the old quarters of Izadkhast. Floods in recent years destroyed many homes and forced people to move from this isolated, ancient desert citadel.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Architecture ==
[[File:Izadkhast caravanserai - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of [[Izadkhast Caravanserai]] from castle.]]In location and form of construction the castle display unique characteristics. However the material wise its comparable to the [[Citadel of Bam]], [[Rayen Castle|Rayen]] and other sites nearby in Yazd and Kerman provinces. The architecture of Izadkhast castle is very similar to the more feted [[Citadel of Bam]]. The Izad-Khast castle like the Citadel of Bam is a sand construction, made of [[adobe]].&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The castle is a [[Sassanid]] (224 to 651 AD) structure,&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the interior has seen modifications and new structures added later on. Structures like a mosque and a bathroom are later additions.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the homes in the castle interior are built from wood and mud. Size limitations of the bedrock led to an agglomeration of smaller rooms and increase of floors. Some of the buildings inside the castle rose as high as five storeys. It is impressive in itself but becomes a remarkable architectural achievement considering the circumstances of its time.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Izadkhast Caravanserai]] was built during the [[Safavid Dynasty]] era (1502 - 1736).&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Izadkhvast ruins 02.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Crumbling ruins of the old castle town]]Many parts of the Izadkhast castle are crumbling due to erosion and flooding. Many homes even beside the castle front gate have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The castle is also in danger from treasure hunters and vandalism. Inside the walled city, there are signs of damage from treasure hunters and graffiti on the walls.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine Anne "Kitty" Forman''' (née '''Sigurdson''') is a [[fictional character]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network's]] ''[[That '70s Show]]'', portrayed by comic actress [[Debra Jo Rupp]]. A nurse, she has taken breaks from her career when it was economically practical, to nurture her family.

Nurturing but enabling, she has a very recognizable laugh whenever she is nervous about anything (which is often), a fondness for square dancing, and an even greater fondness for liquor of almost all kinds (wine, kahlua, bourbon, mai tais, margaritas, etc.) She puts her family first and tries to smooth over the many conflicts within her household, although her efforts often fail. She is also an unofficial foster mother to the entire group.

==About Kitty Forman==
Kitty is Eric and Laurie Forman's mother and the wife of [[Red Forman]]: a cheerful, sunny, sweet-natured typical housewife with a much happier, gentler personality as opposed to that displayed by her ill-tempered, wisecracking husband, Red. She almost always treats those around her sweetly and kindly and shows far more respect for the teenagers than Red does. She cooks a great deal and often uses food to encourage and cheer people up.

She has occasionally been provoked into using profanity strong enough to be censored out, albeit otherwise she seldom raises her voice to other people. She smoked frequently for a period of time before deciding to quit the habit, although when stressed she has been shown to relapse, even taking a cigarette from one of the teenagers when desperate, due to an unexpected visit from her mother-in-law, who treats her shabbily.

==Her parents==
Kitty's parents generally generate stress for both Kitty and Red, particularly her rather cold, unaffectionate, hypercritical mother, Bea (played by [[Betty White]]). Kitty's genial but rather hapless father, Burt (played by [[Tom Poston]]), evokes more affection. Burt makes a terrible financial investment in an ostrich farm (located next to a coyote farm) which costs the Sigurdsons their home, leaving them dependent on the Formans. He collapses outside the house and dies soon afterward, the only occasion on which Bea shows emotion, albeit privately until Kitty finds her.

==Relationship with the kids==
Unlike Red, Kitty enjoys having young people around her house. In regards to her children, she clearly favors Eric. She sees Laurie's true colors (unlike Red, who favors Laurie and browbeats Eric) and once said she loves her daughter "because I have to". She sometimes tries to get through to Laurie, almost always without success.

Upon learning Eric has lost his virginity (episode "The Parents Find Out") she stays in bed, depressed and angry at Donna, only leaving bed when Eric reminds her that he needs Kitty to protect him from Red. For a time, she is sad that her children are growing up and expresses a desire for another baby, episode "[[List of That 70's Show episodes|Baby Fever]]", a feeling her husband does not share.

Kitty resolves her sadness over not being able to have another child when Red reminded her of grandchildren. When Eric and Donna announce that they are moving to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] at the end of season five, Kitty suffers a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by Red's support of the plan. Later, when Eric plans to go to [[Africa]] in season seven, Kitty tries to sabotage his efforts by withholding food and information on [[immunization]]s. After he leaves at the start of season eight, Kitty briefly tries [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].
 
Kitty is fond of Hyde, whom they take in after his mother abandons him, leaving him nowhere to go. In the episode "[[Kitty's Birthday (Is That Today!?)]]", Hyde is the only one who remembers her birthday, and in the episode "[[List of That 70's Show episodes|Jackie Bags Hyde]]", Kitty is the one who helps Hyde realize he likes Jackie. Kitty treats Hyde as a second son even after he moves out of the Forman basement. In the series finale, she referred to him as "my second son". 
 
Kitty treats Eric's other friends [[Michael Kelso|Kelso]], [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] and [[Jackie Burkhart|Jackie]] as her own children as well; she looks out for them and helps them out on numerous occasions throughout the series. For example, she taught the prenatal class Kelso and Brooke take before Betsy's birth, she attempts to teach Jackie how to bake on two occasions, and she behaves as a mother to Fez, who hasn't seen his real parents since emigrating to the United States.

Being a nurse and a maternal figure, she is the one who treats the teenagers whenever they get physically injured (which happens quite often), especially Kelso. Kitty plays an active role in all the group's private lives; for example, she is the one who orchestrated the talk between Jackie and her mother Pam (played by [[Brooke Shields]]) in season six. Kitty seems to dislike anyone who questions her values, telling Jackie to "shut your dirty little mouth" when she references Kitty's frequent drinking; and when Kelso asks if she'd ever smoked, she stared at him and Red makes him leave.

Despite being a motherly figure to all of the teens, Kelso and Fez seem to have some sexual attraction towards her. Fez admits this to Charlie Richardson after he sees Kitty naked accidentally, asking what she looked like and saying, "And I'm only asking this because I find Miss Kitty attractive in a sexual way." Also, after Kelso has a break up with Hyde's sister, Angie, he tells Eric, "I need a hug from your mom." Eric concludes his conversation with Hyde, leaving to "go pull Kelso off my mother". Also, Hyde, before his (technically not legal) adoption made him Kitty's son, demonstrated some attraction to Kitty, such as when she was teaching him dancing, he greatly enjoyed placing his hand in the small of her back, almost sexually. As part of the plot of that episode, Bob sees them and assumes they are having an affair.

In season eight, with Eric gone, she seemingly replaces him with Fez. Fez begins dating a friend of hers and when she finds out, she snaps and demands he break it off, to which he replies, "You can't tell me what to do. You're not my mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Good Company|episodelink=That '70s Show (season 8)#ep186|series=That '70s Show|serieslink=That '70s Show|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|date=January 12, 2006|season=8|number=8|time=12:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitty takes great offense to this and storms off and makes herself a blender full of alcohol. Donna and Jackie help Fez realize that Kitty has been the closest thing he has to a mother and she thinks of Fez as her own son. Fez makes up with Kitty afterward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22171">The '''100 Books of the Century''' ({{lang-fr|Les cent livres du siècle}}) is a list of the one hundred best books of the 20th century, according to a poll conducted in the spring of 1999 by the French retailer [[Fnac]] and the Paris newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voters responded to the question, "Which books have remained in your memory?" (''Quels livres sont restés dans votre mémoire ?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527083227/http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=Écrivains et choix sentimentaux |trans-title=Authors and sentimental choices |first=Josyane |last=Savigneau |author-link=Josyane Savigneau |newspaper=Le Monde |language=French |date=15 October 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the [[Asterix the Gaul |Asterix]] comic book. The list includes many [[French novels]] because of the demographics of the surveyed group. However, similar lists by English language sources include US and UK authors only (for example, the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] published in 1998, with two lists, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded).

'''mTropolis''' (pronounced "metropolis") was an [[open-architecture]] multimedia programming application aimed at enabling rapid development of [[multimedia]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823023742/http://www.cbd-hq.com/articles/2000/000501gh_mtropolis.asp mTropolis, the Greatest CBD Tool that Never Was] by Glen Hunter, Mojo Productions Inc. (2000, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by mFactory (pronounced "em-factory") and introduced in 1995. It introduced [[object-oriented]] concepts such as reusable objects, modifiers and behaviors into the multimedia authoring space dominated by [[Macromedia]]'s Director software. mTropolis was bought in 1997 by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]], which moved development from [[Burlingame, California]] to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and then [[End-of-life (product)|cancelled the product]] one year later. Despite efforts by its fervent users to attempt to save their investment and beloved tool, negotiations and even a possible purchase offer never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsay |first=Greg |title=The software that refused to die |url=http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |accessdate=2016-06-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000503164742/http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |archivedate=May 3, 2000|publisher=[[salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

mTropolis (pronounced "metropolis") competed in the [[Interactive media|interactive]] multimedia product space dominated in the 1990s by [[Adobe Director|Macromedia Director]]. The software's maker, mFactory (pronounced "em-factory"), founded in 1992, variously positioned mTropolis as an alternative and as an adjunct to Director.

mTropolis was bought by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] in 1997. The use of behaviors in mTropolis spurred [[Macromedia]] on to introduce behaviors in Director 6.0.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was there when Seery, Shepherd, meself and probably Greggy went over to the Mtrop user meetings.  We straight out stole [behaviors] from  
them.

- ''Alex Zavatone (ex Macromedia) on the Direct-L Mailing List, Tue, 9 Sep 2008''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While multimedia CD-ROM authoring has largely been rendered irrelevant by online content distribution, mTropolis remains an interesting study in application design, and held a loyal following for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Paradigm==

The development environment was very different from the other tools around at the time - [[Apple Computer]]'s [[HyperCard]] and others had a card based metaphor, and [[Macromedia Director]] had a film metaphor (the content area is called The Stage, the time line The Score, an assets library named The Cast, etc.). In mTropolis there were sections, subsections, and scenes. Assets would be placed onto the scene, and then combinations of behaviors and modifiers would be dragged onto the assets.

Powerful interaction and animation could be created by making different modifiers send messages to each other, allowing a user to create something impressive fairly quickly, without any typing. There was a simple programming language, accessed via a Miniscript modifier, but most of the programming was achieved by attaching standard behaviors and modifiers, and making selections within the modifier pop-up menus.

==Technical Issues==

According to [[Starship Titanic]] author [[Douglas Adams]], his team had originally selected mTropolis 1.0 for its development platform but it had to be abandoned for unspecified technical insufficiencies in favor of an in-house tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Douglas | title = Why isn't Starship Titanic on the Macintosh? | url=http://www.starshiptitanic.com/game/mac.html | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miniscript Limitations===

One criticism of the tool was that the integrated programming language, Miniscript, was lacking key features necessary for common tasks. Because mTropolis was conceived around a [[visual programming language|visual programming]] metaphor, mFactory engineers intentionally omitted [[control flow|control constructs]] such as [[conditional loop]]s. To remedy such limitations, the third-party developer AX Logic produced the commercially-available Alien Studio modifier as a drop-in replacement for Miniscript.

===File Format===

The advent in version 1.1 of the mTropolis browser plug-in for [[Netscape Navigator]], dubbed ''mPire,'' exposed a core architectural shortcoming. The binary file format was not cross-platform; in order to make a mTropolis element available for embedding on a web page, the author was required to save a Macintosh version and a separate Windows version. Hence the web server had to store redundant copies of the same content, consuming disk space and necessitating the use of loader pages to serve the file appropriate for the end user's operating system.

===Macintosh-Only Authoring===

While playback engines existed for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, the mTropolis authoring system itself only ran on the Mac.

==Release history==
===mTropolis 1.0===

January 1995: Released at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld San Francisco]]. Retail price $4,495.

===mTropolis 1.1===

May 1996: Added support for [[QuickTime VR]] 1.0. Retail price $1,195.

October 1996: mFactory releases beta 1 of the mPire browser plug-in.

===mTropolis 2.0===

March 1997: mFactory announces pre-order sales availability for version 2.0, due to ship in "the second half of May." Retail price $995.

May 1997: Quark, Inc. purchases mFactory.

March 1998: Quark announces that v2.0 would be furnished free-of-charge to registered mTropolis v1 customers, but that the product will not be made available for general purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Landwehr | first = Rebecca | title = mFactory shut down by Quark | url=http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/1998/03/30/story5.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | date=1998-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles Created with mTropolis==

Due to the way the mTropolis Player was separate from developer content, by viewing the files, it is easy to tell if a title was developed with mTropolis. A few [[CD-ROM]]s were created using mTropolis, including the [[BAFTA]] award winning [[MindGym]], [[Scott Kim]]'s [[Obsidian (1997 video game)|Obsidian]], A Sharp's [[King of Dragon Pass]], the [[Muppets]] Treasure Island, Voyager's Fun With Architecture and The Magic World of [[Beatrix Potter]].

I did the shot to his satisfaction. But in doing so I hurt my toes. But I did not want to show it to him. But after a few minutes the blood was oozing from the wound. KB sir saw it and asked me immediately to attend to it".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/15/stories/2005091503060200.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his work appeared under the [[pen name]] "Mart Dellon."

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story| title=Superhero summer: Behind 'Green Lantern' and the rest, an American story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623172041/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story|archivedate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no|first=Gloria|last= Goodale|date= June 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | page= [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story/(page)/2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/nodell_martin.htm Martin Nodell] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. This source says Nodell also attended the "Chicago Academy of Art", but no school of that name exists, and the [[Chicago Academy for the Arts]] was not founded until 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1930s, where he attended [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=lam /&gt;

===National Comics Publications===
Nodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for [[Sheldon Mayer]], an editor at [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that ultimately merged to form [[National Comics Publications]] (present-day [[DC Comics]]). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street [[Subway (rail)|subway]] station in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]]tic [[Ring cycle]]&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; as well as [[Chinese folklore]] and [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; to create the hero.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionisio |first=Joseph |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zBx0HteF?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070205153908/http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11,0,3651663.story |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |title=Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell, 91 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11%2C0%2C3651663.story |deadurl=yes |df= }} Additional, June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Nodell himself described in 2000:
{{quote|I picked out the name from the train man on the tracks who was waving a lantern, going from red to green.... Green meant go and I decided that was it. Then I needed a colorful and interesting costume. I was interested in Greek mythology and so the costume took on elements of that. It just all fell into place. When I sent it in, I waited into the second week before I heard the word to come in. I was ushered into [[Max Gaines|Mr. [Max] Gaines]] office, publisher, and after sitting a long time and flipping through the pages of my presentation, he announced, 'We like it!' And then, 'Get to work!' I did the first five pages of an eight page story, and then they called in Bill Finger to help. We worked on it for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Nodell in {{cite web| last=Black| first= Bill| url= http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |title=An Interview with Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell| publisher= AC Comics|year= 2000| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5zBwS4Oy9?url=http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |archivedate= June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by [[Bill Finger]], appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least ''[[All Star Comics]]''&lt;!--sp OK with no hyphen--&gt; #2 (Fall 1940).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/martin%20nodell/sort/chrono/ Martin Nodell] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, "Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in ''All-American'' and ''All Star'' until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including [[Howard Purcell]], [[Irwin Hasen]], and [[Alex Toth]].

===Timely Comics===
[[Image:MarvelTales93.jpg|left|thumb|''Marvel Tales'' #93 (Aug. 1949). Cover art by Nodell.&lt;!--per [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=7756 this page] at the Grand Comics Database--&gt;]]
Nodell left All-American in 1947 and joined [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s–40s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]), where he drew postwar stories of [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]]. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of ''[[Marvel Tales]]'', Timely's [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics revamp of the company's flagship series ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented ''Captain America's Weird Tales''.

===Post-1950s career===
In 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the [[Leo Burnett Agency]] in Chicago as an [[art director]]. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running [[flour]]-company mascot the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionisio, 2000. Sidebar [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/lantern-s-light-celebrity-fans-flock-to-the-hip-dc-comics-superhero-but-he-still-can-t-get-a-movie-gig-1.477749 "Ring Power vs. Flour Power"].&lt;/ref&gt;

His only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story "The Glistening Death" in the [[Avon Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''City of the Living Dead'' (1952), reprinted two decades later in the [[Skywald]] horror-comics magazine ''Psycho'' #1 (Jan. 1971); and "Master of the Dead" in Avon's ''Eerie'' (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's ''Nightmare'' #1 (Dec. 1970).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in ''[[Super Friends|Super Friends Special]]'' #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age [[Harlequin (comics)#Molly Mayne|Harlequin]] in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'' #10 (Dec. 1985).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age [[Alan Scott]] Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/50454/ ''Green Lantern'' DC, 1990 Series) #19] at Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and [[Superman]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1 (Dec. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/58075/ ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database. Note: The [http://www.comics.org/issue/91581/ GCD also lists] Nodell among three [[pencilers]] who contributed to the single [[Hal Jordan]] Green Lantern figure on the cover of the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Green Lantern Gallery'' #1 (1996), but this cover is signed only by penciler [[Gil Kane]] and [[inker]] [[Kevin Nowlan]].&lt;/ref&gt; At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page [[Harlan Ellison]] adaptation "Gnomebody", scripted by [[John Ostrander]] and Ellison and inked by [[Jed Hotchkiss]], in [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly'' #1 (Aug. 1996).

===Personal life===
Nodell met his future wife, Carrie, at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in September 1940.&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB9&gt;Dionisio, 2000.

'''''Mise-en-scène''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz.ɑ̃.sɛn}} "placing on stage") is an expression used to describe the [[design]] aspect of a [[theatre]] or [[film]] production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "[[storytelling|telling a story]]"—both in [[visual arts|visually artful ways]] through [[storyboarding]], [[cinematography]] and [[stage design]], and in [[narrative|poetically artful ways]] through [[film direction|direction]]. It is also commonly used to refer to single scenes within the film to represent the film. ''Mise-en-scène'' has been called [[film criticism]]'s "grand undefined term".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henderson, "The Long Take," in ''Movies and Methods: An Anthology'', ed. Bill Nichols (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition in film studies==

When applied to the cinema, ''mise-en-scène'' refers to everything that appears before the [[camera]] and its arrangement—[[composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], [[actor]]s, costumes, and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bordwell, David |author2=Thompson, Kristin | title=Film Art: An Introduction, 7th ed. | location=New York | publisher=McGraw–Hill  | year=2003 | isbn=0-07-248455-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "mise-en-scène", along with the cinematography and editing of a film, influence the [[verisimilitude]] or believability of a film in the eyes of its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Joanne. "Film tourism – Evolution, progress and prospects." Tourism [[Management]] (October 2012), 33 (5), pp. 1007–1029&lt;/ref&gt; The various elements of design help express a film's vision by generating a sense of time and space, as well as setting a mood, and sometimes suggesting a character's state of mind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Barsam, Richard Meran., and Dave Monahan. Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Mise-en-scène" also includes the composition, which consists of the positioning and movement of actors, as well as objects, in the shot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These are all the areas overseen by the [[Theatre director|director]]. One of the most important people that collaborates with the director is the [[production designer]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These two work closely to perfect all of the aspects of the "mise-en-scène" a considerable amount of time before the actual photography even begins.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"&gt;Pramaggiore, Maria, and Tom Wallis. Film: A Critical Introduction. Boston: Laurence King, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The production designer is generally responsible for the general look of the movie, leading various departments that are in charge of individual sets, locations, props, and costumes, among other things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Andre Bazin]], a well-known [[French people|French]] [[film critic]] and [[film theorist]], describes the mise-en-scene [[aesthetic]] as emphasizing choreographed movement within the scene rather than through editing.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

Because of its relationship to shot blocking, ''mise-en-scène'' is also a term sometimes used among professional [[screenwriters]] to indicate descriptive (action) paragraphs between the dialog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgar-Hunt|first=Robert, John Marland and James Richards|title=Basics Film-Making: Screenwriting|year=2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|location=Lausanne|isbn=2-940373-89-2|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv-GsqMLs2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key aspects==

*;[[Scenic design|Set design]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set Design and Locations|url=https://film110.pbworks.com/w/page/12610287/Set%20Design%20and%20Locations|work=film110|publisher=PBworks|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: An important element of "putting in the scene" is set design—the setting of a scene and the objects (props) visible in a scene. Set design can be used to amplify character emotion or the dominant mood, which has physical, social, psychological, emotional, economic and cultural significance in film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the most important decisions made by the [[production designer]] and director is deciding whether to shoot on location or on set. The main distinction between the two is that décor and props must be taken into consideration when shooting on set. However, shooting on set is more commonly done than shooting on location as a result of it proving to be more cost effective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  
*;[[Cinematography#Lighting|Lighting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting|url=https://film110.pbworks.com/w/page/12610256/Lighting|work=film101|publisher=PBworks|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The intensity, direction, and quality of lighting can influence an audience's understanding of characters, actions, themes and mood.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt; Light (and shade) can emphasize texture, shape, distance, mood, time of day or night, season, glamour; it affects the way colors are rendered, both in terms of hue and depth, and can focus attention on particular elements of the composition. Highlights, for example, call attention to shapes and textures, while shadows often conceal things, creating a sense of mystery or fear.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For this reason, lighting must be thoroughly planned in advance to ensure its desired effect on an audience. [[Cinematographer]]s are a large part of this process, as they coordinate the camera and the lighting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*;[[Space]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 2: Mise-en-scene|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm|work=Film Studies Program|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The representation of space affects the reading of a film. Depth, proximity, size and proportions of the places and objects in a film can be manipulated through camera placement and lenses, lighting, set design, effectively determining mood or relationships between elements in the story world.
*;[[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]]&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;
: The organization of objects, actors and space within the frame. One of the most important concepts with the regard to the [[Digital compositing|composition]] of a film is maintaining a balance of symmetry. This refers to having an equal distribution of light, colour, and objects and/or figures in a shot. Unbalanced composition can be used to emphasize certain elements of a film that the director wishes to be given particular attention to. This tool works because audiences are more inclined to pay attention to something off balance, as it may seem abnormal. Where the director places a character can also vary depending on the importance of the role.

: There is enormous historical and cultural variation in performance styles in the cinema. In the early years of cinema, stage acting and film acting were difficult to differentiate, as most film actors had previously been stage actors and therefore knew no other method of acting.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;  Eventually, early melodramatic styles, clearly indebted to the 19th century theater, gave way in Western cinema to a relatively naturalistic style. This more naturalistic style of acting is largely influenced by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s theory of [[method acting]], which involves the actor fully immersing themselves in their character.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

'''Molecular symmetry''' in [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry.  Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's [[chemical property|chemical properties]], such as its [[molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]]. Many university level textbooks on [[physical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[inorganic chemistry]] devote a chapter to symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Chemistry'', Third Edition John P. Lowe, Kirk Peterson {{ISBN|0-12-457551-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach'' by Donald A. McQuarrie, John D.

The predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry is [[group theory]]. Symmetry is useful in the study of [[molecular orbital]]s, with applications such as the [[Hückel method]], [[ligand field theory]], and the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rule]]s. Another framework on a larger scale is the use of [[crystal system]]s to describe [[crystallography|crystallographic]] symmetry in bulk materials.  
 
Many techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including [[X-ray crystallography]] and various forms of [[spectroscopy]]. [[Spectroscopic notation]] is based on symmetry considerations.

=== Elements ===
The point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of [[symmetry element]]. 
{{anchor|axis}}
* '''Symmetry axis''': an axis around which a [[rotation]] by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt; results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original.  This is also called an ''n''-fold '''rotational axis''' and abbreviated C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[water]] and the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[ammonia]]. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest ''n'' is called the '''principal axis''', and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].
* '''Plane of symmetry''': a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated.  This is also called a [[mirror plane]] and abbreviated [[Sigma|σ]] (sigma = Greek "s", from the German 'Spiegel' meaning mirror).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/goss/symmetry/CharacterTables.html |title=Symmetry Operations and Character Tables  |last= |first= |date=2001 |website=University of Exeter |access-date=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one [[perpendicular]] to it. A symmetry plane [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] with the principal axis is dubbed ''vertical'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it ''horizontal'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed [[Dihedral angle|dihedral]] (σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). A symmetry plane can also be identified by its Cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).
* '''Center of symmetry''' or '''inversion center''', abbreviated ''i''.  A molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. In other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,-z) correspond to identical objects. For example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (-x,-y,-z).  There may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself.  Examples are [[xenon tetrafluoride]]  where the inversion center is at the Xe atom, and [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.
* '''Rotation-reflection axis''': an axis around which a  rotation by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt;, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged.  Also called  an ''n''-fold '''improper rotation axis''', it is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are present in tetrahedral [[silicon tetrafluoride]], with three S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and the [[staggered conformation]] of [[ethane]] with one S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; axis.
* '''Identity''', abbreviated to E, from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=einheit&amp;relink=on LEO Ergebnisse für "einheit"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. While this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]], whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. It is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). In other words, E is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|last=Pfenning|first=Brian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118859025|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations ===
[[Image:Xenon-tetrafluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[xenon tetrafluoride|XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], with square planar geometry, has 1 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis and 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes orthogonal to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These five axes plus the mirror plane perpendicular to the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis define the D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry group of the molecule.]]  
The five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of '''[[symmetry operation]]''', which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a [[caret]] or [[circumflex]]. Thus, Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and Ê is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis of the [[square planar molecular geometry|square]] [[xenon tetrafluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule is associated with two Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation (180°). Since Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to Ê, Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to σ and Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''î'',  all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.

== Symmetry groups ==

===Groups===
The symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'', which is a mathematical structure usually denoted in the form (''G'',*) consisting of a set  ''G''  and a binary combination operation say '*' satisfying certain properties listed below.

In a '''symmetry group''', the group elements are the symmetry operations (''not'' the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. An example is the sequence of a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By convention the order of operations is from right to left.

A symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.

(1) ''closure'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G'', the ''product'' ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  ( in symbols, for every two elements ''x'', ''y''∈''G'', ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G'' ). &lt;br&gt;This means that the group is ''closed'' so that combining two elements produces no new elements. Symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.&lt;br&gt;
(2) ''associative'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every ''x'' and ''y'' and ''z'' in ''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z'' and ''x''*(''y''*''z'')  result with the same element in ''G''.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, (''x''*''y'')*''z'' = ''x''*(''y''*''z'' ) for every ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' ∈ ''G'')&lt;br&gt;
(3) ''existence of identity'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
There must be an element ( say ''e'' ) in  ''G'' such that product any element of ''G'' with ''e'' make no change to the element.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, ''x''*''e''=''e''*''x''= ''x'' for every ''x''∈ ''G'' )&lt;br&gt;
(4) ''existence of inverse'' property: &lt;br&gt;   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For each element ( ''x'' ) in  ''G'', there must be an element ''y'' in  ''G'' such that product  of  ''x'' and ''y'' is the identity element ''e''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, for each  ''x''∈''G''  there is a ''y'' ∈ ''G'' such that ''x''*''y''=''y''*''x''= ''e'' for every ''x''∈''G'' )

The ''order'' of a group is the number of elements in the group. For groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.

===Point groups and permutation-inversion groups===
[[File:Pt Group chart 2.png|thumb|800px|Chart for determining Point Group]]
The successive application (or ''composition'') of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. For example, a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation followed by a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflection is seen to be a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;' symmetry operation: σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;*C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'. (Note that "Operation A followed by B to form C" is written BA = C).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. So (''S'',''*'') is a group, where ''S'' is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.

This group is called the [[point group]] of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). In other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a [[space group]] of symmetry operations, which includes [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] in space.

One can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one USES a point group, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. They are "symmetry operations" for that vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relation between point groups and permutation-inversion groups is explained in this pdf file [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] .

===Examples of point groups===
Assigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. For example, PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; all share identical symmetry operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all can undergo the identity operation E, two different C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotation operations, and three different σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) also share identical symmetry operations. They both undergo the identity operation E, one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation, and two σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miessler|first1=Gary|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780321811059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Common point groups===
The following table contains a list of point groups labelled using the [[Schoenflies notation]], which is common in chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules, which can be explained by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR model]].

=== Representations ===

The symmetry operations can be [[group representation|represented in many ways]]. A convenient representation is by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. Within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; example this is:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
     -1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
   }_{C_{2}} \times
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma_{v}} = 
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
   -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma'_{v}}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although an infinite number of such representations exist, the [[irreducible representation]]s (or "irreps") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.

== Character tables ==

{{Main|List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups}}

For each point group, a '''character table''' summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. As there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.

The table itself consists of '''characters''' that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied.  Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged.  But, for acting on a general entity, such as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] or an [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], this need not be the case.  The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type.  For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or &amp;minus;1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (''symmetric'') and &amp;minus;1 denotes a sign change (''asymmetric'').

The representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:

* A, when rotation around the principal axis is symmetrical
* B, when rotation around the principal axis is asymmetrical
* E and T are doubly and triply degenerate representations, respectively
* when the point group has an inversion center, the subscript g ({{lang-de|gerade}} or even) signals no change in sign, and the subscript u (''ungerade'' or uneven) a change in sign, with respect to inversion.
* with point groups C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; the symbols are borrowed from [[angular momentum]] description: [[sigma|Σ]], [[Pi (letter)|Π]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]].

The tables also capture information about how the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way.  These indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables.  This information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular ''p'' and ''d'' orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.

The character table for the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry point group is given below:

{| class="wikitable" 
 ! C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; || E || C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;(xz) || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) || || 
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || ''z'' 
 | ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xy''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || ''x'', R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xz''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || ''y'', R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; || ''yz''
|}
 
Consider the example of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which has the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry described above.  The 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; [[atomic orbital|orbital]] of oxygen has B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). It is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1}, corresponding to the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation. Likewise, the 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation (''i.e''.: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the  3''d''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.

== Historical background ==

[[Hans Bethe]] used characters of point group operations in his study of [[ligand field theory]] in 1929, and [[Eugene Wigner]] used group theory to explain the selection rules of [[atomic spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Group Theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra'', E. P. Wigner, Academic Press Inc. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The first character tables were compiled by [[László Tisza]] (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. [[Robert Mulliken]] was the first to publish character tables in English (1933), and [[E. Bright Wilson]] used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational [[normal mode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Correcting Two Long-Standing Errors in Point Group Symmetry Character Tables'' Randall B. Shirts [[J. Chem. Educ.]] 2007, 84, 1882. [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Nov/abs1882.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Jenny E. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. M. | year = 1936 | title = Group Theory and the Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules | url = | journal = Rev. Mod. Phys. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 317–346 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.8.317 | bibcode=1936RvMP....8..317R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular nonrigidity==
{{See also|Fluxional molecule}}
Point groups are useful for describing ''rigid'' molecules which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry, and for which the distorting effects of molecular rotation can be ignored, so that the symmetry operations all correspond to simple geometrical operations. However [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]] has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecules but also for ''non-rigid'' molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called ''versions'') and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation.&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are known as ''permutation-inversion'' groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or  inversion  with respect to the center of mass, or a combination of the two.

For example, [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) has three equivalent [[staggered conformation]]s. Tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by ''internal rotation'' of one [[methyl group]] relative to the other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis. Although each conformation has D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group G&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has two equivalent pyramidal (C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as [[nitrogen inversion]]. This is not an inversion in the sense used for point group symmetry operations of rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the center of mass) since NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no inversion center. Rather it the inversion of all nuclei and electrons in the center of mass (close to the nitrogen atom), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. The appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M) which is isomorphic with the point group D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;.

Additionally, as examples, the [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational
centrifugal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546-544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oldani | first = M.|display-authors=etal | year = 1985 | title =Pure rotational spectra of methane and methane-d4 in the vibrational ground state observed by microwave Fourier transform spectroscopy| url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 93-105 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(85)90215-2 | bibcode = 1985JMoSp.110...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;(M) and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M), respectively.

A second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann S.L. (1977) ''Induced Representations in Crystals and Molecules'', Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flurry&gt;Flurry, R.L. (1980) ''Symmetry Groups'', Prentice-Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-880013-8}}, pp.115-127&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach the symmetry groups are known as ''Schrödinger supergroups'' and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) ''isodynamic operations'', which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically  reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).&lt;ref name=Flurry/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">The '''Native American Renaissance''' is a term originally coined by [[literary critic|critic]] Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book ''Native American Renaissance'' to categorise the significant increase in production of [[Literature|literary works]] by [[Native Americans in the United States]] in the late 1960s and onwards. A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of [[N. Scott Momaday]]'s ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' in 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, "Introduction", in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1969.

==Earlier works by Native American authors==
Prior to the publication of ''House Made of Dawn,'' few Native American authors had published works of fiction that reached wide readership. Writers such as [[William Apess]], [[John Rollin Ridge]] and [[Simon Pokagon]] published works to little fanfare in the nineteenth century. Prior to the onset of [[World War II|WWII]], [[Mourning Dove (author)|Mourning Dove]], [[John Milton Oskison]], [[John Joseph Mathews]], [[Zitkala-Sa]], [[Charles Eastman]] and [[D'Arcy McNickle]] published literary works, although these works were relatively few in number.

==The Renaissance==

===Literary Renaissance===

In the work ''Native American Literatures: An Introduction,'' author Suzanne Lundquist suggests the Native American Renaissance has three elements:

*Reclamation of heritage through literary expression;
*Discovery and reevaluation of early texts by Native American authors; and
*Renewed interest in customary tribal artistic expression (i.e. mythology, ceremonialism, ritual, and the oral tradition of narrative transmission).&lt;ref&gt;Lundquist, Suzanne Evertsen. ''Native American Literatures: An Introduction.'' Consortium International Publishing Group: New York, NY. 2004, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln points out that in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a generation of Native Americans were coming of age who were the first of their respective tribal communities to receive a substantial English-language education, particularly outside [[Indian boarding school]]s, and with more graduating from colleges and universities. Conditions for [[Indigenous peoples|Native people]], while still very harsh during this period, had moved beyond the survival conditions of the early half of the century.

A period of [[historical revisionism]] was underway, as historians were more willing to look at difficulties in the history of the invasion and colonization of the [[North America|North American continent]]. As they explored the colonial and "[[Wild West]]" eras, some historians were more careful to represent events from the Native American perspective. This work inspired [[public interest]] in Native cultures and within Native American communities themselves; it was also a period of activism within Native American communities to achieve greater sovereignty and civil rights.

The ferment also inspired a group of young Native American writers, who emerged in the fields of poetry and novel-writing. In the span of a few years, these writers worked to expand the Native American literary [[Western canon|canon]].

By the 1980s, the rapid increase in materials and the development of [[Native American Studies]] departments and programs at several universities, such as [[the University of California, Los Angeles]]; [[Dartmouth College]], and [[Eastern Washington University]], led to the founding of scholarly journals, such as ''SAIL (Studies in American Indian Literature)'' and ''[[Wicazo Sa Review|Wíčazo Ša Review]]'' (1985). With the heightened interest in Native American writing, publishers established specialized imprints, such as [[HarperCollins|Harper and Row]]'s Native American Publishing Programme, which had the goal of promoting new voices and publication opportunities.

===Other meanings===
Although the primary use of the term has been literary, it has been used in a wider sense to describe "an increasing prosperity and sense of achievement among Indians [...] a widespread economic and cultural rebirth."&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Joan Nagel applies the term to the totality of "the resurgence of American Indian ethnic identification and the renascence of tribal cultures during the 1970s and 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;Joane Nagel, "False Faces: Ethnic Identity, Authenticity and Fraud in Native American Discourse and Politics," in ''Identity and Social Change'', ed. Joseph E. Davis (New Brunswick: Transaction, 2000), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native American Renaissance writers==

Writers typically included in the ''Native American Renaissance'' include:

*[[N. Scott Momaday]] ([[Kiowa]]), ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' (1968)
*[[Duane Niatum]] ([[Klallam]]), ''Ascending Red Cedar Moon'' (1974)
*[[Leslie Marmon Silko]] ([[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]), [[Ceremony (Silko novel)|''Ceremony'']] (1977)
*[[Gerald Vizenor]] ([[White Earth Chippewa|Chippewa]]), ''Darkness in Saint Louis Bearheart'' (1978)
*[[James Welch (poet)|James Welch]] ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]] and [[A'aninin]]), ''[[Winter in the Blood]]'' (1974)
*[[Joy Harjo]] ([[Muscogee]]), ''The Last Song'' (1975)
*[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Barney Bush - Native American Author (Shawnee)|Barney Bush]], ''Petroglyphs'' (1981)
*[[Simon J. Ortiz]] ([[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]]), ''From Sand Creek: Rising In This Heart Which Is Our America'' (1981)
*[[Louise Erdrich]] ([[Ojibwe|Chippewa]]), ''[[Love Medicine]]'' (1984)
*[[Paula Gunn Allen]] (Laguna), ''The Woman Who Owned the Shadows'' (1984)
*[[Maurice Kenny]] ([[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]), ''Tekonwatonti/Molly Brant (1735-1795): Poems of War'' (1992)
*[[nila northSun]] ([[Shoshone]]), ''A snake in her mouth: poems 1974-96'' (1997)

John Gamber argues that the characteristics of Renaissance writers are as follows: devotion to a sacred landscape; a homing-in plot, often associated with a protagonist's return to the reservation; the treatment of a mixed-blood protagonist's dilemma between two worlds as a central theme.&lt;ref&gt;"'We've Been Stuck in Place since ''House Made of Dawn'':Sherman Alexie and the Native American Renaissance", in Lee and Velie, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Erika Wurth points out that writers of this period were often concerned with writing for a non-Native audience.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Wurth, "The Fourth Wave", http://waxwingmag.org/writing.php?item=344&lt;/ref&gt;  Wurth and Gamber both agree that a new phase in Native writing began with the works of writers such as [[Sherman Alexie]], who rejected many of the formal and thematic concerns of Renaissance-era writing.

==Criticism==

The term ''Native American Renaissance'' has been criticized on a number of points.  As James Ruppert writes, "Scholars hesitate to use the phrase because it might imply that Native writers were not producing significant work before that time, or that these writers sprang up without longstanding community and tribal roots. Indeed, if this was a rebirth, what was the original birth?"&lt;ref&gt;James Ruppert, "Fiction: 1968–Present". In ''The Cambridge Companion to Native American Literature'', ed. Kenneth M. Roemer and Joy Porter (CUP, 2005). Page 173 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3_cSqmbXd8C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=%22native+american+renaissance%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iBTW6Icptc&amp;sig=EKr6NFqSyQlqPl1ypMYE2w9tRrE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ej43Sq6TCYuQsAa2-8GwCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPP1,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have described it as "a source of controversy,&lt;ref&gt;Craig Womack, "Book-Length Native Literary Criticism", in ''Reasoning Together'' by Janice Acoose, Lisa Brooks, Craig S. Womack, Tol Foster, Daniel Heath Justice, Christopher B Teuton (Oklahoma, 2008), page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zj79HmexugcC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=%22native+american+renaissance%22&amp;lr=#PPA14,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;". Rebecca Tillett argues that "While the definition of the recent burgeoning of Native writing as a "renaissance" is highly accurate in its description of the sudden growth in the numbers of Native writers finding publication, it is also profoundly inaccurate in its tendence to obscure the often specifically political histories of Indian oratory and writings upon which many Native writers are drawing."&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Tillett, "On the Cutting Edge," in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductor Armand Diangienda founded the orchestra in 1994 after losing his job as an [[airline pilot]], naming it after his grandfather, religious leader [[Simon Kimbangu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsioulcas  |first=Anastasia |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/03/06/148075689/kinshasa-symphony-an-ode-to-musical-joy-in-central-africa |title='Kinshasa Symphony': An Ode To Musical Joy In Central Africa|publisher=NPR|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its conception, the group had only twelve amateur musicians that shared instruments and often used common materials as makeshift instrument parts. The group eventually grew to the size of about 200 amateur musicians and performers consisting of a full orchestra and [[choir]].

The orchestra gained international attention when German filmmakers [[Martin Baer]] and [[Claus Wischmann]] created the documentary ''[[Kinshasa Symphony]]'' (2010) depicting the plight of the orchestra and its members in poverty stricken Kinshasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan  |first=Frances |url=http://soundandmusic.org/features/sound-film/films-sound-kinshasa-symphony |title=Films on sound: Kinshasa Symphony|publisher=Sound and Music|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 it was announced that Diangienda was to become an honorary member of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], an award previously bestowed on such famous musicians as [[Mendelssohn]], [[Rossini]], [[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Stravinsky]].&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;

The '''Portmahomack sculpture fragments''' are the slabs and stone fragments which have been discovered at the [[Easter Ross]] settlement of [[Portmahomack]] (Tarbat), [[Scotland]].

There are around 200 of these fragments, each the size of a handspan or larger, making Portmahomack one of the major centres of rediscovered [[Pictish]] art.  Nineteen pieces were found in and around the churchyard before 1994, and the remainder were found during formal archaeological investigations by the University of York between 1994 and 2007 [[Tarbat Discovery Programme]]. The excavation director, [[Martin Carver]] has proposed that the majority of the carved pieces originated in four monumental crosses or cross-slabs of exceptional size and elaboration, placed around the site of St Colman's Church. One of these (TR1) carried four Pictish symbols, a second (TR2) had snake-headed [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]. A third (TR10, 20), features images of a complex beast and a row of apostles carrying books. This same stone originally carried along one edge a [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription, &lt;blockquote&gt;''IN NOMINE IHU XRI CRUX XRI IN  COMMEMORATIONE REO... LII... DIE HAC...''&lt;/blockquote&gt; commemorating an unknown person. The fourth cross was covered in spiral and interlace ornament. Another large fragment, the so-called '''Boar Stone''', has been identified as a [[sarcophagus]] lid with images of a boar and a wolf-like creature. Yet another fragment, the so-called '''Calf Stone''', appears to belong to a shrine or screen. It depicts a bull and a cow tending to their calf. Other pieces from Portmahomack have been recognised as grave markers, incised with simple crosses. These are comparable to examples known from [[Iona]] and other [[early Christian]] sites in [[Argyll]] and western [[Scotland]]. Much of the Portmahomack sculpture has been assigned by radiocarbon dating of the layer in which it was found to the 8th century. Artistically, it has points of contact with sculpture in Iona and [[Northumbria]], but its closest affiliation is with the great cross-slabs on other parts of the Tarbat peninsula, namely those at [[Hilton of Cadboll]], [[Shandwick]] and [[Nigg, Highland|Nigg]], which one may perhaps assume were created by a school of masons centred on Tarbat.  Together they demonstrate that the Tarbat peninsula was a prime centre of 8th-century European art.

The collection also includes a number of architectural pieces which are likely to have adorned an early stone church, including a probable label-stop and a gable finial.  This collection, not yet fully published, is probably the most extensive to survive from early medieval [[Scotland]].

'''''Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion''''' is a 1958 book about human [[pregnancy]] by the anthropologist [[Paul Gebhard]], the sexologist [[Wardell Pomeroy]], the sexologist [[Clyde Martin]], and Cornelia Christenson. It was a publication of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]]. The work was prepared and written with careful attention to sampling, methodology and date interpretation, to demonstrate the Institute for Sex Research's scientific competence despite the death of [[Alfred Kinsey]] and to answer the criticism that the Institute was interested only in popular, moneymaking books. Though it did not receive the public acceptance of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', the work was well received in scientific circles, and demonstrated that the Institute could survive as a productive research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pom82|Pomeroy 1982. p. 450.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Romanian National Opera, Timișoara''' ({{lang-ro|Opera Națională Română din Timișoara}}) is a public opera and [[ballet company|ballet]] institution in [[Timișoara]], Romania. It is one of the national opera companies of [[Romania]]. The Opera shares the same building with the Mihai Eminescu National Theatre in Timișoara.

The first performance at the Timișoara Opera was on 27 April 1875, the inaugural concert being [[Aida]] by G. Verdi.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ort.ro/ro/istoric|title=Istoric &amp;#124; Opera Romana Timișoara|publisher=ort.ro|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 1880 the building is devastated by the first fire. The theatre goes bankrupt and it is bought by the authorities, in charge of its recovery. Since investments were insufficient individual funds were needed. The government offered "eternal" property over twenty lodges and the right of inheritance. Later, in agreement with the owners, they are redeemed. The reconstruction, completed in 1882, keeps the original Renaissance style of the façade.

After the second fire, which takes place in 1920, only the lateral wings remain intact. The reconstruction of the building begins on July 15, 1923, by architect [[Duiliu Marcu]].

On December 20, 1989, during the [[Romanian Revolution]], a crowd of 40,000 gathered in the open space in front of the opera house. Some managed to enter the building through the rear, and a succession of figures representing factories and ethnic groups delivered speeches from the balcony. From that point, the revolutionaries controlled the opera and surrounding square, although representatives of the [[Ceaușescu]] regime briefly continued to hold the county council building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Siani-Davies|title = The Romanian Revolution of December 1989 |location = Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-801-47389-6|pages=74–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the album by musician Chris Mars, see [[Tenterhooks (album)]]''.

'''Tenterhooks''' are [[hook]]s in a device called a ''tenter''. Tenters were originally large wooden frames which were used as far back as the 14th century in the process of making [[wool]]len [[cloth]]. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained [[lanolin|oil]] and dirt from the fleece. A [[craft]]sman called a [[fulling|fuller]] (also called a tucker or wa[u]lker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a [[fulling mill]], and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a tenter, and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter ({{ety|la|tendere|to stretch}}) using tenterhooks (hooked nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges ([[selvedge]]s) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trowbridgemuseum.co.uk/fulling-and-tentering/|title=Fulling and Tentering «  Trowbridge Museum|website=trowbridgemuseum.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.

By the mid-18th century, the phrase "'''on tenterhooks'''" came to mean being in a state of tension, uneasiness, [[anxiety]], or suspense, i.e. figuratively stretched like the cloth on the tenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ont1.htm|title=World Wide Words: On tenterhooks|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John_Ford_(dramatist)|John Ford's]] 1633 play ''Broken Heart'' contains the lines: "There is no faith in woman. Passion, O, be contain'd! My very heart-strings Are on the tenters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/editions/broken.htm#5.4|title=John Ford. The Broken Heart.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1690 the periodical ''The General History of Europe'' used the term in the modern sense: "The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then."&lt;ref&gt;The general history of Europe, London [England] 1688–1693, republished in Early English newspapers, Microfilm, Woodbridge, Conn. Primary Source Microfilm, an imprint of Gale Group, 2000; reel 1,364.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, English periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine|Monthly magazine or British register of literature, sciences, and the belles-lettres]]'' contained the line "I hope (though the wish is a cruel one) that my fair readers, if any such readers have deigned to follow me thus far, are on tenterhooks to know to whom the prize was adjudged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://grammarist.com/usage/on-tenterhooks/ Grammarist], retrieved 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of 19th-century British periodicals]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his wife the same year, American educator [[Francis Wayland]] (waiting for his promised appointment as President of [[Brown University]]) wrote "I was never so much on tenter hooks before."&lt;ref&gt;Roelker, William G. [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44807076.pdf "Francis Wayland A neglected pioneer of higher education"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', '''53''' (1):27–78. 1944. retrieved 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''tenter'' is still used today to refer to production line machinery employed to stretch [[polyester]] films and similar fabrics. The spelling ''stenter'' is also found.

'''''The History of Middle-earth''''' is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 that collect and analyse material relating to the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], compiled and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of [[Middle-earth]] as a fictional place with its own peoples, [[languages invented by Tolkien|languages]], and history, from his earliest notions of a "mythology for England" through to the development of the stories that make up ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is not a "history of Middle-earth" in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/gallery.php?subsection=81 |title=The History of Middle-earth |website=An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography |publisher=TolkienBooks.net |date=2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and [[Marquette University]] libraries, and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]].

The first five books track the early history of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and related texts.  Books six to nine discuss the development of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; book nine also discusses the [[Númenor]] story in the form of [[The Notion Club Papers]]. Books ten and eleven focus on material from the ''Silmarillion'' that Tolkien worked on after ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published, including the ''Annals of [[Beleriand]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Aman]]''. Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.

Christopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in ''The History of Middle-earth'' because it was not originally intended to form part of [[Tolkien's legendarium|the mythology]], but was a children's story and originally not set in Middle-earth, but was revised during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was  edited by [[John D. Rateliff]]

A combined index was published six years after the series was completed as ''The History of Middle-earth: Index'' (2002).

A shorter version of volume 9, omitting material not related to ''The Lord of the Rings'', was published as ''The End of the Third Age''; this is usually sold as a boxed set along with volumes 6, 7 and 8 as ''The History of the Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Lord-Rings-Box-Middle-Earth-x/dp/0261103709/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502463207&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=the+history+of+the+lord+of+the+rings |title=The History of the Lord of the Rings on Amazon.co.uk|website=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Die sechs Schwäne.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]

A King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. 

The new queen and now [[stepmother]], who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into [[swan]]s. 

The brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of [[nettle]]s and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.

Years later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. 

The young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.

On the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. 

The queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Daughter of the Forest]]'', the first book of the [[Sevenwaters trilogy]] by [[Juliet Marillier]], is a detailed retelling of this story in a medieval [[Celts|Celtic]] setting. A young woman named Sorcha must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers (Liam, Diarmuid, Cormack, Connor, Finbar and Padriac) from the witch Lady Oonagh's enchantment, remaining completely mute until the task is finished. Falling in love with a British lord, Hugh of Harrowfield alias "Red", complicates her mission.

* An episode from the anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |title=新グリム名作劇場 第10話 六羽の白鳥 &amp;#124; アニメ &amp;#124; 動画はShowTime (ショウタイム) |website=Web.archive.org |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2016-06-05 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622031028/http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Mitsuko Horie]] as the Princess (here named Elise), [[Toshiko Fujita]] as the witch, [[Hideyuki Hori]] as the prince, [[Ishizuka Unsho]] as the king, and [[Koichi Yamadera]], [[Taku Takemura]], [[Masami Kikuchi]], and Keiichi Naniwa as the brothers. This plot differs in some parts from the Grimm's version, especially in the second part of the story. In the anime, the evil stepmother-queen kills her husband and puts a spell on his children to gain total control of the kingdom like in the original, but later she takes up the role of the Princess/Queen's evil mother-in-law and leaves Elise's baby son (her only child) in the forest. The swan-brothers find their nephew the forest and keep him alive, plus they're stuck in their swan forms all day/night long (though they still can speak) until their sister breaks the curse and they give her the baby back. Elise finishes the garments in time, therefore the youngest is not left with a swan wing in the end. When the wicked stepmother is exposed as the witch ''and'' as the one who framed Elise at the end, she uses her magic in an attempt to escape but then accidentally catches fire from Elise's pyre and burns to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPtShfBadw |title=GFTC - The Six Swans |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Paul Weiland]]'s episode "The Three Ravens" of [[Jim Henson]]'s television series ''[[The Storyteller]]'' is another retelling of this classic tale. After the queen dies, an evil witch ensnares the king and turn his three sons into [[raven]]s. The princess escapes and must stay silent for three years, three months, three weeks and three days to break the spell. But after she meets a handsome prince, this is suddenly not so easy, for her stepmother has killed her father and remarried - to the prince's father. But when the witch attempts to burn the princess at the stake, the ravens attack her and she accidentally sets fire to herself instead, instantly turning into ashes. Her death almost fully reverses the spell, but the princess breaks her silence three minutes too soon, and her youngest brother subsequently keeps one wing forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/me3/muppets/Story_ThreeRavens.html |title=The Storyteller Presents The Three Ravens |website=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The novel ''Birdwing'' by Rafe Martin follows the youngest prince, human but with a wing instead of his left arm, as he grows up with this "deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafemartin.com/bk_birdwing.html |title=Rafe Martin-Birdwing |website=Rafemartin.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Moonlight'' features a thirteen-year-old princess named Aowyn who loses her mother to a mysterious illness, and is charged with protecting her father and her six brothers from the conniving of a witch bent on taking the throne. This retelling is written by Ann Hunter and set on the Summer Isle, an alternate Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Hunter |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620664-moonlight |title=Moonlight by Ann Hunter — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A teenage boy, Sergey, arrives at a boarding school for the deaf.

Soon however, he falls in love with one of the girls, Anna, whom he impregnates. Sergey finds a purse on a train which he steals, giving the money to Anna for a makeshift abortion. Much later, Sergey follows one of the teachers home, knocks him unconscious, and robs him, giving the substantial sum to Anna and then raping her. Anna gets an abortion, and they set apart over time. One of the gangmasters prepare to send the two girls to Italy, but Sergey ruins Anna's passport and is eventually beaten by King and his gang. Sergey later retaliates by crushing their heads with their nightstands in their sleep.

===Theatrical run===

==Reception==
''The Tribe'' received widespread critical acclaim by critics, audiences and at festivals all over the world. Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 86% of critics gave the film a "Certified Fresh" rating, based on 92 reviews with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 7.5/10, with the consensus "A bleak, haunting drama whose wordless dialogue speaks volumes, The Tribe is a bold, innovative take on silent films for a contemporary audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/plemya/?search=Plemya|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another [[review aggregator]], assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 27 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "generally favorable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tribe|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the piece four out of five stars, writing, "I can't stop thinking about it." while too praising  Slaboshpytskiy's ability to "[draw] on Samuel Beckett or Peter Brook to create a universal language of anxiety." while concluding the sentiment, "What an intriguing film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe review – deaf-school drama is shocking, violent and unique|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/17/the-tribe-review-deaf-mute-miroslav-slaboshpytskiy|accessdate=17 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the piece, stating, "The use of sign language, deafness and silence itself adds several heady new ingredients to the base material, alchemically creating something rich, strange and very original." He also admired the film's "silky smooth steadicam" cinematography of Vasyanovych. As well as comparing the language of gestures and body posture as "akin to watching a ballet like [[Coppélia]] or [[The Nutcracker]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' heralded the film and its director, Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, by stating: "Actions, emotions and desperate impulses speak far louder than words in The Tribe, a formally audacious coup de cinema that marks a stunning writing-directing debut for Ukrainian filmmaker [Slaboshpytskiy]." Chang was most praiseworthy of Vasyanovych's cinematography, Stepanskiy's sound design as "vividly detailed" and described Odudenko's production designs as "harshly lit corridors and graffiti-strewn exteriors". He also admired Novikova's "fire and vulnerability" as Anya.&lt;ref name="Film Review: The Tribe"/&gt;

Jonathan Romney of ''[[Film Comment]]'' granted the piece high acclaim, "[...] it was a thrill to discover something so bold, innovative, and downright wayward." Stating of the film, "[...] a magnificent example of long-take cinema". and calling it "an astonishing film". He continued by praising Slaboshpytskiy's risky endeavour, to which he "follows through with intrepidity and absolute rigor" as well as Vasyanovych’s "precise compositions". Romney further adds, "The Tribe, in short, was the most surprising, most inventive, and in many ways most disturbing film I’ve seen in Cannes this year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film of the Week: The Tribe|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/cannes-2014-the-tribe-myroslav-slaboshpytskiy-semaine-de-la-critique|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[Film Comment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later named the film among the best movies of 2014.&lt;ref name="The best films of 2014"/&gt;

Eric Kohn of ''[[indieWIRE]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating, adding, "While the specifics remain uncertain, it's never particularly difficult to keep up with the movie's pace, since their actions speak plainly enough -- and sometimes add far more expressiveness than any verbal exchanges could provide." Praising Slaboshpytskiy and Vasyanovych's usage of the steadicam approach, "capturing the actors' exchanges in their full-bodied entirety"; and Slaboshpytskiy as "brilliantly [developing] a suspenseful core through the mysteries of their conversations". He admired Grigory Fesenko's "body movements" and "precise details" through gestures.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Fred Topel wrote, in his review for ''[[CraveOnline]]'', "The piece de resistance is a taboo subject that unfolds in an elaborate single take. It was so harrowing I would have applauded if it would not have been completely inappropriate for the subject matter to do so." Topel praised the cast as "made up of non actors but you wouldn’t suspect that" adding, "They are full of life and energy" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fantastic Fest 2014 Review: ‘The Tribe’|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/film/reviews/763193-fantastic-fest-2014-review-tribe|accessdate=22 September 2014|newspaper=[[CraveOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Kiang of ''[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating and wrote, "It might sound glib, but it's the literal truth: "The Tribe" left us speechless." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cannes Review: Bizarre, Unsettling, Brilliant Critics’ Week Winner ‘The Tribe’|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-review-bizarre-unsettling-brilliant-critics-week-winner-the-tribe-20140528|accessdate=29 May 2014|newspaper=[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electric Sheep|Electric Sheep Magazine]]'''s Greg Klymkiw granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating "A sad, shocking and undeniably harrowing dramatic reflection of Ukraine with the searing truthful lens of a stylistic documentary treatment (at times similar to that of Austrian auteur [[Ulrich Seidl]])". He continues by commending that, "Visuals and actions are what drive the film and ultimately prove to be far more powerful than words ever could be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/reviews/2014/09/23/the-tribe/|accessdate=23 September 2014|newspaper=[[Electric Sheep]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Y. Thompson of ''[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]'' spoke most highly of the film, declaring, "Compelling, upsetting, brutal and brilliant, The Tribe is one of the best works of cinema of the year - a familiar template recreated in what, for most, will be an entirely new world." Too adding, "[...] this is a movie that will and should be used in [[film school|cinema schools]] as a master class in how film is a visual medium." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shape Shifters, Deaf Gangsters and More: 7 Upcoming Horror &amp; Crime Films Reviewed From AFI Fest|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2014/11/shape_shifters_deaf_gangsters_and_more_7_upcoming.php?page=2|accessdate=19 November 2014|newspaper=[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">Most [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monasteries, temples and other religious structures in the [[Himalayas]] were decorated with '''Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings'''.  Despite much destruction in Tibet itself, many of these survive, the dry climate of the [[Tibetan plateau]] assisting their survival, as the wet Indian climate has reduced survival of paintings from there.  There are some regional differences, but the techniques described here cover the traditional wall paintings across this area. The wall paintings were executed on earthen plaster with the secco-technique.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, O.P. (ed.) (1989) "Wall Paintings - Asian Perspective. In: Wall Paintings of India- A Historical Perspective. Lucknow, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; A secco-technique is a painting technique in which the pigments with their binder are employed to paint onto a dry (Italian: secco) wall.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Detail wall painting, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail wall painting, Ladakh]]
[[File:Wall painting ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail of a wall painting in a Buddhist temple in Ladakh/India]]
[[File:1000 armed Avalokiteshvara at Saspol cave DSCN7053 1.jpg|thumb|1000 armed [[Avalokiteshvara]] dated 13th - 15th century AD at Saspol cave in  [[Ladakh]], [[India]] ]]
The support for wall paintings in made of [[earthen plaster]], usually consisting of more than one layer of earthen plaster, in which the last layer was rendered as smoothly as possible.
The support was covered by a smoothened ground, generally in white. Materials employed for the ground may be kaolin, chalk or gypsum, or any other white material deriving from an inert mineral.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S.( 2005) "A Technical Study of Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India." In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To organise the painting, preliminary sketches were carried out. Generally this involved  the geometric layout of the design with the help of snapped lines and/or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P., Jackson, J. A. (2006) ''Tibetan Thangka Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; Compasses were employed mainly for the construction of [[mandalas]]. Figures were roughly sketched, and then rendered with precise  contours. These outlines are usually in black.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study of the Early Buddhist Wall PAintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive designs were in some cases achieved with the use of [[stencils]].&lt;ref&gt;Lo Bue, E. (2006) "Tibetische Malerei." In: ''Tibet. Klöster öffnen ihre Schatzkammern''. (Exhibition catalogue. Museum für Asiatische Kunst. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.) Essen: Kulturstiftung Ruhr. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditionally, colour codes were employed to accelerate and simplify the colouring of the various ornaments and figures. For this purpose each section was given a number from 1-9 or an abbreviation of the name of the colour.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P, Jackson, J. A. (2006) "Tibetan [[Thangka]] Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Some paintings  were embellished with raised ornaments (pastiglia-technique).&lt;ref&gt;Dasser, K. L. (1996) "Some Observations on the Technology of the Wall Paintings in the Sumtsek. In: ''Alchi: Ladakh's Hidden Buddhist Sanctuary''. London: the Sumtsek, pp. 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt; Either a semi-liquid paste was applied to the painting surface, or a stamp had been previously produced from a mould and then applied onto the painting surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study  of the Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting were employed. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system. Shading may be obtained with glazes, or with one of the dry shading systems, such as the dot-shading technique in which minuscle dots of colour cover the paintings surface.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P., Jackson, J. A. (2006) "Tibetan Thangka Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific details were then achieved with small paint brushes employing a variety of colours: black, white, ochre or red.

Specific ornaments of a representation were  enriched with gold. This  was either applied as a [[gold leaf]] or as powder in a binder.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeo, R., et al (2004) "Characterization of Mural Painting Pigments from the Thubchen Lakhang Temple in Lo Manthang, Nepal". In: ''Journal of Raman Spectroscopy''; 35, p. 678-685.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Under African Skies'''" is a song by the American singer-songwriter [[Paul Simon]]. It was the fifth and final [[Single (music)|single]] from his seventh studio album, ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' (1986), released on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The song features guest vocals from singer [[Linda Ronstadt]], who received top billing on the single release.
==Background==
"Under African Skies" originated in later recording sessions for ''Graceland''. Simon flew over several South African musicians to New York to complete the record three months after the original sessions in [[Johannesburg]],&lt;ref name="linernotes"/&gt; paying them triple union rates in order to lure them to record, as many did not know who he was.&lt;ref name=rs86&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[David Fricke]]| date =October 23, 1986| title =African Odyssey| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| volume = | issue =485 | pages =77–80 | publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also offered writer's royalties to those who he felt had contributed particularly to the song's compositions.&lt;ref name="nyt86"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Holden|title=Paul Simon Brings Home the Music of Black South Africa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/arts/paul-simon-brings-home-the-music-of-black-south-africa.html|date=August 24, 1986|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sessions also resulted in the lead single, "[[You Can Call Me Al]]".&lt;ref name="linernotes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes | title=Graceland | year=1986 | others=[[Paul Simon]] | type=liner notes | publisher=[[Warner Bros.

'''Urmston Musical Theatre''' (UMT) is an [[amateur theatre]] company based in [[Urmston]], [[Greater Manchester]], UK.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1911 as the Urmston and District Operatic Society, and produced ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the Urmston Public Hall. In 1947, the name was changed to the Urmston Amateur Operatic Society which remained until it assumed the current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk The Urmston Musical Theatre], Retrieved on 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known personalities have been connected with the society, notably the current President, [[Matthew Kelly]], who appeared in the society's 1963 production of ''[[The King and I]]'' along with Peter Pennington, who became a featured soloist with the ''[[Black and White Minstrel Show|Black and White Minstrels]]''. Others include [[Brian Trueman]] who appeared in the group's production of ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/merrie.htm Merrie England 1951] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the late Lord Winstanley and [[Winston Churchill (1940–2010)|Winston Churchill]] MP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/pastshows.htm UMT Past Shows] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; grandson of the wartime leader and son of [[Randolph Churchill]] MBE.

In 1958, 1959 and 1960, the society won the [[Manchester Evening News]] Prompter's Palm award for their productions of ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''Magyar Melody'' respectively. The society has also been nominated in the Manchester Musical Awards on a number of occasions for both overall and individual performances. In 1995, they won the "Best Musical" award for their production of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''.

Junior members aged between 8 years and 18 years, in addition to being involved in some of the main shows and pantomimes, have presented a variety of musicals in their own right since 1993 including ''[[Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', ''Andy Capp'', ''[[Copperfield (musical)|Copperfield]]'', and ''Dazzle''.

In the early 1930s, the theatre almost closed when reserves fell to £3, but for the enthusiasm and dedication of its members and patrons.

[[File:Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Late 1930s.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]
'''Vladimir Ivanovich Nemirovich-Danchenko''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Владимир Иванович Немирович-Данченко}}; {{OldStyleDate|23 December|1858|11 December}} – 25 April 1943, Moscow), [[People's Artist of the USSR|PAU]], was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Soviet theatre director, writer, [[Theatre pedagogy|pedagogue]], playwright, producer and theatre administrator, who founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] with his colleague, [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], in 1898.

==Biography==
[[File:Vladimir Nemirovich Danchenko3.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]
Vladimir Ivanovich Nemirovich-Danchenko was born into a mixed [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] family in the village of [[Shemokmedi]] near [[Ozurgeti]] ([[Guria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). His Ukrainian father, Ivan Danchenko, was an officer in the Imperial Russian army, and his mother, Alexandra Yagubyan (1829–1914), was Armenian. He went to high school in [[Tbilisi]], continuing his education at [[Moscow State University]] (physical-mathematical and juridical departments 1876–79). 

In 1879 he left the University for the theatre, starting as a theatre critic, and in 1881, his first play "Dog-rose", which was staged in one year by [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], was published. 
He was a teacher of [[Moskvin]], [[Olga Knipper|Knipper]] and [[Meyerhold]].&lt;ref name="BertenssonFryer2004"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Sergei Bertensson|author2=Paul Fryer|author3=Anna Shoulgat|title=In Hollywood with Nemirovich-Danchenko, 1926–1927: the memoirs of Sergei Bertensson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-q7vtY7jXUC&amp;pg=PR16|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4988-4|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1919, he established the Musical Theatre of the Moscow Art Theatre, which was reformed into the [[Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="BertenssonFryer2004"/&gt; In 1943 Nemirovich-Danchenko established the [[Moscow Art Theatre School]], which is still extant.{{cn|date=August 2015}} 

He died of a heart attack on 25 April 1943, aged 84, in Moscow.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Legacy==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2015}}
Nemirovich-Danchenko's  [[Moscow Art Theatre]] staged [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] drama with theretofore unknown naturalism and full expression. In addition, his theatre presented highly acclaimed [[Dostoevsky]] and [[Tolstoy]] dramatizations. It has been said {{Whom?|date=July 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that "If [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavsky]] was the soul of Art Theatre, then Nemirovich was its heart".

Nemirovich-Danchenko created the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]'s acting and directing style, known for "actors ensemble" and its "atmosphere". Because of his directorial and production skills, the Moscow Art Theatre was considered, at the time, the best theatre in the world.{{Whom?|date=July 2010}} But Nemirovich didn't write down his acting "system"and we know only the "[[Stanislavski's system|system of Stanislavski]]".{{proveit|date=August 2016}} He was one of the first recipients of the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1936. Later, he was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] (1942, 1943), the [[Order of Lenin]] (3 May 1937), and [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] (25 February 1936).

'''''Wayne's World 2''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]] as hosts of a [[public-access television]] [[cable television]] show in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. The film is the sequel to ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), which was adapted from a [[Wayne's World|sketch]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Plot==
[[Rock and roll]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World,'' from an abandoned factory in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. After an [[Aerosmith]] concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets [[Jim Morrison]] and a "weird naked [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert "Waynestock" and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.

Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra, singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.

Tickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of ''[[The Graduate]]''. Meanwhile, Garth has [[stage fright]] during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.

In the dream desert, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come and that all that matters is they tried. They become lost in the desert. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'', driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth stage an ending in which the bands arrive and Waynestock is a success. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to get Cassandra but is not allowed inside.

After the concert, the park is covered with trash and [[Keep America Beautiful|the "weird naked Indian" cries]]. Wayne and Garth begin to remove the litter, promising to clean the entire park.

==Production==
[[Penelope Spheeris]], who directed the [[Wayne's World (film)|first film]] believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=June 16, 2008 |title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery |publisher=ew.com |url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/ |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |quote="I hated that bastard for years," says Spheeris, who believes Myers dissuaded Paramount from hiring her for Wayne's World 2. "But when I saw Austin Powers, I went, 'I forgive you, Mike.'" She pauses, voice choked with emotion. "'You can be moody, you can be a jerk, you can be things that others of us can't be—because you are profoundly talented. And I forgive you.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.

Myers' original script for ''Wayne's World 2'' had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy ''[[Passport to Pimlico]].''  This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to ''Passport to Pimlico''.  Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: "I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melnychuk |first=Mark |date=March 3, 2017 |title=Making Wayne's World 2 was 'traumatic' for director Stephen Surjik |publisher=[[Regina Leader-Post]] |url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/making-waynes-world-2-was-traumatic-for-director-stephen-surjik |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio executive [[Sherry Lansing]] was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he didn't immediately produce a new script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THR Staff |date=April 21, 2017 |title=Why Sherry Lansing Threatened Mike Myers: 'I'll Take Your F—ing House' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-sherry-lansing-threatened-mike-myers-ill-take-your-f-king-house-994864 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Wayne's World 2'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne's World 2': It's Not as Good, but Still Worthy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 11, 1992 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-11/news/mn-255_1_wayne-s-world |first=Rone |last=Tempest |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 61% approval rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in ''Wayne's World 2'' are more hit-and-miss the second time around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world_2/ |title=Wayne's World 2 (1993) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are "impossible to dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 10, 1993 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-2-1993 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |title=Wayne's World 2 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
Although it was intended to be a [[Christmas season]] blockbuster, ''Wayne's World 2'' did not receive the box office intake or positive fan reaction that the first film did. Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. ''Wayne's World 2'' also suffered from competition from other holiday season [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne, Garth Party On at the Box Office Movies: 'Wayne's World' sequel pulls in an estimated $14.2 million to push "Mrs. Doubtfire" into second place.
