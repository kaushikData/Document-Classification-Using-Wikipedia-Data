[[File:Alexander Mackenzie 001.jpg|thumb|Alexander Mackenzie, 1898]]
'''Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie''' [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] (22 August 1847{{spaced ndash}}28 April 1935) was a Scottish composer, conductor and teacher best known for his [[oratorio]]s, violin and piano pieces, Scottish folk music and works for the stage.

Mackenzie was a member of a musical family and was sent for his musical education to Germany.  He had many successes as a composer, producing over 90 compositions, but from 1888 to 1924, he devoted a great part of his energies to running the [[Royal Academy of Music]].  Together with [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], he was regarded as one of the fathers of the British [[English Musical Renaissance|musical renaissance]] in the late nineteenth century.

==Life and career==
Mackenzie was born in [[Edinburgh]], the eldest son of Alexander Mackenzie and his wife, Jessie Watson ''née'' Campbell.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U213304 "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, 2007, accessed 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth musician of his family. His great-grandfather was an army bandsman; his grandfather, John Mackenzie, was a violinist in Edinburgh and [[Aberdeen]]; his father was also a violinist, the conductor of the orchestra in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, and editor of ''The National Dance Music of Scotland''.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;"Alexander Campbell Mackenzie, August 22, 1847{{snd}}April 28, 1935", obituary, ''[[Musical Times|The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 76, No. 1108, June 1935, pp. 497–502.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackenzie's musical talent emerged early: at the age of eight he was playing nightly in his father's orchestra.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; He was sent for his musical education to Germany, living with his teacher, the Stadtmusiker August Bartel, in [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]] in Thuringia, where he entered the [[conservatorium]] under K. W. Ulrich and Eduard Stein, remaining there from 1857 to 1861, when he entered the ducal orchestra as a violinist.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

[[File:Alexander-Mackenzie-age-12.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie, aged 12. In 1927 he said, "If I could only finish my career with a head of hair like that, I should die happy."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;]]
Mackenzie wished to continue his violin studies with the teacher Prosper Sainton, who had taught his father, and in 1862 he successfully applied for admission to the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London, where Sainton taught.  His other tutors were the principal, [[Charles Lucas (musician)|Charles Lucas]] (harmony), and Frederick Bowen Jewson (piano).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Barker, Duncan J. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17356?q=Alexander+Mackenzie&amp;source=omo_t237&amp;source=omo_gmo&amp;source=omo_t114&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell"], Grove Music Online (requires subscription), accessed 27 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after starting at the Academy, he was awarded a King's Scholarship, the income from which Mackenzie augmented by playing in theatre and [[music hall]] pit-bands, as well as in classical concerts under the leading conductor [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 29 April 1935, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes caused him to neglect his academic work, and on one occasion, having failed to prepare a piece by a classical composer for a piano examination, he improvised, "starting off in A minor and taking care to end in the same key", and convinced the examiners that it was a little-known work by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]. Recalling this prank in his old age, he added, "I have never ceased to wonder at my escape, and would certainly not advise any student to run a similar risk today."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; Some of Mackenzie's early compositions were performed at the Academy.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===Early career===
In 1865 Mackenzie returned to Edinburgh. He undertook a heavy workload of teaching, both privately and in local colleges, and from 1870 he was in charge of music at St George's, [[Charlotte Square]]. In 1873 he took on the conductorship of the Scottish Vocal Association. He also played the violin in orchestral concerts both locally and at the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Festivals]] from 1864 to 1873, meeting visiting musicians including the conductor [[Hans von Bülow]], who became a firm friend.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In 1874 Mackenzie married a local woman, Mary Malina Burnside (d. 1925). They had a daughter, Mary.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Carnegie, Moir, rev. Rosemary Firman.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34749  "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell (1847–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mackenzie successfully began composing orchestral music.  Bülow conducted his overture ''Cervantes'' in 1879,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and two of his Scottish rhapsodies were premiered by [[August Manns]] in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Alexander mackenzie by spy.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Mackenzie by "[[Leslie Ward|Spy]]"]]
By this time, Mackenzie's heavy workload as a teacher and player began to undermine his health.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Two of Bülow's pupils in [[Florence]], Italy, Giuseppe Buonamici and George F. Hatton, introduced Mackenzie to the musical philanthropists Carl and Jessie Hillebrand. After a few months' rest in their care, Mackenzie began composing full-time.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; Apart from a year in England (1885), he made Florence his home until 1888. During this period he spent much time in the company of [[Franz Liszt]]. He began composing large-scale works, including instrumental, orchestral and choral music and two operas.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His [[cantata]]s ''The Bride'' and ''Jason'' were successfully given, and the [[Carl Rosa|Carl Rosa Company]] commissioned his first opera, ''Colomba'', written to a libretto prepared by [[Francis Hueffer]], music critic of ''[[The Times]]''. The opera premiered successfully in 1883.  A second opera, ''The Troubadour'', produced by the same company in 1886, was less successful, though Liszt thought well enough of the piece to begin work on a piano fantasia based on themes from it.  [[Pablo de Sarasate]] premiered a [[violin concerto]] by Mackenzie at the Birmingham Festival of 1885. For the 1885–86 season, Mackenzie was appointed conductor of [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]]'s [[oratorio]] concerts in London. Liszt paid his final visit to England chiefly to hear his ''Saint Elisabeth'' performed under Mackenzie's direction in 1886.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Peak years===
In October 1887, the principal of the Royal Academy of Music, [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]], died, and in early 1888 Mackenzie was appointed to succeed him.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He held the post for 36 years until his retirement in 1924. At the time, the Academy was overshadowed by its younger rival, the [[Royal College of Music]], and Mackenzie set about reviving its reputation. He was fortunate in enjoying the friendly support of his opposite numbers at the College, [[George Grove]], and, from 1895, [[Hubert Parry]], and the two institutions established a close working relationship of mutual benefit. In addition to overhauling the curriculum and reorganising the faculty, Mackenzie engaged personally with his students by teaching composition and conducting the student orchestra. In 1912 the Academy moved from its old buildings in [[Mayfair]] to purpose-built premises in [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In his later years as principal, Mackenzie became markedly conservative, forbidding his students to play the chamber music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], which he stigmatised as "a pernicious influence".&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie was conductor of the [[Royal Choral Society]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]] Orchestra between 1892 and 1899,&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; giving the British premières of many works, including symphonies by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; &lt;!--REFERENCE NEEDED FOR THIS RECENT ADDITION:  Also in 1899, Mackenzie was invited to be a founder honorary member of the [[Oxford &amp; Cambridge Musical Club]].--&gt;

[[File:Parry-Mackenzie-Stanford.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (front c.), in 1910 with [[Hubert Parry|Parry]] (back l.), [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] (front r.), [[Edward German]] (back r.) and [[Dan Godfrey]]]]
Like his father, Mackenzie took a great interest in folk music and produced several collections of arrangements of traditional Scottish songs.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1903, interested in investigating Canadian folk-song, he undertook a tour of Canada organised by the Anglo-Canadian musician [[Charles A.E. Harriss]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His visit stimulated the cultural scene and choral festival competitions were held throughout Canada with eleven new choral societies being founded.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Mackenzie conducted concerts during the tour, exclusively of British music.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Mackenzie was regarded as a cosmopolitan musician. He spoke fluent German and Italian and was elected to the post of President of the International Musical Society which he held from 1908 to 1912. From his early days playing in orchestras in Edinburgh and Birmingham he had met and become friendly with many leading international musicians, including [[Clara Schumann]], [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His friendship with Liszt began in Mackenzie's student days in Sondershausen and lasted for the rest of Liszt's life.

Although Mackenzie composed a large number of works, which met with great public success, he found, as had [[Arthur Sullivan]] earlier and as did Parry contemporaneously, that running a large musical conservatoire left less time for composition.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David. "The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century", ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', 130 no. 2, pp. 236–82; and Dibble, Jeremy. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35393, "Parry, Sir (Charles) Hubert Hastings, baronet (1848–1918)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Both at the Academy and elsewhere, he was a popular lecturer. Among his topics were [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', the text of his lecture on which was later published in translation in Italy.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Outliving his contemporaries Sullivan and Parry, he gave memorial lectures on their lives and works. At a time when Sullivan's reputation in academic musical circles was not high, Mackenzie's tribute was generous and enthusiastic.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Alexander. "The Life-Work of Arthur Sullivan", ''Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft'', May 1902, Franz Steiner Verlag, pp. 539–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Mackenzie's professional prominence brought him many honours from universities and learned societies in Britain and abroad. He was [[knight]]ed in 1895, and created a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in 1922, the year of the centenary celebrations of the Royal Academy, in which he was the central figure. On his eighty-sixth birthday, over forty distinguished musicians presented him with a silver tray inscribed with facsimiles of their signatures, including [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Ethel Smyth]], [[Edward German]], [[Henry Wood]], and [[Landon Ronald]]. He retired from the Academy and from public life in 1924.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

Mackenzie died in London in 1935 at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Works==
{{Further|List of compositions by Alexander Mackenzie}}
''The [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says of Mackenzie's music that it is "cosmopolitan in style and somewhat old-fashioned for its period, displaying influences of French and German composers, including [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' says that although Mackenzie's music was eclipsed by the works of later composers, "he and his contemporaries may be regarded as having laid the foundations of the [[English musical renaissance|musical renaissance]] in 19th- and early 20th-century Britain".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

During his time teaching in Edinburgh, Mackenzie wrote several works, including a piano trio, a string quartet and a piano quartet, and he maintained a considerable output despite his crowded schedule both then and later. ''The Times'' reported that his list of compositions numbered 90, of which 20 were distinctly Scottish.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

[[File:Sullivan to MacKenzie.png|right|thumb|Cartoon alluding to the irony of the failure of ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897) after Mackenzie had criticised [[Arthur Sullivan]] for "wasting his talents" on comic opera.]]
His orchestral works include the overture ''Cervantes'', performed at Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in 1877, three ''Scottish Rhapsodies'', a violin concerto premiered by [[Pablo de Sarasate]] at the Birmingham Festival of 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times '', 28 August 1885, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a "Scottish" concerto for piano (1897), a suite, ''London Day by Day'' (1902),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 February 1902, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Canadian Rhapsody'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 March 1905, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He composed [[incidental music]] to six dramas, including ''Ravenswood'', and [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''The Little Minister''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 November 1897, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral march from his music for [[Henry Irving]]'s production of ''[[Coriolanus]]'' was played at Irving's funeral in 1905 and at Mackenzie's memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1935. He worked on a symphony but did not complete it.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

It was as a composer of vocal music that Mackenzie first achieved national fame. His cantata ''The Bride'' was a success at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 September 1881, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Elgar]] played in the violins at the première and later remarked that meeting Mackenzie was "the event of my musical life".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; A second cantata, ''Jason'', for the [[Bristol]] festival of 1882, was also well received.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 October 1882, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous choral work was the oratorio ''The Rose of Sharon'', written for the [[Norwich]] festival of 1884.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 March 1885, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The words were adapted from the ''[[Song of Solomon]]'' by [[Joseph Bennett (critic)|Joseph Bennett]], music critic of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', who later provided Sullivan with the text for ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]''. ''The Dream of Jubal'' (1889), is an unusual combination of recitation and choral sections, composed for the jubilee of the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra|Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 14 December 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie's operas began in 1883 with ''Colomba'', first produced by the Carl Rosa Company. It was a success, but his second opera ''The Troubadour'' (1886) was not.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 June 1886, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Hueffer's libretti for both operas were written in an antiquated style that attracted much criticism. Mackenzie's other operas were a one-act opera, ''The Cricket on the Hearth'', first performed in 1914, ''The Eve of St John'' (1924), and two almost-complete operas, ''The Cornish Opera'' and ''Le luthier''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Critics observed that Mackenzie's operatic and choral music was generally ill-served by his librettists: "Much of his best work ... is neglected, partly because unlike his contemporaries, Parry and Stanford, Mackenzie went for the texts of his larger vocal works to such librettists as Joseph Bennett and Hueffer, instead of to the vital things of English poetry and literature."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; "[He] was content with librettos written by hacks according to the current operatic conventions."&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Mackenzie: A Neglected Generation", ''The Times'', 15 August 1947, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This even applied to his one excursion into [[comic opera]], ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', a piece in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] vein, with a libretto by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and [[R. C. Lehmann]] and additional lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]], presented at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html ''His Majesty'' homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie also wrote books on [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (1913) and [[Franz Liszt]] (1920). In his memoirs ''A Musician's Narrative'' (1927), he described "a lifetime spent, boy and man, in the service of British music".&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in ''The Musical Times'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aval Oru Thodharkadai''''' ({{lang-en|She is a Never Ending Story}}) is a 1974 [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film]] directed by [[K. Balachander]]. The story revolves around a working middle class woman, who sacrifices her life and desires to support her large family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=E-hkAAAAMAAJ |page= }} |title=Women in Films: An Incisive Study Into the Issues and Trends |author=R.

== Plot ==
Kavitha (Sujatha) is a working woman in a middle-class family. She works hard to support her [[widow]]ed sister, unmarried sister, her [[Blindness|blind]] younger brother, her mother, her drunkard brother Murthy (Jaiganesh) and his family. Her father abandons the family and becomes a [[saint]]. Her brother not only does not take responsibilities, but also creates additional problems for her. She has a longtime boyfriend of five years, Tilak ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) who wants to marry her, but she doesn't because of her commitment to her family. His eyes now wander to Kavitha's widowed younger sister Bharathi ([[Sripriya]]) who reciprocates his feelings. Kavitha, after reading her boyfriend's love letter to her sister, arranges for them to get married, thus giving up her chance of having a life with him. Meanwhile, Prasad (Kamalahasan) loves Bharathi, Kavitha's sister; but when he comes to know that she loves Tilak, he sacrifices his love for her and marries Kavitha's distressed friend, Chandra (Fatafat Jayalaxmi). Kavitha eventually accepts a marriage proposal of her boss (Gokulnath), when she realises that her brother has become responsible enough to take care of her family. She decides to resign from the hard work, but could not as the result of a turning point in a typical Balachandar-style climax. Kavitha swaps her unmarried sister as the bride in her stead, as she is informed of Murthy's death minutes before. In the end she resumes her job and continues to support the family.

== Production ==
Director [[K. Balachander]] saw the Malayalam film, ''[[Ernakulam Junction (film)|Ernakulam Junction]]'', where [[Sujatha (actress)|Sujatha]] had played the heroine and decided that she would play the role of the protagonist in his ''Aval Oru Thodar Kathai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C V Aravind |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/154101/subtle-yet-powerful.html |title=Subtle yet powerful |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When auditioning her, Balachander felt that her Malayalam accented Tamil may not be convincing for the role of Kavitha and sent her advising to learn and speak Tamil better. A month later, Balachander called Sujatha and gave the role, that marked her Tamil cinema debut.&lt;ref name="indiaglitz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/66002.html |title=Sujatha Oru Thodarkathai&amp;nbsp;– Tamil Movie News |publisher=Indiaglitz.com |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balachander introduced [[Fatafat Jayalaxmi]] in ''Aval Oru Thodar Kathai'' and the sobriquet "Fatafat" she got after she used the word in this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindu.com/fr/2002/05/03/stories/2002050300330300.htm |title=It's a heavy price to pay |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 May 2002 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors [[Jaiganesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindu.com/2001/02/13/stories/04132239.htm |title=Actor dead |publisher=The Hindu |date=13 February 2001 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sripriya]] (her first release, though she had worked for another film before) and Thideer Kanniah &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/99981.html |title=Thideer Kannaiya Passes Away&amp;nbsp;– Tamil Movie News |publisher=Indiaglitz.com |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also made their debuts with this film.

== Reception ==
The film is considered a classic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2011/03/19/stories/2011031951790400.htm |title=Metro Plus Visakhapatnam / Cinema : Women of substance |publisher=The Hindu |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cult film]].&lt;ref name="indiaglitz1" /&gt; [[Times of India]] named it one "of the landmark movies in the history of Tamil cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobiletoi.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article%3Dyes%26pageid%3D4%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D08-09-2010%26pubname%3DTimes+of+India+-+Chennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr00403%26publabel%3DTOI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210220211/http://mobiletoi.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=4&amp;sectid=edid%3D&amp;edlabel=TOICH&amp;mydateHid=08-09-2010&amp;pubname=Times+of+India+-+Chennai&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar00403&amp;publabel=TOI |archivedate=10 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 years after the film's release, directors [[Mani Ratnam]], [[K. Bhagyaraj]] and [[K. S. Ravikumar]] named ''Aval Oru Thodar Kathai'' as one of their favourite films.&lt;ref name="thehindu1" /&gt; Mani Ratnam said, "K.Balachandar has done some of the best films before and after ''Aval Oru Thodar Kathai''. But I choose it mainly for its storyline. It is not the plot or the story, but the character that carries the film through. Although it was released about 25 years ago, the character remains fresh in one’s memory. That is the greatness of the film".&lt;ref name="thehindu1" /&gt; Ravikumar stated, "Through his script and direction, Balachandar brings out the tender core of his middle-class heroine, assailed by problems, in ''Aval Oru Thodarkathai''."&lt;ref name="thehindu1" /&gt; Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi]] said, "Since Aval Oru Thodarkathai days, I am an avid fan of Balachander".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/cm-watches-special-screening-of-poi-tamil-news-25580|title=CM watches special screening of Poi|publisher=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, after Balachander had been given the [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]], [[Rediff]] named it one of Balachander's best and wrote, "''Aval Oru Thodarkadhai'' was one of his path-breaking works. Sujatha took on the mantle of Kavitha, the hard-working woman who struggles to support her largely ungrateful family. The tough exterior conceals a heart of gold, which, tragically, is never seen or recognised by her family. The film made waves not just for its principal characters who challenged Tamil cinema's set notions; it was also the dialogues that drew gasps from the audience. In creating Kavitha, K Balachander gave life to one of Tamil's most enduring, powerful female characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-south-ten-pathbreaking-films-by-k-balachander/20110502.htm#2|title=The Very Best of K Balachander|date=2 May 2011|work=Rediff|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu wrote, "Aval Oru Thodarkadhai is a film that will stay with you forever&amp;nbsp;— the invincible heroine was a big draw. And with AOT, Sujatha arrived! As the eldest daughter, who bears the onus of supporting a large family, she came up with a memorable performance. Her matter-of-fact approach to life was very fresh for Tamil audiences, who sang paeans to KB’s creative stroke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/women-of-steel/article5760715.ece|title=Women of Steel|author=Malathi Rangarajan|work=The Hindu|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aval Oru Thodarkathai'' is the second film in a series of woman-centric films by Balachander in which "the daughter has to make sacrifices and take care of her family" and a reviewer from [[Times of India]] wrote that it was a tough task to beat those films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/meiyyazhagi/movie-review/26412335.cms |title=Meiyyazhagi movie review: Wallpaper, Story, Trailer at Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=kuPaE3v22zAC |page=189 }} |title=Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's other Film Industry |publisher= |page=189 |date= |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The song "Kadavul Amaitha" inspired a 1979 film of [[Kadavul Amaitha Medai|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://play.raaga.com/tamil/album/Kadavul-Amaitha-Medai-songs-T0001623|title=Songs&amp;nbsp;– Tamil Movie Songs&amp;nbsp;– Raaga.com|work=Raaga.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song "Deivam Thantha" inspired a television series of [[Deivam Thandha Veedu|same name]] in Vijay TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/23frserials/article5056457.ece|title=23fr-serials|work=The Hindu|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was parodied by [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] in ''[[Parthiban Kanavu (2003 film)|Parthiban Kanavu]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''Parthiban Kanavu'' (DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the song sequence in the film featured Jai Ganesh as the character singing, it is often associated with [[Rajinikanth]], who played Murthy in the Telugu remake also by Balachander, ''Athuleni Katha'', and acted in the sequence of the same song in Telugu. Thus, Vivek is seen mimicking Rajinikanth's iconic cigarette-flicking mannerism during his parody.

Clips from ''Aval Oru Thodarkathai'' were screened along with clips from other films such as ''[[Server Sundaram]]'' (1964), ''[[Iru Kodugal]]'' (1969), ''[[Arangetram]]'' (1973), ''[[Avargal]]'' (1977) and ''[[Azhagan]]'' (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at [[Tiruchirappalli]] in January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rich-tributes-paid-to-balachander/article6810307.ece | title=Rich tributes paid to Balachander | newspaper=The Hindu | date=22 January 2015 | accessdate=2 May 2015 | author=G.

== Original and remakes ==
''Aval Oruuu Thodhar Kathai'' was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Anthuleni Katha]]'', also directed by K. Balachander. It was also shot in black and white. [[Jayaprada]] played the role of Sujatha, [[Rajnikanth]] did the role of Jaiganesh, making his debut in Telugu cinema,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sangeetha Devi Dundoo |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/the-man-behind-the-idol/article4328739.ece |title=The man behind the idol |publisher=The Hindu |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kamal Haasan did the role of Jayaprada's boss. Same tunes were used in both the languages.

Kamal Haasan made his Bengali film debut with this film by acting in the same role that he played in the Tamil original. [[Bharat Shamsher]] directed the black-and-white film. The film was again remade in Hindi as ''[[Jeevan Dhaara]]'' in 1982 by director [[T. Rama Rao]]. [[Rekha]] did the role of Jayaprada, [[Rakesh Roshan]] did the role of Kamal Haasan, [[Amol Palekar]] did the role of Narayana Rao. Kanwaljit did the conductor role, [[Simple Kapadia]] (sister of [[Dimple Kapadia]]) did Phataphat Jayalaxmi's role. The film was shot in colour. The film was a decent hit.&lt;ref name="Remakes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilcinemas.com/tamil/anthuleni-katha-telugu-film |title=Tamil Cinema News, Gossips, Gallery, Trailer and more... » Anthuleni Katha&amp;nbsp;– Telugu Film |publisher=Tamilcinemas.com |date= |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Balachander produced the [[Kannada language|Kannada]] remake titled ''[[Benkiyalli Aralida Hoovu]]'' starring Suhasini, whose real-life uncle Kamal Haasan played the guest role of a bus conductor in this remake. Balachander directed the film which was produced by [[Chandulal Jain]].

'''Bastar Iron Craft''' (also known as "Wrought iron craft of Baster") is a traditional Indian [[iron]] crafts that are manufactured in the [[Bastar district|Bastar]] district of [[Chhattisgarh]] state, [[India]]. The iron-crafting work has been protected under the [[geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 82 as "Bastar Iron Craft" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications|accessdate=5 July 2016|publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iron craft skill is passed through generation to generation in Bastar region. Some tribal communities are experts in iron craft work and many of them became as iron-smiths. Among many communities [[Gondi people|Gondi]] and [[Madiya language|Maria]] are notable for the traditional iron-crafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsource.in/resource/wrought-iron-craft-bastar/history | title=/ Wrought Iron Craft of Bastar - History | accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codex of Munich''' (or Munich Codex) is a part of the oldest known Hungarian translation of the Bible, called Bible of Hussittes (or the Hussite Bible). It was written at Tatros (today [[Târgu Trotuș]], Romania) in 1466. Today it is located in [[Munich]] at [[Bavarian State Library]]. (Cod. Hung. 1)

==Content==
Codex of Munich contains the Hungarian translation of the four [[Gospel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. At the [[recto and verso|recto]] of the 108th letter, at the end of [[Gospel of John]], there is written who made the copy, where and when it was produced. As it is written, script was finished by György Németi, Son of Imre Henzsel. There is no  further mention about him.

A '''color wheel''' or '''colour circle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory|title=Basic Color Theory|website=Color Matters|last=Morton|first=J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract illustrative organization of [[color]] [[hue]]s around a circle, which shows the relationships between [[primary color]]s, [[secondary color]]s, tertiary colors etc.

Some sources use the terms ''color wheel'' and ''color circle'' interchangeably;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Artist's Color Manual: The Complete Guide to Working With Color | author = Simon Jennings | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8118-4143-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8q9RV05uYC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=color-wheel+color-circle#PPA26,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Color Dimensions: Creating New Principles of Color Harmony and a Practical Equation in Color Definition | author = Faber Birren |authorlink=Faber Birren | publisher = Chicago: The Crimson Press | year = 1934 | isbn = 1-4286-5179-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ucTfVJnO-64C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=inauthor:birren+inauthor:faber+color-wheel+color-circle#PPA18,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, one term or the other may be more prevalent in certain fields or certain versions as mentioned above.  For instance, some reserve the term ''color wheel'' for mechanical rotating devices, such as color tops or filter wheels.  Others classify various color wheels as ''color disc'', ''color chart'', and ''color scale'' varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Elements of Natural Philosophy: For the Use of Schools and Academies | author = Joseph Anthony Gillet and William James Rolfe | year = 1881 | publisher = New York: Potter, Ainsworth | url = https://books.google.com/?id=8jYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=color-disc#PPA186,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an illustrative model, artists typically use [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]] primaries ([[RYB color model]]) arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Oil Painting Course You've Always Wanted: Guided Lessons for Beginners | author = Kathleen Lochen Staiger | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B4Q05KmkEdUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=color-wheel+artist+red+yellow+blue| isbn = 0-8230-3259-0 | year = 2006 | publisher = Watson–Guptill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[cyan]] as [[subtractive primaries]]. Intermediate and interior points of color wheels and circles represent color mixtures.  In a paint or subtractive color wheel, the "center of gravity" is usually (but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Color Harmony Pastels: A Guidebook for Creating Great Color Combinations | author = Martha Gill | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cl6ELZriVe0C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=color-wheel+scientific+traditional#PPA11,M1 | publisher = Rockport Publishers | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-56496-720-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) black, representing all colors of light being absorbed; in a color circle, on the other hand, the center is white or gray, indicating a mixture of different wavelengths of light (all wavelengths, or two complementary colors, for example).

The original color circle of [[Isaac Newton]] showed only the spectral hues and was provided to illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights, that these could be approximately predicted from the center of gravity of the numbers of "rays" of each spectral color present (represented in his diagram by small circles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Opticks|last=Newton|first=Isaac|publisher=|year=1704|isbn=|location=|pages=114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divisions of Newton's circle are of unequal size, being based on the intervals of a [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] musical scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/071.php#Newton_s_hue_system|title=Newton's hue system|last=Briggs|first=David|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most later color circles include the [[purple]]s, however, between red and violet, and have equal-sized hue divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Color | author = Steven K.

== Colors of the color wheel ==
[[File:RGV color wheel 1908.png|right|thumb|A 1908 color wheel with red, green, and violet "plus colors" and magenta, yellow, and cyan blue "minus colors"]]

The typical artists' paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue, red, and yellow [[primary color]]s. The corresponding [[secondary color]]s are green, orange, and violet or purple. The [[tertiary color]]s are green-yellow, yellow–orange, orange-red, red–violet/purple, purple/violet-blue and blue–green.

A color wheel based on [[RGB]] (red, green, blue) or RGV (red, green, violet) additive primaries has cyan, magenta, and yellow secondaries ([[cyan]] was previously known as cyan blue).  Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue (or violet) being secondaries.

Most color wheels are based on three primary colors, three secondary colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as tertiary colors, for a total of 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors.  Other color wheels, however, are based on the four [[opponent process|opponent]] colors, and may have four or eight main colors.

[[Goethe]]'s [[Theory of Colours]] provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color (1810). His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process|opponent color theory]] (1872).{{quote|text=...for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those that reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. |author=Goethe|title=[[Theory of Colours]]}}

==The color circle and color vision==
[[File:Opponent color circle 1917.png|right|thumb|A 1917 four-way color circle related to the color [[opponent process]]]]

A color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with [[red]] at one end of the spectrum and is 100% mixable [[Violet (color)|violet]] at the other. A wedge-shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency. These extra-spectral colors, the [[purple]]s, form from additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum.

In normal human vision, wavelengths of between about 400&amp;nbsp;nm and 700&amp;nbsp;nm are represented by this incomplete circle, with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum.  Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel.  These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing (such as are used in paint), but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white.&lt;ref name="complements"&gt;Krech, D., Crutchfield, R.S., Livson, N., Wilson, W.A. jr., Parducci, A. (1982) ''Elements of psychology'' (4th ed.). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: the reason that the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis tournament]] uses purple on the Wimbledon official logo is that purple is located almost opposite of green on the color wheel. Purple against green provides good contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Court Colors Give Way to a Kaleidoscope of Shades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/sports/tennis/french-open-courts-of-many-colors-in-tennis-world.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color circle is used for, among other purposes, illustrating [[additive color]] mixture. Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum may produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as [[Metamerism (color)|metameric]] matching.&lt;ref name="Schiffman"/&gt;  Thus a combination of green and red light might produce a color close to yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle, but they are usually represented as being joined by a straight line on the circle, the location of the new color closer to the (white) centre of the circle indicating that the resulting hue is less saturated (i.e., paler) than either of the two source colors. The combination of any two colors in this way are always less saturated than the two pure spectral colors individually.

Objects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions. The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by [[chromatic adaptation]]. This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead, and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon. The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions.

Arranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Newton's calculation of the resulting color involves three steps: First, mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight. Second, find the [[barycenter]] of these differently weighted colors. Third, interpret the radial distance (from the center of the circle to the barycenter) as the saturation of the color, and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color. Thus, Newton's color circle is a predecessor of the modern, horseshoe-shaped [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE color diagram.]]

The psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early [[color triangle]] of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], whose work was later extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].  Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations, or spectra of light.  As Maxwell showed, all hues, but not all colors, can be created from three [[primary color]]s such as red, green, and blue, if they are mixed in the right proportions.

==Color wheels and paint color mixing==
There is no straight-line relationship between colors mixed in pigment, which vary from medium to medium.  With a psychophysical color circle, however, the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights.&lt;ref name="Schiffman"&gt;Schiffman, H.R. (1990) Sensation and perception: An integrated approach (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 252-253.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints. As such, a painter's color wheel is indicative rather than predictive, being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures. Because of differences relating to the medium, different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used, and many artists make their own individual color wheels. These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;Rodwell, J. (1987) The complete watercolour artist. London: Paul Press, pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color wheel software==
{{Main|Color tool}}

A number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications. These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design.

== HSV color wheel ==
[[File:Hsv color circle.svg|thumb|right|A color wheel based on [[HSL and HSV|HSV]], labeled with HTML color keywords]]

The [[HSL and HSV]] color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the [[RGB color space|RGB]] cube into cylindrical form. The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder – or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder – can be thought of as a color wheel. There is no authoritative way of labeling the colors in such a color wheel, but the six colors which fall at corners of the RGB cube are given names in the [[X11 color names|X11 color list]], and are [[web colors#HTML color names|named keywords in HTML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=Basic HTML data types|publisher=[[W3C]]|work=HTML 4.01 Specification|date=24 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Color scheme}}

Color schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel.

[[File:Moses Harris, The Natural System of Colours.jpg|thumb|Moses Harris, in his book ''The Natural System of Colours'' (1776), presented this color palette.  Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other; for example, red and green are complementary colors. Tetradic color palettes use four colors, a pair of complementary color pairs. For example, one could use yellow, purple, red, and green. Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel.]]

In [[color theory]], a [[color scheme]] is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design.

Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes. A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based around a single color&amp;mdash;for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article.

[[File:020 schiffermueller1.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Schiffermüller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I. Color wheels can be used to create pleasing color schemes. An analogous color scheme is made up of colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, red, orange, and yellow are analogous colors.]]

Color schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (almost white) to very dark.

Analogous colors are colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, yellow and green.
Monochromic colors are different shades of the same color. For example, light blue, indigo, and cyan blue.
Complementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel. For example, blue and orange.
Triadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are triadic colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burnettsboards.com/2013/05/how-to-create-color-palettes/ How to create color palettes]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a list of ways to construct color schemes, regarding properties such as warmness/achromiticness/complementariness, see [[color theory]].

Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=del rosario |first1=Sivy |url=http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">The '''DVD Copy Control Association''' ('''DVD CCA''') is an organization primarily responsible for the [[copy protection]] of [[DVD]]s. The [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) was devised for this purpose to make [[copyright infringement]] difficult, but also presents obstacles to some [[Fair use|legitimate uses]] of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial [[Regional Playback Control]] (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.

As of 2001, members included film distributors such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Register: August 3, 2001 (Volume 66, Number 150) | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-19392-filed | accessdate=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2001 copyright reform: CMPDA reply | url=http://www.flora.ca/copyright-2001-cmpda-reply.shtml | accessdate=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They filed the much publicized case versus [[Jon Johansen]] who they alleged wrote [[DeCSS]]. The case was dropped in January 2004. CSS decrypting software (such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], and [[DVD Shrink]]) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes [[TiVo_Corporation#RipGuard|Macrovision]], CSS, [[DVD region code|region codes]], and [[user operation prohibition]]s. They also filed the suit ''[[DVD CCA v. Bunner]]'' against people who distributed DeCSS, seeking injunctions to stop further distribution based on trade secret claims. The injunction was eventually denied because CSS was no longer a secret by the time litigation occurred.

==Features restricted by manufacturers==
All{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} hardware manufacturers (especially DVD player/burner manufacturers) implement DVD CCA-mandated enforcement features on their products as RPC (which is one of three restrictions in the Content Scramble System); some even go beyond that and implement additional features to restrict [[ripping]], for example:
* [[Riplock|RIPLOCK]]: many manufacturers put an artificial limit, or lock, on ripping speeds. Some of these drives have alternative 3rd-party firmware that have this removed to enable faster ripping. See the RPC-1 Firmware Site for example.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Bitsetting/Booktyping: this is a feature which makes DVD+Rs readable by older DVD players that can play DVD-ROMS only. Some manufacturers disable this feature on their drives. Again, some alternative 3rd-party firmware can enable this so that burned DVDs appear as DVD-ROMs and are playable by older DVD players.{{Citation needed|reason=There is unfortunately no source given. Is there really some connection to the CCA?|date=November 2018}}

'''Docomomo International''' (sometimes written as '''DoCoMoMo''' or simply '''Docomomo''') is a non-profit organization whose full title is '''International Committee for Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement'''.

Mrinalini Rajagopalan, author of "Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity," described it as "the key body for the preservation of modernist architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n354cBry_6EC&amp;pg=PA324|title=The SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory|date=2012|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=9781446282632|edition=paperback|location=|page=324|chapter=Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity|quote=|via=|last1=Rajagopalan|first1=Mrinalini|editor1-last=Crysler|editor1-first=C. Greig|editor2-last=Cairns|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Heynen|editor3-first=Hilde|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its foundation was inspired by the work of ICOMOS, the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], established in 1965. The work of Icomos was concerned with the protection and conservation of historical buildings and sites, whereas Docomomo was founded to take up the challenge of the protection and conservation of [[Modern Architecture]] and [[Urbanism]].

Docomomo International was founded in [[Eindhoven]] in 1988 by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architects [[Hubert-Jan Henket]] and Wessel de Jonge. Henket chaired Docomomo International with de Jonge as secretary until September 2000 when the International Secretariat relocated to Paris, where it was hosted by the [[Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine]], in the [[Palais de Chaillot]]. The chair was Maristella Casciato, architect and architectural historian; with Émilie d'Orgeix, architectural historian, as secretary and Anne-Laure Guillet as director.

In 2008 there were 2,000 individual members. That year, 49 countries had national chapters and working parties of Docomomo. In 2010, the International Secretariat was relocated to Barcelona, hosted by the Fundació Mies van der Rohe. Ana Tostoes, architect and architect historian, chairs Docomomo International with Ivan Blasi, architect, as secretary. In 2014 the secretariat was transferred to the Instituto Superior Técnico at Lisbon, Portugal. Professor Tostoes remained as chair, with Zara Ferreira as secretary.

==Conferences and seminars==
Docomomo holds biennial international conferences where the people related to conservation issues gather and exchange information and studies pertaining to their scholarly research. The list of conferences held until now is as follows:

*1990 - Eindhoven, The Netherlands
*1992 - Bauhaus Dessau, Germany
*1994 - Barcelona, Spain
*1996 - Bratislava and Sliac, Slovakia
*1998 - Stockholm, Sweden
*2000 - Brasília, Brazil
*2002 - Paris, France
*2004 - New York, United States
*2006 - Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey
*2008 - Rotterdam, The Netherlands
*2010 - Mexico City, Mexico
*2012 - Espoo, Finland
*2014 - Seoul, South Korea
*2016 - Lisbon, Portugal

The International Scientific Committee on Technology (ISC/T) organizes seminars covering the following themes: restoration of reinforced concrete structures, curtain-wall facades, windows and glass, wood and the modern movement, colours in modern architecture and stone in modern buildings.

Seminars and conferences are often held in key modernist buildings, as for instance at [[Alvar Aalto]]’s [[Vyborg Library]] (2003 ISC/T seminar), Brinkman and [[Leendert van der Vlugt]]'s Van Nelle factory in [[Rotterdam]] (2008 Conference), and Gordon Bunshaft's [[Lever House]] in New York (closing party at 2004 Conference).

==Publications==
The ''Docomomo Journal'' is published twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, James P. and Evans Yankopolus, Jennifer, "Docomomo." ''Almanac of Architecture &amp; Design 2006''. Greenway Communications, November 1, 2005. {{ISBN|0975565427}}, 9780975565421. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh7ecV24_uAC&amp;pg=PA426 426].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work at national level==
Many countries have national Docomomo working parties, as either part of academic establishments or architecture federations. They may define gazetteers of important structures to be protected, such as [[DoCoMoMo Key Scottish Monuments]] and DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism,&lt;ref&gt;''DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism'', Maija Kairamo et al. (eds.), Helsinki: docomomo Suomi-Finland, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; or support local campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/07/18/why-we-have-to-protect-our-modern-buildings-91466-24172488/ Why we have to protect our modern buildings], ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation work by Docomomo together with others was recognised by the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] after a 2009 [[charrette]] to protect the former [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bell Labs charrette recognized by state", ''Greater Media Newspapers'', June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don't Bite the Pavement''' is a series of [[contemporary art]] exhibitions showcasing [[installation art]], expanded video, and [[experimental film]], which toured the west coast of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Jen|title=On Top of the Underground|agency=The News Tribune|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.artrod.org/history.html|website=Artrod Official|publisher=ArtRod|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Bite the Pavement|url=http://jwvpk.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/dont-bite-the-pavement-uk/|website=En Tarde-Garde|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

The Don't Bite the Pavement series began in 1999 in [[Olympia, Washington]] and eventually became a project of the organisation [[ArtRod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.artrod.org/history.html|website=Artrod Official|publisher=ArtRod|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each installment was loosely focused around an idea or theme and showcased innovative work by artists from around the world within the field of [[video art]], expanded media, [[microcinema]], or [[installation art]]; providing a space for this work to be presented and creating dialogues between the site and the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Jen|title=On Top of the Underground|agency=The News Tribune|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toby Room Issues|url=http://www.artrod.org/tobyroom_issues.html|website=ArtRod Official|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curatorial Projects|url=http://pappas-kelley.com/art/Curatorial_Projects.html|website=Pappas-Kelley|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Bite the Pavement|url=http://www.artrod.org/dontbite.html|website=ArtRod Official|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, artists and writers also began documenting and discussing this work in a reoccurring column likewise called Don't Bite the Pavement, which regularly featured interviews and articles in the journal [[Toby Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toby Room Issues|url=http://www.artrod.org/tobyroom_issues.html|website=ArtRod Official|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=Bridget|title=Champion for the White Collar Worker|url=http://www.filmanddestroy.org/bryanconnolly.htm|website=Film and Destroy|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Renwick|first1=Vanessa|title=Rising Up|url=http://www.odoka.org/the_work/rising_up/|website=ODOKA|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With each installment of the video series, Don't Bite the Pavement sought to create exhibitions that "engaged and challenged the community", while providing space and resources where artists could exhibit new work and develop novel approaches and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavage|first1=Sarah|title=Creative Class: Yes, it is About the Artists: The Tacoma Story|publisher=The Next American City|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Jen|title=On Top of the Underground|agency=The News Tribune|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Artforum]] contributor Emily Hall wrote that the project was "pulling together some of the most challenging and interesting work happening around Seattle" adding: "Let that be a modest but powerful lesson to all the naysayers and whiners who complain that innovative work isn't happening here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Emily|title=Toby Room|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/2005/07/toby_room|website=SLOG|publisher=The Stranger|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Lauren Steinhart characterized the project as: 
:"Each gathering of Don't Bite the Pavement was a chance for artists and viewers to gather, interact, and to show and discuss their work both completed and in-progress. In this way, DBtP became an integral and vital part of the arts community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Bite the Pavement|url=http://jwvpk.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/dont-bite-the-pavement-uk/|website=En Tarde-Garde|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early events included work by artists [[Wynne Greenwood]] ([[Tracy + the Plastics]]), Denise Baggett (Smith), [[Jared Pappas-Kelley]], Tim Sullivan, Anna Jordan Huff ([[Anna Oxygen]]), Cathy de la Cruz, [[Nathan Howdeshell]] (from the band [[the Gossip]]), April Levy, [[Michael Lent (visual artist)|Michael Lent]], Jason Gutz, Devon Damonte, Lauren Steinhart, Bryan Connolly, Bridget Irish, and has also included work by [[David Blandy]] and [[George Kuchar]] with the average screening consisting of pieces by emerging and established artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Bite the Pavement|url=http://www.artrod.org/dontbite.html|website=ArtRod Official|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egoresties.jpg|thumb|Orestes 1993]]
'''En Garde Arts''' is a New York City-based theatre company, and a pioneer in the field of [[immersive theater]].  

Founded in 1985 by [[Anne Hamburger]], the company was New York’s first exclusively site-specific theatre, leading audiences to unexpected locations across the city for innovative, contemporary, highly visual new work.  En Garde’s productions earned 6 [[OBIEs]], 2 [[Drama Desk Awards]] and the Special [[Outer Critics Circle Award]].  The company ceased operations in 1999 when Hamburger relocated to the West Coast, first as Artistic Director of the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], and later to run a global division for the [[Walt Disney Company]].   She returned to the east coast, reformed the company, and re-launched En Garde in the fall of 2014.

==En Garde Arts in the 80s and 90s==
From 1985-1999, Hamburger commissioned playwrights, directors and composers to create theatrical pieces for architectural sites and neighborhoods. The roster of En Garde’s alumni artists includes playwrights [[Charles L. Mee]], [[Mac Wellman]], [[Maria Irene Fornes]]; composers [[David Van Tieghem]], [[Jonathan Larson]]; directors [[Michael Engler]], [[Tina Landau]], [[Anne Bogart]], [[Reza Abdoh]], [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]] and [[Bill Rauch]]; and actors [[Carl Hancock Rux]], [[Fiona Shaw]], [[Fisher Stevens]], Tyne Daly and [[Jefferson Mays]]. Intrepid audiences followed their work to a variety of locations, including [[Central Park]], the [[Meatpacking District]],  [[Penn Yards]], [[East River Park]], Pier 25, the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], the Victory Theater ([[New Victory Theatre]], and the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets in Lower Manhattan.

In 1989, En Garde produced a series of three plays at the Dairy, [[Belvedere Castle]] and [[Bow Bridge(Central Park)]] in Central Park to great critical acclaim.  OBIE Awards for Best New American Play and Best Director were given to BAD PENNY playwright [[Mac Wellman]] and director [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]] .  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, “Moving environmentally through the streets and buildings of Manhattan, En Garde Arts is an invigorating urban presence.”  The following year, Wellman’s play CROWBAR became the first legitimate theatrical production to be held in 42nd Street’s Victory Theatre for 60 years.  Designed and built for [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] in 1900, the theatre’s elaborately decorated interior remained intact despite decades of neglect, including 20 years as porn theatre.  CROWBAR was produced before 42nd Street’s redevelopment, and En Garde Arts could not find a cleaning company willing to take on the job, so a group of volunteers cleaned the interior to make way for Mac Wellman’s new play.  Directed by Richard Caliban with music by David Van Tieghem, CROWBAR won OBIEs for En Garde Arts and actor [[Elzbieta Czyzewska]], and was granted a Special Award by the Outer Critics Circle.

Now firmly in league with New York’s most influential and innovative theatre companies, En Garde continued to produce iconoclastic, critically acclaimed, award-winning work throughout the 1990s.  Reza Abdoh &amp; Mira-Lani Oglesby’s spectacular, AIDS era cri de coeur, FATHER WAS A PECULIAR MAN took place over 9 distinct locations through the Meatpacking District, long before its gentrification.   [[File:Wall street (4).jpg|thumb|J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation 1995]]  In an abandoned Victorian hospital on West 106th Street, Charles L. Mee’s ANOTHER PERSON IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY confronted the social marginalization of unconventional people; in fact, it was a celebration of difference, played like a beautiful human symphony under a blanket of stars. Director Anne Bogart’s cast included a blind choir with seeing-eye dogs, a group of emotionally disturbed rock musicians, and a man and woman, both 3’ tall, all staged against the gothic, empty Towers Nursing Home([[New York Cancer Hospital]]).  The evening ended with a stunning waterfall cascading down the building’s stone facade.

En Garde would win further OBIE Awards for Tina Landau &amp; Charles L. Mee’s  ORESTES in the Penn Yards, and Trojan Women in East River Park Amphitheatre. Deborah Warner’s adaptation of The Wasteland with Fiona Shaw earned two Drama Desk Awards.  Hamburger used the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as a backdrop for JP MORGAN SAVES THE NATION by composer [[Jonathan Larson]].  On opening night, he slipped her a cassette tape of the work he was just developing; it would become the musical phenomenon [[RENT]]. Hamburger was recognized with the Edwin Booth and Lee Reynolds Awards for the impressive body of her work.  In 1999, she was offered and accepted the post of Artistic Director with the La Jolla Playhouse.  Within six months of moving to California, she received an offer to establish a new creative division for the Walt Disney Company, where she remained until returning to New York.

==Re-launch==
Hamburger re-launched En Garde Arts in 2014 with [[BASETRACK Live]], a gripping, multimedia fusion of music, film, photojournalism and performance, that explores the impact of war on veterans and their families.   The show was developed in collaboration with the corpsmen and families of the 1st Battalion 8th Marines. BASETRACK Live, created by Edward Bilous, music direction by Michelle DiBucci, directed by Seth Bockley, co-adapted by Jason Grote with Seth Bockley and Anne Hamburger.  Music Co-Composed by Edward Bilous, Michelle DiBucci and Greg Kalember. Anne Hamburger, Executive Producer,  Portia Kamons, Producer  (Inspired by the website One-Eight Basetrack, a citizen journalism project featuring the work of Teru Kuwayama, Balazs Gardi and Tivadar Domaniczky). The production premiered in Austin, TX in September 2014, and is touring to over 40 cities nationally with a New York premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on [[Veterans Day]] 2014.  BASETRACK Live was invited to Fort Hood at the invitation of the Commanding General to encourage active duty soldiers to avail themselves of mental health services.   Six months of research by the Intrepid Behavioral Health Center determined that 36% of the soldiers that came to the show sought out help for the first time.

==BOSSS==
En Garde Arts continued to grow, creating the highly anticipated Emerging Arts Festival BOSSS (Big Outdoor Site Specific Stuff) in the fall of 2015. Beginning in early 2015, Hamburger gathered multiple artists together once a week to brainstorm ideas. Hamburger mentored the artists as pieces began to take shape, working with the Hudson River Park as a performance space. Completely free to the public, the festival featured 9 site-specific shows, including a feminist march through the park, to a first date with Bina48, the most advanced artificial intelligence-enabled robot in the world. After complications due to tropical storm Joaquin, the festival was moved from its original dates in early October to the weekend of October 23rd.
En Garde Arts plans to make BOSSS an annual event.

{{Fantasy}}
A '''fantasy world''' is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games.  Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', pp. 166–7, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, either a [[historical]] or [[futuristic]] theme. Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

The '''Fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere''' is a fountain  located in the square in front of the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Rome]], Italy.  It is believed to be the oldest fountain in Rome, dating back, according to some sources, to the 8th century.  The present fountain is the work of [[Donato Bramante]], with later additions by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and [[Carlo Fontana]]. &lt;ref&gt;Maurizia Tazartes, ''Fontaines de Rome'', pg. 48 &lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
A fountain is believed to have stood in this square since the 8th century, but the exact date it was built is unknown.  The fountain is first mentioned in documents dating to the second half of the 15th century.   A drawing of the fountain appears on the map of Rome made by Pietro del Massaio in 1471,  along with a description of the legend of the fountain's origin. According to the legend,  which appears in the ''Chronicle'' of [[Eusebius]],  translated and finished by [[Saint Jerome]] in the fifth century, on the night of the birth of Christ a fountain of oil appeared miraculously in front of the church, which as a result was given the name "Santa Maria in fontibus."   The original fountain was supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct, the [[Aqua Traiana]].  When the aqueduct was ruined during the invasions of Rome,  water came from underground sources below the [[Janiculum]] hill.  The old fountain illustrated in the drawing of del Massaio had two vasques, one above the other, pouring water into the basin below.  &lt;ref&gt; Maurizia Tazartes, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was reconstructed between 1499 and 1500 on the command of Giovanni Lopez, the bishop of Perouse and Bishop of the parish of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]],  who gave the commission to [[Donato Bramante]], the architect of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  Bramante removed the upper vasque and added four carved stone wolf heads, the emblem of the Lopez family. 

The fountain was reconstructed again in 1604 by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, the father of [[Carlo Rainaldi]],the architect of the two churches of [[Piazza del Popolo]].  At that time the fountain was connected to the newly restored [[Acqua Felice]] aqueduct.    In 1659 the fountain was connected to the [[Acqua Paola]] aqueduct and remodeled again by [[Bernini]].  Bernini replaced the octagonal basin,  moved the fountain from its original place in front of the church to a new location in the center of the square, and added sculpted seashells around the basin.   At the end of the 17th century, the architect [[Carlo Fontana]] replaced Bernini's seashells with his own sculpted seashells.  

The fountain was completely rebuilt in 1873, following the design of Bernini and Fontana, but using less expensive materials. In that occasion, the main pool was rebuilt with bardiglio marble and an imposing S.P.Q.R. sign has been placed on the external side of the shells.
It was rebuilt once again in 1930. The last maintenance has been made in 1984.

The '''Gamergate controversy''' stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[hashtag]] #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture. ''Gamergate'' is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.

In August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the [[video game industry]]; notably game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and [[Brianna Wu]], as well as feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]]. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included [[doxing]], threats of rape, and death threats. 

Gamergate proponents ("Gamergaters") said that they were a movement, but had no official leaders, spokespeople, or manifesto.  Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymously]] on online platforms such as [[4chan]], [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[Twitter]], and [[Reddit]]. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent and contradictory, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.

The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a [[right-wing]] backlash against progressivism. 

Industry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimise harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.

==History==

===Zoë Quinn and ''Depression Quest''===
In 2013, [[Zoë Quinn]], an independent game developer, released ''[[Depression Quest]]'', a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression though a series of fictional scenarios,{{refn|name=Kidd &amp; Turner}}{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}} based in part on Quinn's own experience with the illness.{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} The game received positive reviews in the gaming media, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=43}};  {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who opposed "political" intrusions into gamer culture.{{refn|name=Salter}} Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release,&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KernelMag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; including rape and death threats.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}} Quinn documented the harassment she received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to an even greater intensity of abuse against her, including the posting of her home address online.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=43–45}} She ultimately fled her house out of fear for her safety.{{refn|name=Parkin}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}

[[File:Zoe Quinn Car 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Game developer [[Zoë Quinn]], the initial target of the harassment campaign]]

The event that would come to be known as Gamergate began in 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=29}}{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Mantilla}} Called the "Zoe Post",{{efn |Gjoni initially published the post on the video-game sites ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' and ''[[Something Awful]]''. After it was removed by the sites' moderators, Gjoni published "The Zoe Post" via the blogging platform WordPress.{{refn|name=Jason}}}} it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup{{sfnp|Jane|2017|pp=29-30}} that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; The blog falsely implied that Quinn had gotten a favorable review of ''Depression Quest'' because of her sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a video-game reviewer for the website ''[[Kotaku]]''.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=30}}{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=316}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}} Grayson never actually reviewed Quinn's games, and Grayson's only article mentioning her was published before their relationship began.&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canadacom" /&gt; Gjoni later updated his blog post to acknowledge this,&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt; saying that a typographical error was to blame.{{refn|name=Jane}} Nonetheless, a link to the blog posted on [[4chan]], where many participants had previously been highly critical of ''Depression Quest'', led to renewed attacks on Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=44}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}; {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gjoni's blog post, Quinn and her family were subjected to a virulent and often [[misogynistic]] harassment campaign.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name="nybooks 2015-06-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeronBelford2014/&gt; Online attackers of Quinn at first used the label "Quinnspiracy",{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}{{refn|name=Shaw &amp; Chess 2016}}{{refn|name=Aghazadeh et al}} later adopting the [[hashtag]] "#Gamergate" after it was coined by the actor [[Adam Baldwin]],{{efn |Baldwin, known for his right-wing political views,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|p=130}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted the hashtag #GamerGate near the end of August alongside a pair of videos promoting the "Quinnspiracy" by a YouTube user called Internet Aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|pp=129–130}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later tell an interviewer that a left-wing "culture war" was imposing "political crap" on gamers.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Kaufman}}}} whose nearly 190,000 Twitter followers helped the spread of the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment of Gamergate targets was coordinated via [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), spreading rapidly over [[imageboard]]s and forums like 4chan and [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="TeleStuart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Within four months of the start of Gamergate, Quinn's record of threats she had received had grown 1,000-fold.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Jason}} At a conference Quinn said, "I used to go to game events and feel like I was going home&amp;nbsp;[...] Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?".&lt;ref name=BBCQuinnInterview /&gt; One anonymous 4chan user threatened to "give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} Commentators both inside and outside the video game industry condemned the attacks against Quinn.&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; The attacks included [[doxing]] (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual) and hacking of her [[Tumblr]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], and [[Skype]] accounts; she was again subjected to rape and death threats.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; Quinn again fled her home to stay with friends.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Jason}} She wrote that "the Internet spent the last month spreading my personal information around, sending me threats, hacking anyone suspected of being friends with me, calling my dad and telling him I’m a whore, sending nude photos of me to colleagues, and basically giving me the 'burn the witch' treatment".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}

===Other targets of harassment===

Gamergate supporters subjected others to similar harassment, doxing, and death threats. Those who came to the victims' defense were ridiculed as "white knights", or "[[social justice warrior]]s" (SJWs);&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; this characterization was intended, according to Heron, Belford and Goker, to neutralize any opposition by questioning their motives.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Shortly after the Gamergate hashtag was coined, video game developer [[Phil Fish]] had his personal information, including various accounts and passwords, hacked and publicly posted in retaliation for defending Quinn and attacking her detractors.&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name=BI/&gt; The hacks and doxing also exposed documents relating to Fish's company, Polytron.&lt;ref name=DailyFish/&gt; As a result, Fish left the gaming industry and put Polytron up for sale, calling the situation "unacceptable" and saying, "it's not worth it".&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name="gs fish" /&gt;

[[File:Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg|thumb|Feminist and media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]] received death threats after releasing a ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' video.]]

The campaign expanded to include renewed harassment of prominent&lt;ref name="prominent 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2" /&gt; feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], who had previously been a target of online harassment due in part to her YouTube video series ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'', which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper.&lt;ref name="TheStar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TorontoExclusive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cosmo" /&gt; After a new episode of ''Tropes vs. Women'' was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home.&lt;ref name="BusinessWeekSarkessian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; At the [[XOXO (festival)|XOXO]] arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that "one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all&amp;nbsp;[...] They see themselves as noble warriors".&lt;ref name=VergeXOXO /&gt;

Sarkeesian canceled an October 2014 speaking appearance at [[Utah State University]] (USU) after the school received three anonymous threats, the second of which claimed affiliation with Gamergate.&lt;ref name="SLT ALberty101614" /&gt; The initial threat proposed that "a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center", alluding to the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], a 1989 mass shooting motivated by [[antifeminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre-threat-ctv" /&gt; USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff or the speaker.&lt;ref name=USUthreat/&gt;  Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's [[Open carry in the United States|open carry]] laws, leading to the cancellation.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUBBC /&gt;  The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation.&lt;ref name="venturebeat mainstream"/&gt; Wingfield of ''The New York Times'' referred to the threat as "the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture".&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats.&lt;ref name=HJFBI/&gt; The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others.&lt;ref name="FBI 2017Jan27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed" /&gt;
[[File:Brianna Wu next to Motorcycle.jpg|thumb|Video game developer [[Brianna Wu]] suffered Gamergate-related harassment beginning in late 2014.]]

In mid-October [[Brianna Wu]], another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio [[Giant Spacekat (company)|Giant Spacekat]], saw her home address and other identifying information posted on [[8chan]] as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WuBoston /&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeFeature /&gt; Wu announced an {{US$|11000}} reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online.&lt;ref name="wu reward"/&gt; As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.&lt;ref name="csm 20160411" /&gt;

Harassment related to Gamergate continued for several months after the onset of the controversy. Two critics of Gamergate were targets of attempted "[[swatting]]"—hoaxed reports to emergency services intended to provoke a [[SWAT]] team response at the target's home. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that both swatting attempts were coordinated through the "[[Baphomet#Modern interpretations and usage|baphomet]]" subforum of 8chan.&lt;ref name="ars swatting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian swatting" /&gt; After the initial rush of threats that caused her to flee her home, Wu documented receiving roughly 45 death threats by April 2015; Silicon Valley investor [[Marc Andreessen]] offered up to a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those who made the threats.&lt;ref name="inc" /&gt; Wu's studio, Giant Spacekat, withdrew from the Expo Hall of [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX East 2015]]. Wu cited security concerns, lack of confidence in the management and their failure to return calls.&lt;ref name="wu pax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat 2015-02-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-02-24" /&gt;

Actress and gamer [[Felicia Day]] wrote a blog post about her concerns over Gamergate and her fear of retaliation if she spoke against it. Almost immediately her home address and phone number were posted online, leading to harassing letters and phone calls.&lt;ref name="seattletimes 2015-09-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayGuardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayTime /&gt; Actor [[Wil Wheaton]] and former [[NFL]] player [[Chris Kluwe]] also posted criticisms of Gamergate. [[Stephen Colbert]] questioned why men like Kluwe had not been threatened by Gamergate, noting that the targets were almost entirely women.&lt;ref name=ColbertVerge /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPoColbert /&gt;

Some who have identified as Gamergate supporters said that they have been harassed.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt; YouTube personality [[Boogie2988|Steven "Boogie2988" Williams]] remarked that a comment on one of his videos included his address and a threat to his wife's life.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Codd /&gt; In an interview with [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]], Gamergate supporter [[TotalBiscuit|John Bain]], known by his YouTube moniker "TotalBiscuit", said he had been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate.&lt;ref name="bbc3 2016-03-16" /&gt; Mike Diver wrote in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt; According to the BBC, the technology writer [[Allum Bokhari]] said that a "well-known trolling group" was "working to provoke both sides against each other".&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

Bomb threats have also been made towards events attended by Gamergate supporters. A May 2015 meeting in Washington D.C. arranged by writer [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and journalist [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] was the target of a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to local police responding to information supplied by the FBI.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-05-03" /&gt; During "Airplay", an event run by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] in August 2015, multiple bomb threats were made. This led to the evacuation of the building and the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-08-16"/&gt;

===Coordination of harassment===

Gamergate harassment was orchestrated largely through anonymous message boards such as [[4chan]], [[8chan]], and [[Reddit]],{{refn|name=Nieborg &amp; Foxman}}{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=41}} particularly the "KotakuInAction" [[Subreddits|subreddit]].&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=47}} ''[[Ars Technica]]'' reported that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]] accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using [[Astroturfing|astroturf]] campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Mortensen wrote in ''[[Games and Culture]]'' that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it to create an environment where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;

There has been considerable discussion of [[Norm (social)|self-policing]] and the [[Collective responsibility|responsibility]] supporters of Gamergate share when the hashtag is used for harassment. A number of websites have blocked users, removed posts, and created policies to prevent their users from threatening Quinn and others with doxing, assault, rape and murder, and planning and coordinating such threats.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt;&lt;ref name=dot /&gt; 4chan founder [[Christopher Poole]] banned all discussion of Gamergate on the site as more attacks occurred, leading to Gamergate supporters using 8chan as their central hub.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost 8chan"/&gt;

Many Gamergate supporters have denied that the harassment took place, or falsely accused victims of fabricating the evidence.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; Gamergate supporters have used the term "Literally Who" to refer to victims of harassment such as Quinn, saying they are not relevant to Gamergate's goals and purposes. Commentators have decried the use of such terminology as dehumanizing, and said that discussions on Gamergate forums often center around those referred to as "Literally Who".&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt; Some Gamergate supporters have denounced the harassment, arguing that the perpetrators are in the minority and do not represent them.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;

By September 24, 2014, over one million Twitter messages incorporating the Gamergate hashtag had been sent.&lt;ref name="metro what is gg" /&gt; A ''[[Newsweek]]'' and [[Brandwatch]] analysis found more than two million Twitter messages between September and October 2014.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch" /&gt; Software developer [[Andy Baio]] also produced an analysis of #Gamergate tweets showing a discussion that was polarized between pro- and anti-Gamergate factions. One quarter of the tweets sampled were produced by users new to Twitter, most of whom were pro-Gamergate.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-10-28" /&gt; While the number of Gamergate supporters is unclear, in October 2014 ''[[Deadspin]]'' estimated 10,000 supporters based on the number of users discussing Gamergate on Reddit.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

==Organization==

The series of events that came to be known as Gamergate has been described as "torturously complex".{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As a movement, it had no official leaders or clearly defined agenda.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|pp=113-114}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=41–42}} Because of its anonymous membership, lack of organization and leaderless nature, sources differ as to the goals or mission of Gamergate and defining it has been difficult.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Frank Lantz of [[NYU]]'s Game Center wrote that he could not find "a single explanation of a coherent Gamergate position".&lt;ref&gt;Lantz, quoted in {{harvp|Meyer|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', told the ''Columbia Journalism Review'': "The closest thing we've been able to divine is that it's noise. It's chaos&amp;nbsp;[...] all you can do is find patterns. And ultimately Gamergate will be defined—I think has been defined—by some of its basest elements."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, quoted in {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

As the threats expanded, international media focused on Gamergate's violent, misogynistic element and its inability to present a coherent message. Bob Stuart, in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' reported that "Gamergate has since swelled into an unwieldy movement with no apparent leaders, mission statement, or aims beyond calling out 'social justice warriors'.&amp;nbsp;[...] When members of the games industry are being driven from their houses and jobs, threatened, or abused, it makes Gamergate's claim that it is engaged in an ethical campaign appear laughable."&lt;ref name=TeleStuart /&gt; The campaign's focus broadened to take on other targets in the news media, as with [[Bollea v. Gawker|Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media]].&lt;ref name="NYTThielGawker" /&gt;

Jesse Singal, in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', stated that he had spoken to several Gamergate supporters to try to understand their concerns, but found conflicting ideals and incoherent messages. Singal observed Gamergate supporters making a constant series of attacks on Quinn, Sarkeesian, and other women, while frequently stating that Gamergate "is not about" them.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' said that any legitimate message from Gamergate supporters regarding ethics in journalism was lost in the noise created by harassment, sexism, and misogyny.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} With anyone able to tweet under the hashtag and no single person willing or able to represent the hashtag and take responsibility for its actions, Ip said it is not possible for journalists to neatly separate abusers from those seeking reasonable debate.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; 

[[Jon Stone (poet)|Jon Stone]] wrote in ''The Guardian'' that {{Nowrap|"[Gamergate]}} readjusts and reinvents itself in response to attempts to disarm and disperse its noxiousness, subsuming disaffected voices in an act of continual regeneration, cycling through targets, pretexts, manifestoes, and moralisms".&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; ''Polygon''{{'}}s Grant said that Gamergate has remained amorphous and leaderless so that the harassment can be conducted without any culpability.&lt;ref name="OTMGrant" /&gt;{{Time needed|date=May 2018}}

===Harassment and Twitter===

While organized through anonymous message boards such as 4chan and Reddit, Gamergate harassment was most prominent on Twitter. Michael Salter, a [[University of Western Sydney]] criminologist,  writes that Twitter's design and architecture was "highly conducive" to such abuse campaigns, allowing Gamergaters to overwhelm users' ability to individually block the large numbers of fake or "sockpuppet" accounts used to send abusive and harassing messages.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=47–48}} 

Twitter was criticized for its inability to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt; Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by the ease with which anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints.&lt;ref name="businessweek wu twitter"/&gt; Robinson Meyer of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said Gamergate is an "identity crisis" for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

Early on during Gamergate, software developer Randi Harper started the "Good Game Auto Blocker" or "ggautoblocker", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically [[block (Internet)|blocked]], therefore reducing the degree of harassment received.&lt;ref name="verge 2015-06-10" /&gt; In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group "Women, Action &amp; the Media" (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while arising in the wake of the Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet.&lt;ref name="wiredWAMTwitterHarassment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVergeWAMTwitter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wam release" /&gt; In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.&lt;ref name="wam report" /&gt;

===Efforts to affect public perceptions===

Early in the controversy, posters on 4chan focused on donating to a self-described [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] group called [[The Fine Young Capitalists]] (TFYC), who had been embroiled in a dispute with Quinn over a female-only game development contest they had organized. Advocating donations to help TFYC create the game, posters on 4chan's politics board argued that such donations would make them "look really good" and would make them "PR-untouchable".&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-11-03" /&gt;

To respond to widespread criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended to show that Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed as a way to "demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, "#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic".&lt;ref name=Escapist4chan /&gt; [[Arthur Chu]] wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage [[white guilt]] and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Chu2014" /&gt;

===Targeting advertisers===

Gamergate supporters were critical of the wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose from a list of target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser.&lt;ref name=waposuccess /&gt; [[Intel]] reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy&lt;ref name="GIBizIntel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeIntelStatement" /&gt; and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.&lt;ref name="Intel_Telegraph" /&gt;

===Sad Puppies===
Gamergate became associated with the "[[Sad Puppies]]" and "Rabid Puppies" during [[Hugo Awards#Since 2000|2015 Hugo Awards]] for science fiction writing. These groups organized [[voting bloc]]s that dominated the 2015 Hugo Awards. The campaign was described as a backlash against the increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in science fiction. Members of the bloc said that they sought to counteract what they saw as a focus on giving awards based on the race, ethnicity, or gender of the author or characters rather than quality, and bemoaning the increasing prominence of what they described as 'message' fiction with fewer traditional "zap gun" sciencefictional trappings.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2015-04-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes 2015-08-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-08-23" /&gt; By 2018, the Sad Puppies had diminished visibility, and Quinn's 2017 memoir, ''[[Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate]]'', was nominated for the 2018 [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]] (for non-fiction works related to science fiction or fantasy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/03/31/2018-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |title=2018 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |date=2018-03-31 |work=Tor.com |access-date=2018-08-27 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics in journalism complaints==
The most active Gamergate supporters or "Gamergaters"{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}}{{refn|name=Braithwaite}} said that Gamergate was a movement for ethics in games journalism and that any harassment of women was done by others not affiliated with Gamergate.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}}{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}} They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues,&lt;ref name="KernelMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt; leading to conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt; Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as ''[[Depression Quest]]'' and ''[[Gone Home]]'', which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]]  as downplayed.&lt;ref name="overland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willametteweek" /&gt; Journalists who did not cover the examination into Quinn's private life were accused of conspiracy, and a [[blacklist]] circulated by Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name=ibtimes1 /&gt;

Observers in the media have largely rejected these claims as baseless. Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' wrote that "many criticisms of press coverage by people who identify with Gamergate&amp;nbsp;[...] have been debunked" and concluded that "at core, the movement is a classic culture war".&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; Writing in ''Vox'', Todd VanDerWerff said that "[e]very single question of journalistic ethics Gamergate has brought up has either been debunked or dealt with".&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt; According to [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]], then editor-at-large of ''Gamasutra'', the ethics concerns were a [[conspiracy theory]], albeit a sincere one; Alexander writes that there is nothing unethical about journalists being acquainted with those they cover and that meaningful reporting requires journalists to develop professional relationships with sources.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; ''Ars Technica'', ''Vox'', and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', among others, stated that discussions of gender equality, sexism and other social issues in game reviews present no ethical conflict.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt;&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt;&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

Several writers who attempted to understand Gamergate's motivations concluded that, rather than relating to purported issues with gaming journalism ethics, Gamergate represented an effort to suppress opposing views.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeDead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoRosenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Salter writes that "mass media had a decisive role in evaluating the competing claims of Gamergate and its critics, and ultimately dismissing Gamergate as a misogynist abuse campaign".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=55}} Screenshots of 4chan boards, collected and published by Quinn, suggested that complaints about ethics in games journalism were invented ''post hoc'' by Gamergaters to distract critics from their ongoing abuse of her.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=46}}{{refn|name=Johnston September 2014}} Jay Hathaway wrote at ''Gawker'' that this strategy emerged once Gamergaters found that harassing Quinn about her sexual history was unlikely to win them support; according to Hathaway, IRC chat logs showed that "the [Gamergate] movement was focused on destroying Zoë Quinn first, reforming games reporting second".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=85}} (attributed to T.C. Sottek)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Hathaway}}

Other commentators argued that Gamergate had the potential to raise significant issues in gaming journalism, but that the wave of misogynistic harassment and abuse associated with the hashtag had [[poisoned the well]], making it impossible to separate honest criticism from sexist trolling.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Visible support for Gamergate in the form of tweets, online videos, and blogs seldom involved discussion of ethics, but often featured misogynistic and/or racist commentary.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2017"/&gt; The targets were mainly female game developers, academics, and writers.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=33}}

Researchers at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]] described Gamergate as a "vitriolic campaign against Quinn that quickly morph[ed] into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism" which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics.&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Concerns have also been raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed to be interested in journalism ethics, their "misogynistic and threatening" behavior belied this claim. "Much of the conversation—if I can even call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior."&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

After analyzing a sample of tweets related to Gamergate, ''Newsweek'' concluded that it was primarily about harassment rather than ethics, stating that the sample "suggests that&amp;nbsp;[...] contrary to its stated goal, Gamergate spends more time tweeting negatively at game developers than at game journalists".&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt; Casey Johnston wrote for ''Ars Technica'' that, based on logs from the 4chan users who initially pushed Gamergate into the spotlight, the goal behind the hashtag campaign was to "perpetuate misogynistic attacks by wrapping them in a debate about ethics".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; An academic analysis of a week's worth of public posts tagged with #Gamergate found that the [[issue public]]s involved were not "only or even primarily" concerned with ethics in gaming journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess &amp; Matamoros-Fernández, quoted in {{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BurgessMatamoros-Fernández2016" /&gt;

In an interview with Anita Sarkeesian in ''The Guardian'', [[Jessica Valenti]] said that "the movement's much-mocked mantra, 'It's about ethics in journalism{{'"}} was seen by others as "a natural extension of sexist harassment and the fear of female encroachment on a traditionally male space". Sarkeesian asked, "if this 'movement' was about journalism, why wasn't it journalists who had to deal with a barrage of rape and death threats?".&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; Wu told ''The Boston Globe'' that the ethics claims were "a pretext" and described Gamergate as "an actual hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] they're upset and threatened by women who are being very outspoken about feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Wu, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Gamergate has been criticized for focusing on women, especially female developers, while ignoring many large-scale journalistic ethics issues. Alex Goldman of NPR's ''On the Media'' criticized Gamergate for targeting female indie developers rather than [[AAA (game industry)|AAA games publishers]], and said claims of unethical behavior by Quinn and Sarkeesian were unfounded.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt; In ''Wired'', Laura Hudson found it telling that Gamergate supporters concentrated on impoverished independent creators and critics, and nearly exclusively women, rather than the large game companies whose work they enjoyed.&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt; ''Vox'' writer Todd VanDerWerff highlighted an essay written by game developer David Hill, who said that corruption, [[nepotism]], and excessive [[commercialism]] existed in the gaming industry, but that Gamergate was not addressing those issues.&lt;ref name=VoxConfuse /&gt; Adi Robertson, of ''The Verge'', commented on the long-standing ethical issues gaming journalism has dealt with, but that most Gamergate supporters did not seem interested in "addressing problems that don't directly relate to feminist criticism or the tiny indie games scene".&lt;ref name=VergeDay/&gt;

{{anchor|GameJournoPros}}In mid-September 2014, [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], vocal critic of feminism and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a mailing list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the [[Breitbart News]] website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list as evidence of collusion among journalists.&lt;ref name=GGJargon /&gt; The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn in response to the harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate.&lt;ref name=GJPresponse /&gt;&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt; Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest.&lt;ref name=westmanjournal/&gt; Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt;

==Social and cultural implications==
Observers have generally described Gamergate as part of a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s digital culture writer [[Caitlin Dewey]] said that "Whatever Gamergate may have started as, it is now an Internet culture war" between predominantly female game developers and critics advocating for greater inclusion, and "a motley alliance of vitriolic naysayers" opposed to such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, quoted in {{harvp|Hanson|2017|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Guide to Gamergate}} ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women.&lt;ref name=VoxLose/&gt; ''Ars Technica'' quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Gamergate has been described as being driven by antifeminist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-06-12" /&gt; Some supporters have denied this, but acknowledge that there are misogynistic voices within Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vice /&gt; Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in ''Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies'' "in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens."&lt;ref name="nordic" /&gt; Jon Stone, in ''The Guardian'', called it a "swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment" and compared it to the [[men's rights movement]].&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt; Commentators such as Stone, [[Liana Kerzner]], and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming.&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MetalEater2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name="DipCour" /&gt; Some figures associated with Gamergate went on to become components of the so-called [[alt-right]], &lt;ref name="Alt-right Component" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein J"/&gt; which thus  featured in the [[2016 American presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Alt-right precursor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="From Video Games to Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Old Racism, New Technology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimesHollywoodGG" /&gt;

Quinn said the campaign had "roped well-meaning people who cared about ethics and transparency into a pre-existing hate mob",&lt;ref name="ViceQuinn" /&gt; and urged industry publishers and developers to condemn the hashtag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt; She further asked those Gamergate supporters who had any earnest discussion about ethics to move away from the "Gamergate" tag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

===Gamer identity===

Gamergate is often considered to be a reaction to the changing cultural identity of the "[[gamer]]". As video games grew in mainstream popularity during the 1990s, a "gamer" identity emerged around games marketed to an audience that was predominantly young, male and heterosexual. Over the years, the growing popularity of games expanded that audience to include many who did not fit the traditional gamer demographic, particularly women.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}} Games with artistic and cultural themes grew in popularity, and [[independent video game development]] made these games more common, while [[mobile games|mobile]] and [[casual games|casual]] games expanded the scope of the industry beyond the traditional gamer identity.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; The games most popular with typical "gamers", often featuring explicit violence along with exaggerated gender stereotypes, were joined by a more diverse set of games that included gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. "Indie" gaming blogs and websites were created to comment on these developments, in contrast to the more established gaming press, which was traditionally dependent on the games industry itself.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}}

The media-studies scholar Adrienne Massanari writes that Gamergate is a direct response to such changes in video-game content as well as changes in the demographics of players.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Surveys by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] in 2014 and 2015 showed that video-game players were between 44% and 48% female,&lt;ref name="gamesindustry women" /&gt;{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} with an average age of thirty-five.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} This broader audience began to question some assumptions and [[fantasy tropes and conventions|tropes]] that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw write that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences.&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; Gamergaters often dismiss such games and their more diverse, casual group of players as being not "real" games or gamers.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Alyssa Rosenberg of ''The Washington Post'' said that some of Gamergaters' concerns were rooted in a view of video games as "appliances" rather than art, that should be reviewed based on feature checklists rather than traditional artistic criteria.&lt;ref name=WaPoRosenberg /&gt; Chris Suellentrop of ''The New York Times'' criticized resistance to innovative uses of the gaming medium, and the belief that increased coverage and praise of artistic games like ''[[Gone Home]]'' would negatively affect blockbuster games such as ''Grand Theft Auto V''.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop/&gt;

Gamergate is particularly associated with opposition to the influence of so-called "[[social justice warrior]]s" in the gaming industry and media, who are perceived as a threat to traditional gaming culture.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As the video-game market grew more diverse, cultural critics became interested in issues of [[gender representation in video games|gender representation]] and identity in games.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; One prominent feminist critic of the representation of women in gaming is Anita Sarkeesian,&lt;ref name="prominent 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2"/&gt; whose ''Tropes vs. Women in Video Games'' project is devoted to female stereotypes in games. Her fund-raising campaign and videos were met with hostility and harassment by some gamers. Further incidents raised concerns about [[sexism in video gaming]].&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; Prior to August 2014, escalating harassment prompted the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA) to provide support groups for harassed developers and to begin discussions with the FBI to help investigate online harassment of game developers.&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; In an interview on [[Comedy Central]]'s program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Sarkeesian said she believes women are targeted because they are "challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space".&lt;ref name=Colbert /&gt;

In late August 2014, shortly after the initial accusations against Grayson and harassment of Quinn, several gaming sites published opinion essays on the controversy that focused on the growing diversity of gaming and the mainstreaming of the medium, some of which included criticism of sexism within gamer culture.&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston August 2014"/&gt; These so-called "gamers are dead" articles were seen as part of a conspiracy to undercut traditional gamer identity{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; and were used by participants to rally support for Gamergate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s'' [[David Auerbach]] and ''[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel's]]'' David Elks criticized these articles for alienating their publications' audience by attacking the gamer identity.&lt;ref name=stokesentinel/&gt; Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', L. Rhodes said the antagonism in the Gamergate controversy was a result of the industry seeking to widen its customer demographic instead of focusing on core gamers, which Rhodes says "is precisely what videogames needed".&lt;ref name="paste 2015-04-20" /&gt; Brendan Keogh of ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'' stated that Gamergate "does not represent a marginalised, discriminated identity under attack so much as a hegemonic and normative mainstream being forced to redistribute some of its power".&lt;ref name="overland"/&gt;

===Misogyny and sexism===
{{see also|Sexism in video gaming}}

Gamergate has been described as an expression of sexism and misogyny within gaming culture; its main themes are criticism of feminism and so-called "social justice warriors", who are perceived as a threat to traditional video games.{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} Women's greater visibility in the gaming industry has seen a corresponding rise in gendered harassment and intimidation directed at them.{{refn|name=Salter}} Among mainstream journalists, the harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate is considered emblematic of this surge of online misogyny.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=112}} According to Sarah Kaplan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "sexism in gaming is a long-documented, much-debated but seemingly intractable problem", and became the crux of the Gamergate controversy.&lt;ref name=WaPo /&gt; Jaime Weinman writing in ''[[Maclean's]]'' said, "[w]hether it was supposed to be or not, GamerGate is largely about women".&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt; Discussing Gamergate on her [[ESPN]] blog, Jane McManus compared the misogyny that women in the gaming industry experience to that faced by the first women entering sporting communities.&lt;ref name="ESPNMcManus" /&gt; Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has described Gamergate as "something that we need to stand clearly against".&lt;ref name="IBTimesTrudeauGG" /&gt;

Sexism and misogyny had been identified as problems in the video game industry and online community prior to the events of Gamergate.&lt;ref name="gdc misogyny 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe Women Outside" /&gt; Sarkeesian considered that the Internet has a "boys'-locker-room feel" to it, with male users trying to show off to each other which causes escalating cases of harassment in situations like Gamergate.&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; In March 2014, game designer [[Cliff Bleszinski]] wrote a blog post commenting on the "latent racism, homophobia and misogyny" that existed within the online gaming community.&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop"/&gt; In a November 2014 interview with ''[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]'', Wu said the game industry "has been a boys' club for 30 years", and that the common portrayal of women as "sex symbols and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" in video games has led to the players taking the same attitudes.&lt;ref name="develop harassment"/&gt; Brendan Sinclair, writing for ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'', stated that the events of the Gamergate controversy were "reprehensible and saddening" and "this industry has some profound issues in the way it treats women".&lt;ref name="gibiz silver lining"/&gt;

Many commentators have said that the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. [[Lisa Nakamura]], a professor of digital studies at the University of Michigan, wrote that Gamergate "showed the world the extent of gaming's misogyny".&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakamura"/&gt;  Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, [[Amanda Marcotte]] in an article for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' accused the video game world of being "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" with hate on any "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a ''[[Teen Titans]]'' cover and to a community manager of the ''[[Mighty No. 9]]'' game because she drew a feminine [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]], and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]''.&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that "[b]efore [Gamergate] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family.&amp;nbsp;[...] There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone."&lt;ref name="BBCQuinnInterview"/&gt; [[Danielle Citron]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to "fundamentally distort who she is".&lt;ref name="inc"/&gt;

Targets of Gamergate supporters have overwhelmingly been women, even when men were responsible for the supposed wrongdoings. Writing in ''The New Yorker'', Simon Parkin observed that Quinn was attacked while the male journalist who was falsely accused of reviewing her work favorably largely escaped, revealing the campaign as "a pretense to make further harassment of women in the industry permissible".&lt;ref name="Parkin" /&gt; In ''The New York Times'', Chris Suellentrop said that a petition sought to have a female colleague fired for criticizing the portrayal of women in ''Grand Theft Auto V'', while he and many other male critics raised similar concerns but did not face similar reprisals.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop /&gt; Most commentators have described Gamergate as consisting largely of white males, though some supporters have said that it includes a notable percentage of women, minorities and LGBT members.&lt;ref name="inquisitr" /&gt;

Critics of the movement have described it as a kind of misogynistic [[terrorism]].{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=5}}{{refn|name=Musgrave}} Writing in ''The Week'', Ryan Cooper called the harassment campaign "an online form of terrorism" intended to reverse a trend in gaming culture toward increasing acceptance of women, and stated that social media platforms need to tighten their policies and protections against threats and abuse.&lt;ref name=TheWeek /&gt; Speaking on [[Iowa Public Radio]], academic Cindy Tekobbe said the harassment campaign was intended to drive women from public spaces and intimidate them into silence.&lt;ref name=IPR /&gt; Prof. Joanne St. Lewis of the [[University of Ottawa]] stated that Gamergate's harassment and threats should be considered acts of terrorism as the perpetrators seek to harm women and to prevent them from speaking back or defending others.&lt;ref name="vice 2015-02-13" /&gt;

===Law enforcement===

[[File:Katherine clark june 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katherine Clark]], the U.S. Congresswoman from Massachusetts' 5th District, sought to expand the FBI's ability to take action against cyberharassment similar to that faced by Wu.]]

Though ''Newsweek'' reported that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed,&lt;ref name="newsweek FBI" /&gt; and parts of the FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 due to a lack of leads.&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed"/&gt; Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce.&lt;ref name="slate 2014-10-17" /&gt; In June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Elonis v. United States]]'' that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily [[true threat]]s that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to ''[[Pacific Standard]]'', this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment.&lt;ref name="psmag 2015-06-04" /&gt; However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt;

Wu has expressed her frustration over how law enforcement agencies have responded to the threats that she and other women in the game industry have received.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-05-21" /&gt; On public release of the FBI's case files on Gamergate, Wu said she was "livid", and that "Only a fraction of information we gave the FBI was looked into. They failed on all levels."&lt;ref name="gamesindustyFBIGG" /&gt;The lack of legal enforcement contributes towards the harassers' ability to maintain these activities without any risk of punishment, according to Chrisella Herzog of ''[[The Diplomatic Courier]]''; at worst, harassers would see their social media accounts suspended but are able to turn around to register new accounts to continue to engage.&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Katherine Clark]], one of whose constituents was Brianna Wu, called for a stronger response from law enforcement to online abuse, partly as a result of advocacy by the women targeted by Gamergate.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; On March 10, 2015, Clark wrote a letter to the [[House Appropriations Committee]] asking it to call on the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to crack down on the harassment of women on the internet, saying the campaign of intimidation associated with Gamergate had highlighted the problem.&lt;ref name="clark 2015-03-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge 2015-03-11" /&gt; She asked the U.S. Department of Justice to "prioritize" online threats against women, saying, "We do not think this a harmless hoax. We think this has real-life implications for women".&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; Clark also hosted a Congressional briefing on March 15, along with the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus to review issues of cyberstalking and online threats; during the briefing, Quinn spoke of her experiences with Gamergate, which an executive director of the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] described during the hearing as "an online hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] which was started by an ex-boyfriend to ruin [Quinn's] life".&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-04-21" /&gt; On May 27, the [[United States House of Representatives]] formally supported Clark's request for increased measures to combat online abuse against women, explicitly pressing for more investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="wgbh 2015-06-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon 2015-05-29" /&gt; On June 2, Rep. Clark introduced the "Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act of 2015" to Congress. The bill would have allocated more funding for the FBI to employ additional agents to enforce laws against [[cyberstalking]], online criminal harassment, and threats.&lt;ref name="metrowest 2015-06-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.2602" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo 2015-06-07" /&gt; Two years later, in June 2017, Rep. Clark introduced the "Online Safety Modernization Act of 2017" with co-sponsors Reps. [[Susan Brooks]] (Indiana) and [[Pat Meehan]] (Pennsylvania), which combined several of Clark's previous bills. The bill focused on penalizing "cybercrimes against individuals", including doxing, swatting, and [[sextortion]], as well as granting $20 million for law enforcement training to help tackle such crimes, and $4 million to establish the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals in order to study and collect statistics and information related to these crimes.&lt;ref name="verge 2017-06-29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clark hr__2017"/&gt;

==Gaming industry response==

The harassment of Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others led prominent industry professionals to condemn the Gamergate attacks for damaging the video gaming community and the public perception of the industry.&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek 2015-05-31" /&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s Laura Parker stated that the Gamergate situation led those outside of the video game industry to be "flooded with evidence of the video-game community as a poisonous and unwelcoming place", furthering any negative views they may have had of video games.&lt;ref name="vanityfair 2015-08-04" /&gt; Independent game developer Andreas Zecher wrote an open letter calling upon the community to take a stand against the attacks, attracting the signatures of more than two thousand professionals within the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; Many in the industry saw the signatures "as proof that the people sending vicious attacks at Quinn and Sarkeesian weren't representative of the video game industry overall".&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'', Jenn Frank described the tactics used in the harassment campaign and the [[climate of fear]] it generated through its attacks on women and their allies, concluding that this alienating and abusive environment would harm not only women but also the industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=GuardianJF /&gt; Frank herself received significant harassment for writing this article, and announced an intention to quit games journalism as a result.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Games designer Damion Schubert wrote that Gamergate was "an unprecedented {{sic|catastrof**k}}", and that silencing critiques of games harms games developers by depriving them of feedback.&lt;ref name="EscapistSchubertInterview"/&gt; Several video game developers, journalists, and gamers from across various gender, racial, and social backgrounds adopted new Twitter hashtags, such as #INeedDiverseGames, #StopGamergate2014 and #GamersAgainstGamergate, to show solidarity with the people targeted by the harassment and their opposition to the reactionary messages from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="salon 2014-12-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, Janish 2015" /&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] characterized Gamergate as a "magnet for harassment", and notes the possible financial risk for companies dealing with it on social media platforms.&lt;ref name="eff 2015-01-08" /&gt; The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that "[t]here is no place in the video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats".&lt;ref name="wapost esa" /&gt; ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 2015-06-14" /&gt; At [[BlizzCon]] 2014, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] president and co-founder [[Mike Morhaime]] denounced recent harassment; blaming a "small group of people [who] have been doing really awful things" and "tarnishing our reputation" as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate.&lt;ref name=CNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=joystiqblizzcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=PCGamerMM /&gt; CEOs of both the American and European branches of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Shawn Layden]] and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony.&lt;ref name="ibtimes 2015-02-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sony response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venture sony" /&gt; The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="GuardianQvist" /&gt;

Responses to Gamergate have encouraged the video game industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them.&lt;ref name="wapo 3 women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate GG2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nightline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune august2015"/&gt; Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a "Diversity in Technology" program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at increasing the number of women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] stated in announcing the program that "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent".&lt;ref name="Polygon Intel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes Intel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-01-07" /&gt; [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) COO [[Peter Moore (businessman)|Peter Moore]] said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' "[i]f there's been any benefit to Gamergate,&amp;nbsp;[...] I think it just makes us think twice at times".&lt;ref name="fortune 2015-09-04" /&gt; Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', [[IGDA]] executive director Kate Edwards said, "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, "We need to stop this. This has got to change."&lt;ref name="seattletimes"/&gt;

The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] 2015 included markedly more female protagonists in these new games, as well as more visible presence by women at the event. Some commentators characterized this as a response to Gamergate and a rejection of the misogynistic Gamergate harassment.&lt;ref name="RepresentationStrides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GamergateFail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BadassCharacters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

The game ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' references Gamergate with hashtag, #CrusaderGate, which the [[Riddler]] uses to unsuccessfully try to rally the Internet against Batman; bemoaning its failure, the Riddler describes those who use the hashtag as "idiotic and easily roused rabble".&lt;ref name="ArkhamKnightPolygon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

==Gamergate representation in media==
"[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#Episodes|Intimidation Game]]", an episode of the crime television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-02-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2015-02-12" /&gt; The 2015 documentary film ''[[GTFO (film)|GTFO]]'' analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was "a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem".&lt;ref name="nytimes 2015-03-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes 2015-03-13" /&gt; The Gamergate situation was covered as part of a larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]''.&lt;ref name="time 2015-06-22" /&gt; The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of ''[[The Internet Ruined My Life]]''.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney 2016-03-16" /&gt;

==Reducing online harassment==

In January 2015, Quinn and Alex Lifschitz created the [[Crash Override Network]], a private group of experts who provide free support and counsel to those that have been harassed online, including as a result of Gamergate, and to work with law authorities and social media sites in response to such threats.&lt;ref name="CSM 2015-01-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verge 2015-01-17" /&gt; Software developer Randi Harper founded a similar group, the [[Online Abuse Prevention Initiative]], a non-profit organization that also seeks to provide aid to those harassed online.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016-04-13" /&gt;

Anita Sarkeesian was named as one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet in March 2015, and later in the magazine's Top 100 Most Influential People of 2015, in recognition of her role in highlighting sexism in the video game community in the wake of the Gamergate controversy.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="time 2015-03-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time 2015-04-16" /&gt; She was also highlighted as one of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''{{'}}s fifty "Internet's Most Fascinating" in a 2015 list due to her efforts to curb online harassment.&lt;ref name="cosmo"/&gt;

An on-line abuse panel (itself the subject of controversy) at the 2016 [[SXSW]] festival said that there was no technological solution to the problem of harassment given human nature;&lt;ref name="SXSW On-Line Harassment Panel" /&gt; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific.&lt;ref name="engadetSXSWSummit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RecodeSXSWSummit" /&gt; Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for [[Women's History Month]], [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] said that "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes."&lt;ref name="obama" /&gt; Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. "And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it".&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailydot 2016-03-18"/&gt;

'''''Gay Science: The Ethics of Sexual Orientation Research''''' is a 1997 book about scientific research on [[sexual orientation]] by the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy. The book received positive reviews, crediting Murphy with providing a useful discussion of the ethical implications of sexual orientation research, including the work of scientists such as the neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] and the geneticist [[Dean Hamer]], and with convincingly criticizing the philosopher [[John Finnis]]. However, some reviewers criticized his style of writing.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Murphy, a philosopher, discusses scientific research on sexual orientation, including [[homosexuality]], [[heterosexuality]], and [[bisexuality]]. He aims to provide "an ethical overview of sexual orientation research and, more specifically, the meaning of that research for gay people." He argues in favor of the use of the terms "homoeroticism" and "heteroeroticism" in place of "homosexuality" and "heterosexuality" respectively, maintaining that the latter set of terms are misleading. He discusses the work of the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]], including [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|Freud's views on homosexuality]], and the views of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]]. He evaluates the work and views of scientists such as the neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]], the geneticist [[Dean Hamer]], and J. A. Y. Hall, as well as the work of the psychoanalysts [[Irving Bieber]] and [[Charles Socarides]], the psychologists [[Alan P. Bell]], [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[Doreen Kimura]], and [[Joseph Nicolosi]], and the sociologist [[Martin S. Weinberg]]. He also discusses the views on homosexuality of the philosopher [[John Finnis]].{{sfn|Murphy|1997|pages=1, 3–4, 10, 15, 19, 32–41, 54, 165, 174–179, 240}}

==Publication history==
''Gay Science'' was first published by [[Columbia University Press]] in 1997.{{sfn|Murphy|1997|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Gay Science'' received positive reviews from James Edward Van Buskirk in ''[[Library Journal]]'' and R. W. Smith in ''Choice'' and a mixed review from the biologist [[Ruth Hubbard]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Van Buskirk|1997|page=116}}{{sfn|Smith|1998|page=1413}}{{sfn|Hubbard|1998|page=15}} The book was also reviewed by the gay writer [[Gabriel Rotello]] in ''[[New Scientist]]''.{{sfn|Rotello|1998|page=47}}

Van Buskirk described the book as an "important addition to the field" and a useful complement to LeVay's ''[[Queer Science]]'' (1996). He credited Murphy with providing an objective account of sexual orientation research and its ethical implications.{{sfn|Van Buskirk|1997|page=116}} Smith credited Murphy with providing a "carefully detailed" and "meticulously logical" analysis of the moral implications of research into the causes of homosexuality. However, he also described the book as "somewhat repetitious".{{sfn|Smith|1998|page=1413}}

Hubbard credited Murphy with addressing "a range of interesting questions about the purpose and uses of scientific research" into homosexuality, but criticized his writing, calling it "convoluted and ponderous". She also criticized him for writing "as though ethics and moral philosophy exist outside politics", arguing that "the power relationships that determine what science gets done also circumscribe the extent to which it is done ethically" and that if "scientific inquiring takes place in a context in which its results are certain to be misused, then the ethical innocence it may have in other contexts becomes irrelevant".{{sfn|Hubbard|1998|page=15}}

===Gay media===
''Gay Science'' received a positive review from the psychiatrist [[Vernon Rosario]] in ''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review]]''. Rosario described the book as a "welcome addition to the debate" on biological research on homosexuality, and credited Murphy with providing "a scientifically well-informed and balanced review of the recent research and its possible ethical implications" and with being "well-versed in the basic science and cognizant of the enormous theoretical and methodological impediments to doing sound research in this area." He agreed with him that it is reasonable to hypothesize that homosexuality might have a biological basis, but considered him overly optimistic in believing that research into that possibility would benefit gay people. He commented that, "it seems unlikely that biological research on homosexuality will easily shake off its 150-year-old association with the pathologization of same-sex love", and noted that all of the sexual orientation research Murphy discussed was actually concerned specifically with homosexuality. He wrote that while Murphy discussed hypothetical scenarios in which it became possible for scientists to manipulate "sexual orientation in utero or in adults", his "countless scenarios seem contrived and belabored". He described Murphy's view that adults should be free to have their sexual orientation changed through biological manipulation and that "mothers would have the right to abort fetuses that tested positive for homosexuality", if either of these things ever became possible, as "disturbing", but also difficult to argue against.{{sfn|Rosario|1998|pages=48–49}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''Gay Science'' received positive reviews from Mark Chekola in ''[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]'',{{sfn|Chekola|1999|pages=170–173}} the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] in the ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'',{{sfn|Ruse|2000|pages=487–493}} and Daniel Wolfe in ''[[Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality]]'',{{sfn|Wolfe|2000|pages=491–493}} and a mixed review from the sex researcher [[James D. Weinrich]] in ''[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]]''.{{sfn|Weinrich|1999|pages=891–895}} The book was also reviewed by the psychiatrist [[Susan Bradley]] in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'',{{sfn|Bradley|1998|page=1477}} the philosopher Udo Schüklenk in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'',{{sfn|Schüklenk|1998|pages=1664–1665}} the philosopher [[David Hull]] in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'',{{sfn|Hull|1998|pages=390–391}} the philosopher [[Sandra Harding]] in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'',{{sfn|Harding|1999|pages=149–154}} and the feminist scholar [[Martha McCaughey]] in ''[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]''.{{sfn|McCaughey|2000|pages=535–537}}

Chekola described the book as "an admirable exploration of issues related to research on sexual orientation and possible applications of such research". He credited Murphy with being the first person to write a comprehensive work examining these issues, calling him "extremely thorough and exhaustive". He also credited Murphy with carefully discussing the limitations of research by LeVay, Bailey, Hamer, Hall, Kimura, and Nicolosi. He wrote that while Murphy's speculation that science might develop means of preventing or altering homosexuality, and that the number of gay people would be diminished as a result, might seem "odd and chilling", it was "an interesting exercise in looking at the implications scientific knowledge might have for people's choices that could result in a minority's becoming smaller, a concern not limited to gay and lesbian people." However, he also wrote that Murphy's thoroughness would probably limit his audience to academics, and that "Many undergraduates would likely get lost at various points in the book."{{sfn|Chekola|1999|pages=170–173}}

Ruse credited Murphy with having "a deep and sensitive knowledge of the appropriate areas of science", being "able to write clearly and distinctly about difficult issues, so that one can follow without any trouble the sorts of points that he wants to make", and providing good discussions of the work of researchers such as LeVay. He wrote that Murphy's book made his own work ''[[Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry]]'' (1988) in "many respects ... dated and redundant." He agreed with Murphy's defense of inquiry into the origins of sexual orientation. He found Murphy's discussion of attempts by parents to control the sexual orientation of their children interesting, but disputed Murphy's conclusion that parents would have the right to engage in such attempts, arguing that rather than granting them that right it would be better "to change societal attitudes about homosexuality so that people do not show prejudice against homosexuals." He found Murphy's discussion of laws about homosexuality interesting, but questioned whether Murphy provided "anything which is deeply grounded in a well thought-out philosophy of law". He also questioned whether Murphy was right to devote attention to the issue of whether it is possible or desirable to change a person's sexual orientation and noted that, "Murphy seems to have virtually no time or interest in Freud's work, even though a mere twenty years ago the Freudian etiological analysis of homosexuality was considered really significant." He also observed that Murphy had little or no interest in discussing social constructionist views influenced by Foucault.{{sfn|Ruse|2000|pages=487–493}}

Wolfe described the book as "invaluable for students of gay history, medicine and their intersections", and praised its, "Careful summary and careful citations". He complimented Ruse for his discussions of the research of Bieber, Socarides, Hamer, and LeVay, his account of [[conversion therapy]], and his philosophical discussion of the ethical questions involved in scientific research on sexual orientation, including the possible development of methods to prevent or alter homosexuality. He also credited Murphy with exposing the oversimplification of research such as that of LeVay by the media. Though noting that not all readers would find Murphy's ethical discussions interesting, he agreed with Murphy's criticisms of Finnis's views, while finding them obvious. He criticized Murphy for devoting too much space to discussing anti-gay views and arguments.{{sfn|Wolfe|2000|pages=491–493}}

Weinrich credited Murphy with providing a "reasonably up-to-date review" of scientific accounts of sexual orientation, and endorsed Murphy's criticisms of Finnis, calling them "complete and devastating". He also praised Murphy for helpfully addressing "questions about the supposed naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexual desire and behavior" and for his discussion of "the consequences for society of his lines of thought." However, he described much of Murphy's discussion of the question of whether research into sexual orientation should be undertaken at all as boring, and wrote that most of Murphy's conclusions ranged "from self-evident to uninteresting." He also accused Murphy of being naive in his discussion of how institutions such as the Catholic Church and the American military might respond to the development of scientific methods of preventing or detecting homosexuality, and argued that he was overly critical of sociobiological explanations of homosexuality, and sometimes showed a "less than perfect" understanding of biology.{{sfn|Weinrich|1999|pages=891–895}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Gibbs and Canning Limited''' was an [[England|English]] [[manufacturing|manufacturer]] of [[terracotta]] and, in particular, [[architectural terracotta]], located in Glascote, [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], and founded in 1847.

The company manufactured a wide range of terracotta and faience: statues of lions and pelicans to adorn the Natural History Museum in London; architectural terracotta for banks and schools; and garden urns and planters. By the 1950s, when the factory finally closed, it was best known for more practical items, such as drainage pipes, sinks, vases and jars.

Today, there is little evidence of the factory in Glascote, but the legacy lives on in the decoration and plumbing of many buildings in Britain’s major towns and cities.

'''Hue''' is one of the main properties (called [[Color appearance model#Color appearance parameters|color appearance parameters]]) of a [[color]], defined technically (in the [[CIECAM02]] model), as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as [[red]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[yellow]]",&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fairchild, "Color Appearance Models: CIECAM02 and Beyond". Tutorial slides for IS&amp;T/SID 12th Color Imaging Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; (which in certain theories of color vision are called [[unique hues]]). Hue can typically be represented quantitatively by a single number, often corresponding to an angular position around a central or neutral point or axis on a colorspace coordinate diagram (such as a [[chromaticity diagram]]) or [[color wheel]], or by its [[dominant wavelength]] or that of its [[complementary color]]. The other color appearance parameters are [[colorfulness]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] (also known as intensity or chroma)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/|title=Hue, Value, Saturation {{!}} learn.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065346/http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/|archive-date=2017-06-30|dead-url=no|access-date=October 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[lightness]], and [[brightness]].

Usually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness, such as with "light blue", "pastel blue", "vivid blue". Exceptions include [[brown]], which is a dark [[Orange (colour)|orange]].&lt;ref name="Bartleson1976"&gt;C J Bartleson, "Brown". ''Color Research and Application,'' '''1''' : 4, p 181-191 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[painting]] [[color theory]], a hue is a ''pure'' [[pigment]]—one without [[Tints and shades|tint or shade]] (added white or black pigment, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creativecurio.com/2008/05/the-color-wheel-and-color-theory/ |title=The Color Wheel and Color Theory |publisher=Creative Curio |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705211646/http://creativecurio.com/2008/05/the-color-wheel-and-color-theory/ |archivedate=2011-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hues are first processed in the [[Human brain|brain]] in areas in the extended V4 called [[glob (visual system)|globs]].&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.008 | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | last2 = Moeller | first2 = S | last3 = Tsao | first3 = DY. | year = 2007 | title = Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 560–73 | pmid = 17988638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | last2 = Tsao | first2 = DY | title = Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 42 | pages = 18034–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19805195 | pmc = 2764907 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810943106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computing hue ==

In [[opponent process|opponent color spaces]] in which two of the axes are perceptually orthogonal to lightness, such as the CIE 1976 (''L''*, ''a''*, ''b''*) ([[CIELAB]]) and 1976 (''L''*, ''u''*, ''v''*) ([[CIELUV]]) color spaces, hue may be computed together with chroma by converting these coordinates from [[rectangular coordinates|rectangular]] form to [[polar coordinates|polar]] form. Hue is the angular component of the polar representation, while chroma is the radial component.

Specifically, in CIELAB&lt;ref name="CIE1986"&gt;''Colorimetry,'' second edition: CIE Publication 15.2. Vienna: Bureau Central of the CIE, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h_{ab} = \mathrm{atan2}(b^*, a^*),&lt;/math&gt;

while, analogously, in CIELUV&lt;ref name = "CIE1986"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h_{uv} = \mathrm{atan2}(v^*, u^*) =  \mathrm{atan2}(v', u'),&lt;/math&gt;

where, [[atan2]] is a two-argument inverse tangent.

Preucil&lt;ref name = "Preucil1953"&gt;Frank Preucil, "Color Hue and Ink Transfer … Their Relation to Perfect Reproduction, ''TAGA Proceedings,'' p 102-110 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; describes a color hexagon, similar to a trilinear plot described by Evans, Hanson, and Brewer,&lt;ref name = "Evans1953"&gt;Ralph Merrill Evans, W T Hanson, and W Lyle Brewer, ''Principles of Color Photography.'' New York: Wiley, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; which may be used to compute hue from [[RGB]]. To place [[red]] at 0°, [[green]] at 120°, and [[blue]] at 240°,

:&lt;math&gt; h_{rgb} = \mathrm{atan2}\left( \sqrt{3} \cdot (G - B), 2 \cdot R - G - B \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, one may solve
:&lt;math&gt; \tan( h_{rgb}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}\cdot (G - B)}{2\cdot R - G - B}. &lt;/math&gt;

Preucil used a polar plot, which he termed a color circle.&lt;ref name = "Preucil1953"/&gt; Using R, G, and B, one may compute hue angle using the following scheme: determine which of the six possible orderings of R, G, and B prevail, then apply the formula given in the table below.

Note that in each case the formula contains the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{M - L}{H - L}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''H'' is the highest of R, G, and B; ''L'' is the lowest, and ''M'' is the mid one between the other two. This is referred to as the "Preucil hue error" and was used in the computation of mask strength in photomechanical color reproduction.&lt;ref name = "Southworth"&gt;Miles Southworth, ''Color Separation Techniques'', second edition. Livonia, New York: Graphic Arts Publishing, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hue angles computed for the Preucil circle agree with the hue angle computed for the Preucil hexagon at integer multiples of 30° (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and the colors midway between contiguous pairs) and differ by approximately 1.2° at odd integer multiples of 15° (based on the circle formula), the maximal divergence between the two.

The process of converting an RGB color into an [[HSL color space]] or [[HSV color space]] is usually based on a 6-piece piecewise mapping, treating the HSV cone as a hexacone, or the HSL double cone as a double hexacone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling v. 1: Implementation and Algorithms | author = Max K.

== Specialized hues ==

The hues exhibited by [[caramel color]]ings and [[beer]]s are fairly limited in range. The [[Linner hue index]] is used to quantify the hue of such products.

== Usage in art ==

Manufacturers of pigments use the word hue, for example, "cadmium yellow (hue)" to indicate that the original pigmentation ingredient, often toxic, has been replaced by safer (or cheaper) alternatives whilst retaining the hue of the original.  Replacements are often used for [[chromium]], [[cadmium]] and [[alizarin]].

== Hue vs. dominant wavelength ==

[[Dominant wavelength]] (or sometimes equivalent wavelength) is a physical analog to the perceptual attribute hue. On a [[chromaticity diagram]], a line is drawn from a [[white point]] through the coordinates of the color in question, until it intersects the [[CIE 1931 color space#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|spectral locus]]. The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color's [[dominant wavelength]] if the point is on the same side of the white point as the spectral locus, and as the color's [[complementary wavelength]] if the point is on the opposite side.&lt;ref name = "Judd1976"&gt;Deane B Judd and Günter Wyszecki, ''Color in Business, Science, and Industry.'' New York: Wiley, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hue difference: &lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*&lt;/math&gt;? ==

There are two main ways in which hue difference is quantified. The first is the simple difference between the two hue angles. The symbol for this expression of hue difference is &lt;math&gt;\Delta h_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELAB and &lt;math&gt;\Delta h_{uv}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELUV. The other is computed as the residual total color difference after Lightness and Chroma differences have been accounted for; its symbol is &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELAB and &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*_{uv}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELUV.

== Names and other notations ==
There exists some correspondence, more or less precise, between hue values and [[color term]]s (names). One approach in color science is to use traditional color terms but try to give them more precise definitions. See [[spectral color#Table of spectral or near-spectral colors]] for names of highly saturated colors with the hue from ≈ 0° (red) up to ≈ 275° (violet), and [[line of purples#Table of highly-saturated purple colors]] for color terms of the remaining part of the color wheel.

Alternative approach is to use a systematic notation. It can be a standard [[angle]] notation for certain color model such as HSL/HSV mentioned above, [[CIELUV]], or [[CIECAM02]]. Alphanumeric notations such as of [[Munsell color system]], [[Natural Color System|NCS]], and [[Pantone Matching System]] are also used.

[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"The Iaras", bronze sculpture by Cheschiatti, at the [[Palácio da Alvorada|Alvorada Palace]]]]
'''Iara''', also spelled '''Uiara''' or '''Yara''' ({{IPA-pt|iˈjaɾɐ}}, {{IPA-pt|iˈaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈjaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|wiˈjaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|ujˈjaɾɐ|}}) or '''Mãe das Águas''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmɐ̃j dɐˈz aɣwɐs|}}, "mother of waters"), is a figure from [[Brazilian mythology]] based on ancient [[Tupi people|Tupi]] and [[Guaraní mythology]]. The word derives from [[Old Tupi]] ''yîara'' = ''y'' + ''îara'' (water + lord/lady) = lady of the lake (water queen). She is seen as either a water [[nymph]], [[siren (mythology)|siren]], or [[mermaid]] depending upon the context of the story told about her. The Brazilian town of Nova Olinda claims the Cama da Mãe D’água as the home of Iara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guiabrasilturismo.com.br/pontos_turisticos.asp?regiao=regiao2z3# Article on the city of Olinda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iara is a beautiful young woman, sometimes described as having green hair, light brown or copper-colored skin (as that of an Indigenous Amerindian from Brazil, or of a {{lang|pt|[[caboclo]]}}) and brown eyes, connected to a freshwater dolphin, manatee or fish body (the Tupi word ''y'' did not have a distinct meaning, being used in general for any riverine or freshwater lacustrine place) who would sit on a rock by the river combing her hair or dozing under the sun. When she felt a man around she would start to sing gently to lure him. Once under the spell of the Iara a man would leave anything to live with her underwater forever, which was not necessarily a bad thing, as she was pretty and would cater for all needs of her lover for the rest of his life.

It is often claimed that, until the 18th century, the Iara legend was originally about an aggressive monstrous river [[merman]] known as Ipupiara ("freshwater monster", {{IPA-pt|ipupiˈaɾɐ|}} in Portuguese phonological rules; by that [Pre-[[History of Portugal (1640–1777)|Pombaline]]] time, most Brazilians still spoke {{lang|pt|[[língua geral|línguas gerais]]}}), that would readily devour fishers, rather than that of a seducing, docile river [[mermaid]].

Iaras are immortal (like the nymphs of [[Greek mythology]]), but her lovers do age and die, which means that they live most of eternity alone.

The legend of the Iara was one of the usual explanations for the disappearance of those who ventured alone in the [[Rainforest|jungle]].

Iara (or Yara) is also a very popular female name in Brazil.

The Iara is similar in nature to several other female figures of folklore from other regions such as [[La Llorona]] from Mexico and the Southwestern United States, the Colombian creatures La [[Patasola]] and the ''[[Tunda]]'' and the [[Deer Woman]] of North America.  All are females who at times function as sirens leading men to their death.

In the 1969 [[Macunaíma (film)|film version]] of the novel ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]'', the protagonist of the same name meets his death at the hands of an Iara. He embraces her eagerly and sees too late the blow hole in the back of her neck that gives her away as the creature she is and not the beautiful woman he mistook her for.

This physical deformity marking an otherwise perfect woman is a common theme among siren figures in the Americas but it is usually one of the feet. [[Deer Woman]] has hooves for feet, La [[Patasola]] and the ''Tunda'' have deformed feet and ''La Llorona'' is often said to have no feet by those who see her.

The '''Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage''' ('''INTACH''') is a non-profit charitable organisation registered under the [[Societies' Registration Act]], 1860.

In 2007, the [[United Nations]] awarded INTACH a special [[consultative status]] with [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=3029 Civil Society Participation &gt; Consultative Status&gt;Profile] ''[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]'' Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hin"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/30/stories/2007103051980300.htm INTACH gets special status for its efforts] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 30 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Copper Age Tool - ACCN 93-51 - Prehistory and Terracotta Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6248.JPG|thumb|150px| The INTACH logo has been derived from this 3000-year-old anthropomorphic copper figure (ACCN 93-51) found at Shahabad, UP, now at [[Government Museum, Mathura]].&lt;ref&gt;"INTACH." INTACH. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
INTACH was founded in 1984 in [[New Delhi]] with the vision to create a membership organisation to stimulate and spearhead heritage awareness and conservation in [[India]].

Since 1984, INTACH has pioneered the conservation and protection of India's natural and cultural heritage and is today the largest membership organisation in the country dedicated to conservation.

Today it has chapters in 170 Indian cities, as well as chapters in [[Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intach.be Intach Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].

The Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations of INTACH constituted the first Governing Council of the Trust with the following members:
[[Rajiv Gandhi]], [[Pupul Jayakar]], [[L. K. Jha]], Prof. [[M. G. K. Menon]], Dr [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], [[Rajeev Sethi]], [[B. K. Thapar]], [[Martand Singh]], [[Bilkees I. Latif]], [[Madhavrao Scindia]], and J. B. Dadachanji.

In 2007, INTACH signed a memorandum of understanding with [[AusHeritage]], Australia's noted heritage network, to collaborate on [[South Asia]]n and [[South East Asia]]n regional initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausgovindia.com/ndli/PA0807.html Cultural Heritage Cooperation: INTACH and "AusHeritage" sign MoU] [[Diplomatic missions of Australia|Australian High Commission]], [[India]], 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Among the tasks undertaken by INTACH are restoration of monuments and their management; advocacy for heritage property conservation; public awareness through heritage walks and buses;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-in-queue-to-ride-the-heritage-bus/393473/ Delhi in queue to ride the heritage bus] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 3 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; establishment of heritage clubs in schools;&lt;ref name=hinhy/&gt; and holding of awareness workshop for teachers of schools and colleges&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/34201033.cms INTACH trains teachers on protecting heritage] ''[[Times of India]]'', 13 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/33704836.cms INTACH holds awareness workshop for teachers] ''[[Times of India]], 8 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and heritage walks to various unprotected sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Potpourri/Guiding_the_cultural_ambassadors_/articleshow/3809504.cms Guiding the cultural ambassadors] ''[[Times of India]]'', 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-09/kolkata/27930257_1_heritage-buildings-heritage-structures-heritage-hotel Centre push for heritage revival] [[Kolkata]], ''[[Times of India]]'', 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, INTACH has taken up restoration and protection of hundreds of monuments that fall outside the coverage of [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and other government agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-14/india/27920787_1_monuments-intach-indian-national-trust 60,000 monuments at nature's mercy, says INTACH] ''[[Times of India]]'', 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and at times local authorities hand over the upkeep and restoration of heritage structures to INTACH directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/11/stories/2004061114630300.htm Maintenance of Kurupam monument for INTACH ] ''[[The Hindu]], 11 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

INTACH has established chapters not only within India but also outside it. It now uses funds raised by its international chapters in Belgium and the United Kingdom, to take up restoration, conservation and protection projects of historical structures and heritage buildings across India.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;

After developing [[Raghurajpur]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], a place famous for its master ‘[[Pattachitra]]’ artists and ‘[[Gotipua]]’ dance troupes as a heritage village, which has now become a major rural tourist destination, it later used the same pattern to develop Padmanabhpur village, [[Ganjam district]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], famous for its weavers and folk dancers, into another heritage destination.

In 2007, the government of [[Goa]] signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with INTACH for restoration, conservation and maintenance of 51 officially listed heritage and cultural monuments in the state.  This includes the restoration and conservation of the 16th century [[Reis Magos#Reis Magos Fort|Reis Magos Fort]] in [[Goa]],&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/11/stories/2007101157960200.htm INTACH to develop village in Ganjam district] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/20/stories/2007092052340300.htm Goa, INTACH signs MoU to preserve monuments] Special Correspondent, [[The Hindu]], 20 Sep 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 2008, INTACH signed anouth a memorandum of understanding with the [[Government of Delhi]] for the conservation of 92 monuments in Delhi, in the preparation of the [[Commonwealth Games 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/intach-delhi-govt-pact-for-conservation-of-92-monuments-on-route-of-2010-games/379167/ Intach, Delhi Govt pact for conservation of 92 monuments on route of 2010 Games] Express News Service, [[Indian Express]], 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The INTACH logo ==
The INTACH Logo, based on the anthropomorphic copper figure from Shahabad, Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the enigmatic [[Copper Hoard Culture|Copper Hoards of the Ganga Valley]] (circa 1800—1700 BC) is the perceived brand image of INTACH. The classic simplicity and vitality of its lines make it a striking example of primitive man’s creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTACH|url = http://www.intach.org/about-logo.php|website = www.intach.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
INTACH’s mission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTACH|url = http://www.intach.org/about-mission.php|website = www.intach.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conserve heritage is based on the belief that living in harmony with heritage enhances the quality of life, and it is the duty of every citizen of India as laid down in the Constitution of India. The objectives spelt out in the Memorandum of Association constitute INTACH’s Mandate and Vision. Its stated mission to date continues to be:
* Sensitise the public about the pluralistic cultural legacy of India
* Instill a sense of social responsibility towards preserving India’s common heritage
* Protect and preserve India’s living, built, and natural heritage by undertaking necessary actions and measures
* Document unprotected buildings of archaeological, architectural, historic and aesthetic significance, as well as the cultural resources, as this is the first step towards formulating conservation plans
* Develop heritage policies and regulations, and make legal interventions to protect India’s heritage when necessary
* Provide expertise in the field of conservation, restoration and preservation of specific works of art; and encourage capacity-building by developing skills through training programmes
* Undertake emergency response measures during natural or man-made disasters and support the local administration whenever heritage is threatened
* Foster collaborations, Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and partnerships with government and other national and international agencies
* Generate sponsorships for conservation and educational projects
To achieve the above-stated mission, at subsequent Visioning Exercises further measures were spelt out:
* INTACH must widen and strengthen its base so as to involve people in caring for our common heritage, as outlined in the objectives of the Memorandum of Association of the Society
* INTACH should develop into a highly competent and efficient organization of first recourse in all matters concerning Built (Architectural), Natural, Art (Material), Intangible (Living) Heritage in the country by building the requisite professional and other skills, both at its Central Office and at the Chapter level
* INTACH should strive to become the primary advisor on all matters pertaining to protection, conservation and preservation of heritage for the central government, the state governments (including institutions, agencies and organizations under them, such as the Armed Forces), and for institutions of decentralised governance such as the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the rural areas, for the urban local bodies (municipalities, metropolitan authorities, cantonment boards, etc.), and also the Corporate and Public Sectors
* INTACH should put into place an effective system of networking with other like-minded organizations and build a mutual support system

==Awards==
INTACH bestows the following awards:
* The '''Anirudh Bhargava – INTACH Environmental Award'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intach.org/awards.asp?links=award1&lt;/ref&gt; has been instituted in the memory of his son by Dr. Ranjit Bhargava, INTACH Life Member and facilitated by a grant. 
* '''INTACH Award for Best Practices in Heritage Conservation'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intach.org/awards-heritage-conservation.asp?links=award4&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The '''INTACH-SATTE Heritage Tourism Award''' recognizes "inspiring and innovative work done by individuals/organization/ institutions" in a number of areas including "reuse of heritage concepts and properties for tourism purposes".&lt;ref name="hinhy"&gt;[http://www.intach.org/awards-satte.asp?links=award2 INTACH-2008 SATTE - INTACH Heritage Tourism Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==INTACH UK Trust==
The '''INTACH UK Trust''', established in 1987, is a registered charity in the United Kingdom funded by the Charles Wallace bequest. The aim of this trust is to support the cause of heritage conservation in India.

Its two main activities are:
* Funding projects in India
* Providing scholarships to British scholars for heritage research projects in India

==Collaborations==
In recent years INTACH has been fortunate to receive support from the central government and several state governments, corporate houses and international agencies.

'''Intangible property''', also known as '''incorporeal property''', describes something which a [[Natural person|person]] or [[corporation]] can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/[[intellectual property]].  It generally refers to statutory creations such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, or [[patent]]s.  It excludes tangible property like [[real property]] (land, buildings, and [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) and [[personal property]] (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.).  In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as ''choses in action''.  [https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles Intangible] property is used in distinction to [[tangible property]].  It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred).  Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary [[extinguishment]] and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.

Generally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles|title=What are intangibles? {{!}} RoyaltyRange|website=www.royaltyrange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright.  However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights.  For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.

In [[English law]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in ''pure intangibles'' (such as debts, intellectual property rights and [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]) and ''documentary intangibles'', which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a [[bill of lading]], [[promissory note]] or [[bill of exchange]]).  The recent rise of [[electronic document]]s has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">The '''International Thespian Festival''' is an annual week-long [[theatre]] [[festival]] that brings together U.S. [[high school]] theatre clubs, [[actor|thespian]] troupes, and programs.  Organized by the [[International Thespian Society]], it is held annually in late June on the campus of the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edta.org/educational_events/festival/ | title=Thespian Festival| publisher= Official Website for Educational Theater Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= For love of the theatre | publisher=The Daily Nebraskan | date=2000-06-29 | author= Melanie Mensch| url=http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/06/29/Arts/For-Love.Of.The.Theatre-1732984.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 120 workshops offered during the festival, including such titles as "Creating Believable Stage Villains", "Period Hatmaking", and "Fun with Dialects." These workshops are taught by high school teachers, college professors and theater professionals.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

'''Lida Abdul''' is a [[video art]]ist and [[performance art]]ist from [[Afghanistan]]. She was born as Lida Abdullah&lt;ref&gt;ArtFacts.net. "Lida Abdul." ArtFacts.net. Accessed April 05, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/en/artist/lida-abdul-38414/profile.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kabul]] in 1979, fled the country as a child during the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet Invasion]] and went on to live in [[India]] and [[Germany]] then the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/79256724|title=Global feminisms : new directions in contemporary art|others=Reilly, Maura,, Nochlin, Linda,, Brooklyn Museum,, Davis Museum and Cultural Center,|isbn=9781858943909|location=London|oclc=79256724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most recent work has been featured at the 2005 [[Venice Biennale]], Kunsthalle Vienna, Museum of Modern Art Arnhem Netherlands and Miami Cantral, CAC Centre d'art contemporain de Brétigny and Frac Lorraine Metz, France. She has also exhibited in festivals in Mexico, Spain, Germany, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan.

Abdul completed a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1997 and a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1998, both from [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University]]. She also completed a Master of Fine Arts in the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Lida Abdul." Guggenheim. Accessed February 08, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/lida-abdul&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; She currently lives and works in Los Angeles and Kabul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Abdul fled Afghanistan in December 1979 with the threat of the Soviet Invasion, making her a refugee to India, Germany and the United States, and thus is an "artistic nomad".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Olson, Christopher. "Lida Abdul." ''Border Crossings'' 27, no. 2 (05, 2008): 90-92. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/215549787&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Paul B Franklin, "Paris: Lida Abdul." ''Art in America,'' 102, no. 6 (June 2014): 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian-Afghan conflict's history goes back to 1838. Autocratic Russia (and later the USSR) had expansionist goals, continually competing with Great Britain for Central Asian territory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Collins, Joseph J. ''The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan: A Study in the Use of Force in Soviet Foreign Policy''. Lexington (Mass.): Lexington Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Afghanistan's goals have been independence, maintenance of territory and the security of the throne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This contrasted with two great powers, Russia and Great Britain, competing for power in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Soviet Union and Afghanistan were "natural allies" during the [[World War II|Second World War.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan is considered the leading event of the Cold War. Soviet presence in Afghanistan was felt strongly in infrastructure. Afghan cities, notoriously difficult to travel between, were connected with a major road system with Soviet aid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career and art ==
Abdul's video and performance art is described as abstract and dream-like, and she uses film techniques such as blurring to evoke the mind, as well as an "epic scale".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Paul B. "Paris: Lida Abdul." ''Art in America,'' 102, no. 6 (June 2014): 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her films are politically charged and use themes of hope and renewal to suggest her war-torn home country's future of progress.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While Abdul was made a refugee in 1979 after the Soviet Invasion,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; she was able to return to Afghanistan after the fall of the [[Taliban]] to revisit her home country, film, and meet with Afghan people to talk about their hopes for the future.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanier, Samson. "Venice Biennale news: several countries are exhibiting at the Biennale for the first time this year, says Samson Spanier. But the important things--champagne and politics--have not changed." ''Apollo'', July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She considers herself a Nomadic artist, because of her life growing up involved a lot of moving country-to-country and keeping her away form her homeland Abdul uses those feelings and emotions as inspiration or motivation in her art. Abdul creates political commentary, films that speak to themes of devastation, displacement culture, identity and bodies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;"White House" (2005)&lt;/small&gt; ===
''White House'' is a short film rich with political content. It is one of Abdul's better-known works, which was shown at the Venice Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, David. "Paint it white: Afghani artist Lida Abdul chronicles her homeland's struggle to rebuild." ''Toronto Life'' 41, no. 3 (March 2007): 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts the rubble of a classical building in a landscape set outside of [[Kabul]]'''.'''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;MacGilp, Alexandra. "White House." ArtAsiaPacific: Lida Abdul. November/December 2013. Accessed February 08, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/86/LidaAbdul&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cateforis, David. "Lida Abdul – White House." KU Scholar Works. May 2006. Accessed February 08, 2017. https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/13872.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist films herself dressed in black, painting the rubble white.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A man enters the scene, and Abdul paints his back in a similar fashion. Finally, the short, five-minute film ends with a herd of goats exploring the ruins.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The film is rhythmic, and a symbol of hope and progress,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as an act of political resistance to various injustices, such as the United States' profitable occupation of Afghanistan, the whitewashing of history,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and Afghan people's psychological injury from living in a war-torn region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;"Dome" (2005)&lt;/small&gt; ===
&lt;small&gt;Dome holds an optimistic tone contrasted with symbols of distress. It depicts a boy spinning joyfully in a crumbling mosque while an American helicopter passes overhead.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The spinning and dizziness are meant to represent displacement due to war, the irrationality of war acts and the strength of human hope&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;s&gt;›&lt;/s&gt;&lt;ref name="White House Lida"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/86/LidaAbdul |title=White House Lida Abdul |last=MacGilp |first=Alexander |date= |website=Artasiapacific |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150505044602/http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/86/LidaAbdul |archivedate= 5 May 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;"Trees" (2005)&lt;/small&gt; ===
Trees is a video documentary where young men discuss their reason for cutting down a tree, one that is still alive and bearing fruits. They explain their reasoning for cutting it down is because it was the site of many hangings and had to be destroyed. In the end the men cut the tree down and carried it off.&lt;ref name="White House Lida"/&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;"Clapping With Stones" (2005)&lt;/small&gt; ===
Clapping with stones is a video documentary, which contains a group of men in black ''Shalwar Kameez'' performing a prayer like ritual in front of the rock of Bamiyan. The Bamiyan contains traces of ancient Buddha's, which was destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban.&lt;ref name="White House Lida"/&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt; "Brick Sellers of Kabul" (2006) &lt;/small&gt; ===

Brick Sellers of Kabul is a photograph of young children in Kabul, each of them breaking a brick that they hand to a man with a shock of unruly hair and a painted expression. They are very serious and there is a sense of adulthood in the lives of each of these children. Abdul said, "Kabul is full of kids who run in the streets, but if you knew their lives you would wonder how it is possible for them to keep going... when their laughter disappears."

== Themes ==
Abdul's art also addresses the common issue of the depiction of Afghan people in the mass western media. It is common in western media to only report on Afghanistan in contexts of terror and war, and public western knowledge does not expand much beyond that image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Through her art, Abdul hopes Western people will learn more about Afghan people and cultures.

=== &lt;small&gt;Ethnicity and Language&lt;/small&gt; ===
Her works are permeated with; cultural identity, migration, psychological damage, process of destruction &amp; displacement, and include notions of exile and homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Art History; An Anthology 1968-2014|last=Robinson|first=Hilary|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=482–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a centrally governed country, is not unified in culture, national identity or language, though the ''lingua franca'' is [[Dari language|Dari]]'''.'''&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hammond, Thomas Taylor. Red Flag over Afghanistan: The Communist Coup, the Soviet Invasion, and the Consequences. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1984, pg. #5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Few people living in Afghanistan would describe themselves as "Afghan", but rather of a specific tribe living in the region and surrounding areas. Major groups include [[Pashtuns|Pushtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Uzbeks]] and [[Baloch people|Baluch]], each distinct and without strong feelings of national borders or identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who spill into neighboring countries without regard for borders.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Terror and Media Representation&lt;/small&gt; ===
Some attributes unite most "Afghans", however, with a 90% majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] population. One of Abdul's goals in her films is to educate a western audience about the nature of these cultures, and how they may diverge from the assumptions that people make about Afghanistan and Afghan people due to [[stereotype]]s they may encounter in the popular media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;La Gorce, Tammy. "Despite Conflict and Repression, Creativity." ''New York Times'', March 30, 2014, 10(L). ''Academic OneFile'' (accessed February 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; She recognizes the tendency of western media to paint a stereotypical image of Afghanistan, and through her art, she hopes to humanize people who are often demonized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One such stereotype is an image of a nation overtaken by war and stripped entirely of culture, however, even in light of devastation, Afghan people still had the desire to create art.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; With the works of Lida Abdul and other artists in the forefront, a western audience is given an alternative way to see Afghanistan removed from the depictions of terror and devastated cities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Politics&lt;/small&gt; ===
Afghanistan is more regional than central in orientation and culture, in part because of the lack of transportation throughout the country to connect major points of interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, a road system connecting the three major cities was built with Soviet aid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9770">This is a list of [[Publishing|publishers]] dedicated either wholly or to a significant degree to publishing material written for, by, or about women. Many of them started during the "[[Second-wave feminism|second wave]]" of [[feminism]]. The focus of this list is not on publishers which market to women, but on publishers who have a stated commitment to publishing feminist and other [[women's studies]] texts.

The concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach integrating research and innovation processes. These are integrated through the co-creation, exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and related technological artefacts in real life use cases. Such use cases involve user communities, not only as observed subjects but also as a source of creation. This approach allows all involved stakeholders to concurrently consider both the global performance of a product or service and its potential adoption by users. This consideration may be made at the earlier stage of research and development and through all elements of the product life-cycle, from design up to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Kusiak, A.; Tang, C.-Y.: Innovation in a requirement life-cycle framework, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, IMS’2006, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey, 2006, 61-67.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Concurrent engineering]]

More recently, the [[Web 2.0]] has demonstrated the positive impact of involving user communities in [[new product development]] (NPD) such as [[mass collaboration]] projects (e.g.  [[crowdsourcing]], [[Wisdom of Crowds]]) in [[collective intelligence|collectively]] creating new contents and applications.

A living lab is not similar to a [[testbed]] as its philosophy is to turn users, from being traditionally considered as observed subjects for testing modules against requirements, into value creation in contributing to the co-creation and exploration of emerging ideas, breakthrough scenarios, innovative concepts and related artefacts. Hence, a living lab rather constitutes an experiential environment, which could be compared to the concept of [[experiential learning]], where users are immersed in a creative social space for designing and experiencing their own future. Living labs could also be used by policy makers and users/citizens for designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new policies and regulations in real-life scenarios for evaluating their potential impacts before their implementations.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Description==
The term ''living lab'' has emerged in parallel from the ambient intelligence research communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ami-communities.eu/wiki/AMI%40Work_on-line_Communities|title=AMI@Work on-line Communities |work=AMI@Work Communities Wiki |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; context and from the discussion on experience and application research (EAR).&lt;ref&gt;ISTAG EAR working group report "Involving users in the development of Ambient Intelligence" on http://www.cordis.lu/ist/istag.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the term is based on the concept of [[user experience]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaver, W.W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S. and Walker, B.

William J. Mitchell, Kent Larson, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory.  They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Nowadays, several living lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Core Labs (2006), http://www.ami-communities.net/wiki/CORELABS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niitamo, V.-P.; Kulkki, S.; Eriksson, M.; Hribernik, K.

Living Labs for user-driven open innovation. An overview of the Living Labs methodology, activities and achievements. January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mitchell, Larson and Pentland, formed the first US-based living labs research consortium. According to the consortium website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinglabs.mit.edu |title=MIT Living Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The convergence of globalization, changing demographics, and urbanization is transforming almost every aspect of our lives.  We face new choices about where and how we work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health.  Ultimately, our societies are being transformed.  MIT Living Labs brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, deploy, and test - in actual living environments - new technologies and strategies for design that respond to this changing world.  Our work spans in scale from the personal to the urban, and addresses challenges related to health, energy, and creativity.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consortium has since been reorganized as the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.media.mit.edu/ |title=MIT City Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "living lab" or "living laboratory" is also used for representing a residential home research facility where the behaviour of people living in this house is observed and usage patterns are collected by researchers that are investigating methods for merging new technologies with user-centered design. In this type of living lab, users are more observed subjects than engaged in the co-creation of ideas and breakthrough scenarios. There are examples of such research facilities like PlaceLab at MIT developed by Kent Larson and Stephen Intille and ExperienceLab at Philips Research. In the Netherlands, Utrecht University has created the Governance Lab Utrecht

==How it works==
The living lab process,&lt;ref&gt;Pallot M. (2009). Engaging Users into Research and Innovation: The Living Lab Approach as a User Centred Open Innovation Ecosystem. Webergence Blog. {{cite web |url=http://www.cwe-projects.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/1760838?id=715404_1760838 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509081658/http://www.cwe-projects.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/1760838?id=715404_1760838 |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which integrates both user-centred research and open innovation, is based on a maturity spiral concurrently involving a multidisciplinary team in the following four main activities:
* Co-creation: bring together technology push and application pull (i.e. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting) into a diversity of views, constraints and knowledge sharing that sustains the ideation of new scenarios, concepts and related artefacts.
* Exploration: engage all stakeholders, especially user communities, at the earlier stage of the co-creation process for discovering emerging scenarios, usages and behaviours through live scenarios in real or virtual environments (e.g. [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[mixed reality]]).
* Experimentation: implement the proper level of technological artefacts to experience live scenarios with a large number of users while collecting data which will be analysed in their context during the evaluation activity.
* Evaluation: assess new ideas and innovative concepts as well as related technological artefacts in real life situations through various dimensions such as socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive and socio-economic aspects; make observations on the potentiality of a viral adoption of new concepts and related technological artefacts through a confrontation with users' value models.

'''Mindre teatern''' (''The Smaller Theatre''), '''Nya teatern''' (''The New Theatre''), '''Lindeberska teatern''' (''The Lindeberg Theatre''), was a Swedish theatre at [[Kungsgatan, Stockholm|Kungsgatan]] in [[Stockholm]], active 1842–1863. The building was used as localitites for the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1863–1908.  

== History ==
The theatre was founded by [[Anders Lindeberg]] in 1842 after the theatre monopoly of the Royal Dramatic theatre was abolished. It was called Mindre teatern (The Smaller Theatre), as the old Royal Dramatic theatre was called "The Big Theatre", Nya teatern (The New Theatre), and also Lindeberska teatern (The Lindeberg Theatre), after its founder. 

It became a popular theatre, which rivaled the royal Theatre. In 1863, the theatre was sold to the Royal Theatre and dissolved. The building itself became the new house for the Royal Dramatic Theatre, who also employed many of the actors, and continued as such for 45 years. It was the fourth building to serve as localities for the royal theatre. When the royal opera and the royal theatre shared building, the Royal Dramatic Theatre was often called "The Small stage", while the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] was called "The Big stage", and this continued after they were separated.    

Eventually, the building was deemed inadequate, and when the new building for the royal theatre was finished in 1908, it was demolished.

'''Montmajour [[Abbey]]''', formally the '''Abbey of [[St. Peter]] in Montmajour''' ({{lang-fr|Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Montmajour}}), was a fortified [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] built between the 10th and 18th centuries on what was originally an island five kilometers north of [[Arles]], in what is now the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] [[Departments in France|Department]], in the region of [[Provence]] in the south of France.

The abbey complex consists of six sections:
* the '''[[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]''', dating from the 11th century, which includes the '''Chapel of St. Peter''';
* the [[cloister]], built during the 12th and 13th centuries;
* the adjacent '''Chapel of the Holy Cross''', built during the 12th century;
* the fortified '''Monastery of St. Peter''', built during the 14th century;
* the '''Tower of Abbot Pons de l'Orme''', dating from the same period;
* the '''[[Congregation of St. Maur|Maurist]] monastery''', built in the 17th century.

The abbey is noted for its 11th–14th-century [[grave (burial)|grave]]s, carved in the rock, its subterranean [[crypt]], and its massive unfinished church. It was an important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, and in the 18th century it was the site of a large [[Maurist]] monastery, now in [[ruin]]. The abbey and the landscape around it were frequently painted and drawn by [[Vincent van Gogh]].

It has been listed since 1840 as a ''[[monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="merimee"&gt;{{Base Mérimée|PA00081117}} Ancienne abbaye de Montmajour&lt;/ref&gt; Today the ruins of the abbey are cared for as a historic monument by the ''[[Centre des monuments nationaux]]''.

== Early history and legends of Montmajour ==
Until the late Middle Ages, Montmajour was an island, 43 meters above the surrounding terrain, protected by marshes and accessible only by boat. As early as the 3rd millennium BC the island was used as a cemetery, with individual graves carved into the rock. In the 9th and 10th centuries the island also served as a sanctuary for the local residents during invasions of the [[Saracens]] and the [[Normans]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Abbey of Montmajour'', Jean-Maurice Rouquette and Aldo Bastié, Monum Editions de patrimoine, Centre des monuments nationaux, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Middle Ages, several legends arose about Montmajour and its founding. One legend said that the island had been the sanctuary of St. [[Trophimus]], who had been sent from Rome by [[St. Peter]] to convert the [[Gauls]]. After coming to Arles in 46 AD, he took shelter in one of the caves on the island and received disciples there. A rock cell under the church is called "The Confessional of St. Trophimus." Until 943 the island belonged to the [[Church of St. Trophime]] in Arles.

Another legend said that the graves were those of soldiers of [[Charlemagne]], who had fought against the Saracens.  A third legend said that the first church was founded by King [[Childebert I]], the son of [[Clovis I|Clovis]], when he saw the fervor of a group of [[hermit]]s on the island.

== Chronology ==
*'''949''' - A Frankish noblewoman, [[:fr:Teucinde d'Arles|Teucinde of Arles]], acquires the island from the [[Archbishop of Arles]], and leaves it in her will to a group of hermits already residing on the island, with instructions to create a monastery following the [[Rule of St. Benedict]].
*'''963''' - [[Pope Leo VIII]] puts the monastery under his direct patronage and raises it to the status of an abbey.
*'''11th century''' - The first Abbey Church of Mary, Mother of the Lord ({{lang-fr|Marie la mère du seigneur}}) is built between 1030-69. The Chapel of St. Peter is excavated into the rock on the south side of the hill, near the cemetery. The crypt of the church is [[consecrated]] by Pons de Marignane, Archbishop of Arles, on 3 May, most likely in 1019, at the insistence of Rambert, the 7th Abbot of Montmajour. The abbey church becomes the resting place of the [[Counts of Provence]].
*'''1030''' - The abbey acquires what is believed to be a fragment of the [[True Cross]] obtained from a larger piece which had been venerated in Arles since the 4th century. The Chapel of St. Benedict is dedicated to the relic, and the abbey thereby becomes a major pilgrimage site. It was dedicated in that year by the Archbishop of Arles, who proclaimed the "Pardon of Montmajor" for all those seeking [[absolution]] from their sins who went to that remote location on May 3, the obsolete [[feast day]] of the Finding of the [[True Cross]] known as "[[Roodmas]]", and who left a donation for the completion of the abbey church. By the 12th century the shrine has become so popular with pilgrims that the abbey has to build a separate church for the relic, the '''Chapel of the Holy Cross''', located outside the abbey walls.
*'''12th century''' - The second abbey church is built, possibly on the site of the previous one. The abbey is at the peak of its influence and wealth. It possesses vineyards, cornfields, olive groves, waterways, mills, fisheries and forests, and had dependent [[Priory|priories]] and land all over Provence, and as far away as [[Fréjus]], [[Sisteron]] and  [[Grenoble]]. The rulers of Provence give the abbey land, castles, and even entire towns, such as [[Pertuis]].
*Construction of the Abbey Church of Our Lady is begun, but because of a shortage of money, only the first two [[bay (architecture)|bay]]s are completed.
*'''13th century''' - The abbey has 60 resident monks, a large number for the period. By then it is the [[motherhouse]] of a network of 56 [[priory|priories]], subject to the Abbot of Montmajour.
*'''1348''' - The [[Black Plague]] reduces by half the population of Provence.
*'''1357''' - The [[Free Company]], armies of French soldiers left unpaid after the defeat of France by the [[England|English]] army at [[Poitiers]] during the [[Hundred Years War]], ravage the countryside. It is pillaged again by marauders in 1357, and by the soldiers of [[Raimond de Turenne]] of [[Les Baux]], who wage war against Arles from 1386 to 1398. The Abbot of Montmajour, Pons de L'Orme, then fortifies the monastery with a massive tower. Starvation and destruction become widespread in Provence.
*'''1593''' - During the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], the abbey is occupied by soldiers of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], and the monks are forced to move to Arles for two years. When they return, they find the monastery ruined.
*'''1639''' - Against the wishes of the majority of monks, the abbey is given to a new Benedictine [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]], the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists, a Benedictine reform based at the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris. Despite the hostility of the "old" monks, and of the [[commendatory abbot]], Charles Bichi, whose family had purchased his title from the king and who does not reside at the abbey and refuses to pay for its upkeep, the Maurists begin a program of restoration and construction.
*Though the Maurists monks number only 30, their construction program is grandiose - they begin a classical building designed to have 25 bays along its north and south facades. Sixteen bays are completed by the time of the [[French Revolution]].
*'''1786''' - The titular abbot, Cardinal [[Louis de Rohan]], refuses to pay anything further for the upkeep of the abbey, and it was officially secularized.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}
*'''1789''' - At the time of the French Revolution, only nine monks remain at Montmajour.
*'''1791-1793''' - The monastery is sold for 62,000 ''livres'' to Elizabeth Roux-Châtelard, who strips the Maurist building and leaves it in ruins. The property is then divided and resold to twenty different owners. The medieval part is used for a sheep farm and haylofts.
*'''1797''' - The painter [[Jacques Réattu]] buys the Pons de l'Orme tower, saving it from destruction.
*'''1822''' - The city of Arles buys the Chapel of the Holy Cross from a fisherman, and preserves it.
*'''1840''' - The writer [[Prosper Mérimée]], Inspector of Ancient Monuments for the French government, puts the abbey on the first list of French historical monuments which should be preserved. Restoration begins on some of the buildings in 1862, and continues for decades.
*'''1859''' - The last of the Romanesque and Gothic properties are purchased by the state.   The Maurist building is not purchased until 1921.
*'''1944''' - A major fire breaks out inside the abbey church, which is being used by the German Army as an arms depot.

== St. Peter's Chapel (11th century) ==
[[File:Montmajour-ErmitageStPierre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nave of St. Peter's Chapel (11th century)]]
St. Peter's Chapel is the oldest existing part of the abbey, probably built between 1030 and 1050.&lt;ref&gt;The Abbey of Montmajour, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a [[narthex]] and two parallel naves, the older one cut into the rock on the south side of the hill, and an arcade of rounded Romanesque arches resting on columns, creating openings to the rock cemetery.  The columns are older than the church, and probably come from Roman buildings in Arles; but the capitals of the columns are carved with Romanesque floral designs. The southern nave is complete with a [[choir]] and a semi-circular [[apse]].

Inside the church a passage leads to what appears to be a natural cave, with a small window, which according to tradition was the home of St. Trophimus and the first monks to live on the island.

The chapel was severely vandalized in 1976, with restoration due by 2012.

== Rock Cemetery  (11th-14th century) ==
The rocky slope near St. Peter's Chapel has more than a dozen tombs cut into the rock in the shape of human bodies, with places for the head, shoulders and feet. The more recent tombs (14th century) were rectangular, and were probably covered with stone slabs.  Most of the tombs are oriented with the feet toward the east, the direction of the sunrise and the Resurrection.

== Chapel of the Holy Cross (12th century) ==
[[File:Chapelle de Ste-Croix, Arles.JPG|thumb|Chapel of the Holy Cross]]
The '''Chapel of the Holy Cross''' (French: ''Chapelle de Sainte-Croix'') was built to contain the most valuable relic of the abbey, a piece of the True Cross. It is located a few hundred meters from the abbey church, outside the monastery walls, to provide the monks with greater separation from the crowds of pilrims.

It was dedicated on 20 April and is in the shape of a cross, with a vestibule on the north side, and four semicircular apses with semicircular domes around a square bay with a cloister vault.  The vault is crowned by a perfect stone square, topped by triangular pediments and a small tower. The cornices and pediments are decorated with dentils. The building, with its dignity, simplicity, symmetry and perfect craftsmanship, is considered a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture.

==Crypt of St Benedict  (12th century) ==
[[File:Montmajour Abbey Crypt of St. Benedict Rotunda.jpg|thumb|Crypt of St. Benedict Rotunda (12th century)]]
The crypt of St Benedict is partly dug into the rock of the hill and partly built of massive stone walls, perfectly cut.  It features a transept with two absidioles, or small chapels, and a passage which leads to a small rotunda which is crowned with a cupola.  The rotunda is surrounded by an '''ambulatory''' a tall, narrow hemicircular corridor with a stone barrel vault.  On its outer side, the ambulatory opens into five radiating chapels, each with its own window catching the eastern light, and its own small barrel-vaulted choir bay and semi-domed apse. The large number of small chapels allowed the large number of monks in the monastery to quickly celebrate the morning mass. 
A striking feature of the crypt is the smooth quality of the stone work- the stones are perfectly cut and fitted, and their only texture is the slight rippling caused by dressing the stone with the help of a toothed hammer.&lt;ref&gt;The Abbey of Montmajour, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nave and choir of the Abbey Church of Notre-Dame (12th century) ==
[[File:Montmajour-Abbatiale.jpg|thumb|upright|Apse of the abbatial church (12th century)]]
The massive church on top of the crypt has a single nave fourteen meters wide. It was designed to have five bays, but apparently because of a shortage of funds only two bays were constructed, and the west end was left unfinished.

The '''nave''' is covered with slightly pointed barrel vaults supported by projecting traverse arches resting upon cruciform piers.

The '''apse''', at the east end of the church, is semicircular, and has the same diameter as the width of the nave. It has an imposing semi-spherical dome with five flat ribs, and three small windows, slightly offset to one side.   Perhaps because of the strong mistral and tramontane winds from the north, the nave has no windows on the north side.

The church has a relatively short '''transept''', each wing ending in a small apsidiole.

There are three doorways on the south side of the church; one leading to the rock cemetery, one to abbot's lodging (now ruined); and one to the chapter house and  the spiral stairway to the bell tower.

Two new chapels were added to the north side of the nave in the 15th century. One, which served as the [[sacristy]], contains the 18th century [[lavabo]], or washing basin, and the other protected the charters of the Abbey.

== The cloister (12th century) ==
[[File:Montmajour-Cloître3.jpg|thumb|View of the cloister from the watchtower]]
The '''cloister''' was built to the south of the church.  It was meant to reinforce the walls of the first four bays of the church, but these bays were never built.  It is rectangular, 27 meters long and 24 meters wide. In the center is a cistern which collected rainwater through pipes and channels from the roofs of the monastery buildings.

The '''north gallery''' is the oldest part of the cloister. The traverse arches are supported by brackets decorated with carvings of real and mythological beasts, including a [[tarasque]].  Some of the foliage-decorated columns show human heads looking through the foliage. The original sculpted capitals were repaired in the 19th century.

At the beginning of the '''east gallery''' is the tomb of the Counts of Provence, built to hold the remains of Count Raymond Berenger IV (died 1181).  The only original Romaneque capitals are in this arcade, representing the [[Temptation of Christ]] by a small devil with flaming hair; on the other side is an acrobat performing splits, and an apple, the symbol of temptation.

The '''west gallery''' was extensively altered by the Maurist monks in the 18th century, but the brackets have some of the most vivid carvings, showing the [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]] wind, the moon, the sun and fire, and a mythical amphibious beast devouring a man. It also has 13th century graffiti depicting sailing ships and horses.

The '''south gallery''' is the most recent, and the carvings are the most realistic; a donkey, a monkey, a camel and an eagle are depicted on the brackets, and the columns show the Annunciation the crowning of the Virgin, and knights fighting.

The '''Chapter House''' was connected with the east gallery- here the monks gathered each morning to hear a chapter of the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] followed by a brief teaching on it by the abbot, and also discussed the management of the abbey. It is lit by a single oculus, or round window, and connected with the nave and by a stairway to the dormitory.

The '''Refectory''', or dining room, connected with the south gallery through a Romanesque door decorated with a grotesque head of [[Tantalus]],

The '''dormitory''' of the monks occupied the entire floor over the refectory, and was connected to it by two staircases.

The west gallery formerly connected to the cellar, bakery, bread oven, and guest rooms, which no longer exist.

== The Tower of Pons de l'Orme (14th century) ==
The tower was built by the abbot and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]], Pons de l'Orme, beginning in 1369 to protect the abbey from the rampaging Free Company (see chronology.) The tower is 26 meters high, and contained a well and a storeroom for provisions, having three stories in the upper level. The top is equipped with battlements, arrow slits and [[machicolation]], designed to drop unpleasant things on the heads of attackers. The coat of arms of the abbot, an elm tree with two angel-monks, is carved on the outside of the tower.

== The Maurist monastery (18th century) ==
[[File:Montmajour StMaur 03.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the Maurist monastery (18th century)]]
The ruined Maurist Monastery was built in the classical [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesian]] style on a huge scale; the building was originally five stories high, covering eight thousand square meters, with sixty windows and two grand staircases.  The monks, [[lay brother]]s and [[novices]] lived on the top two floors, with their library, classrooms and archives.  The building was largely demolished after the French Revolution for its building materials (see Chronology.)

==Vincent van Gogh at Montmajour Abbey==
The painter [[Vincent van Gogh]], who lived in nearby [[Arles]], frequently painted and drew the Abbey and the landscape around it. In a letter to his brother in July 1888, he said he had been at Montmajour at least fifty times "to see the view over the plain."  He  wrote on July 5, 1888:  "Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath, where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheat fields in the valley. it was romantic, and couldn't be more so."

A painting that van Gogh had done on July 4, 1888, ''[[Sunset at Montmajour]]'', long considered a fake, was authenticated and placed on display in the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]] in September 2013.

'''Mysore literature in Kannada''' is a body of literature composed in the [[Kannada language]] in the historical [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in [[Southern India]] and  written in the [[Kannada script]]. The writings date from the Kingdom of Mysore, which existed from around 1600 CE until the establishment of modern India in 1947. Many of the works of this literature written on religious themes are labeled [[Veerashaiva]] or [[Vaishnava]] in acknowledgment of the two faiths that gave form to the literature and fostered it until the advent of the [[Modern Kannada literature|modern era]].&lt;ref name="oldest10"/&gt; Despite a gradual decline in the popularity of [[Jainism]], authors devoted to the faith produced some works of merit.&lt;ref name="oldest10"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 17, Shastri (1955), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Secular themes dealing with a wide range of subjects were also written on.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23–26; Kamath (2001), p. 228, 280; Pranesh (2003), pp. 11, 60; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Kannada literature flourished for a short while in the court of the neighbouring kingdom of the [[Keladi Nayaka|Nayakas]] of [[Keladi]] whose territory was annexed by Mysore in 1763.&lt;ref name="keladinayaka"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 370, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

During an age of revival and innovation, some Mysore court poets brought back the classical ''[[champu]]'' (a composition in prose-verse), a form of writing that had prevailed in Kannada prior to the 13th century, and initiated writings on contemporary history.&lt;ref name="ship"&gt;Shipley (2007), pp. 526, 528&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakshagana]], a native form of dramatic literature meant for a rustic audience, consolidated in the coastal and [[malnad]] (hill) regions in the 16th century and gained popularity thereafter, and spread to Mysore and [[Yelandur]].&lt;ref name="sabha10"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 22; Brandon and Banham (1993), p. 115; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; The literature of the itinerant [[Haridasa]]s, popular in the 15th and 16th century, was revived in the 18th and 19th century, and had a strong influence on devotionalism in the Kannada speaking regions.&lt;ref name="flourish"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200&amp;ndash;201; Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 884; Thielemann (2002), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[vachana]]'' poetic tradition was repopularised by some poets while others wrote anthologies and doctrines based on the 12th century Veerashaiva canon.&lt;ref name="repopularise"&gt;Shipley (2007), p. 528; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 188&amp;ndash;192; Nagaraj (2003) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Social developments in the 19th century brought the influence of [[English literature]] and classical [[Sanskrit literature]], resulting in the birth of modern prose, prose narrative and theatrical literature.&lt;ref name="murthy"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 167&amp;ndash;170&lt;/ref&gt;

The men of letters in the Mysore royal court included not only the court poets, who were often quite prolific, but also on occasion the rulers themselves.&lt;ref name="kan6"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Shipley (2007), p. 528; Kamath (2001), pp. 227, 229&amp;ndash;230; Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23, 26; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Pranesh (2003), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the post [[Vijayanagara empire|Vijayanagara]] period, a new kind of lyrical poetry, one unaffiliated with the royal court, and written by maverick-poets was gaining popularity.&lt;ref name="folk"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 378&amp;ndash;379&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of [[Meter (poetry)|metres]], indigenous and Sanskritic, were popular including ''tripadi'' (3-line verse), ''shatpadi'' (6-line verse) and ''saptapadi'' (7-line verse) metres, and ''gadya'' (prose).&lt;ref name="meteres"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192, 210; Pranesh (2003), pp. 21, 32, 42–43, 49&amp;ndash;50, 87&amp;ndash;88; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-16th century, Kannada literature had been influenced by three important socio-religious developments: [[Jainism]] (9th&amp;ndash;12th centuries), [[Veerashaivism]] (devotion to the god Shiva, from the 12th century), and [[Vaishnavism]] (devotion to the god Vishnu, from the 15th century).&lt;ref name="models"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 17, 65&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhakti"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 167&amp;ndash;170, 192&amp;ndash;195&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period.&lt;ref name="topics"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 61&amp;ndash;64&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain works were written in the classical ''champu'' metre and were centred on the lives of [[Tirthankar]]s (saints), princes and personages associated with the [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="champu"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 17, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The early Veerashaiva literature (1150&amp;ndash;1200 CE), comprising pithy poems called ''Vachanas'' (''lit.'' "utterance" or "saying")&lt;ref name="favour1"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 360&amp;ndash;361; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="favour10"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 115; Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; which propagated devotion to the god Shiva were written mostly as  prose-poems, and to a lesser extent in the ''tripadi'' metre.&lt;ref name="3line"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 59; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3line1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 163&amp;ndash;164, 166&amp;ndash;169, 191&lt;/ref&gt; From the 13th century, Veerashaiva writers made the saints of the 12th century the protagonists of their writings and established native metres such as the ''ragale'' (lyrical compositions in blank verse) and  the ''shatpadi''.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 362; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragale"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 551&amp;ndash;552, pp. 403&amp;ndash;404; Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 179&amp;ndash;205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harishchandra"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 1181&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaishnava writers of the 15th and early 16th century [[Vijayanagara empire]] consisted of the [[Brahmin]] commentators who wrote under royal patronage, and the itinerant [[Haridasa]]s, saint-poets who spread the philosophy of [[Madhvacharya]] using simple Kannada in the form of melodious songs.&lt;ref name="thimmanna"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhaktimusic"&gt;Sharma (1961), pp. 514&amp;ndash;555&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="music1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 194&amp;ndash;200&lt;/ref&gt; The Haridasa poets used genres such as the ''kirthane'' (compositions based on rhythm and melody), the ''suladi'' (rhythm-based) and the ''ugabhoga'' (melody-based).&lt;ref name="ugabhoha"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 166&amp;ndash;167, 193&amp;ndash;194&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kannada writings had changed from ''marga'' (formal) to ''desi'' (vernacular) and become more accessible to the commoner.&lt;ref name="gamut"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 163&amp;ndash;164, 166&amp;ndash;167&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments from 16th century ==

=== Court and monastic literature ===
After the decline of the [[Vijayanagara empire]], the centres of Kannada literary production shifted to the courts of the emerging independent states, at Mysore and [[Keladi]].&lt;ref name="keladi"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 370, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Keladi was centred at Keladi and nearby [[Ikkeri]] in the modern [[Shivamogga district]]. At their peak, their domains included the coastal, hill and some interior regions of modern [[Karnataka]]. Writers in the Keladi court authored important works on Veerashaiva doctrine. The Keladi territories and that of smaller chiefs (''Palegars'') were eventually absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore by 1763.&lt;ref name="absorb"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 220, pp. 225&amp;ndash;226; Nagaraj (2003), p. 370; Rice E.P. (1921), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The unique aspect of the Mysore court was the presence of numerous multi-lingual writers, some of whom were Veerashaivas. They were often adept in Telugu and Sanskrit, in addition to Kannada. The Veerashaiva monasteries that had sprung up in various regions including [[Mysore]], [[Tumkur]], [[Chitradurga]] and [[Bangalore]] sought to spread their influence beyond the Kannada speaking borders.&lt;ref name="border"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), pp. 377&amp;ndash;378&lt;/ref&gt; Sadakshara Deva, a Veerashaiva writer, tried to rejuvenate the classical ''champu'' style of writing.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; The [[Srivaishnavism|Srivaishnava]] (a sect of Vaishnavism) writers, who were dominant in the Mysore court, maintained a literary style that was conventional and conservative while proliferating lore and legend. A spurt in Vaishnava writings resulted in new renderings of the epics, the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]] and no fewer than three versions of the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name="rendering"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 91&amp;ndash;92&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 17th century, information about royal genealogy and achievements had been recorded mostly on versified inscriptions. Beginning with the 17th century, with the consolidation of the feudatory of Mysore into an independent kingdom, historical and biographical writings became popular. A number of such works were penned by the court poets in the 17th and early 18th century, most notably, Tirumalarya II and Chikkupdhyaya. Some of these writings would later serve as valuable research and source material for modern day historians.&lt;ref name="kantiravavijaya"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk and didactic literature===
[[File:Yakshagana artists makeup.jpg|right|thumb|Yakshagana artists applying makeup to prepare for a play]]
Yakshagana (''lit.'' "Songs of the demi-gods") is a composite folk-dance-drama or folk theatre of [[South India|southern India]] which combines literature, music, dance and painting into. The best-known forms of this art are from the [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Udupi district]], [[Uttara Kannada]] and to some extent from the [[Shimoga district]] of modern Karnataka.&lt;ref name="gana10"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gana"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 17&amp;ndash;18, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="region"&gt;Brandon and Banham (1993), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of dance-dramas collectively termed as Yakshagana. The ''Yakshagana Tenkutittu'' (''lit.'' "Yakshagana of the southern style") is popular primarily in the [[Mangalore]] region and the ''Yakshagana Badagatittu Bayalaata'' (''lit.'' "Yakshagana of northern style performed outdoors") is popular in [[Udupi]] and surrounding regions.&lt;ref name="kau"&gt;Ashton (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Other art forms also grouped under Yakshagana are the ''Nagamandalam'', a dance meant to appease the deity [[Nāga|Naga]], and a variety of ''bhuta'' (spirit) dances.&lt;ref name="gana"/&gt; The "Yakshagana Tenkutittu" is more akin to the classical [[Kathakali]] of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="gana"/&gt;

According to modern Kannada writer [[Shivarama Karanth]], the region between Udupi and [[Ikkeri]] could be where the Yakshagana of the northern style originated.&lt;ref name="vij"&gt;Karanth in Ashton (2003), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noted that the earliest forms of dance-drama, called the ''Gandharagrama'', are mentioned in the writing ''Narada Siska'' dated to 600&amp;ndash;200 BCE. This primitive form developed into "Ekkalagana", a term which appears in the 12th century Kannada writings ''Mallinathapurana'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1105, by Nagachandra) and the ''Chandraprabha Purana'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1189, by Aggala&lt;ref name="agga"&gt;Rice E. P. (1921), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ekkala"&gt;Karanth in Ashton (2003), pp. 20&amp;ndash;21&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar M.M. Bhat, ''Chattana'', a native composition adaptable to singing and  mentioned in  ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;850) could be considered the earliest known forerunner of the Kannada Yakshaganas.&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat (''Yakshagana-Stage in Karnataka'', 1963) in Ashton (2003), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of c.&amp;nbsp;1565 from [[Bellary]] describes a grant to a troupe of [[Tala-Maddale]] performers. The earliest available manuscript containing Yakshagana plays is ''Virata Parva'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1565) by Vishnu of Brahmavara in South Kanara, and ''Sugriva Vijaya'' (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi. The earliest available edition of Yakshagana plays, ''Sabhaparva'', is dated to c.&amp;nbsp;1621.&lt;ref name="sabha"&gt;Ashton (2003), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sugriva"&gt;Brandon and Banham (1993), p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Haridasa ''Sahitya'', the devotional literature of the Vaishnava saints of Karnataka, flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries under the guidance of such saint-poets as [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Purandara Dasa]] ("father of carnatic music")&lt;ref name="similar"/&gt; and [[Kanaka Dasa]]. This period, according to the scholars M.V. Kamath and V.B. Kher, may be called its "classical period". This literature was revived in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Kamath and Kher (2000), pp. 60&amp;ndash;61&lt;/ref&gt; According to musicologist Selina Tielemann, the Vaishnava ''bhakti'' (devotion) movement, which started with the 6th century [[Alvars]] of modern Tamil Nadu and spread northwards, reached its peak influence on [[South India]]n devotionalism with the advent of the Haridasas of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="peakinfluence"&gt;Thielemann (2002), pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; The Haridasa poetry, which bears some structural similarities to devotional songs of northern and eastern India, is preserved in written textual form but the musical compositions in which they are rendered have been passed down orally. These songs have remained popular with the members of the Madhva religious order even in the modern age.&lt;ref name="similar"&gt;Thielemann (2002), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vijaya Dasa]], [[Gopala Dasa]] and [[Jagannatha Dasa]] are the most prominent among the saint-poets belonging of the "didactic period".&lt;ref name="hari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enrich"/&gt; The scholar Mutalik classifies Haridasa devotional songs into the following categories: "biographical, socio-religious, ethical and ritualistic, didactic and philosophical, meditative, narrative and eulogistic and miscellaneous".&lt;ref name="hari"/&gt; Their contribution to Hindu mysticism and the ''bhakti'' literature is similar to the contributions of the Alvars and [[Nayanmar]]s of modern [[Tamil Nadu]] and that of the devotional saint-poets of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="vedanta"&gt;Sharma (2000), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash, about 300 saint-poets from this cadre enriched Kannada literature during the 18th&amp;ndash;19th century&lt;ref name="enrich"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Basava statue crop.png|left|upright|thumb|Basavanna, protagonist of many a Veerashaiva writing]]
After a break of more than three centuries, writing of ''vachana'' poems was revived. Though some poets such as Tontada Siddhalingayati (1540), Swatantra Siddhalingeswara (1565), Ganalingideva (1560), Shanmukha Swamy (1700), Kadasiddheswara (1725) and Kadakolu Madivallappa (1780) attempted to re-popularise the tradition with noteworthy pieces, they lacked the mastery of the 12th century social reformers.&lt;ref name="mastery"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of the later day ''vachanakaras'' (''lit.'' "Vachana poets") were undoubtedly [[Sarvajna]] and [[Shishunala Sharif|Sisunala Sherif]] (late 18th century).&lt;ref name="sar-sisu"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 377, p. 379; Shipley (2007), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt; Sarvajna is known to have lived sometime between the mid-16th century and the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="sarlived"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sisunala"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Prasad (1987), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''vachana'' poetic tradition had come to a temporary halt, the creation of anthologies and commentaries based on the earlier ''vachana'' canon, depicting the 12th century Veerashaiva saints as its protagonists, became popular from around c.&amp;nbsp;1400. Among well-known 16th century anthologists were Channaveeracharya (16th century) and Singalada Siddhabasava (c.&amp;nbsp;1600) who interpreted the ''vachanas'' from a purely philosophical and meta-physical context.&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 188&amp;ndash;189&lt;/ref&gt; In the Keladi court, notable works on doctrine, such as ''Virasaivadharma siromani'' ("Crest jewel of the moral order of the Veerashaivas") and ''Virasaivananda chandrike'' ("Moonlight to delight the Veerashaivas") were written.&lt;ref name="chandra"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; A new genre of mystic ''Kaivalya'' literature, a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and the [[Advaitha]] (monistic) philosophy, consolidated from the 16th century onwards. While the most famous writings are ascribed to [[Nijaguna Shivayogi]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1500), later day writers such as Mahalingaranga (''Anubhavamrita'' in ''shatpadi'' metre, c.&amp;nbsp;1675) and Chidanandavadhuta (''Jnana Sindhu'') are also notable.&lt;ref name="pieces"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern literature===
{{Main article|Modern Kannada literature}}
The birth of modern expression in the Kannada language can be traced to the early 19th century, a transition that in later decades included the influence of [[English literature]] on local traditions.&lt;ref name="assert"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest examples of modern literature came in the form of prose, either inspired by or renderings of Sanskrit classics, in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. The king himself was an accomplished Kannada writer to whom is ascribed the prose romance ''Saugandhika Parinaya''.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt; Under the patronage of the king, Kempu Narayana wrote ''Mudramanjusha'' ("The Seal Casket", 1823), a historical novel and an innovative version of the Sanskrit original, ''Mudrarakshasa'' by Vishaka Datta. This work is considered the trailblazer in modern Kannada prose.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt;

English-language education, the role of missionaries, their translation of the [[Bible]] into Kannada in 1820, the arrival of the printing press, publication of newspapers and periodicals and the earliest Kannada-English and English-Kannada dictionaries helped to modernise Kannada prose.&lt;ref name="prose"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168; Kamath (2001), pp. 278&amp;ndash;280&lt;/ref&gt; Development of prose narrative came by way of translations of Christian classics, such as ''Yatrikana Sanchara'' (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', 1847). Dramatic literature got its impetus from translations of Sanskrit and English classics (''[[Shakuntala]]'' in 1869; ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').&lt;ref name="shakuntala"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; The modern novel, with a reformist outlook, was born in 1892. This milestone was followed by the earliest social plays with similar themes, a trend that had already set roots in the modern literature of Marathi and Bengali languages.&lt;ref name="farce"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Muddanna (or Nandalike Lakshminarayana) stands out as a unique writer, whose language is Old-Kannada but whose sensibilities are modern. His two important works were ''Adbhuta Ramayana'' (1895) and ''Ramaswamedham'' (1898). The latter work is historically important to prose development &amp;ndash; ancient epic is handled from a modern viewpoint. The narrator is the author and the listener his wife. Muddanna's declaration ''Padyam Vadhyam, Gadyam Hridyam'' (''lit.'' "Poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart") summarises the trends in Kannada literature in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="padyam"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition from Vijayanagara===
With the waning of the Vijayanagara empire, Raja Wodeyar I (r. 1578&amp;ndash;1617) became the first ruler of political importance at Mysore, having ousted the Vijayanagara governor at [[Srirangapatna]]. However, the fledgling kingdom still owed nominal allegiance to the diminished empire.&lt;ref name="sovereign"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of an independent state that would influence regional polity and culture was laid in this period. In the following decades, the Mysore court became the inheritor of the Vijayanagara literary legacy and a centre for textual production not only in Kannada, the native language, but to some extent, even in Telugu and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="keladi"/&gt; The earliest available Kannada language writings from the Mysore court are by [[Tirumalarya|Tirumalarya I]] (or Tirumala Iyengar), Raja Wodeyar I's court poet. He composed the ''Karna Vrittanta Kathe'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1600) in ''sangatya'' metre, a composition rendered to the accompaniment of an instrument.&lt;ref name="kan10"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Raja Wodeyar I's grandson, Chamaraja VI (r. 1617&amp;ndash;1637), is the earliest among the Mysore kings known for their personal contribution to the fine arts. The king wrote ''Chamarajokti Vilasa'', a translation of the Sanskrit [[Ramayana]], in the [[Valmiki]] tradition.&lt;ref name="sovereign"/&gt; &lt;!--Other writings that belong to his reign are the treatises ''Ashwashastra'', ''Hayasara Samucchaya'' and ''Brahmottra Khanda''.&lt;ref name="kan11"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

During the rule of King [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I|Kanthirava Narasaraja Wodeyar I]] (r. 1637&amp;ndash;1659), the kingdom attained complete freedom, as evidenced from the issue of gold coins called ''phanams'', similar to ones issued by the Vijayanagara empire. This event was followed by a period of political expansion within modern southern Karnataka and a successful military encounter against the invading [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] commander Ranadullah Khan.&lt;ref name="phanam"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 227&amp;ndash;228&lt;/ref&gt; Govinda Vaidya, the most well-known poet in the royal court, wrote ''Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya'' (1648) in ''sangatya'' metre.&lt;ref name="kantiravavijaya"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In this eulogy, written in 26 chapters, Vaidya compares his patron king to "God [[Narasimha]]" (an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu). The writing also gives useful details about the kingdom, its social events, urban life, the king's court, the types of music composed by the court musicians and the instruments they used to render them.&lt;ref name="desika"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 227; Pranesh (2003), pp. 11&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Bhattakalanka Deva]], a Jain writer from Haduvalli in [[South Kanara]] excelled as a grammarian of extraordinary talent. He was the last of the three notables who wrote comprehensively on Old-Kannada grammar ([[Nagavarma II]] and [[Keshiraja]] being the other two).&lt;ref name="bhatta"/&gt; He was an expert in Sanskrit grammar as well. His extant Kannada grammar,  ''Karnataka Sabdanusasanam'', containing 592 Sanskrit ''sutras'' (a literary form written for concision) with ''vritti'' (glossary) and ''vyakhya'' (commentary), is written in four ''padas'' (chapters) and makes useful references to contemporary and earlier writers. His work is modelled after that of earlier Sanskrit grammarians, [[Pāṇini|Panini]], [[Pujyapada]] and others, and is considered an exhaustive work. The author's emphasis on the importance of Kannada language and its rich literary and poetic history is evident and was meant to be a rebuttal to the attitude shown by contemporary Sanskrit scholars towards Kannada language.&lt;ref name="bhatta"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 476&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadaksharadeva, who attempted to revive the classical (Sanskritised) ''champu'' metre, belonged to the [[Adikavi Pampa|Pampa]] tradition.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; A Veerashaiva by faith and the head of the [[Yelandur]] monastery, he was under the patronage of the Mysore court. A bilingual writer in Sanskrit and Kannada, his writings propagate his faith in the god Shiva. He wrote three well-known works in Kannada:&lt;ref name="yelandur"/&gt; ''Rakashekara Vilasa'' (1655), his best-known poetic work, written during his early days, has love as the main theme and rivals the poems in [[Lakshmisa]]'s ''Jaimini Bharata'' (17th century).&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; It is derived from a well-known devotional Tamil story of Satyendra Chola and is known to be based on an earlier work, ''Bhavachintaratna'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1513), by Kannada writer Gubbi Mallanarya of Vijayanagara.&lt;ref name="yelandur"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 3934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; In a noteworthy piece of [[elegy|elegiac]] poetry, the poet describes the lamentation of a mother in his own inimitable style. Upon hearing the news of her son's death by trampling under the hooves of Prince Rajashekara's horse, the mother rushes to the scene, and mourns, holding the body of her son in her lap.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p.1149&amp;ndash;1150&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vrishabhendra Vijaya'' (1671), a poem of epic proportions, written in forty-two [[canto]]s and 4,000 stanzas, is an account of the 12th century reformer [[Basavanna]]. ''Sabarasankara Vilasa'' is a poem in five cantos narrating a popular tale of the battle between the god Shiva and the [[Pandava]] prince [[Arjuna]]. To test Arjuna's devotion to him, Shiva disguises himself as a hunter and fights a fierce battle with Arjuna. Toward the end, impressed with Arjuna's devotion, Shiva bestows on him a weapon called ''Pashuptastra''.&lt;ref name="yelandur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pashupa"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable Kannada writers in the court of Kanthirava Narasaraja I (r. 1637&amp;ndash;1659) were Shantaveera Deshika (''Shivaganga Charitra'' in ''sangatya'' metre, 1650),&lt;ref name="shivaganga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Bhaskara (''Beharaganita'', on mathematics, early 17th century), Nanjakavi (''Kanthirava Narasaraja Charitra'', a historical, early 17th century) and Timmarasa (''Markandeya Ramayana'', the story of the god Rama which forms an episode in the forest section of the epic Mahabharata, c.&amp;nbsp;1650).&lt;ref name="markandeya"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narasa"&gt;Rice (1921), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Chamaiah, a court poet,  wrote an account of his patron, King [[Dodda Kempadevaraja|Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar]] (r. 1659&amp;ndash;1673) in ''Devarajendra Sangatya'' (late 17th century), and Channarya wrote a metrical history of the same king in ''Devaraja Vijaya'' (late 17th century).&lt;ref name="kan14"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 89; Pranesh (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Tirumalabhatta, a court poet of the Keladi ruler Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (r. 1586&amp;ndash;1629) wrote the poem ''Shivagita''.&lt;ref name="gita"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 220, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden age ===
The reign of King [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] (r. 1673&amp;ndash;1704) is a high point in the early history of the Kingdom of Mysore. The king, an able warrior known to have defeated even the [[Maratha]]s on occasion, held the upper hand against the [[Nizam]] of [[Golconda]] and brought the [[Keladi]] territories under his domain by 1682. An able administrator, the king was inclined towards the Srivaishnava faith.&lt;ref name="vai"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 228&amp;ndash;229&lt;/ref&gt; His reign produced numerous prolific writers, not the least the king himself &amp;ndash; he was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and a composer of music.&lt;ref name="chikka"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Shipley (2007), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chikka10"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 229&amp;ndash;230; Pranesh (2003), pp. 20&amp;ndash;21; Narasimhacharya (2001), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known treatise on music called ''Geeta Gopala'', written in opera style and in the ''saptapadi'' metre, is credited to him. Though inspired by [[Jayadeva]]'s ''Geeta Govinda'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1200), it had an originality of its own. The work differs from the original in that the god Krishna and his Gopikas are the protagonists of the play instead of Krishna and his consort [[Radha]].&lt;ref name="sapta"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78; Pranesh (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The writing consists of fourteen sections, with seven songs in each section. It is considered an asset to students of music and literature. The king's other works are commentaries on the [[Bhagavata]] and the later chapters of the epic [[Mahabharata]], a collection of devotional poems written in thirty verses (''Chikkadevaraya binappa'', "Kings Petition") and composed in praise of the god Cheluva Narayanaswamy of [[Melkote]].&lt;ref name="upa"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirumalarya II, a native of [[Srirangapatna]] and a descendent of Tirumalarya I, was held in high esteem in the Mysore court. A childhood friend of the King Chikka Devaraja, he served as his minister.&lt;ref name="childhood"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 90; Pranesh (2003), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Tirumalarya II authored five notable writings: ''Chikka Devaraja Saptapadi'' (''saptapadi'' metre, 1698), an important musical treatise rendered in seven sections comprising fifty-two songs which exalts the patron king to the level of "God on Earth";&lt;ref name="tiru"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 28&amp;ndash;30&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apratimavira Charite'' ("History of the Peerless Hero"), a rhetorical eulogy of the king and a treatise on poetics; ''Chikkadevaraja Vijaya'', an account of the king's conquests, his life and his ancestors, in the ''champu'' metre comprising six chapters; ''Chikkadevaraya Yaso-bhushana''; and the prose piece ''Chikkadevaraja Vamshavali'', one of the earliest available contemporary historicals in Kannada language describing the king's ancestry.&lt;ref name="tiru1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 23&amp;ndash;24, 62, 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 77&amp;ndash;78; Rice (1921), pp. 89&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Tirumalarya II composed seventy songs, most of which are in Kannada and a few in Telugu.&lt;ref name="tirumala"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister [[Chikkupadhyaya]] (or Lakshmipathi), a native of Terakanambi town in [[Mysore district]] was a zealous Srivaishnava and one of the most prolific Kannada writers of his time. To his credit are over thirty works, mostly in the ''sangatya'' and ''champu'' metres, and ''gadya'' (prose).&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 23; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 213; Pranesh (2003), pp. 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known works are ''Vishnupurana'' (prose and ''champu'' versions, 1691); ''Divya Suri Charitre'', a history of the twelve [[Alvar]] saints; ''Artha Panchaka'' ("Five truths"), on saint Pillai Lokacharya; a commentary on ''Tiruvayimole'' of saint [[Nammalvar]]; ''Kamalachala Mahatmya'' (1680); ''Hastigiri Mahatmya'' (1679); ''Rukmangada Charite'' (1681); ''Satvikabrahma-Vidya-Vilasa'', treating on the [[Visishtadvaita]] philosophy;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mahat"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yadugiri Mahatmya'', a eulogy of saint Kadambi Srirangacharya; ''Yadavagiri Mahatmya'', a eulogy of saint Kadambi Lakshmanacharya; and a collection of seventy songs called ''Shringarada Hadugalu'' in praise of his patron Chikka Devaraja  (pen-name "Chikkadevaraja").&lt;ref name="Upadhyaya"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lakshmisa]], a superb story-teller, a dramatist and a Vaishnava by faith, is one of the most well-known writers of ''kavyas'' (narrative poems). Kannada scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash opines he lived in the mid-16th century, but R. Narasimhacharya and historian Nilakanta Sastri claim he was active in  the late 17th century, probably during the rule of King Chikka Devaraja.&lt;ref name="dated"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 59; Sastri (1955), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dated10"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 210; Kamath (2001), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Jaimini Bharata'', written in ''shatpadi'' metre, is the poet's Kannada version of the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]] and is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval age.&lt;ref name="jai"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Sastri (1955), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of stories, the epic poem contains the famous tale of the ''Sita Parityaga'' ("Repudiation of Sita"). The author has succeeded in converting a religious story into a very human tale, making it popular even in modern times. For his deft usage of the language, the poet earned the honorific ''Upamalola'' (''lit.'' "One of revels in similes and metaphors").&lt;ref name="lakshmi"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaraya, a brother of Tirumalarya II, wrote ''Mitravinda Govinda'' (1680), the earliest available classical drama in Kannada. It is a play inspired by the Sanskrit drama ''Ratnavali'' ("Pearl necklace") by King [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]].&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 62; Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077&lt;/ref&gt; Among notable women poets, Srirangamma (1685) wrote ''Padmini Kalyana'' ("Marriage of Padmini"), and Sanchi Honnamma, a [[Vokkaliga]] from Yelandur, wrote ''Hadibadeya Dharma'', on the duties of a faithful wife. This work, which won her many accolades, is in nine sections, containing 479 stanzas, and is written in ''sangatya'' metre. Despite being employed as a betel bag bearer and as a maid to Queen Devajammani, she claimed Alasingaraya, a court poet, her Guru. Her work narrates the struggles of women in society, and stresses their need to fulfill their daily roles in family life.&lt;ref name="hon"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hon1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 230; Mukherjee (1999), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers under the patronage of King Chikka Devaraja were: Chidananda, a [[Jain]] poet wrote philosophical compositions called ''Tatwada Kirtanegalu'' (1675), ''Neeti Nrimaya'' and ''Munivamsha Bhyudaya'' in ''sangatya'' metre; Vaikunta Dasa (1680), a native of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] composed ''[[kirtan]]es'' on the god Vishnu (pen-name "Vaikunta") and songs such as ''Kapatamata'';&lt;ref name="vaikunta"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), pp. 32&amp;ndash;33&lt;/ref&gt; Timmakavi (''Hari Vilasa'' in ''sangatya'' metre and ''Yadavagiri Mahatmya'', 1677); Mallikarjuna (''Sriranga Mahatmya'', 1678) and Mallarasa (''Dasavatara Charite'')&lt;ref name="dasavatara"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Pranesh (2003), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Brahmin writers worthy of mention from the 17th century are Ramachandra (''Asrasastra''), Tirumalevaidya (''Uttara Ramayana'', 1650), Nagarasa of [[Pandharpur]] (''Bhagavadgite''), Timmarasa (''Kshetraganita'' on geometry),&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and Venkayarya, a Haridasa of [[Penukonda]] (''Krishnalilabhyudaya'').&lt;ref name="penu"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Among Jains, Padmana Pandita (''Hayasara Samuchchaya'') and Chandrashekara (''Ramachandra charitra'', story of the Hindu god [[Rama]]) are notable.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; Among Veerashaiva writers, Harisvara (''Prabhudeva Purana''), Siddhananjesa, (''Raghavanka Charitra'' and ''Gururaja Charitra''), Prasabhushana (or Pemmisetti, ''Gurubhaktandara Charitre''), Mummadi Tamma (''Sankara Samhita''), Parvatesvara (''Chatuacharya Purana'') and Sejjeya Siddhalingaraya (''Malayaraja Charite'') are well-known.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;

===Age of Sarvajna===
{{Kannada poets in 18th century}}
A mendicant Veerashaiva poet, a moralist and a drifter whose early days are unclear, Sarvajna (''lit.'' "The all knowing"), has left his indelible mark on Kannada literature and the Kannada-speaking people. He is known to have been a native of either Abbalur or Madagamasuru in the [[Dharwad district]]. Based on literary evidence scholars place him  variously between the 16th and 18th centuries. Prabhu Prasad of the [[Sahitya Akademi]] feels he belonged to the 16th century while Kannada scholars R. Narasimhacharya and H.S. Shiva Prakash claim he lived in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="assign"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 24; Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; To Sarvajna goes the credit of re-vitalising the ''vachana'' poetic tradition. His witty and didactic poems, numbering over 2,000, were written using the simple ''tripadi'' metre.&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt; Some clues in his first fourteen of a series of poems ("Reminiscences of Birth") give an indication about his birth, parentage and his reasons for leaving home at an early age.&lt;ref name="dhar"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; His poems after the 14th focus on his spiritual quest.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 9&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarvajna, who is not known to have acquired a formal education, gained knowledge from the world, writing poems impromptu about the nature of people and places. According to the scholar Naikar, Sarvajna was born to "sing the truth and truth alone".&lt;ref name="world"&gt;Naikar (2008), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His poems cover a vast range of topics, from caste and religion to economics and administration, from arts and crafts to family life and health. People from a broad spectrum of life were commented upon: "Professionals such as priests, astrologers, sorcerers, tax collectors and accountants; artisans such as smiths, carpenters, tailors and potters; and businessmen such as oil men, money-lenders, fishermen and farmers", all have caught the poet's discerning eye. Sarvajna reserved his compliments only for the farmers, weavers, real spiritual seekers and chaste housewives.&lt;ref name="sarlived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life10"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 17&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb in [[Hirekerur]] town in the Haveri district is said to be his final resting place.&lt;ref name="guru"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; His poems, all of which end with his name "Sarvajna", constitute some of Kannada's most popular works. Sarvajna is to Kannada language what [[Bhartrhari]] is to Sanskrit language, [[Vemana]] is to [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] is to [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Neither was he patronized by royalty nor did he write for fame or money.&lt;ref name="morals"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to instruct people about morality with poems such as these:&lt;ref name="vacpoems"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 191&amp;ndash;192; Prasad (1987), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|A begging bowl in hand,&lt;br&gt;

{{Haridasa poets (Kannada) of 17th-19th century}}
During the first half of the 18th century Mysore's independence was delicately balanced, with the incumbent kings accepting either a nominal subordination or a strategic alliance with the larger power, the Mughals of [[India|northern India]], by paying tribute while keeping the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]] (Baji Rao I) of the [[Deccan plateau]] at bay. From the 1830s, the kings also came under the sway of the powerful ''Dalavoy'' (or ''Dalwai'', Prime minister) Nanjaraja (or Nanjarajaiah) and ''Sarvadhikari'' (Chief minister) Devaraja (or Devarajaiah), the influential Kalale brothers of [[Nanjangud]].&lt;ref name="dalavoy"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 229&amp;ndash;230; Pranesh (2003), pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, literary contributions were made by some members of the royal family including King Narasaraja Wodeyar II, Nanjaraja and Queen Cheluvambe.&lt;ref name="kan5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nanja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shalya"/&gt;

Yakshagana, a rustic form of theatre which draws upon themes from the Hindu epics, the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Bhagavata]], has an established history in the Kannada speaking region of over 400 years.&lt;ref name="region"/&gt; In its rudimentary form, the script of the play contains ''prasanga'' (poetic songs) sung by the ''bhagavata'' (musician), to which improvised ''matu'' (dialogue) is added. Witty comments are interjected by ''hasyagaras'' (clowns). Musical instruments include ''maddale'' and ''chende'' (types of drums), and a ''sruti'' ([[Pump organ|harmonium]]-like instrument). The ''rangasthala'' (acting arena) could be a temple compound, an open space near the patron's house or a clearing in a paddy field.&lt;ref name="harmonium"&gt;Brandan and Banham (1993), pp. 115&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sugriva Vijaya'' (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi is one of the earliest available manuscripts of a Yakshagana play. It is based on the story of the ape-like humanoid king [[Sugriva]] who overthrew his powerful brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] to regain his kingdom in the Hindu epic Ramayana.&lt;ref name="region"/&gt; While scholars such as M.M Bhat, Shivarama Karanth and R.R. Diwakar have proposed various theories about the origin and forerunners of the Yakshagana art,&lt;ref name="rajarama"&gt;Ashton (2003), pp. 17&amp;ndash;23&lt;/ref&gt; N. Venkata Rao, editor of ''The Southern school in Telugu literature'' (1960), gives the credit of writing the earliest available Yakshagana plays that include ''sangita'' (music), ''nataka'' (drama) and ''natya'' (dance) to the polyglot king of Mysore, [[Narasaraja Wodeyar II|Narasaraja II]] (r. 1704&amp;ndash;1714).&lt;ref name="kan5"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The king was proficient in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Prakrit. His fourteen Yakshagana compositions, written in various languages but in the Kannada script, were discovered at the government manuscripts library in [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name="wod"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 37&amp;ndash;38&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, Yakshagana had become popular in Mysore and nearby Yelandur, where stage troupes were active.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

===Revival of Haridasa literature===
The Haridasa literature propagates the ''dvaita'' (dualistic) philosophy of Madhvacharya. Their compositions have also been of immense value to the development of music and literature in general. While ''Hari'' (a form of god Vishnu)  is central to their beliefs, their compositions show tolerance to other Vaishnava deities as well. By bringing the values cherished in the [[Upanishad]]s (scripture) and [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred texts) to the commoner in simple Kannada, these itinerant Haridasas made valuable contributions as "minstrels of God".&lt;ref name="bhimava"/&gt; With the passing of the [[Vijayanagara]] era, the creation of the Haridasa literature slowed down for about a century, despite attempts by two ''dasa'' (devotee) poets, Mahapati Dasa (1611&amp;ndash;1681), who wrote 600 compositions, and his son Krishna Dasa.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 883&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition however recovered in the early 18th century under the able guidance of [[Vijaya Dasa]] (1687&amp;ndash;1755),&lt;ref name="inspire"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; a native of Ceekalaparavi in the [[Raichur district]]. Vijaya Dasa was inspired by the establishment of the monastery of saint [[Raghavendra Swami]] (of the Madhvacharya order) at [[Mantralayam]] town. His lyrical compositions, said to be 25,000 in all, are written in the [[Purandara Dasa]] tradition with the pen-name (''ankita'') "Vijaya Vittala".&lt;ref name="rao"/&gt; Most well-known among his many disciples is [[Gopala Dasa]] who wrote with the pen-name "Gopala Vittala" (1721&amp;ndash;1769).&lt;ref name="inspire"/&gt; Later, Gopala Dasa inspired another famous saint-poet, Jagannatha Dasa, to take to the Haridasa fold.&lt;ref name="rao"/&gt;

Jagannatha Dasa (1728&amp;ndash;1809) is considered the most notable of the late-18th century Haridasas. Apart from a number of devotional songs, he is credited with two important writings. The ''Harikathamritasara'' treats on the philosophy of Madhvacharya. Written in the ''shatpadi'' metre with a poetic touch, it contains 32 chapters of 988 stanzas.&lt;ref name="tattva"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tattva Suvvali'', containing 1,200 pithy and proverbial poems written in the ''tripadi'' metre, is known to have been a consolation to his widowed daughter.&lt;ref name="tattva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tatva"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Among women, Helavanakatte Giriyamma (pen-name "Helavanakatte Ranga", early 18th century) and Harapanhally Bhimava (pen-name "Bhimesa Krishna", 1890) are notable despite their humble education and background. Giriyamma authored more than forty songs, and five narrative poems, the best known among which is the devotional piece  ''Chandrahasana Kathe''.&lt;ref name="bhimava"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mahi"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 201; Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dasas"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In a  prayer poem about famine, Giriyamma wrote:&lt;ref name="enrich"/&gt;
{{Quote|Women are taking out in vessels&lt;br&gt;

===Other writings===
Cheluvambe, a queen of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar I (r. 1714&amp;ndash;1732), was an accomplished Kannada writer. Her notable works include ''Varanandi Kalyana'',  written in the ''sangatya'' metre.&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; The story narrates the wedding of Varanandi, the daughter of the Badshah (Emperor) of Delhi, and the god Cheluvaraya Swamy of [[Melkote]]. In the writing, the author envisioned Varanandi to be a reincarnation of [[Satyabhama]], the consort of the Hindu god Krishna. Her other compositions include ''Venkatachala Mahatmyam'' &amp;ndash; a lullaby song written in ''choupadi'' (4-line verse) metre in devotion to the Hindu god [[Venkateshwara]] residing on the Vrishabha hill, songs centred on Alamelu Mangamma, the consort of the Hindu god Venkateshwara of [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], and songs in praise of the god Cheluvanarayana.&lt;ref name="manga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 42&amp;ndash;43&lt;/ref&gt; Shalyada Krishnaraja, a poet and a member from the royal family was proficient writer in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit. His contributions to Kannada literature include devotional songs, ''vachana'' poems, compositions in ''sangatya'' metre (''Nija Dipika Ratna''), ''gadya'' (''Anubhava Rasayana''), and ''kirthane'' compositions (''Bhakti Marga Sarovara'', ''Gnana Sarovara'' and ''Shalyada Arasinavara Tikina Kirtane'').&lt;ref name="shalya"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 49&amp;ndash;50&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanjaraja was the most noted of the Shaiva writers in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar II (r. 1734&amp;ndash;1766). For his literary taste, he earned the honorific "Nutana Bhojaraja", a comparison to the medieval [[Bhoja|King Bhoja]]. A native of Kalale town near [[Nanjangud]], Nanjaraja came from an influential family of warriors, statesman and scholars. He was politically active and is known to have created a power centre, holding court in parallel to Krishnaraja II.&lt;ref name="nanja"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  He was proficient in multiple languages and authored more than twenty writings in Kannada, Sanskrit and Telugu. Among his Kannada writings, ''Kukudgiri Mahatmya'',&lt;ref name="maha"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical composition called ''Aravattu muvara trivadhi'', an account of the life of 63 ancient devotees of the god Shiva, is well known.&lt;ref name="trivadi"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known Shaiva writers were Chenniah, who wrote in the ''sangatya'' metre (''Padmini Parinaya'', 1720),&lt;ref name="padmini"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nuronda, who eulogised his patron Krishnaraja II in ''Soundarya Kavya'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1740) in ''sangatya'' metre, and Sankara Kavi (''Chorabasava Charitre'', 18th century).&lt;ref name="sankara"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 25; Pranesh (2003), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Linganna Kavi wrote a ''champu'' historical piece called ''Keladinripavijayam'' in the 1763&amp;ndash;1804 period accounting for the chronology and history of the Keladi dynasty. The work also gives useful information about contemporary kingdoms and states including the Nawabs of Savanur, the Marathas and the Mughals.&lt;ref name="nawab"&gt;Ciṭaṇīsa and Chitnis (2000), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Jain writers of the period were Payanna (''Ahimsacharitre''), Padmaraja (''Pujyapada Charitre'', 1792), Padmanabha (''Ramachandra Charitre''), Surala (''Padmavati Charitre''), and Jayendra (''Karnataka Kuvalayananda'').&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; Vaishnava writers who distinguished themselves were Lakshmakavi (''Bharata'' in 1728 and ''Rukmangada Charite''), Venkatesha (''Halasya Mahatmya'', in ''champu'' metre), Konayya (''Krishnarjuna Sangara''), Timmamatya (''Ramabhyudaya Kathakusumamanjari'', a version of the epic Ramayana), Timmarya of [[Anekal]] (''Ananda Ramayana'', 1708), Balavaidya Cheluva (''Lilavati'', and an encyclopedia of precious stones called ''Ratnasastra''),&lt;ref name="maha"/&gt; and Puttayia (''Maisuru Arasugala Purvabhyudaya'', c.&amp;nbsp;1713, an account of the history of the Kingdom of Mysore).&lt;ref name="putta"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 89, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century writings==

===Age of prose and drama===
After the death of [[Tipu Sultan]] in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war (1799), the British took control of the kingdom. They however restored the Wodeyars in the smaller [[princely state]] of Mysore under the [[paramountcy]] of the [[British Raj]]. The British took direct control of the administration of the kingdom in 1831, after which Maharaja [[Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar|Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]] devoted all his time to developing the fine arts, earning him the honorific "Abhinava Bhoja" (''lit.'' "Modern [[Bhoja]]").&lt;ref name="bhoj"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 249, 278; Pranesh (2003), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnaraja III (1799&amp;ndash;1868) is called the "Morning Star of the Renaissance in Karnataka".&lt;ref name="star"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; A patron of the fine arts, he was an accomplished writer, musician, musicologist and composer.&lt;ref name="mantra"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55&lt;/ref&gt; He gave munificent grants to scholars and was a prolific writer himself. Of the over forty writings attributed to him, a prose romance called ''Saugandhika Parinaya'', in two versions (a ''sangatya'' composition and a play) is best known.&lt;ref name="sou"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 26; Murthy (1992), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In this writing, the author imaginatively narrates the story of the sage [[Durvasa]] who curses Devendra (the Hindu god [[Indra]]) to be born as Sucharitra, the son of King Sugandharaya of Ratnapuri. Devendra's wife Shachidevi takes birth as Sougandhika and marries Sucharitra.&lt;ref name="indra"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from composing many devotional songs to his deity, the Hindu goddess Chamundeshwari (pen-name "Chamundi"), he authored three noteworthy treatises: ''[[Sritattvanidhi|Sri Tatwanidhi]]'' and ''Swara Chudamani'' (on music) in Sanskrit language and Kannada script,  and ''Sara Sangraha Bharata'' (on dance and music), dealing with [[Tala (music)|tala]] (rhythm) in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="swara"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 55, 58, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliya Lingaraja Urs, a native of [[Heggadadevanakote]] and a son-in-law (''Aliya'') of Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer with over fifty works spanning various genres: devotional songs, musical compositions, ''kavya'' (classical poems), over thirty Yakshagana plays, and other dramas. The author used multiple pen-names including, "lingaraja" and "linganripa". For his contributions to the fine arts, he earned the title ''Ubhaya Kavita Visharada'' (''lit.'' "Master of poetry in two languages" &amp;ndash; Kannada and Sanskrit).&lt;ref name="linga"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 78&amp;ndash;80&lt;/ref&gt; Among his best-known Kannada works are the poem ''Prabhavati Parinaya'' and the two versions of the classical epic ''Girija Kalyana'' ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess"), in Yakshagana style and in ''sangatya'' metre. The writing gives an account of the Girija, the daughter of Himavanta, her youthful days and her successful penance which resulted in her marriage to the Hindu god Shiva.&lt;ref name="hima"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 80; Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prabha"&gt;Narasimhacharya (2003), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Yadava, also a court-poet, penned two prose pieces, ''Kalavati Parinaya'' (1815) in the ''dandaka vritta'' (blank verse) metre and ''Vachana Kadambari'', a prose rendering of the classical Sanskrit original by poet Bana.&lt;ref name="assert"/&gt;

The Jain poet Devachandra (1770&amp;ndash;1841), a native of Kankagiri,  was in the court of Krishnaraja III and authored three noted works: ''Pujyapada Charite'', a poem on the life of the Jain saint [[Pujyapada]] in ''sangatya'' metre; ''Ramakathavatara'', the poet's Jain version of the Hindu epic Ramayana in ''champu'' metre; and ''Rajavalikathe'' (1838), a biographical account of the Mysore royal family, some earlier poets, and stories of religious importance.&lt;ref name="royalaccount"&gt;Mukherjee (1999), pp. 89, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jain writer of merit was Chandrasagaravarni, author of ''Kadambapurana'' and other works.&lt;ref name="prabha"/&gt; Devalapurada Nanjunda of [[Nanjangud]], a mere court attendant, rose to the level of a court poet for his scholarship in Kannada and Sanskrit. Among his many compositions, ''Sougandhika Parinaya'' in ''sangatya'' metre, ''Samudra Mathana Kathe'' (a Yakshagana play), ''Sri Krishna Sarvabhoumara Charitre'' in ''sangatya'' metre, and ''Krishnendra Gite'' in ''choupadi'' metre are well-known. He earned the honorific ''Ubhaya Bhasha Kavi'' ("Poet of two languages").&lt;ref name="kris"&gt;Pranesh (2003), pp. 87&amp;ndash;88&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Kannada prose saw its nascent beginning in 1823 with ''Mudra Manjusha'' ("Seal Casket"). It is an elaboration of a play summarised in the Sanskrit original, ''Mudra Rakshasa'' by Vishakadatta, and was written by Kempu Narayana, a court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 280; Mukherjee (1999), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===External influences===
[[File:Kittel, Ferdinand (1832-1903).jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand Kittel (1854)]]
Eager to spread their gospel in Kannada, Christian missionaries took to the Kannada language. The establishment of the printing press and English language education had a positive effect on Kannada prose. Periodicals and newspapers were published for the first time.&lt;ref name="publish"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The first Kannada language book was printed in 1817 and the first Bible in 1820. Grammar books and dictionaries, meant to help the missionaries in their effort in spreading Christianity, became available. Rev. W. Reeve compiled the earliest English-Kannada dictionary in 1824 followed by a Kannada-English dictionary in 1832, though the best-known work is an 1894 publication by Rev. [[Ferdinand Kittel]]. Rev. William Carrey published the earliest Kannada grammar in 1817.&lt;ref name="rev"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 279&amp;ndash;280; Murthy (1992), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of English literature and poetry on Kannada was evident from the numerous songs of prayer composed by the missionaries.&lt;ref name="song"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; British officers [[Lewis Rice]] and [[John Faithfull Fleet]] deciphered numerous Kannada inscriptions. Rice published several ancient classics and a brief history of Kannada literature while Fleet published folk [[ballad]]s such as ''Sangoli Rayana Dange'' ("Sangoli Raya's Revolt").&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt; The first Kannada newspaper, ''Mangalura Samachara'' ("Mangalore News"), was published in Mangalore in 1843. In a few years, printing presses opened in many locations, including at the Mysore palace in 1840.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;

A surge in the generation of prose narratives and dramatic literature, inspired by writings in English, Sanskrit, modern Marathi and modern Bengali languages culminated in original works in the succeeding decades.&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt; In the field of prose, translation of English classics such as ''Yatrikana Sanchara'' (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' by [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]], 1847) and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1857) set the trend. Translations from vernacular languages were popular too and included the Marathi classic ''Yamuna Prayatana'' (1869) and the Bengali work ''Durgesanandini'' (1885).&lt;ref name="marathi"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 168&amp;ndash;169; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In the genre of drama, inspiration came from translations of Sanskrit and English plays. ''Shakuntala'' and ''Raghavendrarao Nataka'' (''[[Othello]]'') by Churamuri Sehagiri Rao (1869), ''Pramilarjuniya'' by Srikantesa Gowda and ''Vasanthayamini Swapnachamatkara Nataka'' by K. Vasudevachar (''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''), ''[[Macbeth]]'' by Srikantesa Gowda, ''[[King Lear]]'' by M.S. Puttanna, ''Ramavarma-Lilavati'' (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') by C. Ananda Rao paved the way.&lt;ref name="churamuri"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169; Kamath (2001), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Basavappa Shastry (1882), a native of Mysore and court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar IX, earned the honorific ''Kannada Nataka Pitamaha'' (''lit.'' "Father of Kannada stage") for his contributions to drama. His contribution to dramatic literature in the form of anthologies, translations and adaptations from English and Sanskrit, learned editions, and successful integration of musical compositions into drama is well accepted.&lt;ref name="gowri"&gt;Das (1991), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; His translations from English to Kannada include  ''Shurasena Charite'' ("Othello"). His Sanskrit to Kannada translations include, ''[[Kalidasa]]'', ''Abhignyana Shakuntala'', ''Vikramorvasheeya'', ''Malavikagnimitra'', ''Uttara Rama Charite'', ''Chanda Koushika Nataka'', ''Malathi Madhava'' and ''Ratnavali''.&lt;ref name="basava"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077; Pranesh (2003), pp. 82&amp;ndash;83&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known Kannada writers in Chamaraja IX's court were S.G. Narasimhacharya, Dhondo Narasimha Mulabaglu, Santa Kavi and B. Ventakacharya.&lt;ref name="prabha"/&gt;

The earliest modern novels in the Kannada language are the ''Suryakantha'' by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and the ''Indrabayi'' (1899) by Gulvadi Venkata Rao. The later work is reformist and decried corruption and encouraged widow remarriages.&lt;ref name="surya"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 169; Kamath (2001), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Suri Venkataramana Shastri's modern social play ''Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana'' ("Iggappa Heggade's farce of marriage", 1887) and Dhareswar's ''Kanya Vikraya'' (1887) carried a similar reformist outlook while Santa Kavi's ''Vatsalaharana'' (1885) drew upon mythological and folk themes.&lt;ref name="farce"/&gt;

==Developments up to the mid-20th century==
[[File:BugleRock DVG6.JPG|right |thumb |Statue of noted Kannada writer [[D. V. Gundappa]] at Bugle rock garden, Bangalore]]
In 1881, the British handed back administrative powers to the Wodeyar family. Up to 1947, when the kingdom acceded to the [[India|Union of India]], the incumbent Maharaja was assisted by a [[List of Diwans of Mysore|Diwan]] (Prime minister), the administrative chief of Mysore. These were times of positive social and economic change, the independence movement and modern nationalism, all of which influenced literature.&lt;ref name="admin"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 254, 257&amp;ndash;261, 284&amp;ndash;286, 291&amp;ndash;294&lt;/ref&gt;

Kannada literature saw the blossoming of the Navodaya (''lit''. "New beginning") style of writings in genres such as lyrical poems, drama, novels and short stories, with the strong influence of English literature.&lt;ref name="englit"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 170&amp;ndash;173&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. M. Srikantaiah]]'s ''English Geetagalu'' ("English songs", 1921) was the path-breaker in the genre of modern lyrical poetry.&lt;ref name="lyricalpoem"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 170&amp;ndash;171&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest stalwarts in the field of modern historical drama and comedy were [[T. P. Kailasam]] and A.N. Swami Venkatadri Iyer (also called "Samsa"). Kailasam sought to critique social developments by producing plays that questioned the utility of the modern education system in ''Tollu Gatti'' (1918, "The Hollow and the Solid") and the dowry system in ''Tali Kattoke Cooline'' ("Wages for tying the [[Mangalsutra]]"). Samsa's ideal king, Narasaraja Wodeyar, is the protagonist of the play  ''Vigada Vikramarya'' ("The Wicked Vikramarya", 1925).&lt;ref name="wicked"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial development in the genre of historical novels, in the form of translations and original works, sought to re-kindle the nationalistic feelings of [[Kannadigas]]. Venkatachar (''Anandamatha'') and Galaganath were among the first to write such novels. Galaganath's ''Madhava Karuna Vilasa'' (1923) described the founding of the Vijayanagara empire, while his ''Kannadigara Karmakatha'' ("Kannadigas Fateful Tale") described the empire's decline.&lt;ref name="karma"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 171&amp;ndash;172&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Alur Venkata Rao wrote the famous ''Karnataka Ghata Vaibhava'', a summary of earlier works by Fleet, Rice, Bhandarkar and Robert Sewell, appealing to the Kannadigas to remember their glorious past, their ancient traditions and culture, their great rulers, saints and poets.&lt;ref name="alur"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 281; Murthy (1992), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known works were Kerur Vasudevachar's ''Yadu Maharaja'' describing the rise of the Wodeyar dynasty, and Vasudevaiah's ''Arya Kirti'' (1896).&lt;ref name="kathe"/&gt; The tradition of novels started by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899) reached maturity in 1915 with M.S. Puttanna's ''Madidunno Maharaya'' ("Sir, as you sow, so you reap"), a historical novel written in flowing prose and whose theme is set in the times of Maharaja Krishnaraja III. To Puttanna also goes the credit for writing the earliest modern biography, ''Kunigal Ramashastriya Charitre'' ("The story of Kunigal Ramashastri").&lt;ref name="kathe"/&gt; The genre of short story made its initial beginnings with [[Panje Mangesh Rao]], M.N. Kamath and Kerur Vasudevachar, but it was [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]] who stole the limelight with and set a trend for others to follow in his ''Kelavu Sanne Kathegalu'' ("A few short stories", 1920) and ''Sanna Kathegalu'' ("Short stories", 1924).&lt;ref name="kathe"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of these early pioneers were to become a forerunner for the golden age in the decades to follow. A long list of noted poets and writers followed: [[D. R. Bendre]] (''Gari'', "The Wing", 1932) and [[Govinda Pai]] (''Gilivindu'', "Parrots", 1930), perhaps the most acclaimed writers of lyrical poems that synthesised the work of the English romantics with native traditions; [[K. Shivaram Karanth]], the noted novelist and author of ''Chomana Dudi'' ("Choma's Toil", 1933); [[Kuvempu]], one of Kannada's [[doyen]] poets who showed his brilliance in using the [[blank verse]] in his masterpiece epic and [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Sri Ramayana Darshanam'' (1949); [[V. K. Gokak]], a writer of drama, criticism, songs and epic (''Bharata Sindhu Rashmi'', 1940); [[D. V. Gundappa]], the philosopher-writer to whom is ascribed writings in just about every genre, though his most notable work is the ''[[Mankuthimmana Kagga]]'' ("Dull Thimma's Rigmarole", 1943), which closely compares with the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.&lt;ref name="manku"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1057&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="others"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 173, 174, 178, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="style"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nancy Hower grew up in [[Wyckoff, New Jersey]], and is one of nine children. She appeared onstage for the first time as a senior in high school. Upon graduating from high school, Hower continued her studies at the prestigious [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]] where she majored in drama. During her years at Juilliard, she appeared in such productions as ''[[King Lear]]'', ''And A Nightingale Sang'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''The Fifth of July'', and ''The Would-Be Gentleman''. She also later appeared in two stage productions at the [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] Theatre Festival in [[Massachusetts]].

===''Star Trek: Voyager''===
Hower had a recurring role as Ensign [[Samantha Wildman]] on the popular sci-fi series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. She appeared in eight episodes spanning the series' seven-year run. Her character in the series was named after a real life 7-year-old girl who died in an accident. The little girl's parents decided to donate their daughter's organs. The ailing wife of one of ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s writers received one of the girl's kidneys. The writer, [[Jimmy Diggs]], decided to honor the child's memory by naming the ''Voyager'' persona after the little girl. Because the real Samantha Wildman had been fond of animals, Jimmy Diggs thus made Ensign Wildman head of ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s xenobiology department. During the events of the episode "[[Deadlock (Voyager episode)|Deadlock]]" (Season 2), she gives birth to a daughter: [[Naomi Wildman]]. For almost the entire series, Hower's character was the only crew member with a child aboard (until the final episode, "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame II]]", during which Lieutenant [[B'Elanna Torres]] delivers a daughter).

Hower's ''Voyager'' appearances are, in chronological order: "[[Elogium]]" (Season 2), "[[Tattoo (Star Trek: Voyager)|Tattoo]]" (Season 2), "[[Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dreadnought]]" (Season 2), "[[Deadlock (Star Trek: Voyager)|Deadlock]]" (Season 2), "[[Basics (Star Trek: Voyager)|Basics, Pt. 2]]" (Season 3), "[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]" (Season 4), "[[Once Upon a Time (Star Trek: Voyager)|Once Upon A Time]]" (Season 5), and "[[Fury (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fury]]" (Season 6).

Ensign Wildman was also mentioned, but not seen, in several other ''Voyager'' episodes.

===Music===
Hower formerly fronted two alternative rock bands, ''WENCH'' and ''STELLA''. ''STELLA'' was the opening act on [[Meat Loaf]]'s 2001 UK tour. She sang lead, played rhythm guitar, and wrote all of the band's music. Hower almost recorded an album with ''STELLA'', but the band broke up before then.

Hower also co-wrote the original music for the play ''Momma'' in 2001, as well as writing and recording an unreleased rock opera titled ''Girl On Mars''. Also in 2001, she played the role of Yitzak in ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' in Los Angeles.

===2003-present===
Hower wrote and directed the short film ''The Wizard of Id'', an unreleased film about a musician who discovers that he literally has the power to change the lives of the people around him through his music. The film reportedly starred [[Claire Forlani]] and [[Wallace Shawn]]. In 2003, Hower directed the stage play ''City Limits'' at the Keck Theater in [[Los Angeles]].

Hower wrote, directed, produced and edited the [[independent film]] ''[[Memron]]'' (2004), a mockumentary on the [[Enron scandal]] which won many awards and high acclaim from audiences at several film festivals that year. In 2004, she also directed the stage play ''The Lights Change'' at the Keck Theatre.

Following the success of ''Memron'', Hower teamed up with fellow ''Memron'' producers Robert Hickey, [[John Lehr]], and [[Evie Peck]] to create a comedy improv series titled ''[[10 Items or Less (TV series)|10 Items or Less]]''. The [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] show stars John Lehr as a less than successful businessman who takes over the family supermarket when his father dies. ''10 Items or Less'' premiered on TBS on November 27, 2006.

Hower provided vocals for the film ''[[Catch and Release (film)|Catch and Release]]'' (2007), in which she also plays a small role.

In 2013, Hower directed and co-wrote the Hulu original series ''Quickdraw'', which was renewed for a second season in 2014.

The '''''Palästinalied''''' ("Palestine Song", also known as ''Kreuzlied'' "Song of the Cross"&lt;ref&gt;Both titles are modern conventions.  ''Palästinalied'' was introduced in the debate on the interpretation of the melody discovered in 1912. 
R. Wustmann, "Walthers Palästinalied", ''Sammelbände der internationalen musikgesellschaft'' 13, 247–250.
''Kreuzlied'' is a more generic term for religious songs in troubadour or minnesang literature; there are two ''Kreuzlieder'' attributed to Walther, edited under this name by Pfeiffer (1864).
The "Palästinalied", being Walther's second and more famous ''Kreuzlied'', is often referred to as ''Walthers Kreuzlied'' by the late 19th century. 
W. Mettin, "Zu Walthers Kreuzlied", ''Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur'' (PBB) 18 (1893), 209&amp;ndash;214.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a song written in the early 13th century by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], the most celebrated [[lyric poet]] of [[Middle High German literature]]. It is one of the few songs by Walther for which a melody has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Konzett|first1=Matthias|article=Walther von der Vogelweide|title=Encyclopedia of German Literature|date=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=London, England|isbn=1-57958-138-2|page=977|edition=first|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uE4CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA977&amp;lpg=PA977&amp;dq=Which+songs+by+Walther+von+der+Vogelweide+have+melodies+survived+for?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6di-cXAD27&amp;sig=NFFlvOJVBoqnBT0s_PgTN9llYcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_x7-gupjVAhWT14MKHW1vBQ8Q6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Which%20songs%20by%20Walther%20von%20der%20Vogelweide%20have%20melodies%20survived%20for%3F&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Palästinalied'' was written at the time of the [[Fifth Crusade]] (1217-1221).&lt;ref&gt;Walther's presence in Vienna is recorded for 1217, and again for 1219, after the return of Duke [[Leopold VI of Austria|Leopold VI]] from the crusade. It is not known whether Walther himself participated in Leopold's crusade.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its oldest attestation is in the ''[[Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift]]'' (ms. A, ca. 1270), in seven stanzas. 
The oldest source for the melody is the so-called Münster fragment (ms. Z, 14th century).&lt;ref name=msZ&gt;
Münster, Landesarchiv Nordrhein-Westfalen / Staatsarchiv, Msc. VII, 51, dated to c. 1330 (related to ''[[Jenaer Liederhandschrift]]'').
Discovered in 1910 as binding of an economic ledger of 1522.
[https://archive.thulb.uni-jena.de/hisbest/receive/HisBest_cbu_00008634 thulb.uni-jena.de], [http://www.mr1314.de/2416 mr1314.de].
Raphael Molitor, "Die Lieder des Münsterischen Fragmentes", ''Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft'' 12.3 (April/June 1911), 475&amp;ndash;500.
Franz Jostes, "Bruchstück einer Münsterschen Minnesängerhandschrift mit Noten", ''ZfdA'' 53 (1912), [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=PPN345204123_0053%7Clog40 348&amp;ndash;357].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of the song is the [[The gospel|Christian gospel]] told from the perspective of a pilgrim setting foot in the [[Holy Land]]. 
The song's conclusion refers to the crusades themselves, asserting that, in view of the claim of Christians, [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel|Jews]] and [[Islamic conquest of the Levant|"heathens" (Muslims)]] to the Holy Land, the Christian claim is the just one (''Al diu werlt diu strîtet her / Wir sîn an der rehten ger / Reht ist, daz er uns gewer'' "All the world is warring here [in the Holy Land] / Our claim is the just one / It is right that He [God] grant it").

==Text==
The ''[[Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift]]'' (ms. A) is the oldest source of the text (dated to the 1270s), giving seven stanzas. ''[[Codex Manesse]]''  (ms. C, fol 126rv, dated c. 1304)  has nine stanzas.
Other manuscripts contribute an additional four, for a total of thirteen distinct stanzas. 
Of these, one (recorded as 4th stanza in ms. Z) is clearly younger than the original composition. On the remaining five stanzas not in ms. A, there is no expert consensus as to whether they should be regarded as Walter's. 

The nine stanzas in C are numbered C21&amp;ndash;C29, the seven stanzas in A are A50&amp;ndash;A56.
Three stanzas are identical between A and C (C22=A51, C23=A52, C29=A56) and another have only minor differences, such as transposed word order (C21=A50, C25&amp;ndash;27 = A53&amp;ndash;55). The fourth and eighth stanzas in C (C24, C28) are not recorded in A.

1. 
Life's true worth at last beginneth,
Now my sinful eyes behold
The holy land, the earth that winneth
Fame for glories manifold.
I have won my lifelong prayer:
I am in the country where
God in human shape did fare. 
 
2. 
Lands, the greatest, goodliest, fairest,
Many such mine eyes have seen;
O'er them all the crown thou bearest.
Think what wonders here have been!
From a Maid a babe did spring,
O'er the angel hosts a king;
Was not that a wondrous thing?

For the very first I am alive to myself, 
since my sinful eye beholds
the noble land, and also that earth,
to which so much honour is given.
It has come to pass, for which I have ever prayed:
I have come to the place
where God walked [[Incarnation (Christianity)|in human form]].

2. 
Such fair lands, rich and noble, 
as I have seen elsewhere,
you are the honour of them all,
what miracles have come to pass here!
That [[Virgin birth of Jesus|a maid gave birth]] to a child,
lord over the hosts of all angels, 
was this not a perfect miracle?

3. 
Here He was baptized with water,
That men might be pure as He.
Here He let them sell Him later,
That we thralls might so be free.
We had else been lost, I wis.
Spear, Cross, thorn, your praise it is!
Heathens, woe! ye rage at this. 









5. 
Down to hell the Son descended
From the grave wherein he lay.
Him the Father still attended
And the Ghost, whom no man may
E’er disjoin; the three are one:
Shaft so smooth and straight there’s none,
As to Abraham it was shown. 


6. 
When He quelled the fiend and ended
Such a fight as king ne’er fought,
Here to earth He reascended.
Sorrow to the Jews it brought;
Through their guard He broke amain;
Whom their hands had pierced and slain. 











7. 
Here a day of dreadful summons
He appointed for this land.
Orphan’s wrongs and widowed woman’s
Shall be righted by His hand.
Then the poor man may declare
All the violence he must bear.
Penance here brings blessing there! 


















9. 
That this land they do inherit
Christians, Jews, and heathens claim.
God adjudge it where the merit
Lieth, in His threefold name!
All the world strives here, we see;
Yet we hold the rightful plea:
God will grant it rightfully.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem lang="en" &gt; 
3. 
Here he, [[Perfection of Christ|being pure]], let himself [[baptism of Jesus|be baptized]],
so that man [[Baptismal regeneration|may be pure]].
There he let himself [[Thirty pieces of silver|be sold]], 
so that we thralls may be free,
otherwise we would be lost.
Hail to you, [[Arma Christi|spear, cross and thorn]]!
Woe to you, heathens, this is an outrage to you!

[4. 
As he wanted to take pity on us, 
here he [[crucifixion of Jesus|suffered grim death]],
he, most rich, on us, most poor, 
that we may [[Salvation in Christianity|escape from woe]],
that he was not vexed by this, 
this is a miracle all too great, 
beyond all other miracles.]

5.
Thence the Son [[Harrowing of Hell|rode to hell]],
from the [[Holy Sepulchre|grave]] wherein he lay.
For he was ever joined to the Father, 
and to the Spirit, which no-one may
divide: [[Trinity|They are all One]],
straighter and smoother than an arrow-shaft, 
as [[Abraham#Three_visitors|He appeared to Abraham]].


6.   
Having humiliated the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] there,
such that no emperor has ever fought better,
he travelled [[resurrection of Christ|back to this land]].
Then began the Jews' sorrow:
that he, the Lord, broke from their custody
and that he was later seen alive,
whom [[Jewish deicide|their hand]] had beaten and pierced. 

[6a. After this, he remained in the land
for forty days, [[Ascension of Jesus|then he departed]]
hence, where his Father sent him.
His Spirit, which may save us,
he [[Pentecost|sent back presently]].
Holy is this same land:
Its name is recognized before God.]&lt;ref name=doubtful/&gt;

7.
In this land he has announced
a [[Last Judgement|terrible day]]  
when the widow will be avenged,
and the orphan may file complaint,
and also the poor man, about the violence
that he has suffered.
Hail to him there, who has requited here!

[8. [Not] as our [[Landgericht (medieval)|land-judges]] are wont,
no-one's complaint will be delayed,
as he will pass judgement within the hour,
so will it be on the Last Day.
Whosoever here leaves any debt  
unrequited, how will he stand
there, where he will have neither pledge nor bailsman.]

[8a. Let it not vex you
that I have spoken more.
I will explain my rede
briefly, and let you know,
what wonders God has still
in mind with mankind,
it began here and will [also] end here.]

9. 
Christians, Jews and heathens
all say that this is their patrimony.
God must decide this justly, 
by his three names.
All the world is [[crusades|warring]] here,
we are pursuing a just claim, 
so it is just that He grants it.

[More than a hundred thousand miracles
are here in this land,
about which I cannot

to the Jews, they will tell him more.]

==Melody==
The earliest source for the melody is  the Münster fragment (ms. Z), written about a century after Walther's death.&lt;ref name=msZ/&gt;
The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' ms. (c. 1230) contains the first stanza of ''Palästinalied''  (CB 211a)  with [[neume]]s, which are however insufficient for reconstructing a melody. The stanza is given as an appendix to  ''Alte clamat Epicurus'' (CB 211), which was to be sung in the same melody.

==Modern reception==
With the increased popularity of [[Medieval folk rock|Medieval rock]], [[Neofolk]] and related musical styles in the late 1980s and 1990s, the ''Palästinalied'' became a sort of staple song for such genres and is now well known to modern audiences due to performances by mainly German bands, including (among others):
*[[Ougenweide]] (album All die Weil Ich Mag, 1974)
*[[Corvus Corax (band)|Corvus Corax]] (album ''Congregatio'', 1991)
*[[Radio Tarifa]] (album ''Rumba Argelina'', 1993)
*[[Qntal]] (album ''Qntal II'', 1995)
*[[Estampie (band)|Estampie]] (album ''[[Crusaders]]'', 1996)
*[[In Extremo]] (album ''[[Weckt die Toten!]]'', 1998)
*Djembe (album ''Хиты Средневековья'', 1999)
*[[Mediaeval Baebes]] (album ''[[Undrentide]]'', 2000)
*Finisterra (album ''Kein Evoë - Kein Requiem'', 2002)
*[[Unto Ashes]] (EP ''I Cover You With Blood'', 2003)
*[[Heimataerde]] (instrumental),  album ''Gotteskrieger'' (2005)
*[[Eisenfunk]] (Dance/electronic),  album ''Schmerzfrequenz'' (2005)
*[[Omnia (band)|Omnia]] (in "Teutates," album ''PaganFolk'', 2006) 
*[[Luc Arbogast]] (album ''Hortus Dei'', 2006)
*[[In Extremo]] (album ''[[Quid Pro Quo]]'', 2016)

''Palästinalied-Projekt'' is a compilation of 20 performances of the song (2002; {{discogs release|3301470}}).

The Austrian Ensemble for Early Music [[:de:Dulamans Vröudenton|Dulamans Vröudenton]] recorded a [[Medieval music|reconstructionist]] performance of "Palästinalied".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altemusik.net/klangproben/mp3_seiten/ma2/mp3palaestin.htm Listen/Anhören altemusik.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lou Harrison]]'s String Quartet Set's 1st movement takes much of its melody from this song.

'''Pentagram''' is a design firm. It was founded in 1972, by [[Alan Fletcher  (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], [[Theo Crosby]], [[Colin Forbes (graphic designer)|Colin Forbes]], [[Kenneth Grange]], and Mervyn Kurlansky at Needham Road, [[Notting Hill]], London. The company has offices located at [[London]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Berlin]] and [[Austin, Texas]].

==History==
Pentagram was founded on the premise of collaborative interdisciplinary designers working together in an independently owned firm of equals.  [[Theo Crosby]] claimed the structure was suggested to him by his experience of working on the seminal late-1950s exhibition ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'': "it was my first experience at a loose, horizontal organisation of equals. We have brought it ... to a kind of practical and efficient reality at Pentagram".&lt;ref&gt;Theo Crosby, "The Painter as Designer", ''Edward Wright graphic work and painting'', Arts Council, 1985, pp.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The firm currently comprises 19 partner-designers in five cities, each managing a team of designers and sharing in common overhead and staff resources.  The partners in each office share incomes equally and all the partners own an equal portion of the total firm. This equality, along with the tradition of periodically inviting new members to join, renews the firm while giving even the newest members an equal footing with the partners of long standing. This 'flat' organisation (there are no executive officers, CEO, CFO or board, other than the entire group) along with the self-capitalised finances of the business, allows equal participation and control of the group's destiny by the member.  In 1978 Colin Forbes formed the New York office, eventually adding both graphic designers Peter Harrison and [[Woody Pirtle]] as partners.  In 1990-91 [[Michael Bierut]], [[Paula Scher]], graphic designers, and [[James Biber]], an architect, joined the New York office and eventually moved to a building at 204 Fifth Avenue, a building designed by [[C. P. H. Gilbert]], where the office resided until 2017. Now in the New York office there are eight partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662252/exclusive-pentagrams-new-partner-is-eddie-opara "Pentagram's Newest Partner is Eddie Opara"] on CoDesign. Accessed: 2010-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, all the founding partners, along with David Hillman and John McConnell have departed, leaving a second and third generation of partners working in the Needham Road office. John Rushworth, [[Daniel Weil]] (an industrial designer), [[Angus Hyland]], [[Justus Oehler]] (running the Berlin branch), Harry Pearce, Domenic Lippa, Naresh Ramchandani, Marina Willer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2012/february/marina-willer-joins-pentagram Marina Willer joins Pentagram]&lt;/ref&gt; Jody Hudson-Powell, Luke Powell and Sascha Lobe, along with industrial designer Jon Marshall now comprise the London office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/list | title=List of current Pentagram partners|website=www.pentagram.com|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable alumni of Pentagram include [[Kit Hinrichs]].

==Scope and clientele==
Pentagram does work in [[graphic design]], [[corporate identity|identity]], [[architecture]], [[interiors]] and products. They have designed packaging and products for many well known companies. They have also developed identities for [[Sam Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banks|first1=Tom|title=Pentagram brand for SAM "never stands still"|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/pentagram-brand-for-sam-never-stands-still/|website=Design Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citibank]],&lt;ref name="dailyshow"&gt;Vanderbilt, Tom. [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2005/id20050829_294059.htm "The Daily Show: Satire Restyled."] ''[[BusinessWeek]].'' Accessed on September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Airlines]], and [[The Co-operative brand]] in the UK, winning a silver award from the Design Business Association.&lt;ref name="DBA"&gt;{{Cite web| last=Design Business Association | title=The Co-operative Brand Identity| url=http://www.dba.org.uk/casestudies07/branding/case6.asp |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2007, they updated the visual identity of [[Saks Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name="saks"&gt;Rawsthorn, Alice. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/11/features/design12.php "The new corporate logo: Dynamic and changeable are all the rage."] ''[[International Herald Tribune]].'' Accessed on May 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to graphic design work, the firm has partners working on architectural projects such as the [[Harley-Davidson Museum]], the [[Alexander McQueen]] shops, ''Citibank'' interiors, the ''Adshel'' and [[Clear Channel]] buildings in London, a host of private residences including the Phaidon Atlas of Architecture listed Bacon Street Residence, the new London club [[Matter]], along with a host of interior, retail, restaurant and exhibition projects.

Pentagram was hired to redesign the American cable television programme, ''[[The Daily Show]]'''s set and on-screen graphics in 2005.&lt;ref name="dailyshow" /&gt;

Outside of commercial work, Pentagram also does [[pro bono]] work for [[non-profit organisations]]. On 12 February 2008 the [[President's Council on Service and Civic Participation]] awarded Pentagram the "DNA" award for incorporating [[pro bono]] services into [[business culture]]. Recently, Pentagram has done work for the [[One Laptop per Child]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Sandy.[http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/newsroom/announcements_dynamic.asp?ID=1771 "Six Organizations Honored for Outstanding Pro Bono Service."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215205401/http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/newsroom/announcements_dynamic.asp?ID=1771 |date=2008-02-15 }} ''[[USA Freedom Corps]].'' Accessed on February 26.2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentagram supports up-and-coming artists. Angus Hyland was a notable early supporter of illustrator [[Christine Berrie]], and organised a display of her work at the Pentagram main office.&lt;ref name="designweek"&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of the ordinary|last=Stones|first=John|date=January 20, 2005|work=Design Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2010, the [[Big Ten Conference]] unveiled their new logo designed by Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pentagram.com/en/new/2010/12/new-work-big-ten-conference-1.php New Work: Big Ten Conference Logo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216111040/http://pentagram.com/en/new/2010/12/new-work-big-ten-conference-1.php |date=2010-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Pentagram were comissioned to design the packaging for the [[Pink Floyd]] box set, ''[[The Early Years 1965–1972]]''. The set was released in November 2016.

'''Rag-i-Bibi''' (''Veins of the Lady'') refers to a [[Sassanian]] [[rock relief]] on a cliff in modern [[Afghanistan]]. It first became known to western scholarship in 2002. It is located about a kilometre south of [[Shamarq]] and 10 km south of [[Puli Khumri]]. Rag-i-Bibi is the local name of the relief, which refers to [[Fatimah]] the daughter of [[Muhammad]], who is venerated by the [[Shiites]].

The relief is 4.9 m high and 6.5 m wide. It has been largely destroyed, partially by weathering and partially by [[Taliban]] iconoclasm. At the end of Taliban rule, local villagers reported the relief to local authorities, since they feared it would be damaged. Thus, individual Taliban were conscious of the relief and damaged it on the grounds that local residents "worshipped" it.

The relief shows a Sassanian king hunting an [[Indian rhinoceros]]. The king reins in a galloping horse. His figure would be about 2.4 m high if it were standing upright. Three figures stand around the king. Behind the ruler's horse, another two can be made out, which are poorly preserved. The upper portion of the relief shows a band of poorly preserved architectural features.

The king's head is particularly severely damaged. The crown might enable an identification with a historical king; some stylistic details suggest that [[Shapur I]] is depicted. Stylistically, the relief contains Sassanian features, but also local [[Gandhara art|Gandhara]] ones.

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|upright|Black boy with [[slavery|slave collar]], Dutch 17th-century painting.]]

'''Representations of slavery in European art''' date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.

In Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The ''black'' in European art is not the same topic as the ''slave'' in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Also note the ambiguity of the term "Turkish slave": a Turkish slave may be a Turk or someone enslaved by a Turk. See [[Turkish Slave]] for yet another layer of confusion about a picture by [[Parmigianino]].&lt;/ref&gt; The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.

== Slaves in art ==
[[File:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'', by Velázquez]]
[[File:Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806).JPG|thumbnail|upright|Thomas Alexandre Dumas]]

From the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of [[Roman Triumph]], but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, [[galley slaves]] were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.

Sometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is  [[Juan de Pareja]] (1606–1670) who was a slave of [[Velázquez]] and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives.&lt;ref&gt;See Carmen Fracchia's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document which was discovered by [[Jennifer Montagu]] is in the Archivio di Stato in Rome. See ''Burlington Magazine'', volume 125,1983,pages 683-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] of ''The Three Musketeers'' fame, was the son of a slave, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|also known as Alexandre]], who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo'' (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Post]] (1612—1680) and [[Albert Eckhout]] (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in  idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life.&lt;ref&gt;See Ernest van den Boogaart article in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Michel Massing in Studies in ''Imagery II: the World Discovered''. London 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Rebecca Parker Brienen, ''Albert Eckhout'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic aspects of slavery==


The trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the [[Triangular Trade]] involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver [[slavery|slave collar]] being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem| editor1= McGrath, Elizabeth  | editor2= Massing, Jean Michel |location= London |publisher=The Warburg Institute|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for ''dis''-enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2014}} 

Slaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Elizabeth McGrath and Rick Scorza in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often slaves were  prisoners captured in war and  there is an iconographical overlap between the two.  Michelangelo's [[Dying Slave]] was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Echinger-Maurach, ''Studien zu Michelangelos Juliusgrabmal'', 2 vols, Hildesheim,  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' I.1.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Abolitionism ==

[[File:Wedgwood - Anti-Slavery Medallion - Walters 482597.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anti-Slavery Medallion by Josiah Wedgwood]]

With [[Abolitionism]], the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] which shows a  pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.

An example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by [[George Cruikshank]], ''New Union Club''. It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.

'''''Ruposhi Bangla''''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ''রূপসী বাংলা'', Beautiful Bengal) is the most popular collection of poems by [[Jibanananda Das]], the great modern Bengali poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alokitobangladesh.com/online/details/14964|title=জীবনানন্দ দাশের কবিতার সংখ্যা কত?|last=|first=|date=|website=আলোকিত বাংলাদেশ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hajar Bacharer Bangali Sangskriti|last=Murshid|first=Ghulam|publisher=Abasar|year=2016|isbn=984 415 190 2|location=Dhaka|pages=316|language=bn|script-title=হাজার বছরের বাঙালি সংস্কৃতি|trans-title=Bengali Culture across the Millennia|chapter=Bangla Bhasha o Sahitya|script-chapter=bn:বাংলা ভাষা ও সাহিত্য|trans-chapter=Bengali Language and Literature|author-link=Ghulam Murshid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1934, the sixty-two sonnets - discovered in an exercise-book twenty years after Das wrote them - achieved instant popularity on their posthumous publication in 1957, becoming a totemic symbol of freedom in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence.

{{Quote|text=Go where you will – I shall remain on Bengal’s shore&lt;br&gt;
Shall see jackfruit leaves dropping in the dawn’s breeze;&lt;br&gt;
Shall see the brown wings of shalik chill in the evening,&lt;br&gt;
Its yellow leg under the white down goes on dancing&lt;br&gt;
In the grass, darkness – once, twice – and then suddenly&lt;br&gt;
The forest’s oak beckons it to its heart’s side,&lt;br&gt;
Shall see sad feminine hands – white conch-bangles&lt;br&gt;
Crying like conch shells in the ash-grey wind:&lt;br&gt;
She stands on the pond’s side in the evening,&lt;br&gt;

As if she will take the parched rice hued duck&lt;br&gt;
To some land of legends –&lt;br&gt;
As if the fragrance of the quiltcover clings to her body,&lt;br&gt;
As if she is born out of watercress in the pond’s nest –&lt;br&gt;
Washes her feet silently – then goes faraway, traceless&lt;br&gt;
In the fog – yet I know I shall not lose her&lt;br&gt;
In the crowd of the earth –&lt;br&gt;
She is there on my Bengal’s shore.|sign=Jibanananda Das|source=''Ruposhi Bangla''}}

The '' '''stibadium''' '' (plural: ''stibadia'') is a later form of the Roman ''lectus triclinaris'', the reclining seat used by diners in the [[triclinium]]. Originally, the ''lecti'' were arranged in a group of three in a semi-circle. The ''stibadium'' was a single semi-circular couch, fitting up to a dozen people, which replaced the triple group of ''lecti'' in the dining-room, frequently in alcoves around the centre of the room. 

The ''stibadium'' was originally an outdoor seat but was introduced indoors in the 2nd-3rd centuries B.C. because the shape was more convenient for entertaining and as ''triclinia'' became larger and more elaborate.

Films about [[ancient Roman]] ''[[Symposium|convivia]]'' often feature a ''stibadium'' rather than a ''lectus''.

'''''The Crowning of the Virtuous Hero''''' is a painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], painted between 1613 and 1614. Unsigned, it was commissioned by the St George Guild of Archers in [[Antwerp]] for their banqueting hall and is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister within the [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in [[Kassel]].

==Description==
It shows an ancient Roman general being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with laurels of victory and treading underfoot a bound barbarian and a personification of Discord (shown with snakes for hair). To his right is a [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of Harmony, who presents him with a bound bundle of arrows (symbolising peace). The figure on the right is also intended as the guardian of religion, due to the eternal fire shown on the altar beside the figure. Behind the altar is a red and white tricolour, referring to the ruling [[house of Habsburg]] and thus affirming the guild's loyalty to that house.

==History==
[[William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] acquired the painting between 1730 and 1760 to add to his collection of Dutch paintings at the Schloss Bellevue in Kassel's Oberneustadt or upper new town. The [[Peace of Tilsit]] in 1807 made Kassel the capital of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], under [[Jerome Bonaparte]] - later that year Jerome's brother [[Napoleon I]] acquired the painting and assigned it to the imperial coronation hall in Paris. In 1813 general Czerniczew forced Jerome Bonaparte to flee and negotiations began for the return of this and other paintings confiscated by Napoleon. [[Jacob Grimm]] (then a legation secretary) played an instrumental part in gaining the return of the Rubens, which occurred in December 1815.

Between 1878 and 1943, the painting was in the Neue Galerie at the Schloss Bellevue. In 1943 the painting was moved to a store elsewhere - Kassel was a target for Allied bombing and the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe was severely damaged. In 1956 the painting was moved to emergency headquarters of the Landesmuseum until in April 1974 it returned to Kassel, initially in the Corps de Logis at the Schloss  Wilhelmshöhe.

'''''The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore''''' is a 2011 animated short film directed by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]], and produced by [[Moonbot Studios]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higa |first=Michelle |title=The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore |url=http://www.shortoftheweek.com/2012/01/24/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore |publisher=Short of the Week |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as an "allegory about the curative powers of story," the film centers on [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using [[computer animation]], [[Scale model|miniatures]] and traditional hand-drawn techniques.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles&gt;{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|title=Oscar shorts: 'Morris Lessmore' has hybrid animation, iPad app|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/01/oscars-short-films-fantastic-flying-books-morris-lessmore-animation.html|accessdate=March 17, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. An official [[iPad]] app based on the film was also released in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]]. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore" Nominated for Best Animated Short in 2011 Oscars |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore-nominated-for-best-animated-short-in-2011-oscars-2012-01-24 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Morris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.

After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of [[Humpty Dumpty]], who urges Morris to follow him.

The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.

Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf.{{#tag:ref|The large book on which Morris sleeps is the same title; its inclusion may reference the studio's name "Moonbot". The library also includes Moon globes and in one scene the Moon is featured prominently in a window.|group="Note"}} He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.

Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Porkpie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buster Keaton]] wearing a [[pork pie hat]]]]
The book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at [[HarperCollins]] and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles /&gt;

Morris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' and the tornado from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Also an inspiration was the real-life [[Hurricane Katrina]] which devastated New Orleans in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Like ''The Wizard of Oz'', the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm.

==Reception==
[[File:William Joyce Oscar Parade Shreveport Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|Writer and co-director [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] holding the Academy Award won by the film in 2012]]
The film has received 14 awards, including the Audience Award at the [[Austin Film Festival]], "Best Animated Short" at the [[Cinequest Film Festival]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].

Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] congratulated Shreveport-based animation studio Moonbot Studios for winning an Oscar at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood.

The [[United States]] '''Truth in Video Game Rating Act (S.3935)''' is a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced by then Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) on September 26, 2006. The act would require the [[ESRB]] to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030 | work=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=September 27, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010442/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030 | archive-date=2007-03-11 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill makes no considerations for [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]], [[Mod (computer_gaming)#Total_conversion|total conversion]]s, [[user generated content]], [[procedurally generated content]], unused disc space, blocked/disabled out portions of code, player behavior in online games, and various other factors out of the control of the developers (such as how the player decides to play the game).

This bill was unacted upon during its original session and was reintroduced by Senator Brownback on February 14, 2007 under the same title "the Truth in Video Game Rating Act" with a new session number (S.568). The bill remained in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and expired at the end of the 110th Congress without further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.568 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Truth in Video Game Rating Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/568/committees|accessdate=1 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801084307/https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/568/committees|archive-date=2017-08-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26752">{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
The '''Washington Redskins trademark dispute''' was a legal effort by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who consider the term "[[redskin (slang)|redskin]]" to be an offensive and disparaging racial slur to prevent the owners of the [[Washington Redskins]] football team from being able to maintain federal [[trademark]] protection for this name. These efforts have primarily been carried forward in two cases brought before the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). While prevailing in the most recent case in which the trademarks were cancelled, petitioners have withdrawn for further litigation now that the legal issue has become moot due to a decision in another case which found the relevant portion of the trademark law to be an unconstitutional infringement on [[freedom of speech]].

==''Harjo'' case==
The first action in the dispute occurred in 1992, when [[Suzan Shown Harjo]], President of the Morning Star Institute, with six other prominent Native Americans represented by the [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] law firm of Minneapolis, petitioned the USPTO to cancel the trademark registrations owned by the Redskins' corporate entity of Pro-Football, Inc.  They based their lawsuit on the claim that federal trademark law states that certain trademark registrations are not legal if they are "disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous, or disreputable." The legal battle went on for seven years. In 1999 the PTO judges canceled the federal registration of the mark REDSKINS "on the grounds that the subject marks may disparage Native Americans and may bring them into contempt or disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davin L Seamon|title=Trademark Sensitivity: Learning from the Washington Redskins|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=8 July 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-sensitivity-learning-washington-redskins|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Steptoe &amp; Johnson PLLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners appealed the decision to a district court in the District of Columbia in ''[[Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo]]''. The court reversed the USPTO's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals have been rejected on the basis of ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]],'' which means that the specific Native American plaintiffs had pursued their rights in an untimely and delayed manner. In 2009 the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Washington Redskins can keep team name; Supreme Court refuses native Americans' suit| accessdate = November 15, 2015| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2009/1116/p02s07-usju.html| author=Warren Richey| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related trademark actions==
Since 1992, the USPTO has rejected eleven applications for other trademarks that included the word redskins, based on the same reason of disparagement.

===Appeal of Blackhorse decision===
The Washington Redskins filed its appeal in the Blackhorse case on August 14, 2014, stating their belief "that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) ignored both federal case law and the weight of the evidence". They also cite infringement of their First Amendment right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/08/14/washington-redskins-appeal-federal-trademark-registrations/14066527/|title=Washington Redskins appeal decision to cancel trademark|author1=Erik Brady|author2=Megan Finnerty|publisher=USA TODAY Sports|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2014 the Native Americans asked that the team's appeal be dismissed because it names them as individuals, which is contrary to federal law, and because the appeal was filed with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA, stating that the Redskins should have filed its case against the patent office in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/native-americans-seek-dismissal-of-redskins-lawsuit-in-trademark-case/2014/09/22/fc9fc362-418e-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Native Americans seek dismissal of Redskins lawsuit against them in trademark case|author=Ian Shapira|date=September 22, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oct, 2014 Judge Gerald B.

The brief also stated that the court should also reject the claim that the cancellation of trademarks constitutes an illegal taking of valuable property which is barred by the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.richmond.com/pdf_463aa741-050a-51c4-bf3d-2a0a6914a2d5.html| title= Brief supporting cancellation of Redskins trademarks| date=March 24, 2015| newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; By opening up an inquiry into constitutional issues regarding limits on disparaging speech in order to protect "the unique cultural heritage" of the American Indian population, the case may go well beyond what a football team calls itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/01/constitution-check-is-the-first-amendment-on-the-side-of-a-pro-football-teams-name/| title=Constitution Check: Is the First Amendment on the side of a pro football team’s name?| date=January 13, 2015| author=Lyle Denniston| publisher=National Constitution Center| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Navajo Nation]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in support of the decision to cancel the trademarks, due to Pro-Football, Inc. stating in its appeal that individual members of the Navajo Nation such as former chairman Peter McDonald do not find the name disparaging. The brief states that these individuals speak only for themselves, while the tribe’s elected, appointed and traditional leaders speak for the Navajo people and present “unified opposition” to the team name because it is disparaging and has a negative psychological effect on tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abqjournal.com/728673/news/navajo-attorneys-file-brief-against-redskins-trademark.html| title=Navajo attorneys file brief against Redskins trademark| author=Noel Lyn Smith| date=February 23, 2016| work=Albuquerque Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2015, Judge Lee affirmed the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/ProFootball%20Blackhorse%20opinion.pdf| title=Memorandum Opinion and Order, Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse, et al. | accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Lee denied the team's summary judgment motions challenging the constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants' summary judgment motions, finding that "the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that...the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that 'may disparage' a substantial composite of Native Americans." The decision does not bar the team from using the marks going forward, and the order itself is subject to further appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13220885/federal-judge-upholds-washington-redskins-trademark-ruling| title=Judge upholds ruling against Redskins trademark; team can appeal| date=July 8, 2015| author=Associated Press| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team president Bruce Allen expressed surprise at the decision, and that a summary judgement was made by the judge based upon the evidence submitted rather than proceeding to a trial. While the team continues to have certain rights to its trademarks, it must take action to protect those rights individually. The cancellation of federal registration of the trademarks means that the government will no longer take any action against anyone else using the name or logo, such as blocking counterfeit goods from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/07/08/bruce-allen-surprised-by-ruling-to-uphold-redskins-trademark-cancellation/| title=Bruce Allen ‘Surprised’ by Ruling to Uphold ‘Redskins’ Trademark Cancellation| author=Chris Lingebach| date=July 8, 2015| publisher=CBS DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases prompted a range of opinions from law professors.
*Megan M. Carpenter, a professor and co-director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at the [[Texas A&amp;M University School of Law]]: Trademark law should not be used to make moral decisions, which change over time, and notes that the law has been applied unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-law-promotes-fair-competition-not-morality| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Megan M. Carpenter| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Christine Haight Farley, a professor at [[American University Washington College of Law]]: A distinction should be made between trademarks and government registration. Protection of free speech may allow any trademark to be used, but registration places a seal of approval which should not be given to racist trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-restrictions-permit-free-speech-without-approving-offensive-speech| title=Trademark Restrictions Permit Free Speech Without Approving Offensive Speech| author=Christine Haight Farley| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Sonia Katyal, professor of law and faculty co-director of the [[UC Berkeley School of Law#Centers at Berkeley Law|Berkeley Center for Law and Technology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]: A distinction should be made between a racially sensitive trademark being used ironically by the targets of racism in order to reclaim it, and one used offensively. In addition, denying registration is not limiting speech, since the trademark may be used without government protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-officials-must-distinguish-between-irony-and-offense| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Sonia Katyal| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court review==
Both the USPTO and Pro-Football, Inc. requested a review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) of the same legal issue, the constitutionality of banning a disparaging trademark. The USPTO appealed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which found in December 2015 that part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. That case ([[Matal v. Tam]]) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, "The Slants". The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the Lanham Act, NAPABA President Cyndie Chang stating “Racial slurs should not be recognized as commercial speech through federally-protected trademarks. “Freedom of speech does not require that the government allow racially derogatory terms to be trademarked so that a trademark owner can have exclusive rights to use and monetize such terms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://aapress.com/editorial/napaba-disagrees-with-band-in-trademark-case/| title=NAPABA disagrees with band in trademark case| date=January 21, 2017| publisher=Asian American Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2017 the court ruled unanimously in favor of Tam, the majority opinion stating "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15-1293 Martal V. Tam|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Redskins win trademark fight over the team’s name|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2017/06/29/a26f52f0-5cf6-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|accessdate=30 June 2017| author1=Ian Shapira| author2=Ann E.
