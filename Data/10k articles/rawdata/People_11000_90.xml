      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4994">'''‘Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr''' ({{Lang-ar|عبدالله ابن أبي بكر}}) (c.610–633) was a son of [[Abu Bakr]] the first [[Caliph]], a brother of [[Aisha]] and a [[sahaba|companion]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].

==Childhood==
He was born in [[Mecca]], the son of Abu Bakr ibn Abi Quhafa, from the [[Banu Taym|Taym]] clan of the [[Quraysh]] tribe, and of [[Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza]], who was from the Amir ibn Luayy clan.&lt;ref name="Saad3"&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'' vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). ''The Companions of Badr''. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–29}}&lt;ref name="Tabari11"&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Blankinship, K. Y. (1993). ''Volume 11: The Challenge to the Empires''. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|140–141}}&lt;ref name="Tabari39"&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998). ''Volume 39: The Biographies of the Prophet's Companions and Their Successors''. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}} His parents were divorced soon before or soon after his birth.&lt;ref name="Saad8"&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina''. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}}

When Muhammad and Abu Bakr [[Hegira|fled]] from Mecca in September 622, Abu Bakr instructed Abdallah to listen to adult conversations and to report the day's news to them at the cave on Mount Thawr each night. Abdullah duly reported that the Quraysh had offered a hundred camels to anyone who captured Muhammad. Each morning, when he left the cave, the family [[Amir ibn Fuhayra|servant]] would lead a flock of sheep over the same route to cover his tracks.&lt;ref name="Ishaq"&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq. ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}&lt;ref name="Saad3"/&gt;{{rp|131}}

==Emigration to Medina==
A few months later, Abdullah emigrated to [[Medina]] in the company of his [[Umm Ruman|stepmother]] and two sisters.&lt;ref name="Tabari7"&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by McDonald, M. V. (1987). ''Volume 7: The Foundation of the Community''. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="Tabari39"/&gt;{{rp|172}}

In 630 Abdullah fought at the [[Siege of Ta'if]], where the Thaqafite poet, Abu Mihjan, shot him with an arrow. This wound ultimately caused his death, although he survived for nearly three years afterwards.&lt;ref name="Ishaq"/&gt;{{rp|591}}&lt;ref name="Tabari10"&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Donner, F. M. (1993). ''Volume 10: The Conquest of Arabia'', p. 39. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
He married [[Atiqa bint Zayd]], a poet from the [[Banu Adi|Adi]] clan of the Quraysh.  This marriage was childless.&lt;ref name="Saad8"/&gt;{{rp|186}} It was said that Abdullah respected Atiqa's judgment more than his own and that he spent so much time with her that he neglected his duties to the Islamic state. Abu Bakr punished his son by ordering him to divorce her. Abdullah did as he was told but was grief-stricken. He wrote poetry for Atiqa:&lt;ref name="Hajar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;''I have never known a man like me divorce a woman like her,''
''nor any woman like her divorced for no fault of her own.''&lt;ref name="Hajar"&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani. ''Al-Isaba fi tamyiz al-Sahaba'' vol. 8 #11448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
In the end, Abdullah was allowed to take Atiqa back before her [[iddah|waiting period]] was completed.&lt;ref name="Hajar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;Abbott, N. (1942). ''Aishah - the Beloved of Mohammed''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

==Death==
Abdullah died in January 633, when his old wound from Ta'if flared up.&lt;ref name="Tabari10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suyuti"&gt;Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti. ''History of the Caliphs''.

Translated by Smith, G. R. (1994). ''Volume 14: The Conquest of Iran''. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}}  His wife composed an elegy for him.

'''Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg''' (18 August 1856 – 2 January 1927), primarily known by his [[Hebrew name]] and pen name '''Ahad Ha'am''' ({{lang-he-n|אחד העם}}, lit. 'one of the people', Genesis 26:10), was a [[Hebrew]] essayist, and one of the foremost pre-state [[Zionism|Zionist]] thinkers. He is known as the founder of [[cultural Zionism]]. With his secular vision of a Jewish "spiritual center" in Israel, he confronted [[Theodor Herzl]]. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ha'am strived for "a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ahad |last=Ha'am |title=The Jewish State and Jewish Problem |translator=Leon Simon, 1912 |year=1897 |work=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/haam2.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg (Ahad Ha'am) was born in [[Skvyra]], in the [[Kiev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) to pious well-to-do [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] parents. At eight years old, he began to teach himself to read Russian. His father, Isaiah, sent him to [[heder]] until he was 12. When Isaiah became the administrator of a large estate in a village in the Kiev district, he moved the family there and took private tutors for his son, who excelled at his studies. Ginsberg was critical of the dogmatic nature of Orthodox Judaism but remained loyal to his cultural heritage, especially the ethical ideals of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', vol. 1, Ahad Ha'am, New York, 1971, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, following a trip to Palestine, Ginsberg moved to London to manage the office of the [[Wissotzky Tea]] company. He settled in [[Tel Aviv]] in early 1922, where he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the city council until 1926. Plagued by ill health, Ginsberg died there in 1927.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;

==Zionist activism==
In his early thirties, Ginzberg returned to [[Odessa]] where he was influenced by [[Leon Pinsker]], a leader of the [[Hovevei Zion]] (''Lovers of [[Zion]]'') movement whose goal was settlement of [[Jew]]s in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Unlike Pinsker, Ginsberg did not believe in political Zionism, which he fought, 'with a vehemence and austerity which embittered that whole period'.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Spiegel, ''Hebrew Reborn'',(1939) Meridian Books, Cleveland, New York 1962 p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he hailed the spiritual value of the Hebrew renaissance to counter the debilitating fragmentation (''hitpardut'') in the diaspora, he believed that the ingathering of Jews in Palestine was not an answer. ''Kibbutz galuyoth'' was a messianic ideal rather than a feasible contemporary project. The real answer lay in achieving a spiritual centre, or 'central domicile', within Palestine, that of [[Eretz Israel]], which would form an exemplary model for the dispersed world of Jewry in exile to imitate; a spiritual focus for the circumferential world of the Jewish diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Spiegel, ''Hebrew Reborn'', ibid. pp.286–289&lt;/ref&gt; He split from the Zionist movement after the [[First Zionist Congress]], because he felt that [[Theodor Herzl]]'s program was impractical.&lt;ref&gt;S J Zipperstein, "Ahad Ha'am and the Politics of Assimilation, p.350&lt;/ref&gt; From 1889 to 1906, Ginzberg flourished as a preeminent intellectual in Zionist politics.

==Journalism career==
In 1896, Ahad Ha'am founded the Hebrew monthly. Ha-Shiloaḥ, the leading Hebrew-language literary journal in the early twentieth century. It was published in Warsaw by Ahiasaf. It was  a vehicle to promote Jewish nationalism  and  a platform for discussion of past and present issues relevant to Judaism. The name was taken from a river mentioned in Isaiah 8:6, “The waters of Shiloaḥ flow slowly,” alluding to the moderate stance of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Shiloah_Ha- Ha-Shiloah ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits to Palestine==
[[File:Achadd Haam and Schats 1911.jpg|thumb|Ahad Ha'am with [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Art School]] founder [[Boris Schatz]] against backdrop of "The Wandering Jew" by [[Samuel Hirszenberg]]]]
Ahad Ha'am travelled frequently to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and published reports about the progress of Jewish settlement there. They were generally glum. They reported on hunger, on Arab dissatisfaction and unrest, on unemployment, and on people leaving Palestine. In an essay&lt;ref&gt;'Truth from Eretz Yisrael',&lt;/ref&gt; soon after his 1891 journey to the area he warned against the 'great error', noticeable among Jewish settlers, of treating the ''fellahin'' with contempt, of regarding 'all Arabs a(s) savages of the desert, a people similar to a donkey'.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Shapira, ''Land and power: The Zionist resort to force, 1881–1948,'' Oxford University Press, 1992 p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;variant translation in [[Tom Segev]], ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate'',Metropolitan Books, 2000 p.104
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahad Ha'am made his first trip to Palestine in 1891. The trip was prompted by concern that the Jaffa members of B'nai Moshe were mishandling land purchases for prospective immigrants and contributing to soaring land prices.  His reputation as Zionism's major internal critic has its roots in the essay "A Truth from Eretz Yisrael" published in pamphlet form shortly after his visit in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Kol Kitve Ahad Ha'am, The Jerusalem Publishing House, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Ahad Ha'am wrote about his perceptions of Palestine:
"We who live abroad are accustomed to believe that almost all Eretz Yisrael is now uninhabited desert and whoever wishes can buy land there as he pleases.  But this is not true.  It is very difficult to find in the land [ha'aretz] cultivated fields that are not used for planting.  Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, it is very difficult to find good land for cattle.  And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad are accustomed to believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them.  But this is a grave mistake.  The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd.  All the townships of Syria and Eretz Yisrael are full of Arab merchants who know how to exploit the masses and keep track of everyone with whom they deal – the same as in Europe.  The Arabs, especially the urban elite, see and understand what we are doing and what we wish to do on the land, but they keep quiet and pretend not to notice anything.  For now, they do not consider our actions as presenting a future danger to them. … But, if the time comes that our people's life in Eretz Yisrael will develop to a point where we are taking their place, either slightly or significantly, the natives are not going to just step aside so easily.&lt;ref&gt;''Wrestling with Zion'', Grove Press, 2003 PB, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "Wrestling with Zion," he urged the Jews "not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong...we should be cautious in our dealings with a foreign people among whom we returned to live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment.  And what do our brothers do?  Exactly the opposite!  They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [the Ottoman Empire] can offer.  This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves ['''eved ki yimlokh'' – when a slave becomes king – Proverbs 30:22].  They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions.  There is no one to stop the flood and put an end to this despicable and dangerous tendency.  Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage.  But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts. And these people will be revengeful like no other.&lt;ref name="Zion, Grove Press p. 15"&gt;''Wrestling with Zion'', Grove Press, 2003 PB, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahad Ha'am believed that Zionism must bring Jews to Palestine gradually, while turning it into a cultural centre. At the same time, it was incumbent upon Zionism to inspire a revival of Jewish national life in the [[Diaspora]]. Only then would the Jewish people be strong enough to assume the mantle of building a nation state. He did not believe that the impoverished settlers of his day would ever build a Jewish homeland. He saw the Hovevei Zion movement of which he was a member as a failure because the new villages were dependent on the largess of outside benefactors.

==Importance of Hebrew and Jewish culture==
Ahad Ha'am's ideas were popular at a very difficult time for Zionism, beginning after the failures of the first Aliya. His unique contribution was to emphasise the importance of reviving Hebrew and Jewish culture both in Palestine and throughout the Diaspora, something that was recognised only belatedly, when it became part of the Zionist program after 1898. Herzl did not have much use for Hebrew, and many wanted German to be the language of the Jewish state. Ahad Ha'am played an important role in the revival of the Hebrew language and Jewish culture, and in cementing a link between the proposed Jewish state and Hebrew culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/echad_haam_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Zionism==
His first article criticising practical Zionism, called "Lo zu haderekh" (''This is not the way'') published in 1888 appeared in [[Ha-Melitz|''HaMelitz.'']]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/at_the_crossroads_0902_librivox אחד העם Ha'am, Ahad (Asher Zvi Ginzberg), על פרשת דרכים ''At the Crossroads'' (Selected Essays) (February 19, 2009)] LibriVox recording of at the Crossroads (Selected Essays), by Ahad Ha'am.  Read by Omri Lernau (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he wrote that the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them.  Ahad Ha'am also argued that establishing a "national home" in Zion will not solve the "Jewish problem"; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus [[Hovevei Zion|Hibbat Zion]] must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that they will want to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties.  The ideas in this article became the platform for ''[[Benei Moshe ]]'' (sons of Moses), a group he founded that year. Benei Moshe, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/benei-moshe-jewish-virtual-library Benei Moshe, [[Jewish Virtual Library]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps more significant was ''Derekh Kehayim'' (1889), Ha'am's attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating all the elements of a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.

He eclipsed nationalists like [[Peretz Smolenskin]] arguing assimilative individualism in the west further alienated Russified Jewry, who were seeking to reduce migration: isolating it beggared Eastern European Jewry.  Even those in ''Hovevei'' seeking to restrict emigration would, he feared, bring the extinguishment of national consciousness; and atomisation of Jewish identity.  Only anti-Semitism had made Jews of us.&lt;ref&gt;Herzl to Nordau; Zipperstein, p.344&lt;/ref&gt; ''Derekh'' argued that nations had waxed and waned throughout history, but nationalism had all but vanished from Jewish consciousness.  Only a small group of nobles kept it going.

Throughout the 1890s Ahad Ha'am worked to keep the flame of nationalism alive.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, The People Apart, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis fell on moral concepts, honour of the flag, self-improvement, national revitalisation.  He modernised the language of the Hasidic Court being held in reverence by Benei Moshe, who regarded his work with awe and respect.  A departure occurred in ''Avdut betokh herut''&lt;ref&gt;(Slavery in Freedom) published in 1891&lt;/ref&gt; discussing pessimism about the future for independent Jewishness.  Critic [[Simon Dubnov]] alluded to this but was compromised by his westernised idealizing of French Jewry.  For the movement, the preoccupation with assimilation at Odessa was fatal for Ha'am's progressive Zionism.  The requirement arose in 1891 for a "spiritual centre" in Palestine; Benei Moshe's implacable opposition to his support for Vladimir (Zeev] Tiomkin's ideal community at Jaffa compounded the controversy in ''Emet me'eretz Yisrael'' (''The Truth from the Land of Israel.'')

In 1896, Ginsberg became editor of ''Hashiloah,'' a Hebrew monthly, a position he held for six years. After stepping down as editor in 1903, he went back to the business world with the [[Wissotzky Tea]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's who in Jewish History|publisher=David McKay|isbn=0-415-26030-2|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, following the Basel Zionist Congress calling for a Jewish national home "recognized in international law" (''Volkerrechtlich''), Ahad Ha'am wrote an article called ''Jewish State Jewish Problem'' ridiculing the idea of a ''Volkerrechtlich'' state given the pitiful plight of the Jewish settlements in Palestine at the time. He emphasised that without a Jewish nationalist revival abroad, it would be impossible to mobilise genuine support for a Jewish national home.  Even if the national home were created and recognised in international law, it would be weak and unsustainable. In 1898, the Zionist Congress adopted the idea of disseminating Jewish culture in the Diaspora as a tool for furthering the goals of the Zionist movement and bringing about a revival of the Jewish people.  Benei Moshe founded [[Rehovot]], hoping it would become a model of self-sufficiency, and opened ''Achiasaf'', a Hebrew publishing company.

==Political influence==
[[File:Ahad Ha’am’s proposal to the Paris Peace Conference.jpg|thumb|left|Ahad Ha’am's proposal to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]
Ahad Ha'am's influence in the political realm can be ascribed to his charismatic personality and spiritual authority rather than his official functions. For the "Democratic Faction", the party that propagated cultural Zionism (founded in 1901 by [[Chaim Weizmann]]), he served  "as a symbol for the movement's culturalists, the faction's most coherent totem. He was, however, not – certainly not to the extent to which members of this group, especially Chaim Weizmann, would later contend – its chief ideological influence."&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zipperstein, Elusive Prophet: Ahad Ha'am and the Origins of Zionism, London: Peter Halban 1993, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahad Ha'am was a talented negotiator. In this role he was engaged during the "language controversy" that accompanied the founding of the Haifa Technikum (today: the [[Technion]]) and in the negotiations culminating in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipperstein, Elusive Prophet, 269, 296–301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and commemoration==
Many cities in Israel have streets named after Ahad Ha'am. In [[Petah Tikva]] there is a high school named after him, [[Ahad Ha'am High School]]. There is also a room named after him at the Beit Ariela Library,  Ahad Ha'am Room.

Colonel '''Alexis Kanyarengwe''' (1938–2006) was a [[Rwanda]]n officer who fled Rwanda in 1980 amidst accusations that he was plotting against [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]. Despite being a [[Hutu]], Kanyarengwe joined the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), becoming its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Des Forges|first1=Alison|authorlink=Alison Des Forges|title=Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda – History → Consolidating the Opposition |date=March 1999|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|location=New York|isbn=1-56432-171-1|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the real power broker was "vice-chairman" [[Paul Kagame]].&lt;ref name=Reyntjens&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reyntjens|first1=Filip|title=Political Governance in Post-Genocide Rwanda|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-67879-8|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=dX4LAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 18], [https://books.google.no/books?id=dX4LAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1997, Kanyarengwe was sacked from his post as Interior minister after protesting [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] massacres in his home prefecture of [[Ruhengeri Province|Ruhengeri]]. [[Ignace Karuhije]], who also protested, was removed on the same day. On 15 February 1998, Kanyarengwe was finally replaced by Paul Kagame as chairman of the RPF.&lt;ref name=Reyntjens/&gt;

'''Alina Rinatovna Ibragimova''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} ({{lang-ru|link=no|Али́на Рина́товна Ибраги́мова}}; born 28 September 1985) is a [[Russians in the United Kingdom|Russian-British]] violinist.

==Early life and education==
Ibragimova was born in [[Polevskoy]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SSR]], to a [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] family.  Her family was musical, and she began playing the violin at the age of 4.  At 5 she started at the [[Gnessin State Musical College]] in Moscow, studying under [[Valentina Korolkova]], and by the age of 6 had started her career by playing with various orchestras, including the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra]]. She was aged 10 in 1996 when her father, Rinat Ibragimov, took up the post of principal double bass with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and the family moved to England.  In the following year, Ibragimova began her studies at the [[Yehudi Menuhin School]] (where her mother is professor of violin) under [[Natasha Boyarskaya]].

In December 1998, Ibragimova performed with [[Nicola Benedetti]] at the opening ceremony of the 50th Anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] at [[UNESCO]] in Paris; they played [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Double Violin Concerto (Bach)|double violin concerto]] under the baton of [[Yehudi Menuhin]]. Menuhin died three months later, and Ibragimova performed the slow movement of the same concerto at his funeral in [[Westminster Abbey]].

After finishing her studies at the Yehudi Menuhin School, Ibragimova went on to the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] for a year, and then to the [[Royal College of Music]], studying under [[Gordan Nikolitch]]. Ibragimova has also studied with Christian Tetzlaff since 2000, most recently under the auspices of the [[Kronberg Academy]] Masters programme.

Together with other students from the Royal College, she formed the [[Historically informed performance|period-instrument]] [[string quartet]] [[Chiaroscuro (string quartet)|Chiaroscuro]], specialising in music from the classical period.

==Career==
After winning several international competitions, in 2002 Ibragimova won the [[London Symphony Orchestra Music Scholarship]] (formerly the Shell Prize), which was an important boost to her solo career.  The next breakthrough came in 2005 when Ibragimova played and directed [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Mozart)|second violin concerto]] with the [[Kremerata Baltica]] in [[Mozartwoche]] at the [[Universität Mozarteum Salzburg|Salzburg Mozarteum]].

Ibragimova was a member of the [[BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme]] 2005-7. She has performed concertos with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen]], the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]], [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], [[Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt]], and the [[Seattle Symphony]], working with conductors including [[Sir Charles Mackerras]], [[Valery Gergiev]], [[Sir John Eliot Gardiner]], [[Paavo Järvi]], [[Richard Hickox]] and [[Osmo Vänskä]]. In 2012 Ibragimova directed a period-instrument orchestra, The [[Academy of Ancient Music]], for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aam.co.uk/#/who-we-are/reviews/reviews-of-aam-concerts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

For recitals and chamber music, Ibragimova has appeared at venues including [[Wigmore Hall]] in London, [[Concertgebouw]] in Amsterdam, [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg]], [[Musikverein]] in Vienna, [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York, the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels. She has appeared at festivals including Salzburg, Verbier, MDR Musiksommer, Lockenhaus, Manchester International, and Aldeburgh. With her regular recital partner, Ibragimova performed the complete Beethoven violin sonatas at the [[Wigmore Hall]] London in 2009/10 (the recordings of which were released on the Wigmore Hall Live label). In 2015 she performed the six Bach Solo Sonatas and Partitas in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Promenade Concerts. 

Her first CD for [[Hyperion Records]] was the complete violin works of [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]] in 2007, which was followed by the two violin concertos of [[Nikolai Roslavets]] in 2008, a disc of the complete violin and piano works by [[Karol Szymanowski]], and the [[JS Bach]] Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin in 2009.

==Honours==

Ibragimova has been the recipient of a number of awards including the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] Young Artist Award 2010, and [[Emily Anderson Prize]] (the youngest-ever winner), Borletti-Buitoni Trust, and a Classical BRIT. She performs on a c.1775 [[Anselmo Bellosio]] provided by [[Georg von Opel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alinaibragimova.com/biography.php&lt;/ref&gt;

She was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2016 New Year Honours]] for services to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61450|supp=y|page=N20|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Since 2015 Ibragimova has been married to writer and classical music critic [[Tom Service]], whom she met when he interviewed her for ''[[The Guardian]]''. They live in [[Greenwich]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duchen|first1=Jessica|title=EDITOR’S TEA: ALINA IBRAGIMOVA|url=http://www.amati.com/magazine/153-interviews/editors-tea-alina-ibragimova/|website=The Amati Magazine|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renato "Ato" Agustin''' (born August 1, 1963) is a Filipino former professional basketball player and current coach. He played college basketball for the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] before moving on to play professional basketball in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]].&lt;ref name=Inquirer /&gt;

Agustin was the [[Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] awardee of the PBA in 1992.&lt;ref name=Inquirer&gt;[http://sports.inquirer.net/amateur/amateur/view/20100329-261375/Ato-Agustin-From-top-guard-to-hotshot-coach Ato Agustin: From top guard to hotshot coach - Inquirer.net, Philippine news for Filipinos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401055513/http://sports.inquirer.net/amateur/amateur/view/20100329-261375/Ato-Agustin-From-top-guard-to-hotshot-coach |date=April 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played for the [[San Miguel Beermen]], [[Pop Cola Panthers|Sunkist/Pop Cola]], the [[Sta. Lucia Realtors]], and finally, [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000–11)|Batang Red Bull]].  Agustin was named a member of the [[PBA's 25th Anniversary All-Time Team|PBA's 25 Greatest Players]] in 2000.  He also had a brief stint in with the Pampanga Dragons in the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]].

A shooting guard since his amateur days with RFM-Swift Corporation of the Philippine Basketball League, Agustin saw limited minutes during his rookie season with the grandslam-winning San Miguel Beermen in 1989, playing backup to his more illustrious teammates [[Samboy Lim]] and Elmer Reyes.  However, beginning the 1990 season, he became a regular part of the Beermen's backcourt rotation with the departure of Reyes to expansion team Pop-Cola (RFM) and constant injuries to Lim and [[Hector Calma]].  Coach Norman Black would sometimes play Agustin at point guard until he became an adept combo guard.

He is the former head coach of the [[San Sebastian Stags|San Sebastian Golden Stags]] men's basketball team in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]], having taken over from [[Jorge Gallent]] in 2009, and winning a championship in the same year. In 2010, he became head coach of his former PBA team, the [[San Miguel Beermen]]. During the [[2011 PBA Governors' Cup]], Agustin steered the team (then known as the Petron Blaze Boosters) to the [[2011 PBA Governors' Cup Finals|championship]], defeating the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]] in seven games. He became the 9th coach in PBA history to win a title in his first year as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/the-winning-ways-of-ato-agustin "The winning ways of Ato Agustin" August 22, 2011, InterAKTV]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitrios Dimitriou''' sometimes spelled '''Dimitrija Demeter''' or '''Dimitrije Demeter'''; 21 July 1811 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1872) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Croatia]]n poet, [[dramatist]], short story writer and [[literary critic]].&lt;ref name="nsk-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.nsk.hr/grk-u-ilirskom-kolu-rodjendan-dimitrija-demetra/ | title = Grk u ilirskom kolu – rođendan Dimitrija Demetra | date = 2011-07-22 | publisher = [[National and University Library in Zagreb]] | language = Croatian | accessdate = 2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most learned people of his time,&lt;ref name="Živančević-Sekeruš-1992"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Croatian Writers in the Byronic Mould | author = Ivana Živančević-Sekeruš | journal = The Modern Language Review |date=January 1992 | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 143&amp;ndash;156 | accessdate = | doi=10.2307/3732332}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played a major role in the movement for the national awakening of the Croatian nation (then under Austro-Hungarian rule) as part of what he and his close friend and colleague [[Ljudevit Gaj]] called the Illyrian people by imposing the [[Croatian language]] in the local literacy and with the creation of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]]. His political activism for a [[Croatian national revival]] dealt through his participation in many patriotic pamphlets, most notably the [[Narodne novine]] and [[Hrvatski Sokol]] among many others.

==Biography==

He was born in a wealthy merchant family of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin.&lt;ref name="Živančević-Sekeruš-1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puchner-2004"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Forms and functions of the historical tragedy and the patriotic drama in South Eastern Europe in the era of national awakening | author = Walter Puchner | publisher = Akadémiai Kiadó, co-published with Kluwer Academic Publishers B.V. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.akademiai.com/content/v43042k015573335/ | accessdate = 2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Religious Roots of Linguistic Nationalism Y. Kakridis - The Historical Review/La Revue Historique, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His parents Theodoros (''{{lang|el|Θεόδωρος}}'') and Afrati (''{{lang|el|Αφράτη}}'') came to Austria-Hungary at 1790 from the city of [[Siatista]], then under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Siatistian Memories, Λεύκωμα Συλλόγου Σιατιστέων Θεσσαλονίκης, Salonika 1972 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; He studied philosophy in [[Graz]] and medicine in [[Vienna]] and [[Padua]]. During his studies he practiced his literary work and after his return to Croatia he joined the [[Illyrian movement]]. At first he worked as a physician and from 1841 his main preoccupation was [[literary work]].

Demeter began his literary career writing Greek poetry from a very early age.&lt;ref name="Živančević-Sekeruš-1992"/&gt; He wrote his first drama "''Βιργινία''" (Virginia) at the age of 16 (also in the Greek language). In his most known drama ''Teuta'', which functioned as the first national drama of the Croats,&lt;ref name="Puchner-2004"/&gt; he advocates the idea about [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] origin of all [[South Slavs]]. He also wrote short stories, [[feuilleton]]s, [[literary critics]], [[librettos]] for [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] opera's ''Ljubav i zloba'' and ''[[Porin (opera)|Porin]]'' and for his dramas ''Dramatička pokušenja I.'' (1834) and ''Dramatička pokušenja II.'' (1844). In his texts he tried to join the tradition of the old Croatian literature with tendentions in European drama. He mostly used historical subjects to express his patriotic aspirations and to speak out about the current social situation in society. His role in organizing the cultural life in [[Zagreb]] and Croatia was of extreme significance. He was also editor or various [[almanacs]] of patriotic orientation: ''Iskra'', ''Südslavische Zeitung'', ''Danica'', ''Narodne novine'' and ''Hrvatski Sokol''.

One of his most known works is his early [[Romanticism|Romantic poem]] ''Grobnik field'' (near [[Rijeka]]) written in 1842 for the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Grobnik field]] where according to legend [[Croats]] defeated the invading [[Tatars]]. This works shows it was written by an extremely talented writer, although it was only his literary debut. In it two main [[motif (narrative)|motives]] interweave: the motive of [[countryside]] and the motive of [[patriotism]]. Also inspired by [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] the concept of ''worldwide pain'' appears. Demeter used 10-syllable verse and 12-syllable verse to avoid monotonous routine of traditional folk songs while emphasizing characterization and strong characters of the main heroes and their passion. Instead of narrative epic tendency he gives to his poems a strong dramatic characteristics which reminds us [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron's]] literary work.

Demeter's main spiritual vision emphasizes on the general problems of [[human race|humanity]] styling on the battle between good and evil where at the end the good always prevails. This type of Demeter's poems in many of his works, both by verse and rhyme, announces the most important literary work in Croatian literature of the time: the epic poem ''[[The Death of Smail-aga Čengić]]'' written by [[Ivan Mažuranić]] in 1845. Among Demeter's poems a special place also takes his ''Pjesma Hrvata'' (''Song of the Croats'') which is an 8-syllable verse most known by its starting verse "Prosto zrakom ptica leti".

Dimitrija Demeter was also one of the founders of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] (Hrvatsko Narodno Kazalište - HNK). When the [[Croatian Parliament]] founded the permanent theatre, Demeter was appointed as both its manager and its [[dramatist]]. 35 years after his death, in 1907, ''Demeter's award for drama'' was established which stood until nowadays.
 
Demeter died in Zagreb on 24 June 1872 and since he was a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek-Othodox]] he was originally buried at the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] cemetery in [[Pantovčak]] neighborhood. Upon the closure of most old cemeteries in Zagreb in the 1870s and the designation of [[Mirogoj Cemetery]] as the primary municipal cemetery, his remains were moved to Mirogoj several years later, where they are still kept today.&lt;ref name="mirogoj"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gradskagroblja.hr/default.aspx?id=274 | title = Zatvaranje starih zagrebačkih groblja |trans-title=The closing of old Zagreb cemeteries | work = Povijest - Početak gradnje arkada | publisher = Zagreb Holding - [[Mirogoj Cemetery]] | language = Croatian | accessdate = 2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bust decorates the yard of Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.

{{Donald Trump series}}
With the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]], the [[President of the United States]] appoints the members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which is the highest court of the [[federal judiciary of the United States]]. Following his victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] took office as president on January 20, 2017, and faced an immediate vacancy on the Supreme Court due to the February 2016 death of Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had released two lists of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. After taking office, he [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Neil Gorsuch]] to succeed Scalia, and Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017. In November 2017, five more names were added to the previous lists of potential nominees. In June 2018, Associate Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] announced his retirement, creating a second vacancy on the Supreme Court. In early July 2018, Trump [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Brett Kavanaugh]] as his replacement, Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6, 2018.

Both the Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmations were enabled by a rule change made by the Senate Republican majority in April 2017, which applied the so-called [[nuclear option]] to Supreme Court nominees and allowed nominations to be advanced by a simple majority vote rather than the historical norm of a three-fifths [[supermajority]] vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html|title=Senate Republicans Deploy ‘Nuclear Option’ to Clear Path for Gorsuch|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court composition==
{{see also|List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States}}
President Trump began his term in January 2017 with a vacancy to be filled as a result of the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. As three of the Court's justices at the time—[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] (born 1933), [[Anthony Kennedy]] (born 1936) and [[Stephen Breyer]] (born 1938)—were aged 78 or older, speculation arose that additional vacancies could occur during Trump's four-year presidential term.&lt;ref name="truger1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruger|first1=Todd|title=Clinton, Trump Talk Around Senate in Supreme Court Debate|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/clinton-trump-talk-around-senate-supreme-court-debate|accessdate=October 21, 2016|publisher=Roll Call|date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Ginsburg and Breyer were part of the liberal wing of the Court and Kennedy was a swing vote who often aligned with them on social issues, many top political analysts saw Trump's term as a chance for Republicans to reshape the court significantly towards a more conservative vision of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/314237-trump-could-alter-supreme-court-for-decades-to-come|title=Trump could alter Supreme Court for decades to come|last=Kabot|first=Joel|date=January 13, 2017|work=TheHill|access-date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/trump-supreme-court.html|title=What the Trump Presidency Means for the Supreme Court|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=November 9, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 9, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 2018, this became a real possibility when Justice Kennedy officially announced his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/anthony-kennedy-retires/index.html|title=Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire from Supreme Court|first=Ariane|last=de Vogue|publisher=CNN|date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitch McConnell]], the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], stated [[United States presidential election, 2016|the new President]] should replace Scalia, while President [[Obama]] stated that he planned to nominate someone to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=whgov_20160213&gt;"[https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/president-obama-delivers-statement-passing-supreme-court-justice-scalia President Obama Delivers a Statement on the Passing of Supreme Court Justice Scalia]", Rancho Mirage, CA (February 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, the eleven Republican members of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] signed a letter to [[Mitch McConnell|McConnell]] stating their intention to withhold consent on any nominee made by President Obama, and that no hearings would occur until after January 20, 2017, when the new president took office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2719115/Senate-SCOTUS-Letter.pdf Letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] (February 23, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GrassleyResponse&gt;{{cite web | title = Grassley on Supreme Court Nomination: ‘We have a constitutional responsibility | url = http://whotv.com/2016/03/01/grassley-attends-white-house-meeting-for-supreme-court-nomination/ | publisher = [[WHO-DT|WHO tv]] interview | location = Des Moines, Iowa | date = March 1, 2016 | accessdate = March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2016, Obama [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] then-Chief Judge [[Merrick Garland]] (of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]), to replace Scalia.&lt;ref name="mshear"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|title=Obama Chooses Merrick Garland for Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee.html|accessdate=March 16, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Garland's nomination, [[Mitch McConnell|McConnell]] reiterated his position that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nomination until a new president took office.&lt;ref name="mshear"/&gt; Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with [[114th United States Congress|the 114th Senate]] having taken no action on the nomination.&lt;ref name="ahowegarland"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Amy|title=Garland nomination officially expires|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/garland-nomination-officially-expires/|accessdate=January 30, 2017|publisher=Scotusblog|date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his 2016 presidential campaign]], while Garland remained [[advice and consent|before the Senate]], Trump released two lists of potential nominees.

Two days later, Kavanaugh was confirmed by a 50–48 vote, and sworn in that same day.

==Possible nominees==
Below is a list of individuals which President Trump has identified as his potential nominees for Supreme Court appointments. Most of them were revealed in two lists released by the Trump campaign in 2016. Others were added to a revised list released by the White House on November 17, 2017.&lt;ref name="White House-11-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/11/17/president-donald-j-trumps-supreme-court-list|title=President Donald J. Trump’s Supreme Court List|website=whitehouse.gov|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the nomination of [[Amul Thapar]] to the Sixth Circuit, it was noted that Trump might try to season some of the candidates on his list with federal appellate court experience prior to potential nomination to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=politico-4-6 /&gt; Indeed, Trump later elevated a number of state court judges from his list to fill vacant positions on the federal Courts of Appeals: [[Joan Larsen]] (Sixth Circuit), [[David Stras]] (Eighth Circuit), [[Allison Eid]] (Tenth Circuit), [[Don Willett]] (Fifth Circuit), and [[Britt Grant]] (Eleventh Circuit). Conversely, two previous Trump appointees to the Courts of Appeals—[[Amy Coney Barrett]] (Seventh Circuit) and [[Kevin Newsom]] (Eleventh Circuit)—were later added to the list of potential Supreme Court candidates.

Despite speculation that Trump might consider other candidates for a possible second Supreme Court nomination, he said in May 2017 that he would make his next appointment from the same list he used to choose Gorsuch (the combined 21 names given on either of the two lists he released during the campaign), describing the list as "a big thing" for him and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-01/trump-next-supreme-court-nominee-will-come-from-conservative-list|last=Williams|first=Joseph P.|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=May 3, 2017|title=Trump: Next Supreme Court Nominee Will Come From Conservative List|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump added five further candidates to the list on November 17, 2017.

{{small|''Note: Names marked with a single asterisk (*) were included on the original short list of eleven potential candidates for the Scalia vacancy released by the Trump campaign on May 18, 2016.

'''Edie Williams''' (née '''Britt''', previously '''McLain''' and '''Rothwell''') is a [[fictional character]] created by [[television producer]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Marc Cherry]] for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. [[Nicollette Sheridan]] portrayed Edie from her debut in the [[Pilot (Desperate Housewives)|pilot episode]] of the series until the character's death in the [[Desperate Housewives (season 5)|fifth season]].

Within the series, Edie was one of several residents of the fictitious [[Wisteria Lane]]; she lived at 4362 [[Wisteria Lane]] in Fairview, Eagle State.&lt;ref&gt;"[[I Know Things Now]]". ''Desperate Housewives'' episode 2.21, ABC. Written by [[Kevin Etten]] and [[Bruce Zimmerman]].&lt;/ref&gt; Edie was a [[real estate agent]]. She was married three times; to Charles McLain (with whom she had a son, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Travers McLain|Travers]]), Umberto Rothwell, and [[Dave Williams (Desperate Housewives)|Dave Williams]]. Throughout her time on the series, she also had numerous relationships with the ex-husbands or former lovers of other characters.

Edie Britt was one of the series' most notable characters. Sheridan's portrayal of the character was widely acclaimed, leading Edie to be a fan favourite. In 2005, Sheridan was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actress]].

The character Edie Britt was a series regular for the first 5 seasons, despite originally being conceived as a recurring character. Actress Nicollette Sheridan, who originally auditioned for [[Bree Van de Kamp]], one of the series' more prominent roles,&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; was cast in the role in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3634415/Desperately-seeking-a-ratings-hit.html Desperately Seeking a Ratings Hit]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. January 5, 2005. Retrieved December 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, Sheridan was announced to have joined the main cast for the series' first season, the thirteenth regular cast member to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=6710 "Houswives", "Legal" Bows Bumped to October 3].

''[[USA Today]]''. May 5, 2005. Retrieved December 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan's role remained somewhat minimal in the series' first two seasons. Series creator Marc Cherry insisted that Edie served "only as a spoiler to complicate the other women's lives."&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Although Sheridan thought of Edie as the fifth main housewife—in addition to [[Susan Mayer]], [[Bree Van De Kamp]], [[Lynette Scavo]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]]—the opening credits only pictured the other four women. Additionally, Cherry shared that his goal was to have the central four women remain in the series.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

However, [[Marcia Cross]]' maternity leave caused Bree to be absent in several episodes of the [[Desperate Housewives (season 3)|third season]]. Edie's character was elevated in prominence, providing the fourth concurrent storyline for the episodes. During this time, the character's "layers are peeled away and the character is developed on a deeper level than has been previously explored."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatedisney.com/desperatehousewives-season3.html "Desperate Housewives": The Complete Third Season: The Dirty Laundry Edition DVD Review].

==History==

===Season 1===
Edie led a troubled childhood, since her mother, Ilene Britt, was an alcoholic who served time in jail because of related shoplifting charges. A court, therefore appointed Edie a social worker by the name of Mrs. Muntz, who was sort of like a nanny for her. Mrs. Muntz was a very strict disciplinarian, and showed Edie no mercy. This made Edie actually happy to see her mother once she made parole. As a teenager, Edie would spent her time with the "freaks" hanging out by the loading docks, where she would smoke with them. 
Edie was introduced as a serial divorcée, with two marriages behind her at the beginning of the show. [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Martha Huber|Martha Huber]] ([[Christine Estabrook]]) tells Susan that she will be babysitting Edie's son, although he does not appear until season 3. Edie and [[Susan Mayer]] are attracted to new neighbor [[Mike Delfino]] ([[James Denton]]), creating tension between them which culminates in Susan accidentally burning Edie's house down. Edie is upset when Martha is murdered, and proves to be the only Wisteria Lane resident who wants to give her a proper burial. Susan admits to Edie that she burned her house down and Edie uses Susan's guilt to join the housewives' poker group. Edie continues to hit on Mike but he's more interested in Susan. Edie is upset when Susan and Mike move in together. Edie tries to get the women to convince Susan that Mike is bad for her, but Susan is sure he's the one. Susan later finds out her ex-husband, [[Karl Mayer]] ([[Richard Burgi]]), cheated on her with Edie while they were married; using this knowledge, Edie and Karl start dating, increasing the tension between her and Susan.

===Season 2===
In the show's [[Desperate Housewives (season 2)|second season]], Edie starts dating Karl, Susan's ex-husband. Edie and Susan have many confrontations as Susan tries to deal with some minor jealousy issues. Edie later discovers a wedding ring in Karl's briefcase and suspects Karl plans to propose. The truth was, Karl married Susan so she would have health insurance as she needed an operation. Susan tells Karl that Edie thinks he's going to propose so he does. Susan's boyfriend, Ron, tells Edie about her and Karl's marriage and Edie is angry with them for lying to her. To punish Karl and Susan, Edie decides Karl will throw her a lavish wedding and Susan will be burdened with the arrangements. However, one morning, Edie wakes up to find Karl leaving permanently and also discovers that Karl slept with another woman while they were engaged and breaks the news to the other housewives. Edie is extremely upset and Susan, who feels guilty about unknowingly being the "other woman", tries to make her feel better. Edie begins bonding with Susan, making her feel even more guilty. Edie gets a confession letter from Susan and feels betrayed, retaliating by burning down Susan's house. After discovering Edie burned down her house, Susan tries to get a confession whilst wearing a wire, leading to a fight when Edie realizes. Trying to catch Susan, Edie is badly stung by [[yellowjacket]]s. Susan feels guilty when Edie is hospitalized and tells her she won't give the confession to the police, sparing Edie prison. Edie refuses to accept Susan's pity and vows to get revenge.

===Season 3===
In the show's [[Desperate Housewives (season 3)|third season]], Edie declines Susan's attempts to rebuild a friendship. She is present when Mike wakes up from his coma and learns that he has retrograde amnesia and has forgotten the last two years. Edie's revenge on Susan is to take advantage of this. While "helping" Mike fill in the blanks, Edie makes him think that Susan never loved him and that they were miserable together. Edie admits that she’s always had a crush on him and how hurt she was that he ignored her. Susan comes by the hospital to give Mike flowers, but catches him having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Edie. Edie and Mike start a relationship but Edie ends it when Mike is arrested for the murder of Monique Pollier. Edie's nephew, Austin ([[Josh Henderson]]), moves in with her. He starts dating Susan's daughter, [[Julie Mayer (Desperate Housewives)|Julie Mayer]]. Susan disapproves but Edie claims she can't do anything about it because they are in love. Julie gets Edie to pose as her mother so she can get birth control pills. Edie and Susan later catch Austin having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Bree's daughter, [[Acquaintances of Bree Van de Kamp#Danielle Van de Kamp|Danielle Van de Kamp]]. He leaves Wisteria Lane when Danielle reveals she is pregnant with his child.

Edie's son, Travers, is introduced for the first time, having been dropped off by his father for a month-long visit. [[Carlos Solis]] develops a father/son relationship with Travers as he is constantly called on to look after him. When Edie develops romantic feelings for Carlos, she uses his relationship with Travers to her advantage and tries to seduce him, but he tells her he's not interested in her that way. They eventually sleep together and later start dating. Carlos wants to keep the affair a secret, making Edie think he's still in love with Gabrielle. Edie tells the girls about her and Carlos at her Gabrielle's engagement party. Gabrielle is furious and demands Edie stop seeing Carlos, but Edie refuses. Gabrielle tries to get her friends to freeze out Edie, but Edie makes it difficult. Gabrielle eventually makes peace with the relationship...for now. Edie considers going for full custody of Travers to keep Carlos around, but Carlos convinces her not to. When Travers is collected by his father, Edie asks Carlos to move in with her. When he declines, Edie visits his landlady, Mrs. Simms, at her nursing home and tells her Carlos is an alcoholic, does drugs, and uses her home as a place to hook up with prostitutes. Mrs. Simms terminates the lease and Carlos is evicted. Edie offers Carlos a place to stay but he is suspicious that she was involved in his eviction. Carlos tells Edie he doesn't love her and she tells him she could be pregnant. After they find that she isn't, she suggests he stay with her and they try for a baby but continues taking the pill, because she doesn't want a baby until he starts to love her. While looking for money in Edie's purse to pay the paper boy, Carlos discovers the pills. At Gaby's wedding, Carlos confronts Edie. She tries to apologize but is unsuccessful. At the closing scene of the season, Edie is shown with a sealed letter to her "beloved" Carlos, and hangs herself with a scarf.

===Season 4===
In the first episode of [[Desperate Housewives (season 4)|season 4]], it transpires that Edie's suicide attempt was merely a bid for Carlos' attention. Carlos feels responsible and agrees to resume their relationship, leading Edie to discover his secret [[offshore bank]] account containing $10 million. She uses this knowledge to blackmail him, asking him to marry her, unaware that Carlos is having an affair with Gabrielle. Edie goes on to announce their engagement party, but discovers Carlos' betrayal when she, Carlos, and Gabrielle's new husband, [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Victor Lang|Victor Lang]] ([[John Slattery]]), all suffer from [[Crab louse|crabs]]. Edie hires someone to spy on Carlos and gets pictures of him and Gabrielle kissing before telling the IRS about his offshore account. She discovers that Carlos has emptied and closed his offshore account so she turns the pictures over to Victor, knowing he will get revenge. Edie, still feeling vindictive, tells the police that Gaby may be responsible for Victor's disappearance. A tornado is about to hit Wisteria Lane and Carlos and Edie plan to disappear. Gabrielle is given a folder, giving her access to Carlos' offshore bank account. Edie and Gabrielle fight over it but lose the papers in the tornado. They are forced to take shelter together in Edie's crawl space and are able to put aside their differences for a while. Carlos is blinded in the tornado.

Edie finds out Carlos gave her real jewellery when they were together and gets back at him by staying with him. Edie learns that Carlos' blindness is permanent, when she thought it was only temporary. Later Edie tells Gabrielle that the way she is treating Carlos is sick and that there are other women out there who would treat Carlos better. When Bree and [[Orson Hodge]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) are having troubles, Edie lets Orson stay with her. Edie later shares a brief drunken kiss with Orson which is seen by Bree, who is looking for Toby the cat. Bree confronts Edie about the kiss. When Edie says it meant nothing, Bree slaps her and a full-scale war erupts between them. Bree sabotages Edie's business by hounding off potential house buyers. Edie visits Orson, who is now living at a hotel, to complain about Bree. When she enters the room, she discovers a piece of paper revealing that Bree's baby is really Austin and Danielle's. Edie threatens to tell everyone about it unless Bree does exactly what she wants. Bree tells her friends about her faked pregnancy and about Edie's threats. The housewives confront Edie, and tell her that from now on they won't be friends with her anymore and will ignore her whenever she talks to them. Afterward, Edie calls Travers, and tells him she's going to be spending a lot more time with him from now on.

====Five-year jump====
While off the lane, Edie starts visiting Orson while he is in prison for the hit and run of her ex-boyfriend [[Mike Delfino]]. After Bree hears that Edie has been visiting her husband, Bree goes to Edie's new house to confront her. Edie then shames Bree into being a better person. Bree doesn't tell anyone about this until she, Susan, Lynette, Gabrielle and Karen McCluskey go to bring Travers Edie's ashes. This makes Bree the only housewife to see Edie until she returns five years later.

During the five-year jump, Edie begins dating motivational speaker, Dave Williams. Edie proposes and they elope right away. Dave gets Edie into moving back to Wisteria Lane, though oblivious to her, he has his own agenda.

===Season 5===
The [[Desperate Housewives (season 5)|fifth season]] is set five years on from the fourth-season finale. Edie returns to Wisteria Lane, five years later, a new and transformed woman. When the housewives notice the change in Edie, they resume their friendship with her. Dave is persistent in convincing Edie to get along better with her neighbors. He kidnaps [[Karen McCluskey]]'s cat after she is rude to Edie, only returning him when Karen apologizes. When Karen attempts to investigate Dave's background, Edie realizes she knows very little about his past. Dave's doctor arrives in Fairview and confronts Dave at the White Horse Club, but Dave strangles him and sets fire to the building. Dave only married Edie to have an excuse to move to Wisteria Lane and get revenge on Mike, who, as it turns out, had been involved in a car accident that killed Dave's wife and daughter. Edie starts to notice something is off about Dave and is irritated that he doesn't show interest in her. One night she wakes up and sees Dave talking to himself. Edie wants to know why he's acting so strangely and Dave tells her he used to be married before he met Edie and that his wife died. Edie is furious he never told her about this before and throws him out of the house. When Edie is locked in a basement with Susan, they have a heart to heart chat and Susan tells Edie not to treat men like tissue and to believe in happily ever afters. After they are freed Edie goes to Dave and tells him to move back in. When Dave tells Edie that Eli Scruggs, the neighborhood handy man, has died, she recalls the time that when she was having marital problems with her ex-husband, Umberto. In a flashback, while feeling insecure about her appearance after Umberto turns out to be gay, Eli reassures Edie and makes her feel better and ends up having sex with her.

While at a liquor store, Edie observes an encounter between Dave and Father Drance. Suspicious about her husband's motives, she does a research on his past after Father Drance calls her Mrs. Dash. Determined to know more about her husband's past, Edie goes to the local newspaper for information on Dave's family, only to learn that Dave had both a wife and daughter who were killed in a car crash. Later, when she asks Dave how he feels about children, he tells her that his "friend" had a daughter he loved who died in the crash and lives his life wondering what she would've looked like and how old she would've been; he also tells her that he would never have a child as it wouldn't be worth it. Edie is still determined to know a lot more about Dave's past. Upon receiving a news article on the fateful car accident and finally learning the truth about her husband's intentions, she confronts Dave when he returns home from his camping trip. As she attempts to call Mike to warn him, she is almost strangled to death by Dave. Tearful and disorientated, Edie manages to run away and drives down the lane. She almost hits Orson as he stumbles onto the road; swerving to miss him, she hits an electric post instead. Dazed and unaware that the power line had snapped and there was water underneath the car, Edie steps out. She receives an [[electric shock]], falls to the ground and dies a few minutes later.

The housewives pay a visit to her son, Travers, to announce her death and to give him her ashes. On the journey up each of the housewives and Karen McCluskey share memories of Edie. In one flashback, Susan and Edie did get along in the beginning, until Susan finds out Edie is having sex with her neighbor's husband. In another flashback, Edie takes Lynette out to help her acquire the courage to beat cancer. In another flashback, Edie tells Bree that she has been visiting Orson because Bree can't bring herself to enter the visiting room at all since he went to jail. In another flashback, Edie reveals to Gabrielle that she always knew she wouldn't live a long life, and she should live it up while she still can. However, although Edie was right, Gabrielle convinced her that in 50 years time they would still go out and still be the hottest ladies on the lane. And in a final flashback, Edie visits Karen McCluskey and it is the anniversary of her son's death. Edie explains that she gave her son to her ex because she wanted him to have a good life and she knew that she would have made a bad mother. Karen says she hopes she isn't making a mistake, and Edie replies "Me too".  Once they arrive, however, Travers tells them that they were her closest friends and that they should spread the ashes wherever they see fit. Ultimately, her ashes are spread around Wisteria Lane. Edie was at peace about her death and had no regrets because she lived her life to the fullest and to her it was "a one of a kind life."

Edie appears briefly in "[[Everybody Says Don't (season five episode)|Everybody Says Don't]]" as a hallucination of Dave's, revealing his thoughts. Edie says that his plans to kill M.J. on the fishing trip, pretending it was an "accident" is a boring plan, and that he might as well kill M.J right then and there. She says that Susan would suffer more if she knew why M.J. died. She then says in a mocking tone that everyone would finally know what he's been going through.

'''Edward Harvey Davis''' (1862-1951) was a field collector for the [[Museum of the American Indian]] in [[New York City]] who acquired many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indian]] artifacts from various tribes in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego county]] and northwestern [[Mexico]] (including the [[Seris]]) for that museum (now part of the [[Smithsonian]]).

==Biography==
Born to Lewis S. Davis and Christine Smith Davis on 18 June 1862 in New York, Davis grew up in Brooklyn and attended the Brooklyn Art Guild,&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Edward H. Davis Papers,1910-1944|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM09166.html|website=Cornell University Library|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing skills in drawing and drafting.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Edward H. Davis|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/aboutdavis/.|website=San Diego History Center|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked for a time in New York in the accounting office of his family's shipping firm, Jonas Smith &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt;

In 1885, ill with [[Bright%27s_disease|Bright’s disease]], Davis followed his older brother Henry to San Diego, where the elder Davis had established an office of the family shipping firm and expanded into lumber and mining interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An illustrated history of Southern California|date=1890|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|isbn=5879878805|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Davis found work as a surveyor and a draftsman, drawing maps and house plans.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt; In 1887, he helped draw plans for the [[Hotel del Coronado]].&lt;ref name="Pursuits"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pursuits of a Museum Collector|journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology|date=2013|volume=33|issue=1|page=89|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6fx3z615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1885, he married Anna Marion (Anna May) Wells in New York and returned with her to San Diego.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt;

In 1887, a real estate deal in downtown San Diego provided Davis the funds to purchase 320 acres in Mesa Grande, approximately 60 miles northeast of San Diego, where he developed the land into a working cattle ranch and fruit farm.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt; In 1915, he built a summer resort on the property, the Powam Lodge, designed by noted architect [[Emmor Brook Weaver]]. Davis and his family operated the lodge until 1930, when it was destroyed in a fire.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt;

An interest in Indian culture led Davis to collect Indian artifacts, trading with various tribes in the neighborhood. Concerned with the loss of traditional Indian way of life, Davis acquired extensive artifacts to preserve and document Indian culture.&lt;ref name="Pursuits"/&gt;

In 1916, [[George Gustav Heye]], founder of the Museum of the American Indian, hired Davis as a field collector of Indian ethnological specimens.&lt;ref name="Pursuits"/&gt; Davis collected for the Heye Foundation from 1917 to 1930, focusing on artifacts of the Indian tribes of San Diego County/Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and northwestern Mexico, including the  Paipai, Kiliwa, Cora, Huichol, Opata, Mayo, Seri,  Apache, Cocopa, Tohono O’odham, Papago, Maricopa, Mojave, Hualapai, Yaqui, and Yuma Indians.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt;

In addition to collecting, Davis photographed Indian communities, documenting their daily and ceremonial activities and publishing his experiences in both popular magazines and scholarly journals.&lt;ref name="SDHC About"/&gt;

Davis died on 22 February 1951 at the age of 89.

== Activism ==

Gina Wilson founded [[Intersex Human Rights Australia]] in 2009 and remained as president of the organisation until stepping down on 1 September 2013. She was succeeded by [[Morgan Carpenter]]&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/changes-at-oii-as-trailblazer-gina-wilson-retires/109176 Changes At OII As Trailblazer Gina Wilson Retires ], Star Observer, 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/board-changes-at-oii-australia-gina-wilson-steps-down-11841.html Board changes at OII Australia: Gina Wilson steps down], Gay News Network, 2 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and has since returned as Vice-President.&lt;ref name="oiiboard"&gt;[http://oii.org.au/information/board/, The OII Australia Board], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been a member of the board of the [[National LGBTI Health Alliance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/health-alliance-in-better-shape/64848 Health Alliance in better shape], [[Star Observer]], 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samesame.com.au/news/local/7737/Melbourne-elects-Australias-first-intersex-Mayor.htm Melbourne elects Australia's first intersex Mayor], [[Samesame.com.au]], 9 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/10/tony-briffa-intersex-mayor_n_1140840.html Tony Briffa Of Australia's City Of Hobsons Bay Becomes World's First Intersex Mayor], [[Huffington Post]], 28 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a board associate of the AIDS Council of New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acon.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Annual-Report-2015-2016-WEBspread.pdf | title = Annual Report 2015/16 | work = AIDS Council of New South Wales | date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lidcombe, New South Wales]] branch president of the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/backlash-over-mps-stand-against-gay-marriage-20110802-1i960.html Backlash over MP's stand against gay marriage], Sydney Morning Herald, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/new-south-wales-news/"leave-the-party"-comments-rebuked/57911 "Leave the party" comments rebuked], Star Observer, 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In her work at Intersex Human Rights Australia, Gina Wilson played an important role in improving access to healthcare, inclusion of intersex people in anti-discrimination legislation, and in aged care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/opinion/including-intersex-in-anti-discrimination-law/66200 Including intersex in anti-discrimination law], [[Star Observer]], 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/14-days-of-intersex-begins/64652 14 Days of Intersex], [[Star Observer]], 27 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-discrimination legislation ===

Wilson has played a leading role in moves to protect people on the basis of "[[intersex]] status" in anti-discrimination law, appearing before a Senate inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/lgbti-advocates-front-anti-discrimination-hearings-10416.html LGBTI  advocates front anti-discrimination hearings], Gay News Network, 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], Wilson spoke about how initial proposals for intersex inclusion in federal legislation were inappropriate as they classed intersex as a gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/proposed-law-leaves-intersex-vulnerable-20130120-2d18b.html Proposed law leaves intersex 'vulnerable'], Judith Ireland in [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Senate of Australia]] inquiry into anti-discriminination legislation supported the approach of the organisation  and "intersex status" was added to the ''Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013'', which passed into law on 1 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/21774/welcome-senate-inquiry-anti-discrimination/ We welcome the Senate Inquiry report on the Exposure Draft of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 21 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/22713/sex-discrimination-amendment-intersex-status-act/ On the historic passing of the ''Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013''], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 25 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/02/australia-lgbt-and-intersex-anti-discrimination-laws-come-into-effect/ Australia: LGBT and intersex anti-discrimination laws come into effect], [[Pink News]], 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/national/federal-anti-discrimination-protections-start-today-11582.html Federal anti-discrimination protections start today], Gay News Network, 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bodily autonomy ===

Wilson has called for "normalising" surgeries on intersex infants to end, saying that such interventions should only take place when a child is able to provide informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watoday.com.au/national/call-to-end-intersex-genital-operations-20130619-2ojdr.html Call to end intersex genital operations], [[WA Today]], 20 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In comments on [[Intersex Awareness Day]] 2012, Wilson said, "At a fundamental level homophobic bigotry, intolerance and ancient superstitions underpin contemporary mistreatment of intersex people. Intersex people are subjected to forced gendering and surgical alterations to our bodies to "disappear" our differences in a society that regards difference in sex anatomy as deeply suspicious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/intersex-awareness-day-calls-equality-and-end-bigotry261012 Intersex Awareness Day calls for equality and end to bigotry], [[Gay Star News]], 26 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed by Andrew Bock in [[The Age]], Wilson expressed concern about the use of prenatal screening to terminate intersex foetuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/it-takes-more-than-two-20130619-2oj8v.html It takes more than two], Andrew Bock in [[The Age]], 20 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health and access to healthcare ===

Wilson played a role in efforts to improve access to [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] services in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/gender-discrimination-to-be-removed-from-medicare-20130724-2qi4m.html Gender discrimination to be removed from Medicare], [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 24 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/141595/20130902-0954/www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr13-tp-tp086.htm All Gender Discrimination to be Removed from Medicare], Joint Press Release, The Hon [[Tanya Plibersek]] MP [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]], Minister for Medical Research and Senator The Hon [[Jan McLucas]], [[Minister for Human Services (Australia)|Minister for Human Services]], 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has also called for the removal of intersex people from definitions of [[gender identity disorder]] in the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual, saying "The assumption is that the birth assignment must be right. The doctor is never at fault, it's the poor intersex person who is wrong, who then gets carted off to a psychiatrist to try and 'fix' us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/new-south-wales-news/intersex-people-not-disordered/23521 Intersex people not ‘disordered’], Star Observer, 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Concern over identification documents and third gender ===

While welcoming federal guidelines on recognition of gender,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/new-gender-recognition-guidelines-released-11207.html New gender recognition guidelines released], Gay News Network, 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson has expressed concern about misrepresentation of intersex issues by some [[transgender|trans]] groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/rift-emerges-between-minority-groups/53960 Rift emerges between minority groups], Star Observer, 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; including the instrumentalisation of intersex in moves to create a third gender category, warning of "far-reaching unintended consequences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/court-ruling-stigmatises-intersex-people/104671 Court ruling "stigmatises" intersex people], Star Observer, 7 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/polare-archive/archived-articles/the-intersex-view-of-norries-case.htm The Intersex View of Norrie's Case], Gender Centre, NSW, October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/22681/norrie-v-nsw-registrar-of-births-deaths-and-marriages/ On Norrie v NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages], Organisation Intersex International Australia, 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/new-south-wales-news/norrie’s-may-well-be-the-first-of-their-kind/22790 Norrie’s may well be the first of their kind], Star Observer, 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haji Mirza Hassan Tabrizi''' (میرزا حسن تبریزی; July 4, 1851, [[Tabriz]] – December 12, 1944, [[Qom]]), famously known as '''Hassan Roshdieh''' (حسن رشدیه), was an [[Iran]]ian [[cleric]], teacher, politician, and journalist. He introduced some modern teaching methods in [[Iran]], especially in teaching the alphabet. These are still used to some degree in [[Iran]]'s primary schools.

[[Image:Roshdieh.jpg|thumb|right|A Photograph of Hassan Roshdieh]]

Hassan Roshdieh was an ethnic [[Iranian Azerbaijani]] and began studying as a [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] cleric there, Roshdieh abandoned his plans of going to [[Najaf]] to study in religious schools after reading an article about the hardships of education in the [[Persian language]] from the newspaper ''Akhtar''. He left for [[Beirut]] in 1880 and studied for two years in its ''Daar ul-Mu'allimeen'' (teacher school), and then continued with visiting [[Istanbul]] and [[Egypt]]. In 1883, he left for [[Yerevan]] and founded the first modern school for Muslims there. In his new method of teaching, Roshdieh used the concept of sounds instead of alphabetic letters to teach the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Azeri language]]s, which use the [[Arabic script]].  During his four years of managing his school in Yerevan, Roshdieh wrote ''Vatan Dili'' (''The Language of the Homeland'') in Azerbaijani, which was taught in several schools of the [[Caucasus]] as a primer until the [[October Revolution]].

It was during his stay in Yerevan that Roshdieh met [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], who took him to [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. Roshdieh later return to his birthplace in Tabriz, where he established the first primary schools in [[Persian Empire|Iran]] in 1886 or 1887. While [[Ahmad Kasravi]] has claimed in his book that the primary school were established with the help of [[Ali Khan Amin od-Dowle]], the then [[Prime Minister of Iran|Premier of Iran]], this cannot be confirmed by the records of Fakhreddin Roshdieh, Mirza Hassan's son.

The schools were highly rejected by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh is trying to make the students quit [[Islam]], mentioning the school ring and its similarity to [[church bell]]s. This resulted in mobs destroying some of his schools (which resulted in a few students being killed or injured), unsuccessful assassination attempts using guns, and later a ''[[fatwa]]'' against the modern schools, which finally resulted in him fleeing Tabriz.

In [[Tehran]], and during the reign of [[Mozzafar-al-Din Shah]] and the prime ministership of Amin od-Dowle, Roshdieh started the ''Roshdieh School'' with the help of the government. He was a member of the political ''Ma'āref Association'' and active for the fight for freedoms and constitution during the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], leading to him being exiled or fleeing Iran a few times.

After a final return to Iran, Roshdieh established a new school and a magazine in 1904, both called ''Maktab''. He finally quit his political and educational activities in 1927 and moved to [[Qom]], where he died in 1944 and is buried.

Roshdieh is claimed to be the first Azerbaijani to write poems for children. He also had plans for education of the [[blindness|blind]] people and had helped establishing girl schools in Iran. He has several books and articles in Persian and Azerbaijani. He was called Roshdieh after the name of primary schools in the then [[Ottoman empire]], ''roshdiyye'', because he had established the first such schools in Iran.

Roshdieh is mentioned in a famous poem of [[Nima Youshij]], ''yād-e ba’zi nafarāt'' (''The Memory of Some People'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">'''Illar Hallaste''' (6 May 1959,&lt;ref name="lahkumine" /&gt; [[Kohtla-Järve]] – 27 October 2012,&lt;ref name="mzt0i" /&gt; [[Tallinn]]) was an Estonian cleric, politician, lawyer, and businessman, most notable for being a voter for the [[Estonian restoration of Independence]].

==Education==
Hallaste studied in [[Kohtla-Järve]], and from the 7th grade in the [[Otepää]] branch of the Tallinn Sports Secondary School. In 1977, he graduated from Kohtla-Järve Secondary High School. After graduating from high school, Hallaste began studying at the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Tartu]], where he was thrown out for being religious, which was discouraged by the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] government at the time. He eventually graduated in 1995.&lt;ref name="lahkumine" /&gt;

After graduating from the [[University of Tartu]], Hallaste began studying at the [[Institute of Theology of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. In 1982, he was ordained a teacher at [[St Mary's Cathedral, Tallinn]].&lt;ref name="lahkumine" /&gt;

==Career==
Hallaste served a number of parish throughout the late 20th century, including in [[Laiuse]] and [[Palamuse]] parishes from 1982 to 1983, [[Torma]] and [[Kodavere]] parishes from 1983 to 1988, and [[Kadrina]] and [[Ilumäe]] parishes from 1988 to 1993.&lt;ref name="Reedik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebwpr" /&gt; From 2005 to his death in 2012, he was a vicar teacher in Ida-Harju. He has also served as deputy head of the [[Järva]] [[Provost (religion)|provost]] and eastern Harju Assistance Front.&lt;ref name="lahkumine" /&gt;

After leaving politics, Hallaste established the law office of the same name and offered legal services. Lastly, he headed the company Viimars OÜ. In addition, he organized the Season Travel travel agency&lt;ref name="lahkumine" /&gt; and was a member of the Board of the Kirik Varahaldus OÜ, the company managing the real estate of EELK.&lt;ref name="s5jUc" /&gt;

==Political career==
Hallaste became a part of politics through the heritage protection movement.&lt;ref name="astus" /&gt; In October 1988, he attempted to stand in the [[Lääne-Viru County|Rakvere District]] against the "official" candidate nominated by the [[Communist Party of Estonia|Communist Party]], [[Vaino Väljas]], in the replacement of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, and created a precedent in post-war Estonia. However, bringing the formal reasons to excuse (a meeting of the group setting up the working group was convened as a trade union group, not as a trade union committee), he was denied the candidacy. In March 1989, Hallaste applied for election to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] in the same constituency, but remained under [[Siim Kallas]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="gH1cz" /&gt; In 1989, he was one of the founders of the Estonian Christian Union (later the Estonian Christian-Democratic Union) and was it's chairman until 1992. EKDL considered itself the successor to the [[Christian People's Party (Estonia)|Christian People's Party]] founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="EKDL" /&gt; Between 1990 and 1992, he was a member of the [[Estonian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|Estonian Supreme Soviet]] and the [[Congress of Estonia]], the 1990 Estonian Committee and the 1991-1992 Constituent Assembly. He was among the 69 members of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia who on 20 August 1991 voted for the [[Estonian restoration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Toomla" /&gt;

In the [[Riigikogu]] elections in 1992, the EKDL participated in the election campaign of "Isamaa" with the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia]], the Estonian Christian Democratic Party, the Republican Conservatives, and the [[Estonian Liberal Democratic Party]] (ELDP). The election coalition was the winner, receiving 22.00% of the votes and 29 seats in the Riigikogu. After the election, in the same year, the EKDL joined all but the ELDP, forming a new party: the [[Pro Patria National Coalition Party]]. Hallaste lost his position as party leader ([[Mart Laar]] later became the leader of the new party),&lt;ref name="EKDL" /&gt; but Hallaste was a member of the Riigikogu from 1992 to 1995.&lt;ref name="Toomla" /&gt; Hallaste led the Pro Patria National Coalition Party until 27 October 1993. On 30 June 1994, he left the faction and joined the Right-wing faction, whose members were members of the [[People's Party of Republicans and Conservatives]] on 9 October 1994, as the founders of the newly formed Party of the Republicans from the Republican and Conservative People's Party (VKRE). On April 5, 1998, the VKRE joined the Estonian Peasantry Party, forming the [[Estonian People's Party]], but was compulsorily terminated on 14 December 1999 because it failed to comply with the 1000-member requirement of the new Political Parties Act.&lt;ref name="sGlKs" /&gt;

In 1998, Hallaste and businesswoman [[Toivo Ninnas]] were caught in a sex scandal involving inviting ten female guests to the Viking hotel in [[Pärnu]]. Ninna and Hallaste denied the allegations, but the People's Party forced out Hallaste.&lt;ref name="1ldg9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jp95P" /&gt; As a result of the scandal, former [[President of Estonia|president]] [[Arnold Rüütel]] did not award him the same award given to all members of the Supreme Council who voted on 20 August 1991 to restore Estonia's independence. "I have not seen this list," Hallaste said of the President's decision. "Everyone who voted [for independence] got the award except for me. Why can't I? Is morale a thing? For me, this is completely incomprehensible...".&lt;ref name="aVFH0" /&gt;

In 2000, police in Tallinn fined Hallaste for going 107&amp;nbsp;km/h on the freeway while [[driving under the influence]], despite being part of the leadership of the Alcohol Policy Council.&lt;ref name="qKg8O" /&gt;

From 2001 to his death, Hallaste was a part of the [[Estonian Reform Party]].&lt;ref name="astus" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1978, Hallaste married Hilja Seppenen. They had eight children (three sons and five daughters).

'''Joseph J. Katz''' (April 19, 1912, Detroit – January 28, 2008, Chicago) was a [[chemist]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] whose fundamental research on the chemistry of photosynthesis led to his election to the [[National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Science]]. His parents were Jewish immigrants from [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]]. Neither parent had any formal education.

==Education and independent research==
His college education was in chemistry at the College of the City of Detroit (now [[Wayne State University]]). He worked for the next seven years at small companies in Detroit, developing adhesives, metal polishing compounds, lubricants and other specialty chemical formulations used in the automobile industry. While working in Detroit after receiving his bachelor's degree, Katz and several colleagues rented a room in a Detroit office building and used it as a laboratory. They carried out independent research from 1932 through 1939, trying to cure tuberculosis by finding a substance that could dissolve the fatty outer coating of the TB bacillus so that it would be vulnerable to being destroyed by a drug. He and a Detroit colleague published two papers on studies with the bacterium [[Mycobacterium smegmatis]], a fast-growing and non-pathogenic bacillus with similar physical properties to the tuberculosis bacillus.

Unemployed in summer 1939, he followed a suggestion from a former teacher and applied to graduate school in chemistry at the University of Chicago. His thesis research in physical organic chemistry under the supervision of [[Frank R. Mayo]] was a study of the mechanism of addition of hydrogen chloride to [[isobutene]] in a solvent of low dielectric constant. He received the PhD degree in March 1942.

The '''Krasue''' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:กระสือ|กระสือ]]}}, {{IPA|/krà.sɯ̌ː/|lang=th}}), known as ''Ahp'' ({{lang-km|អាប}}) in [[Cambodia]] and as ''Kasu'' ({{lang-lo|ກະສື}}, {{IPA|/ka.sɯ̌ː/|lang=lo}}) in [[Laos]], is a [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] female [[spirit]] of [[Southeast Asia]]n [[folklore]]. It manifests itself as a woman, usually young and beautiful, with her [[organ (anatomy)|internal organs]] hanging down from the neck, trailing below the head.&lt;ref name="ผีกระสือ"&gt;{{Cite book|last= |first= |authorlink= |title= Spirits|year=2008 |publisher=Thaiworldview |location=Thailand |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thai [[ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Phraya Anuman Rajadhon]], the Krasue consists of a floating head accompanied by a [[will-o'-the-wisp]] kind of [[luminescent]] glow.&lt;ref&gt;''Essays on Thai Folklore'', Editions Duang Kamol, {{ISBN|974-210-345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanations attempted about the origin of the glow include the presence of [[methane]] in marshy areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mthai.com/general-news/149342.html Mthai News Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; The Krasue is often said to live in the same areas as [[Krahang]], a male spirit of the [[Thai folklore]].

This spirit moves about by hovering in the air above the ground, for it has no lower body. The throat may be represented in different ways, either as only the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or with the whole [[neck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/875/vtxtb0x5ol5.jpg Krasue film posters]&lt;/ref&gt; The organs below the head usually include the [[heart]] and the [[stomach]] with a length of intestine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oknation.net/blog/home/blog_data/350/4350/images/exit4893.jpg Movie poster]&lt;/ref&gt; the intestinal tract emphasizing the ghost's voracious nature. In recent movie [[Krasue Valentine]], this ghost is represented with more internal organs, such as [[lung]]s and [[liver]], but much reduced in size and anatomically out of proportion with the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisekwai.buzznet.com/photos/entertainment/?id=2118674 Krasue representation]&lt;/ref&gt; The viscera are sometimes represented freshly daubed with [[blood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chutbooks.com/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7 ''Krasue Sao'' book cover]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as glowing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samsearn.com/pnev/ev12.jpg Glowing Krasue]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary representations her teeth often include pointed fangs in [[yaksha|yakkha]] ({{lang-th|ยักษ์}}) or [[vampire]] fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaifilm.com/imgUpload/reply317321_%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97.jpg ''Krasue Sawath'' ("กระสือสวาท"), Thai dubbed version of Hong Kong movie "Witch with the Flying Head" film poster]&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie ''Ghosts of Guts Eater'' she has a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around her head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tnFHzZFTKTU/TfUxovZn91I/AAAAAAAAFU0/uophBF74g3M/s1600/guts006.png ''Ghosts of Guts Eater'' scene]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Krasue'' has been the subject of a number of movies in the region, including ''[[My Mother is Arb]]'' ({{lang-km|កូនអើយ ម្តាយអាប}}). Also known as ''Krasue Mom'', this Cambodian horror film has the distinction of being the first movie made in the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] after the absence of locally-made movies and the repression of local [[folklore]] in [[Cambodia]] during the [[Khmer Rouge]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Photo-64908-L.png|Konm Eak Madia Arb film poster]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krasue is also found in the popular mythology of [[Malaysia]], where it is called the ''[[penanggalan]] or'' ''hantu penanggal'', and also in [[Indonesia]] where it has many names such as [[Leyak]], Palasik, Selaq Metem, Kuyang, Poppo, and Parakang. This spirit is also part of Vietnamese folklore as ''ma lai'' via the [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|minority ethnic groups]] of [[Vietnam]]'s [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. In the [[Philippines]] there is a similar ghost, [[manananggal]], a local spirit that haunts [[pregnancy|pregnant women]].&lt;ref name="m001"&gt;{{cite book  |last= Alip  |first= Eufronio Melo  |author-link = Eufronio Melo Alip  |title= Political and Cultural History of the Philippines  |year= 1950  |publisher=   |location= Philippines  |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m002"&gt;{{cite book  |last= Ramos  |first= Maximo D.  |author-link = Maximo D.

==Legends==

===Origin===
Krasue is a belief shared across southeast asia, as such its origin is difficult to verify. However, the inception of this demon is likely to be based on a folk lore. In Thailand, Krasue is believed to be a cursed individual (usually a female) who engaged in various sins and fraudulent conducts during her previous life. After she dies, her sins causes her to be reborn as a ''phuti'' ({{lang-th|ภูติ}}) that has to live off wasted, uncooked or rotten food. In recent time, the Thai entertainment industry has fictionalized the origin of Krasue as a cursed ancient Khmer princess, as in [[Demonic Beauty]]'' (2002). ''This depiction is, however, merely an attempt to put a royal touch or to reinvent a mythical beginning to a well-known story of an essentially folk origin, for strictly entertainment and commercial purpose. One critic notes that the director of ''Demonic Beauty'' probably just wanted to depict "Krasue" as an evil and an alien demon, originating from the witchcraft and black magic of a foreign (i.e. Cambodian's) pagan culture, which is ultimately subdued and defeated by the more-enlightened buddhist culture of Thailand.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyotoreview.org/issue-14/tamnan-krasue-constructing-a-khmer-ghost-for-a-thai-film/ Tamnan Krasue]&lt;/ref&gt;    

There are other oral traditions that say that this spirit was formerly a rich lady that had a length of black gauze or ribbon tied around the head and neck as protection from the sunshine. This woman was then possessed by an evil spirit and was cursed to become a Krasue. Other popular legends claim that origin of the spirit may have been a woman trying to learn [[black magic]] that made a mistake or used the wrong [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] so that her head and body became separated. [[Buddhist views on sin|Past sins]] are also related to the transmission of the Krasue curse; women who aborted or killed someone in a previous life will become a Krasue as punishment. Other folk stories talk about a person being cursed to become a Krasue after having consumed food and drink contaminated with a krasue's [[saliva]] or flesh. Popular imagination also claims that the transformation into a Krasue is largely restricted to the relatives of women practicing [[witchcraft]] ''"Mae Mot"'' (แม่มด) or ''"Yai Mot"'' (ยายมด), especially their daughters or granddaughters. Often women acting strange in a community are suspected of becoming nightly a Krasue by other members of the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loy9.com/en/yeaydul/ Yeay Duol]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description in Thai folklore===
The Krasue is under a [[curse]] that makes it ever hungry and always active in the night when it goes out hunting to satisfy its [[gluttony]], seeking blood to drink or raw flesh to devour. It may attack cattle or chicken in the darkness, drinking their blood and eating their internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taliesinttlg.blogspot.com/2011/06/honourable-mention-ghost-and-master-boh.html Honourable Mention: The Ghost and Master Boh]&lt;/ref&gt; It may also prey on pieces of cattle, such as [[water buffalo]] that have died of other causes during the night. If blood is not available the Krasue may eat [[feces]] or [[carrion]].&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnIzUEtWII/AAAAAAAAABU/3Dixe_s_Ins/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD3.bmp Krasue feeding]&lt;/ref&gt; Clothes left outside would be found soiled with blood and excrement in the morning, allegedly after she had wiped her mouth. Therefore, villagers would not leave clothes hanging to dry outside during the night hours.

The Krasue also preys on pregnant women in their homes just before or after the [[Birth in Thailand|childbirth]]. It hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instil fear. It uses an elongated proboscis-like tongue&lt;ref&gt;[http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/AMFrank/KRASUE/snapshot20061023170035.jpg Krasue tongue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q217/Taliesin_ttlg/krasue/krasue_tongue.jpg Krasue tongue extended]&lt;/ref&gt; to reach the [[fetus]] or its [[placenta]] within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting women mainly in rural areas during their pregnancy. In some cases it may catch the unborn child and use its sharp teeth to devour it.
In order to protect pregnant women from becoming victims before delivery, their relatives place thorny branches around the house. This improvised thorny fence discourages the ''Krasue'' from coming to suck the blood and causing other suffering to the pregnant lady within the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budinst.gov.kh/?q=node/180|title=វិធីសម្រាលកូន: |accessdate=12 October 2008|publisher=Buddhist Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After delivery, the woman's relatives must take the cut placenta far away for burial to hide it from the Krasue. There is the belief that if the placenta is buried deep enough the spirit can not find it.
&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;

The Krasue hides the headless body from which it originates in a quiet place because it needs to join it before daybreak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnDAU-RklI/AAAAAAAAABM/jFO3SYlj3Dg/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD2.bmp Krasue emerging from its body]&lt;/ref&gt; living like a normal person during the day, although having a sleepy look.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkaiki0710.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/03/post-9b42.html Fullmoon Devil]&lt;/ref&gt; To crush the still headless body of the krasue is fatal to the spirit. The flying head will return after hunting but rejoin with the wrong body which will lead it to suffer torment until death. If the top part of the body fails to find the lower half before daybreak it will die in terrible pain. The Krasue will also die if its intestines get cut off or if its body disappears or gets hidden by someone. Some folk beliefs hold that the creature can be destroyed by burning it. The main foes of the Krasue are mobs of angry villagers carrying [[torch]]es and [[machete]]s. They may catch the Krasue and kill it or watch where she goes before dawn and destroy her body.

There is a legend said that the people who are wounded should be aware of the Krasue because it can smell the blood and will come to eat the blood at night when people fall asleep. However, there are ways to prevent the Krasue from coming inside the house. House-owners usually build spiky fences or grow spiky bamboo to protect themselves from the Krasue. Krasue is scared of spiky things because its intestine might get stuck and it could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;3. tumnandd. ผีกระสือ นักล่ายามรัตติกาล. tamnandd.com. [Online] 2010. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent reported sightings===
*On the night of July 22, 2008, about 11:27 p.m, [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage of a lemonade factory in [[Nong Suea District]], [[Pathum Thani Province]] captured quite clearly an alleged Krasue. The Krasue appears near one side of the factory wall adjacent to the field. When a smartphone's camera was used to take a shot of the CCTV footage in order to zoom at it closer, an old woman living alone in that area was seen in the image. Local people insist that they see strange lights and hear strange sounds at night for about a year. However, when the old woman seen in the image died, sightings of the Krasue reportedly stopped. Asst. Prof. Dr. Chawan Koopipat, an expert in photography and video technology from [[Chulalongkorn University]] checked the CCTV footage and determined that it was not edited. According to the professor, the Krasue in the CCTV footage probably was a result of the lighting, which has movement on the upper part and reflecting on the bottom wet and damp area of the land that was not farmed giving the illusion of a Krasue.&lt;ref name="ยูทูป"/&gt;

*Strange red lights floating up the paddy fields in the area of [[Phachi District]], [[Ayutthaya Province]], near Wat Tako were sighted in mid-June 2014 and was believed to be from a Krasue. Soon after, hundreds of teenagers (in some nights ranging to thousands) flocked in the area reportedly to prove the truth. This has caused damage to this field. The landlord insists that there are no Krasue here and the lights seen were actually a floating lantern bird chaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma8aLhCVOpc|title=ปากโป้ง - วัยรุ่นนับร้อย แห่ล่าดวงไฟประหลาดโผล่กลางทุ่งนา เชื่อว่าเป็นกระสือ 1/2|date=2014-06-23|accessdate=2017-08-19|language=thai|website=[[Channel 8 (Thailand)|Channel 8]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyzOyN4mqxA|title=ปากโป้ง - วัยรุ่นนับร้อย แห่ล่าดวงไฟประหลาดโผล่กลางทุ่งนา เชื่อว่าเป็นกระสือ 2/2|date=2014-06-23|accessdate=2017-08-19|language=thai|website=Channel 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*At approximately 09:30 p.m., on September 13, 2016, CCTV footage from a house in the [[Tha Ruea District]], Ayutthaya Province, captured strange lights. The woman owner of the house who first reviewed the CCTV footage said she was watching television at that time and she heard a loud barking dog. She went out to check the source of the sound but she did not see anything, so she looked at the CCTV monitor. She saw the strange lights which she watched for almost an hour, until the lights floated in the fence of her house and moved near the [[chicken coop]] and the [[Phyllanthus acidus|star gooseberry]] tree. She became scared and called her neighbor, along with her father and her two other employees, whom she all asked to help her investigate the lights. However, they found nothing. She said that at the time of the event, there was bad weather during two to three days, it's sprinkling and nighttime comes faster than normal. After another 10 days at 08:28 p.m. on 23 September, she saw again the lights in the backyard. This time she asked her son to investigate the lights but her son found nothing. Their neighbors were believed to be a Krasue. At that time, there were chickens and cats that the villagers were missing for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ5-_iBjk3A|title=รายการบันทึกลึกลับ " กระสือ..กรุงเก่า "  08/10/59 EP 2/3|date=2016-11-12|accessdate=2017-07-30|language=Thai|website=miraclechannel tvthailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Dr. Jessada Denduangboripant, a skeptic, the strange lights actually came from the [[flashlight]] held by someone in front of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2016-09-27|url=http://news.sanook.com/2074058/|title=อ.เจษฎา ชี้ คลิปกระสือ อยุธยา ที่แท้ขโมยจะเข้าบ้าน|accessdate=2017-07-31|language=Thai|website=Sanook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*By the end of 2016, one image has been shared on online social networks in Thailand. The image was shot in [[Buachet District]], Surin Province, and shows an entity that looks like a human's face on a tree at night nearby a light. The image is believed to be depicting a Krasue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoLY-QGkp-Y|website=[[Workpoint TV]]|title=กระสือหรือคน โผล่บนต้นไม้ที่สุรินทร์ l ข่าวเวิร์คพอยท์ (เช้า)  29 ธ.ค.59|date=2016-12-29|accessdate=2017-07-28|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In early 2017, at Ban Lao Luang, [[Mueang Kalasin District]], [[Kalasin Province]], a stampede occurred and villagers rode in motorcycles to go to the area where an individual shot a video showing red lights floating at 100 meters above the ground. The video shows that the light has already floated away. A man reported that at the time he lived in [[Yang Talat District]], he would frequent the woods at night and while at the woods he looked at the sky and saw a Krasue. According to him, he cannot see the Krasue's face because it was covered by long hair, but he can make out the long fangs and the bright lights. It was reportedly able to escape when he drew his gun to shoot it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Khaosod]]|url=https://www.khaosod.co.th/around-thailand/news_196091|title=ผวาแสงไฟลอยเข้าหมู่บ้าน!! ชาวบ้านเห็นเป็นกระสือ กลัวแต่อยากรู้ ขับรถตามดวงไฟ(คลิป)|language=Thai|date=2017-01-26|accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entity was being witnessed by either a [[security guard]] or a police officer standing and looking with suspicion.

===Krasue references in Thai culture===
[[File:Luminescent mushroom.jpg|thumb|Glowing mushroom in Khonkaen province is called “ Krasue Mushroom”.]]
There is information from The Royal Academy which provides examples of how belief in the Krasue has been reflected in Thai culture for centuries, for example:
#An abnormally tiny banana (caused by a mutation) is said to be eaten by a Krasue.
#A gluttonous person who eats too fast is usually said to  “eat like a Krasue” or to be “as gluttonous as Krasue”.
#Glowing mushroom in Khonkaen province is called “ Krasue Mushroom”.&lt;ref&gt;2. Siamsouth. เห็ดกระสือ หรือ เห็ดเรืองแสง ควบคุมไส้เดือนฝอยรากปมในมะเขือเทศ. siamsouth.com. [Online] 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
#In Chonburi province, there is a village named “ Nong Krasue” (Krasue marsh). Now, the name has been changed to “ Nong Krasaem” (Happiness marsh) to make it less scary.&lt;ref name=Jan&gt;1. Janputt, Pitchayatun. Nong Krasue. [interv.] Sorayutt Sututsanajinda. January 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==
A possible scientific explanation is that Krasue sightings are caused by blazing flames from methane gas particles emitted from rotten organic matters such as found in farms and fields, where Krasue sightings are commonly reported. However, according to Associate Professor Dr. Sirintornthep Towprayoon, an energy researcher from [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]], the hypothesis that the Krasue is actually burning methane gas particles is impossible because not enough methane is emitted from rotten organic matter to be able to cause an ignition and that even if the methane gas particles did ignited, the burning would be confined to the surface of the organic, flammable matter and will not lead to floating flames that allegedly give the illusion of the Krasue.&lt;ref name="ยูทูป"/&gt;
An anatomical interpretation is that when the head is pulled off from the human body, other organs such as the intestines, heart, and lungs will not come together with the head.&lt;ref name="ยูทูป"&gt;{{cite web|title=บางอ้อ : ท้าพิสูจน์ตำนานกระสือ|website=บางอ้อ|url=http://video.sanook.com/player/398603/|language=Thai|date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular culture==
Countries where the Krasue tale is popular have adapted it to film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tracker.zaerc.com/torrents-details.php?id=8238 Krasue movies]&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai films]] depict this spirit, including 1973 movie ''[[Krasue Sao]]'' (Ghosts of Guts Eater), {{lang-th|กระสือสาว}} with [[Sombat Metanee]], which features a fight between two Krasues,&lt;ref&gt;[http://diedangerdiediekill.blogspot.com/2011/06/ghost-of-guts-eater-thailand-1973.html Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Itthirit Nam Man Phrai]]'' {{lang-th|อิทธิฤทธิ์น้ำมันพราย}} made in 1984, with [[Tanid Pongmanoon]] and [[Praew Mardmarud]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonpalm.tarad.com/shop/t/tonpalm/img-lib/spd_2011031393404_b.jpg Itthirith Nam Man Phrai (Thailand 1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Krasue Kat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|กระสือกัดปอบ}} (1990) with [[Bin Bunluerit]] and [[Trirak Rakkarndee]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24V4743fiw8 Krasue Kat Pop (Thailand 1990)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Krasue Krahailueat]]'' (Bloodthirsty Krasue), {{lang-th|กระสือกระหายเลือด}}, made in 1995 with [[Thida Teerarat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaifilm.com/imgUpload/reply773761_0.jpg Krasue Krahailueat (Thailand 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demonic Beauty|''Tamnan Krasue'']] {{lang-th|ตำนานกระสือ}} (Demonic Beauty) released in 2002, ''[[Krasue Valentine]]'' (2006) by [[Yuthlert Sippapak]], ''Krasue'' (The Gluttonous Fear) {{lang-th|กระสือ}} made in 2007, with [[Jedsada Roongsakorn]] and [[Sirintorn Parnsamutr]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcddvd88.com/imgs/cd/fear2.jpg The Gluttonous Fear (Thailand 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Krasue Fat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|กระสือฟัดปอบ}} (2009) with [[Chutima Naiyana]], in which Krasue fights against [[Phi Pop]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://doopap.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/e0b881e0b8a3e0b8b0e0b8aae0b8b7e0b8ade0b89fe0b8b1e0b894e0b89be0b8ade0b89a.jpg?w=592 Krasue Phat Pop (Thailand 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fullmoon Devil]]'' (2011) {{lang-th|กระสือ}} by [[Komson Thripong]].

Krasue, as ''Ap'' (also spelt ''Arp'' or ''Arb''), is present in the [[Cinema of Cambodia|Cambodian horror film]]s ''[[Neang Arp]]'' (Lady Vampire) (2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviecambodia.com/2012/07/neang-arp.html Neang Arp - Moviecambodia]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tiyen Arp]]'' (Heredity of Krasue) (2007), ''[[Arb Kalum]]'' (The Sexiest Krasue) (2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khmerlife.com/showthread.php/23-Khmai-HORROR Khmai HORROR]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Phlerng Chhes Arb''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angkorwat.com/index.php?com=info&amp;wprdtid=39&amp;wid=2344&amp;wpid=KHMMOV064&amp;wcatid=58&amp;wmtypeid=65&amp;wc=14&amp;winst=1&amp;whp=0 Khmer Movies - Phlerng Chhes Arb]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]'s ''[[Witch with the Flying Head]]'' (飛頭魔女) (1977), which includes a ''Krasue'' spitting flames and firing laser beams and that was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in Thai as ''Krasue Sawat'' (กระสือสวาท), meaning "Lovely Krasue",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdaddicted.it/forum/uploads/1315397014/gallery_31_728_153102.jpg Witch with the Flying Head - Thai poster]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Indonesia]]'s ''[[Mystics in Bali]]'' (1981) also feature local versions of Krasue. In the [[Vietnam War]]-era drama ''Freedom Deal''&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.steampowered.com/app/720180/FREEDOM_DEAL_Story_of_Lucky__Vietnam_War_Supernatural_Historical_Drama Freedom Deal VOD]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Camerado]], [[Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon]] orders the 1970 military incursion into Cambodia, unwittingly unleashing a legion of local ghosts similar to the Krasue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/FREEDOMDEAL Freedom Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

This ghost appears periodically in [[Thai television soap opera]]s (ละคร). ''[[Krasue (lakhon)|Krasue]]'', a popular ''lakhon'' aired between 20 December 1994 and 21 March 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxSugyM_S0 Krasue - The Floating Head Thai Ghost Lakorn.flv]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the more recent ''[[Krasue Mahanakhon]]'' (กระสือมหานคร) —in which the ghost story for a change is against a background of young city people instead of the usual rural or traditional setting&lt;ref&gt;[http://drama.tlcthai.com/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A3-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD Krasue Mahanakhon - Thai Channel 3]&lt;/ref&gt;— feature a ''Krasue'' in the central role. The [[theme song]] of the 1994 ''Krasue'' TV soap opera became very famous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topicstock.pantip.com/chalermthai/topicstock/2008/05/A6622501/A6622501-0.jpg Krasue - Lakorn Theme song]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[remake]] in 2011 named ''[[Krasue Cham Sin]]'' (กระสือจำศีล),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3WddjOGec ละครกระสือจำศีล ''(Lakhon Krasue Chamsin)'']&lt;/ref&gt; but it was poorly cast and produced, not being able to reach the popularity of the 1994 ''lakhon''. A Krasue has been also comically featured in a [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] light bulb commercial for Thai audiences&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRFPf0dgfSg Sylvania light bulb commercial]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a more recent dietary supplement ad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesecretplus.com/ On Air ทางฟรีทีวีแล้ววันนี้ !!! กับอาหารเสริม The Secret Plus]&lt;/ref&gt; A rather ugly Krasue also appears in the animated film ''[[Nak (film)|Nak]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.mju.ac.th/film/detail.php?id=1651 Films Database -  Nak]&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of Krasue, often humorous,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggang.com/data/inmylife-inmyworld/picture/1188699676.jpg ''Krasue'' image]&lt;/ref&gt; are very common in [[Thai comics|Thai comic]] [[comic book|book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggang.com/data/real-ghost/picture/1220969448.gif Comic Vignette]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uc.exteenblog.com/yochi/images/ptoon/T1_P4.png Comic page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letcomic.com/2011/webboard/stocks/attach/ba1c8ef98aca81c958707a40cb777c8d.jpg Let Comic - Krasue leaving her body]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since this ghost is a popular subject in some places of Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, there are even costumes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thairath.co.th/content/ent/36769 Comedian with Krasue costume]&lt;/ref&gt; dolls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/4045/img6556res.jpg Krasue doll]&lt;/ref&gt; keyholders&lt;ref&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6vvd1Dwa1VU/TUrCsUb9YeI/AAAAAAAAAAg/1YPAQUVHExE/s1600/102_1314.gif Krasue keyholder]&lt;/ref&gt; and lamps&lt;ref&gt;[http://moohin.com/trips/bangkok/sanghee/300/42.jpg Krasue lamp]&lt;/ref&gt; in Krasue form.

The Krasue is one of the enemies found in ''[[Indivisible (video game)|Indivisible]]'', a [[role-playing game]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Christina 'Licorice' McKechnie'''  (born 2 October 1945) is a Scottish musician. She was a singer and songwriter in the [[Incredible String Band]] between 1968 and 1972.  Her whereabouts have been unknown since 1990.

==Biography==
McKechnie was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].  After reading her poetry at folk clubs in Edinburgh, she met the musician [[Robin Williamson]], but left home in her teens with the intention of marrying [[Bert Jansch]].  The [[banns]] were published but the wedding never took place.  Jansch left her behind to travel to [[Morocco]] in 1963, and, according to Williamson, "she fell into [my] arms".  In 1966 she travelled to Morocco with Williamson, and was later involved in the Incredible String Band's recordings. Her first contribution to the band came in the form of [[backing vocals]] on the track "Painting Box", on the 1967 album ''[[The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion]]''.  By 1968, she was regarded as a fully-fledged member of the band, usually as a backing singer and [[percussionist]], and she performed with them at the [[Woodstock Festival]] in August 1969.   By 1972 she had left the band, after her relationship with Williamson ended.&lt;ref name=beglad&gt;Whittaker, Adrian, ed. (2003). ''Be Glad: The Incredible String Band Compendium''. {{ISBN|1-900924-64-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, McKechnie appeared onstage at a [[Scientology]] benefit concert in [[East Grinstead]] with [[Mike Garson]], [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], Leonard Halliwell and others, before moving to California and joining the Silver Moon Band. She later married the musician Brian Lambert; they later divorced. She appeared with Williamson and his Merry Band in 1977, and is credited as Likky Lambert on the 1977 album ''[[Journey's Edge]]'', before joining Woody Woodmansey's band U-Boat.&lt;ref name="beglad"/&gt;

She visited Edinburgh in 1986 to see her family, but her whereabouts have been unknown since 1990, when, according to her sister, she was in [[Sacramento, California]], apparently recovering from surgery.&lt;ref name="beglad"/&gt; The music journalist [[Mark Ellen]] wrote in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in 2000 that she was "last seen in 1987 hitchhiking across the [[Arizona]] Desert. Not even her family has heard from her since." Fellow former Incredible String Band member [[Rose Simpson]] was quoted as saying: "There's a possibility she may be dead."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Mark (2000). "Supertroupers—The Incredible String Band". ''MOJO''. August 2000, issue 81, EMAP Metro, London. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lili Ilse Elvenes''' (28 December 1882 – 13 September 1931), better known as '''Lili Elbe''', was a Danish [[transgender]] woman and among the early recipients of [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]]. ''Chirurgische Eingriffe bei Anomalien des Sexuallebens: Therapie der Gegenwart'', pp. 67, 451–455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aj&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010080625/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioe1/elbe1.html Lili Elbe]. andrejkoymasky.com. 17 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elbe was born '''Einar Magnus Andreas Wegener''',{{sfn|Meyer|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4yyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22Einar%20Magnus%20Andreas%20Wegener%22 15], [https://books.google.com/books?id=T4yyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22Einar%20Magnus%20Andreas%20Wegener%22 310–313]}} and was a successful painter under that name. During this time she also presented as Lili (sometimes spelled Lily) and was introduced publicly as Einar's sister. 

After successfully [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] in 1930, she changed her legal name to Lili Ilse Elvenes and stopped painting altogether.&lt;ref name="Meyer pp. 311-314"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4yyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311 311–314]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Lili Elbe was given to her by Copenhagen journalist Louise Lassen.&lt;ref name="Trans Media"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.transmediawatch.org/timeline.html|website=Trans Media Watch|accessdate=February 3, 2016|title=A Trans Timeline – Trans Media Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died from complications involving a uterus transplant.&lt;ref name="Biography.com, 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Week, 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist v H.wood"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Danish Girl (2015)|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/danish-girl/|website=HistoryVSHollywood.com|publisher=History vs Hollywood|accessdate=1 February 2016}}{{better source|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her autobiography ''Man into Woman'' was published posthumously in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Worthen, Meredith  | date = n.d. | url=http://www.biography.com/people/lili-elbe-090815|title=Lili Elbe – Painter | publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
It is generally believed that Elbe was born in 1882, in [[Vejle]], Denmark. Her year of birth is sometimes stated as 1886, which appears to be from a book about her which has some facts changed to protect the identities of the persons involved. Facts about the life of Elbe's wife [[Gerda Wegener|Gerda Gottlieb]] suggest that the 1882 date is correct because they married while at college in 1904, when she would have been just eighteen if the 1886 date were correct.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182419/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/59398.html She and She: The Marriage of Gerda and Einar Wegener].

It is speculated that Elbe was [[intersex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoyer, ed.|first1=Niels|title=Man into woman : the first sex change, a portrait of Lili Elbe : the true and remarkable transformation of the painter Einar Wegener|date=2004|publisher=Blue Boat Books|location=London|isbn=9780954707200|pages=vii, 26–27, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lili Elbe's autobiography, Man into Woman|url=https://oii.org.au/789/book-review-man-woman/|website=OII Australia – Intersex Australia|publisher=[[OII Australia]]|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vacco|first1=Patrick|title=Les Miserables Actor Eddie Redmayne to Star as Queer Artist Lili Elbe|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2014/04/29/les-miserables-actor-eddie-redmayne-star-queer-artist-lili-elbe|accessdate=1 September 2015|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Could this be Eddie Redmayne's most challenging role?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2969353/A-cross-dresser-1920s-Paris-loving-husband-sex-change-pioneer-Extraordinary-Lili-Elbe-Eddie-Redmayne-set-play-new-film.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} although that has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Jodi|title=Transfiguration: a narrative analysis of male‐to‐female transsexual|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education|date=January 2007|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/09518390600923768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports indicate that she already had rudimentary ovaries in her abdomen and she may have had [[Klinefelter syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Biography.com, 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matt &amp; Andrej Koymasky - Famous GLTB – Lili Elbe|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioe1/elbe01.html|website=HistoryVSHollywood.com|publisher=Matt &amp; Andrej Koymasky|date=17 May 2003|accessdate=2 February 2016}}{{better source|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2016}}

== Marriage and modelling ==
[[File:Lili Elbe c1920.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lili Elbe c. 1920]]
[[File:Lili Elbe - Poplerne langs Hobro Fjord - 1908.png|thumb|left|''Poples along Hobro Fjord'' from 1908 - an example of Lili Elbe's work as landscape painter.]] 
Elbe met [[Gerda Wegener|Gerda Gottlieb]] while they were students at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in Copenhagen,&lt;ref name = art&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-movie-poster.com/Paintings/Fine_art.htm |title=Conway's Vintage Treasures |publisher=Vintage-movie-poster.com |date= |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they married in 1904 when Gottlieb was 19 and Elbe was 22.&lt;ref name = cp/&gt; They worked as illustrators, with Elbe's specializing in landscape paintings, and Gottlieb illustrated books and fashion magazines. 

They traveled through Italy and France, eventually settling in Paris in 1912, where Elbe could live openly as a woman, and Gottlieb identified as lesbian.&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt; Elbe received the Neuhausens prize in 1907 and exhibited at [[Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling]] (the Artists' Fall Exhibition), at the Vejle Art Museum, and in the Saloon and Salon d'Automme in Paris. She is represented at Vejle Art Museum in Denmark.&lt;ref name="aob"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060618025105/http://www.renaissanceblackpool.org/art.html The Arts and Transgender]. renaissanceblackpool.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbe started dressing in women's clothes after filling in for Gottlieb's absentee model; she was asked to wear stockings and heels so her legs could substitute for those of the model. Elbe felt surprisingly comfortable in the clothing and began identifying as a woman.&lt;ref name = aob/&gt; Over time, Gottlieb became famous for her paintings of beautiful women with haunting, almond-shaped eyes dressed in chic fashions. In 1913, the unsuspecting public was shocked to discover that the model who had inspired Gottlieb's depictions of ''petites femmes fatales'' was in fact Elbe.&lt;ref name = cp/&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, Elbe regularly presented as a woman, attending various festivities and entertaining guests in her house. One of the things she liked to do was disappear into the streets of Paris in the throngs of revelers during the Carnival, wearing her modeling fashions.&lt;ref name=gerda&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110152844/http://home.get2net.dk/abra-ken/Gerda.htm Gerda Wegener]. get2net.dk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/history/lilielbe.htm |title=Lili Elbe (1886–1931) |publisher=LGBT History Month |date= |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her sister when she was dressed in female attire.&lt;ref name = aj/&gt; Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.

== Surgeries and dissolution of marriage  ==
[[File:Lili Elbe by Gerda Wegener.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lili Elbe by Gerda Gottlieb]]
In 1930, Elbe went to [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] for [[sex reassignment surgery]], which was highly experimental at the time. A series of four operations were carried out over a period of two years.&lt;ref name = hist/&gt; The first surgery, [[Inguinal orchiectomy|removal of the testicles]], was made under the supervision of sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name = hist/&gt; The rest of Elbe's surgeries were carried out by [[Kurt Warnekros]], a doctor at the Dresden Municipal Women's Clinic.&lt;ref name=th&gt;Brown, Kay (1997)  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080308205659/http://www.transhistory.net/history/TH_Lili_Elbe.html Lili Elbe]. Transhistory.net.&lt;/ref&gt; The second operation was to implant an ovary onto her abdominal musculature, the third to remove the penis and the scrotum,&lt;ref name="Meyer pp. 271-281"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4yyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271 271–281]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth to transplant a uterus and construct a vaginal canal.&lt;ref name="Biography.com, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lili Elbe Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/lili-elbe-090815|website=Biography.com|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrod, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrod|first1=Horatia|title=The tragic true story behind The Danish Girl|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-danish-girl/true-story-lili-elbe-transgender/|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Elbe's last surgery, her case was already a sensation in newspapers of Denmark and Germany. A Danish court invalidated the couple's marriage in October 1930,&lt;ref name="Meyer pp. 308-311"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4yyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA308 308–311]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elbe managed to get her sex and name legally changed, including receiving a passport as Lili Ilse Elvenes. She stopped painting, believing it to be something that was part of the identity of Einar. After the dissolution of their marriage, Elbe returned to Dresden for her fourth surgery.

Elbe became the second transgender woman to undergo Gohrbandt's vaginoplasty technique in 1931, after [[Dora Richter]] underwent the same procedure.&lt;ref name="Trans Media"/&gt; Her castration and [[penectomy]] had been performed by Dr. Ludwig Levy-Lenz (1889–1966) the previous year. These preliminaries have sometimes caused confusion over the date of her reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="Trans Media"/&gt; Gohrbandt's surgery deliberately left remnants of the scrotum intact, with a view to modifying these into labia at a later date, but for reasons that are unclear, he did not perform this further procedure himself. Instead, Elvenes' case was taken over by Dr. Kurt Warnekros (1882–1949), at the Dresden Women's Clinic. Here, the [[labiaplasty]] and a subsequent surgical revision led, in the pre-antibiotic age, to Elbe's death from infection in September 1931.&lt;ref name="Trans Media"/&gt;

The book-burning at the Institute for Sexual Research by Nazi students in May 1933, the obliteration of the Dresden Women's Clinic and its records in the Allied bombing raids of February 1945, and the myth-making process itself have left gaps and inconsistencies in the Lili Elbe narrative that may never be resolved.&lt;ref name="Trans Media"/&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:Lili Elbe 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|Lili Elbe, 1930]]
Elbe began a relationship with French art dealer Claude Lejeune, whom she wanted to marry and with whom she wanted to have children.

In June 1931, Elbe had an operation which consisted of implanting a uterus and the [[Vaginoplasty|construction of a vagina]], both of which were new and experimental procedures at that time.&lt;ref name="Biography.com, 2015"/&gt; Her immune system rejected the transplanted uterus, however, and she developed an infection. She died on September 13, 1931, three months after the surgery, of cardiac arrest brought on by the infection.&lt;ref name="Biography.com, 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Week, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lili Elbe: the transgender artist behind The Danish Girl|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/65324/lili-elbe-the-transgender-artist-behind-the-danish-girl|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=This Week Magazine|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist v H.wood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrod, 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lili Elbe (Einar Wegener) 1882–1931|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/lili-elbe-einar-wegener-1882-1931/|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|language=Danish|publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbe was buried on [[Trinitatisfriedhof]] in Dresden. The grave was levelled in the 1960s. In April 2016, a new tombstone was inaugurated, financed by Focus Features, the production company of ''[[The Danish Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.queer.de/bild-des-tages.php?einzel=1485&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kay|last=Haufe|work=Sächsische Zeitung|title=Hollywood rettet Lili Elbes Grab|date=22 April 2016|language=German|url=http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/hollywood-rettet-lili-elbes-grab-3379272.html|accessdate=26 April 2016|trans-title=Hollywood saves Lili Elbe's grave}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tombstone does not record the date of Elbe's birth, just her name and places of birth and death.

==In popular culture==
The LGBT film festival [[MIX Copenhagen]] gives four "Lili" awards named after Elbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = In Competition | work = | publisher =MIX Copenhagen  | date = | url =http://mixcopenhagen.dk/en/in-competition | format = | doi = | accessdate = March 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[David Ebershoff]] wrote ''[[The Danish Girl]]'', a fictionalized account of Elbe's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/books/books-of-the-times-radical-change-and-enduring-love.html|title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Radical Change and Enduring Love|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 2000|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an international bestseller and was translated into a dozen languages. In 2015, it was made into a [[The Danish Girl (film)|film]], also called [[The Danish Girl (film)|''The Danish Girl'']], produced by [[Gail Mutrux]] and [[Neil LaBute]] and starring [[Eddie Redmayne]] as Elbe. The film was well received at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/danish-girl-standing-ovation-venice-1201516383/|title='The Danish Girl' Wows With 10-Minute Standing Ovation In Venice Premiere|publisher=''Deadline''|date=5 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been criticized for its casting of a [[cisgender]] man to play a transgender woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-danish-girl-eddie-redmayne-defends-casting-as-trans-artist-lili-elbe-and-reveals-how-much-he-10451250.html |website=[[The Independent]] |first=Jess|last=Denham |date=12 August 2015|accessdate=7 March 2016 |title=The Danish Girl: Eddie Redmayne defends casting as trans artist Lili Elbe after backlash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the novel and the film omitted topics including Gottlieb's sexuality, which is evidenced by the subjects in her erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://coilhouse.net/2012/08/the-incredibly-true-adventures-of-gerda-wegener-and-lili-elbe/|website=coilhouse.net|date=August 3, 2012|accessdate=January 26, 2016|title=The Incredibly True Adventures of Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disintegration of Gottlieb and Elbe's relationship after their annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/documents/reading-groups/145-the-danish-girl-reading-group-notes|website=allenandunwin.com|accessdate=December 10, 2015|title=Reading Group Notes The Danish Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains mass murders by single perpetrators that do not fit into the upper categories, like arson fires, poisonings, and bombings. Cases with more than one offender are not included.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

Dr. [[Prof.]] '''Muhammad Shahid Qureshi''' or '''Shahid Qureshi''', styled as Dr. '''M. Shahid Qureshi''', is a Pakistani [[astrophysicist]] and a renowned [[astronomer]]. He is an academic and an eminent [[educationist]] from Pakistan who has published articles in the fields of [[astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]]. He is the [[Professor]] of astrophysics and astronomy at [[Karachi University]] and [[Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics]] (ISPA), and also leading ISPA, the country's prominent institution in the field of [[Planetary science|planetary astrophysics and planetary astronomy]]. He previously served as an [[Assistant Professor]] of mathematics.

He is an avid supporter of science and technology in Pakistan and has helped directing documentaries concerning about the astrophysics and astronomy. He has also appeared in [[Geo TV|Geo Television]] and [[Dawn News]] frequently where he briefed the nation on [[Solar eclipse of 22 July 2009]].

==Biography==
He graduated and received a BSc with [[B.Sc. (Hons)|Honors]] in [[Applied Mathematics]] from Department of Mathematics of University of Karachi in 1979. He then received his MSc in Mathematics from the same institution with specialisation in [[Quantum mechanics]], and [[Astronomy]] in 1983. In between, he served [[United Bank Limited]], Karachi as a [[computer programmer]] to earn his living. In 1983, after getting his master's degree, he joined as a fellow the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]], where he joined the "''Mathematical Physics Group''", and did preliminary research there.

He left PINSTECH in 1984, and moved to Karachi, Sindh. He joined University of Karachi as a lecturer to fulfill his dream to become a professor of Mathematics. Under the supervision of noted quantum theorist and renowned [[particle physicist]] Dr. [[Khursheed Ather Siddiqui]], he did his MPhil in Particle physics from University of Karachi, writing a thesis and covered major area in the field of "[[Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics]]". In 2002, he moved to the Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics on the directions of the then-[[Vice-Chancellor]] of University of Karachi, Dr. [[Zafar Saeed Saifi]]. Qureshi did his PhD. in [[astrophysics]] and [[Astronomy]] from ISPA in 2008.

His doctoral thesis is on the "[[Astronomical seeing|Earliest Visibility of New Lunar Crescent]]". He has occasionally lectured in the field [[computational mathematics]] at [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] (LUMS). He was serving at the [[Institute of Business Administration, Karachi]] (IBA) as the Chaiperson, Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Faculty of Computer Science, on deputation from University of Karachi and left from his position at IBA on completion of his deputation period in March 2016.  At IBA he has not only established the department of Mathematical Sciences, he has also started the double major BS program in Mathematics and Economics, the first of its kind in Karachi. Moreover, he also played key role in developing the board of advanced studies and research at IBA that lead to formalise the graduate programs at IBA. In the mean time he also started MS and PhD programs in Mathematics at IBA.

===Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics===
Qureshi joined the teaching profession in 1984 at the University of Karachi. Later, he joined [[Institute of Business Administration, Karachi]]. For a brief period he also served the Department of Computer Science as a full-time Faculty member. Besides, he also taught as visiting faculty at various private sector Universities in Karachi including Institute of Business Administration.

He is a well-known astrophysicist in Pakistan. And, he has given numerous interviews to the media, concerning the fields of [[physical cosmology]], [[astronomy]], and [[astrophysics]]. He played an important role in re-establishing the [[KU Observatory|Karachi University's Astronomical Observatory]]. As a noted [[space scientist]] at ISPA, he is engaged in research on [[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]], [[lunar phase]], [[light pollution]] and [[solar energy]].

===Influence and motivation===
At the Karachi University, he has maintain vital relationship with the professors from Karachi University. According to him, his professors played an important role in his life and influenced him to gain his doctorate in astronomy and astrophysics. According to an interview given to the Dawn News, it was one of his professors who influenced him to gain his doctorate degrees in astronomy. He laments, "In 1990, one of my professors said that very soon Pakistan will be asking the world to send us teachers to teach mathematics and physics as we ran out of them. Today I am forwarding his message: we do not have teachers to teach mathematics and physics".

===Higher education===
In 1983, he received his MSc in [[applied mathematics]] and M.Phil. in 1995 writing his thesis on [[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]], from Karachi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was awarded his PhD. in Astrophysics and Astronomy, in which he wrote his thesis on "[[Astronomical seeing|the effects of atmospheric conditions on crescent visibility]], from the Karachi University.

==Advocacy for space research==
He has been a vocal advocate for space research in Pakistan. Qureshi has been appeared in different Pakistani news channels and educational channels in which he has been advocating for space research in Pakistan. He has also been a core planner and organizer of several astronomical and astrophysics events at universities and high schools. With the help of Karachi University's Physics department, he planned a "Space Week" in ISPA on 31 October 2008.

The event was called "Planet Watch" and a number of high school and college students were invited. He also delivered a lecture at the conference in which he urged: "You don’t need any equipment for astronomy. All you need is a pair of eyes and curiosity about the [[cosmos]]."

He also briefly explained the origins of the seven-day week denomination: "According to initial cosmology, the ancients considered the [[planet]]s to be a total of seven: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] (also considered planets). Hence, the days of the week were also seven".

He concluded the lecture with the nature of his involvement with the team at Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics, where he worked on [[astronomical object]]s, [[astrophysical plasma]], and [[physical cosmology]].

==Research in astrophysics and particle physics==
Qureshi's articles have been printed in international and national physics journals. He has been a known cited researcher in the field of computer programming while studying at Karachi University. He has been researching to the fields of astrophysics in relation with [[elementary particle physics]] and published numerous papers at ISPA. In relation to astrophysics to particle physics, he, once elaborate, while giving a lectured:

"The well-known [[grand unification theory]] had two directions of research in the 1980s and '90s. The [[Supersymmetric theory]] appeared as one of the results. The empirical predictions of which, could not be tested till today, due to the absence of laboratories. We will be able to test some predictions of the supersymmetry theory when the [[Large Hadron Collider]] functions at its full capability. [[Particle physics]] and astrophysics, along wide with astronomy, has remained to explore the nature of forces in the first place and of course which is closely related to [[cosmology]], in which we describe the structure of the universe. So the other aspect of my research was astronomy and astrophysics."

His work has been far reaching and influential. Due to lack to researches to the fields of astrophysics and astronomy; Qureshi's work has been a vital support to an academic research in astrophysics. At [[SUPARCO]], he also helped manufacturing and setting up the [[space observatory]] along with the Chinese scientists.

==Support for rocket science and Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLV)==
He has been supporting the Satellite Launch Vehicle project program at SUPARCO. He has been also urged that Pakistan should launch its satellites via either [[Sonmiani]] or [[Tilla]]. In an interview while discussing Pakistan's status on [[Satellite Launch Vehicle]] with noted [[nuclear physicist]] Dr. [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]]. While in discussion, he urged that [[missile]]s have very roboost and effective [[electronics]] and computer system, the SLVs used the similar technology. Dr. M. Shahid Qureshi also urges that Pakistan has the basic technology to build an SLV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/2008/10/20/local4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He discloses the discussion with Dr. Hoodbhoy and said "If we can launch a missile up to a range of 1,500 km, why not build an SLV that can launch [[Low Earth orbit|low-atmosphere satellites]]?" he said. According to Dr. M.S. Qureshi, "we can begin by [[remote sensing|launching navigation]], [[spy satellite|spy]] and [[weather satellite]]s, which can go up to 1,500 km into space. This alone can give us a lot of data that we need to buy now".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Margaret Behan''' is a [[Native American in the United States|Native American]] woman who is Southern Arapaho-Cheyenne on her mother's side, and Northern Arapahoe/Northern Cheyenne on her father's side.&lt;ref name = "ictmnjune2013"/&gt; and a fourth generation descendant of a survivor of the [[Sand Creek Massacre]].&lt;ref name="Harcourt-Smith"&gt;Harcourt-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; Behan is a former member of the [[International Council of 13 Grandmothers]].

==Early years==
Behan is "of the Kit Fox Clan of the [[Southern Cheyenne people|Cheyenne Nation of Oklahoma]] on her mother’s side, and on her father’s side she is half Northern Cheyenne and half [[Northern Arapahoe people|Arapahoe]] of the Rabbit Lodge."&lt;ref name = "ictmnjune2013"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behan claims that she was prayed for and a [[Peyote]] ceremony was arranged before her conception.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
Behan had 3 children, 11 grandchildren, and one great grandchild.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as an artist==
Margaret's mother-in-law, noticed how well Margaret worked on a pair of beaded moccasins and suggested that she might want to work in clay. Margaret felt so confident in her new career as an artist that she resigned from her job in 1982 and took up her new artistic career full-time. Her work is mentioned in four Folk Art books.&lt;ref name="Six Directions"&gt;Six Directions&lt;/ref&gt; She later moved to [[Taos, New Mexico]] due to the properties of the clay there.&lt;ref name="Six Directions"/&gt;

==Addiction work==
Margaret suffered from alcohol addiction as a young woman. She feels that she drank in order to 'fit in' with her friends. With the aid of addiction clinics, and more of her grandparent's ceremonies, Margaret was able to become free of her addiction.

As a result of this experience, Margaret trained to be a Licensed [[Substance abuse]] Counselor and with her traditional teachings, has led [[retreats]] for children and co-dependants of alcoholics&lt;ref&gt;Future Primitive&lt;/ref&gt; to help other First Nation people that had found themselves in a similar position. Historical trauma commonly leads to alcohol, drug, and behaviour issues.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cheyenne Elders Council==
Margaret is the founder of "The Cheyenne Elders Council", formed in 2007-2008,&lt;ref&gt;NCCS&lt;/ref&gt; with Behan as the sole member, and has the mission to, "Heal Our Own Oppression."&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Studies&lt;/ref&gt; She had moved to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, where her father was from, and "was troubled when she heard one of her people say that Cheyenne youth would have to save themselves," saying "They were not getting any kind of influence or teaching from the elders."&lt;ref name = "missoulaindependent"/&gt; "A project Behan and the Cheyenne Elders Council completed as part of the 11th council is the creation of the T’sistsistas’s Sacred School in Behan’s home.

In 2006, a chapter in the book "Grandmother's Council the World", features Behan and the [[Native American Church]], founded by her grandparents. This movement, (illegal at the time), allowed the combining of traditional ceremonies which then allowed the First Nation people's to stay connected to their traditional beliefs.  
  
In 2012, Behan hosted "the 11th Gathering of the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers ... on the [[Northern Cheyenne Reservation]] July 26 to 29," at which the riders commemorating the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]] of 1878 shared stories of their journey.&lt;ref name="Billings" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Megan "Meg" Griffin''' &lt;!-- Please see discussion re: Megan/Megatron --&gt; is a [[fictional character]] in the [[animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. Meg is the eldest child of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]] and older sister of [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], but is also the family's [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] who receives the least of their attention and bears the brunt of their abuse. She is often bullied, ridiculed, and ignored.

Meg first appeared on television, along with the rest of the [[Griffin family]], in a 15-minute [[Short film|short]] on December 20, 1998. She was created and designed by ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who was asked to pitch a pilot to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], based on [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']], two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode "[[Death Has a Shadow]]".

Originally voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] during the [[Family Guy (season 1)|first season]], Meg has been voiced by [[Mila Kunis]] since [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]].

==Personality==
Meg is a self-conscious and insecure [[adolescence|adolescent]] girl. She is treated unfairly by various people and has numerous insecurities that prompt her to try to be part of the "in-crowd", which only results in her getting rebuffed by the many bullies of this circle, particularly [[List of characters in Family Guy#Connie D'Amico|Connie D'Amico]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408574/movieconnections IMDB – Family Guy – Stew-Roids (2009) Movie Connections]&lt;/ref&gt; the head cheerleader of the local high school, James Woods Regional High School. However, a nerdy student named [[List of characters in Family Guy#Neil Goldman|Neil Goldman]] is attracted to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2DB103DF931A25754C0A9639C8B63|title=Sharing the Ratings Spoils |last=Aurthur|first=Kate|date=2005-07-12|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Meg is usually the butt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s jokes due to her unpopularity and "ugliness"; Peter resorts to outrageous stunts and names. Stewie and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] tend to disdain her kindness, but they typically do it behind Meg's back. Lois constantly puts Meg down, while boosting her own egotistical image. Lois is usually of little to no help to Meg when she is abused by others; though she is not as abusive towards Meg as Peter is. 

While Meg is usually a pushover, she can get angry if pushed too far, though such occasions are usually rare. This can be seen in the episode "[[Seahorse Seashell Party]]", where she strongly insults and defames Peter, Lois, and even Chris for their inconsiderate actions toward her. This causes Peter, Lois, and Chris to distance themselves in shame and sends Peter into [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; though she later apologizes upon realizing that the family needs a "lightning rod" to absorb the dysfunction. In the episode "[[Road to Rupert]]", Meg assaults a man for insulting her after a fender-bender. 

Many of the show's storylines about Meg involve her trying to improve her life, find a boyfriend, and reaching breaking points with her family and others who victimize her.

Out of all the members of the family, her father Peter abuses her the most, however he is shown to actually care about Meg in various episodes, such as in "[[Meg and Quagmire]]" when he goes out of his way to prevent [[Glenn Quagmire]] from having sex with her, and in "[[This Little Piggy (Family Guy)|This Little Piggy]]" where he tries to get Meg out of a [[foot fetishism]] business objectifying her for men's sexual amusement. Peter cares about Meg but is not open about it to anyone.

==Voice actors==
On the season 1 DVD commentary for the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "[[Hot Tub (Drawn Together episode)|Hot Tub]]", [[Cree Summer]] claims she was offered the role to play Meg but was dismissed by the producers. Meg was voiced by an uncredited [[Lacey Chabert]] for the first season, and by [[Mila Kunis]] in subsequent seasons after Chabert became busy with school and appearing on ''[[Party of Five]]'' at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sonicretro.org/Lacey_Chabert_interview_by_GameSpy_%28October_6,_2006%29 Lacey Chabert interview by GameSpy (October 6, 2006) - Sonic Retro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; although some of her work became second season episodes due to production order. Mila Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on ''[[That '70s Show]]''.&lt;ref name="MTR 7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OS3zGMcbrM |title=Family Guy&amp;nbsp;– Casting Mila Kunis |work=The Paley Center for Media |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak more slowly, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more.

==Social life==
Meg is very unpopular in high school due to both her plain appearance and personality. She desperately tries to be part of the cool crowd, but is usually coldly rebuffed. Because of her eagerness for acceptance, she has been recruited "unknowingly" into a [[suicide|suicidal]] religious cult,&lt;ref name="s01e03"&gt;{{cite episode

Meg is so unpopular at school that one student fires a nail gun into his own stomach twice (in [[shop class]]) in order to avoid a date with her, and then in a later episode [[Fratricide|shoots his own brother]] as an excuse not to go to a dance with her the following night. In "[[Don't Make Me Over (Family Guy)|Don't Make Me Over]]", Lois is looking for new clothes for Meg, but with no luck; a saleswoman ends up pouring gasoline on herself, lighting a match, catching fire, and then jumping out of a window after looking at Meg in a pair of jeans. However, she is sought by nerd [[List of characters in Family Guy#The Goldmans|Neil Goldman]]. In "[[8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter]]", Neil starts dating a girl named Cecilia, Meg becomes instantly jealous and pretends to date Jake Tucker to make him jealous. This leads to her signing a contract to become Neil's girlfriend and (not knowing at first) his slave, but she gets him to tear up the contract after Lois seduces him. Perverted neighbor [[Glenn Quagmire]] has shown a repeated interest in her, mostly due to his very low standards, asking if she has reached the [[age of consent]]. Quagmire comes close to succeeding in "Meg and Quagmire" when Lois tells Peter to back off after he was ruining Meg and Quagmire's 'dates'. Then, they rescue Meg after Glenn takes her to his cabin, Peter and Lois arriving in time before anything happens.&lt;ref name="s03e01"&gt;{{cite episode

In the episode "[[Brian Sings and Swings]]", a [[lesbianism|lesbian]] student named Sarah invites Meg to join in her Lesbian Alliance Club, with Meg not knowing at first what kind of club it was. Desperate to fit in, she pretends to be a lesbian and also pretends to be attracted to Sarah and even goes so far as to kiss her to prove it. At the end of the episode, Meg goes over to Sarah's house to admit she lied about being a lesbian (Sarah thought that Meg came over to have sex and even undresses when Meg is telling her that she lied), much to Glenn's (who was hiding in Sarah's closet) disappointment. She also used to have a crush on anchorman Tom Tucker, but it ended after she discovered his vanity and selfishness.

In other episodes, she is portrayed as chronically incapable of finding a boyfriend. For her [[Prom|Junior Prom]] she accepts a pity date from [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], the family dog and only after threatening [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="s05e08"&gt;{{cite episode

Earlier in season 2, she dated Joe Swanson's son Kevin Swanson, but in "[[Stew-Roids]]" it is mentioned that Kevin died in Iraq. In the episode, "[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]", she dates a boy named Doug, but he breaks up with her when he sees her naked right before almost having sex. In the episode "[[Peter's Daughter]]", Meg falls in love with a medical student named Michael Milano after coming out of a short coma (caused by Peter when he asked her to "rescue" beer and make him a sandwich out of an already flooded kitchen) and they start to date. After he breaks up with Meg (because of Peter being overprotective of her after promising that if she came out of the coma, he would "treat her like a princess"), she announces that she is pregnant by Michael and the two get engaged. After finding out that she is not actually pregnant, Meg tells Michael the truth hoping that he will stay, however, Michael quickly leaves Meg at the altar. In the episode "[[Dial Meg for Murder]]", she is dating a convict, while in the episode "[[Go, Stewie, Go!]]" she dates an attractive young man named Anthony, who is absolutely normal (much to the surprise of many of the other characters). They were so shocked that they had to do tests just to see if he was completely normal which annoyed Meg. It is presumed that she broke up with him after he and Lois had an affair. Meg also shows extremely possessive behavior when she encounters someone she believes she has a romantic connection with such as kidnapping Brian and detaining Bonnie Swanson at the airport by planting a gun in her purse.

Overall, Meg has shown romantic interest in and dated several men throughout the series. However, there have been several instances in which she has shown hints of being [[bisexuality|bisexual]] or a [[lesbianism|lesbian]]: examples of this include "[[Brian Sings and Swings]]", "[[Stew-Roids]]", and "[[Dial Meg for Murder]]".

In November 2016, when asked by [[Splitsider]] if the writers will further develop the characters of Chris and Meg in future episodes, [[showrunner]] [[Alec Sulkin]] confirmed that the series crew members are working on doing so and added that there are plans for an episode where Meg comes out as a [[Lesbianism|lesbian]], taking inspiration from previous instances in which she exhibited signs of lesbian characteristics, like when she joins a lesbian alliance group at school in "Brian Sings and Swings" and is identified as a "[[transgender]] man" named "Ron" in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', the latter which takes place in the future. However, Sulkin also noted that the plotline has not yet been finalized and thus isn't officially set to be used in an episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/family-guys-meg-griffin-come-9344983 |title=Family Guy's Meg Griffin 'to come out as lesbian' ... but will she still go on to become transgender man Ron? |last=Newman |first=Vicki |date=November 27, 2016 |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/11/meg-griffin-family-guy-come-lesbian/ |title=Is Meg Griffin of 'Family Guy' About to Come Out as a Lesbian? |last=Ennis |first=Dawn |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |publisher=LGBTQ Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
In the first three seasons of the show, Meg was portrayed with a more whiny and uptight personality who was often embarrassed by the family’s acts of bumbling and stupidity, though they cared for her and meant well. In the post-cancellation seasons, this began to change as the inadvertent embarrassment became deliberate bullying and disrespect. Additionally, the show started to flesh out the characters to the point where it appears that most of the population of Quahog who knows her, or even just meets her, picks on or disdains her for no reason other than her simply being "Meg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IGN|date=May 27, 2009|author=|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p5.html|title= IGN's Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basically means that she is a victim of circumstance, as Meg is normally docile and well-behaved and never seems to do anything mean or inconsiderate. In an interview, Mila Kunis stated: "Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 16-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in perpetual mode of humiliation, and it's fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/milas-kunis-talks-about-workin-11435.aspx |title=Mila Kunis Talks About Working on ''Family Guy'' and Her Upcoming Movie |work=BuddyTV |last=De Leon |first=Kris |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Meg is, in reality, the least obnoxious or self-involved of the family, she is also the least respected and most misunderstood, often shown by people avoiding her company, disparaging her in person, gathering in her bedroom to read her diary for laughs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

Occasionally, when Meg asks a question to Peter or just speaks when he is in the room, Peter responds by saying "Shut up, Meg", which is immediately followed by a line from another character.

When the family tries an anger management technique of writing letters and not sending them, Meg finds Peter's letter to her, which says, "Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat." &lt;ref name="s03e07"&gt;{{cite episode

In the episode "[[Stewie Kills Lois]]", Peter tells guests on a cruise ship about how he and Lois had gone to get an [[abortion]] but decided against it when they arrived at the clinic and found out the abortionist had one hand. He then says "two and a half months later, our daughter Meg was born" – indicating that they had tried to abort her when Lois was already over six months pregnant. Another hint to this is when Meg is in the car with Lois and at an attempt to make civilized conversation, says, "Hey Meg, did you know that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? 'Cause no one told me! I just thought you should know" and laughs awkwardly.

Chris, however, has more of a typical brother-sister relationship with Meg, with Chris telling those who condemn her that it is never her fault. Chris, at one point, threatened to quit his job at the local mini-mart if his boss didn't re-hire Meg (at the insistence of Lois).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

Apparently, a [[double standard]] also exists against Meg, further underscoring the mistreatment she suffers from the people around her. In "[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]", an episode wherein Peter loses his memory, as he reacquaints himself with the pleasures of [[sex]], Lois tells him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his own children; in response, Meg attempts an incest joke.

That's your mother!", ignoring the fact that Chris said the same thing first. Meg responded by saying "I was only trying to fit in!" Peter immediately kicked her out of the house. Later, during an unrelated conversation, when she tried to insight Peter on how Lois' behavior from modeling made a poor example for women, he said "Meg, who let you back in the house?"

Brian's attention initially softens the lack of respect from Peter and the rest of family; he admits that he cares for Meg when she goes out with Mayor Adam West. While initially seeming to have more common decency for Meg than most people, this appears to almost completely disappear after the tenth season, as Brian's increasingly shallow and self-centered character begins to take more pleasure and joy in being rotten to Meg and often refuses to give her the time of day, such as desperately trying to avoid having to comfort her&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Meg's most complicated relationship among the family members after Peter would be with her mother Lois. Although not as abusive as Peter, Lois seldom (if ever) reprimands her husband for their treatment of their daughter and tends to be rather thoughtless of Meg herself, often putting her down for her lack of social achievement or social popularity. Throughout the series, Lois can best be described as a general [[foil (literature)|foil]] to her daughter, being more rebellious, outgoing, and spunky compared to her daughter's own uptight demeanor and easily-embarrassed or discouraged personality. Before the more recent seasons of the series, Lois has also often shown sympathy for Meg and tried to boost her confidence in terms of teenage social matters. Occasionally however, such occasions resulted in the former getting carried away and stealing the show, for example, taking her to Spring Break at the beach, only for her former younger wild side to kick in and completely exclude Meg from the excitement. Lois would very often comfort Meg when she is down; however, she gives up one attempt after 45 minutes and gives her a [[Sylvia Plath]] novel and a bottle of [[Zolpidem|Ambien]], and with a "Whatever happens, happens", leaves Meg to her misery.&lt;ref name="s05e03" /&gt;
One of the most cruel examples of the family's lack of humanity or gratitude for Meg comes in the episode "[[You Can't Do That On Television, Peter]]". When Peter is mauled by a [[Cougar|puma]], Meg uses medical training to save his life. However, no one thanks her afterward and when she tries to point it out, Peter just tells her to get him water.

The family's treatment of Meg finally reaches her limit in "[[Dial Meg for Murder]]" when Meg emerges from a short stint in a Young Offenders Institution as a hardened criminal, abusing her family and beating up anyone who makes fun of her. It is only after a conversation with Brian that she changes her ways. However, it comes to a head once again in "[[Seahorse Seashell Party]]", when Meg finally grows tired of her mistreatment and lashes out against Lois and Peter, informing them of their own flaws. Lois condescendingly tells Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else invoking Meg to bring up her mother's delinquent past. Meg tells her that she is far from the perfect parent, harshly berates her for constantly and ruthlessly pointing out Meg's shortcomings. Lois tries to justify that she's a better person because of her past and she is open that she isn't the perfect parent, but Meg tells her that she's the farthest thing from and states how she has neglected to guide her through life and navigate her through the hardships and difficulties of being a young woman. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18, she may never want to see her again. This breaks Lois' heart and she finally admits that she's been a terrible mother to Meg. Finally, Meg turns on [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing, even when she points out Peter's destructive tendencies and that he would go to jail if someone could witness his negative treatment towards her. It dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a "waste of a man." A disillusioned Peter asks Lois to tell Meg to "knock it off", but Lois refuses because he didn't stick up for her. Within moments, Peter turns his abusive criticisms and insults on Chris and Lois. Peter finally runs to his room crying, with Lois running after him, leaving behind Meg and Brian, who is now fully recovered from his trip, to discuss what just happened. Brian likes that Meg stood up for herself, but she sadly tells him that even though she meant every word, seeing Peter turn on everyone like wolves has made her think that it is ultimately her non-ideal role to serve as the Griffins' "lightning rod that absorbs all the dysfunction". He commends her on her maturity, and even goes on to say that Meg is the "strongest person" in the family. She soon apologizes to the others and says that she is actually the one at fault.

Since this episode, the abuse that Meg receives begins to fade away as a storyline. She also notices that Peter's pro wrestler sister Karen treats Peter exactly the way Peter treats her, and they bond over this with a plan to embarrass Karen at a wrestling show—which goes awry when Meg hits her with a metal folding chair instead of a breakaway one and injures Karen to the point where she ends up in a coma and (as it is implied) possibly will die from her injuries without a blood transfusion.

==Early life and education==
Rohrer was born in 1980 in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="lgbtran-rohrer" /&gt; In 1998, they graduated from high school and enrolled in [[Augustana University]] to study religion.&lt;ref name="lgbtran-rohrer" /&gt; In college they came out as a [[lesbian]], and became president of the Gay-Straight Alliance. They encountered resistance, threats, and attempted "cures" by fellow students for their sexuality.&lt;ref name="lgbtran-rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kalw-10may2016" /&gt; Rohrer graduated from Augustana in 2001.&lt;ref name="lgbtran-rohrer" /&gt;

Rohrer moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 2002 to continue their studies. By this time they had come to identify as transgender.&lt;ref name="kalw-10may2016" /&gt;  Rohrer attended [[Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary]] and [[Pacific School of Religion]] in [[Berkeley, California]], earning a [[Master of Divinity]] from PSR in 2005 and a [[Doctor of Ministry]]  in 2016.&lt;ref name="psr-alum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://psr.edu/2016-doctor-of-ministry-dissertations/ |title=Doctor of Ministry Dissertations |author=Pacific School of Religion |date=n.d. |access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrer was ordained in 2006, becoming the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.&lt;ref name="lgbtran-rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elm-rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kalw-10may2016" /&gt;

==Career==
In 2010, Rohrer and six other Bay Area gay and transgender pastors were reinstated into the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], after the national assembly voted to allow partnered gay people to serve as clergy. The pastors' churches had previously been banned from the denomination for ordaining gay and lesbian ministers who refused to take vows of [[celibacy]].&lt;ref name="sfgate-26jul2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez-Cabrera|first1=Alejandro|title=Gay and transgender Lutheran pastors reinstated|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Gay-and-transgender-Lutheran-pastors-reinstated-3258017.php|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rohrer was installed as pastor of Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="kalw-10may2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebar-27feb2014" /&gt;

In 2017, Rohrer was hired by the [[San Francisco Police Department]] as their first [[police chaplain|chaplain]] from the [[LGBTQ]] community.&lt;ref name="nbc-17jan2017" /&gt;

==Activism==
Rohrer has helped the [[homeless]] in San Francisco, serving as Executive Director of the Welcome ministry to the homeless and hungry, leading the Singers of the Street choir, distributing sandwiches, and participating in a night ministry with other local pastors.&lt;ref name="elm-rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebar-27feb2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hood-20may2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Downing|first1=Shane|title=Faith-Based Meetup Distributes PB&amp;Js To The Castro's Hungry|url=http://hoodline.com/2016/05/faith-based-meetup-distributes-pb-js-to-the-castro-s-hungry|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=Hoodline|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate-9oct2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fagan|first1=Kegin|title=Transgender pastor preaches to the choir with love|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Transgender-pastor-preaches-to-the-choir-with-love-9956967.php|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrer has also helped to grow and distribute thousands of pounds of free food from [[community gardens]].&lt;ref name="elm-rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psr-alum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni/ae|url=https://psr.edu/about/oia/distinguished-alumniae/|website=[[Pacific School of Religion]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Rohrer started a fundraiser to raise bail for Meagan Taylor, a black [[trans woman]] who was held in isolation in an [[Iowa]] jail.&lt;ref name="advocate-20jul2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ennis|first1=Dawn|title=Minister Raises $2,000 Bail for Black Woman 'Arrested While Trans'|url=http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/07/20/minister-raises-2000-bail-black-woman-arrested-while-trans|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[2016 Oakland warehouse fire]], in which at least three transgender people were killed, Rohrer was called upon by the city of [[Oakland]] to provide support and assistance to the community.&lt;ref name="abc-6dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melendez|first1=Lyanne|title=Heartbreak in LGBT community for lives lost in Oakland Ghost Ship fire|url=http://abc7news.com/news/heartbreak-in-lgbt-community-for-lives-lost-in-ghost-ship-fire/1643316/|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[ABC San Francisco]]|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrer has advocated for trans people who would be impacted by proposed "[[bathroom bills]]" that seek to restrict restroom usage based on [[sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]].&lt;ref name="abcfox-30mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Joshua|title=Trans pastor visits Missoula amid "bathroom bill" news|url=http://www.abcfoxmontana.com/story/35038658/trans-pastor-visits-missoula-amid-bathroom-bill-news|accessdate=June 14, 2017|newspaper=ABC Fox Montana|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ursula Southeil''' (c. 1488&amp;ndash;1561) (also variously spelt as '''Ursula Southill''', '''Ursula Soothtell'''&lt;ref&gt;''The Strange and Wonderful History of Mother Shipton'', London, 1686&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Ursula Sontheil'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historyandwomen.com/2010/05/ursula-sontheil-1488-1561.html |title=Ursula Sontheil (1488-1561) |publisher=History and Women |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Prophecies-SONTHEIL-SHIPTON-Knaresborough-Yorkshire/dp/B0019QPMNE |title=The Life and Prophecies of URSULA SONTHEIL Better Known as MOTHER SHIPTON . Knaresborough, Yorkshire: Amazon.co.uk: J.C. Simpson: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date=2 January 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), better known as '''Mother Shipton''', is said to have been an [[English people|English]] [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]] and [[prophecy|prophetess]]. The first publication of her prophecies, which did not appear until 1641, eighty years after her reported death, contained a number of mainly regional predictions, but only two prophetic verses &amp;ndash; neither of which foretold the End of the World, despite widespread assumptions to that effect.&lt;ref name="Mother Shipton's Prophecies 1989"&gt;''Mother Shipton's Prophecies'' (Mann, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable editions of her prophecies was published in 1684.&lt;ref name="Mother Shipton's Prophecies 1989"/&gt; It states that she was born in [[Knaresborough]], [[Yorkshire]], in a cave now known as [[Mother Shipton's Cave]] which, along with the [[Petrifying well|Petrifying Well]] and associated parkland, is operated as a visitor attraction. She was reputed to be hideously ugly. The book also claims that she married Toby Shipton, a local carpenter, near [[York]] in 1512 and told fortunes and made predictions throughout her life.

It is recorded in the diaries of [[Samuel Pepys]] that whilst surveying the damage to [[London]] caused by the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in the company of the [[Royal Family]] they were heard to discuss Mother Shipton's prophecy of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 20 October 1666, cited in ''Mother Shipton's Prophecies'' (Mann, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophecies==
[[File:Mother Shipton's House.png|thumb|200px|Mother Shipton's house]]
The most famous claimed edition of Mother Shipton's prophecies foretells many modern events and phenomena. Widely quoted today as if it were the original, it contains over a hundred prophetic rhymed couplets in notably non-16th-century language and includes the now-famous lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''The world to an end shall come''
''In eighteen hundred and eighty one.''&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=William Henry|title=Mother Shipton investigated. The result of critical examination in the British Museum Library, of the literature relating to the Yorkshire sibyl|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mother_Shipton_investigated&lt;!--[not given in source:] |publisher=The Spiritualist magazine --&gt;|location=London|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this version did not appear in print until 1862, and its true author, one Charles Hindley, subsequently admitted in print that he had invented it.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes and Queries'', 26 April 1873&lt;/ref&gt;
This invented prophecy has appeared over the years with different dates and in (or about) several countries (for example in the late 1970s many news articles about Mother Shipton appeared setting the date at 1981{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}). The 1920s (subsequently much reprinted) booklet ''The Life and Prophecies of Ursula Sontheil better known as Mother Shipton''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+Life+and+Prophecies+of+URSULA+SONTHEIL+Better+Known+as+MOTHER+SHIPTON&amp;x=12&amp;y=17 |title=The Life and Prophecies of URSULA SONTHEIL Better Known as MOTHER SHIPTON: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated the date as 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0019QPMNE|title=The Life and Prophecies of URSULA SONTHEIL Better Known as MOTHER SHIPTON .|first=J. C.|last=Simpson|date=24 August 2017|publisher=The Waverley Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/end_wrl12.htm |title=12 failed end of the world predictions, for 1990 to 1994 |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date=3 November 1993 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among other well-known lines from Hindley's fake version (often quoted as if they were original) are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''A Carriage without a horse shall go;
''Disaster fill the world with woe...
''In water iron then shall float,
''As easy as a wooden boat.''&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:MotherShiptonMoth.jpg|thumb|Mother Shipton moth]]
Quite who Mother Shipton was or what exactly she said is not definitively known. What is certain is that her name became linked with many tragic events and strange goings-on recorded all over the UK, Australia, and North America throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Many fortune tellers used her effigy and statue, presumably for purposes of association marketing. Many pubs were named after her. Only two survive, one near her birthplace in [[Knaresborough]] and the other in [[Portsmouth]], where there is a statue of her above the door.

A caricature of Mother Shipton was used in early [[pantomime]] and is believed by historians to be the forerunner of the [[Pantomime dame|Panto dame]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

The Mother Shipton [[Moth]] (''[[Callistege mi]]'') is named after her. Each [[External morphology of Lepidoptera#Colour|wing's pattern]] resembles a hag's head in profile.

A fundraising campaign was started in 2013 with the goal of raising £35,000 to erect a statue of Shipton in Knaresborough. Completed in October 2017, the statue sits on a bench in the town's Market Square close to a statue of 18th century road engineer John Metcalfe, known as Blind Jack.&lt;ref name="Campaign"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-24361476 | title=Knaresborough campaign for Mother Shipton statue | work=[[BBC News]] | date=3 October 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neil Newhouse''' is a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies, a political survey and [[opinion poll|polling]] firm, and was the lead pollster for the unsuccessful presidential campaigns of both [[John McCain]] and [[Mitt Romney]] against [[Barack Obama]].

== Early life and education ==
Newhouse grew up in [[Shawnee Mission, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="NYT Harwood" /&gt; He graduated from [[Duke University]] in 1974&lt;ref name="Duke Harwood" /&gt; and attended graduate school at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="SHRM" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1991 he founded the polling company [[Public Opinion Strategies]] with [[Bill McInturff]] and Glen Bolger, one of the biggest polling firms in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics.&lt;ref name="NYT Harwood" /&gt; He was previously executive vice president at the [[Wirthlin Group]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2016" /&gt;

In 1993, Newhouse, who specializes in health-care analysis, worked on creating the [[Harry and Louise]] adverts funded by the [[Health Insurance Association of America]] to attack President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2016" /&gt; He was later a senior advisor to [[Bob Dole]]'s campaign in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Republican primaries]] ahead of Clinton's [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 election]], but was fired after Dole lost [[New Hampshire]] to [[Pat Buchanan]], though Newhouses's polling had in that instance been accurate.{{sfn|Johnson|2016|p=401}}

He was lead pollster for [[John McCain]]'s unsuccessful [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2016" /&gt;

In 2012, he was again the lead pollster for a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[presidential nominee]], this time [[Mitt Romney]], whose [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|presidential campaign]] was, like McCain's, against Barack Obama.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2016" /&gt; His polls predicted that Romney would win the election, which proved not to be the case. Newhouse put those errors down, in part, to faulty demographic models of likely turnout, an over-emphasis on measures of voter enthusiasm, and relying on [[random digit dialing]] rather than lists of registered voters.&lt;ref name="NYT Harwood" /&gt; 

Responding to criticism of the factual accuracy of a series of [[attack ad]]s on welfare policy during the campaign,&lt;ref name="HuffPo Stein" /&gt;  Newhouse commented to reporters that "We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers", at a panel organised by [[NBC News]] at the [[Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel" /&gt; The comments drew direct criticism from Obama.&lt;ref name="HuffPo Jeltson" /&gt; In a 2016 interview with the ''Duke Political Review'' he said "What I meant by that was that every ad we did in the Romney campaign was fact-checked internally ... what I meant was that I wasn't going to let those independent newspaper guys dictate how we’re going to run the strategy of our campaign".&lt;ref name="Duke interview" /&gt; A one-letter [[typo]] of his was the subject of several articles when he spelled '[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]', 'Regan' in one slide of a [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation. The error came the week after the Romney campaign's "With Mitt" iPhone app had spelled "America" as "Amercia".&lt;ref name="HuffPo typo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph typo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Star typo" /&gt;

For the [[United States Senate elections, 2014|2014 Senate elections]], he was an adviser to the Republican campaigns in Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="NYT Harwood" /&gt;

== Awards ==
The [[American Association of Political Consultants]] (AAPC) has named Newhouse their Pollster of the Year three times, together or jointly. In 2003, the award went to Public Opinion Strategies for its work in the [[United States elections, 2002|2002 elections]].&lt;ref name="Duke Harwood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPC 2003" /&gt; In 2010, he and Glen Bolger split the award, as the Pollster Team of the Year. Newhouse's win was for his work on [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]'s successful run for senator in a [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|special election in Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPC 2010" /&gt; In 2016 he won for his work on the campaign against the legalization of [[cannabis in Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AAPC 2016" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Newhouse has a wife, Mary, and two children, with whom he lives in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="NYT Harwood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SHRM" /&gt;

'''Nigel Smart''' is a professor at [[COSIC]] at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. He is also associated with the [[Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol|Department of Computer Science]] at the [[University of Bristol]]. He is a cryptographer with expertise in the theory of cryptography and its application in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{DBLP |name=Nigel P. Smart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google Scholar id |name=Nigel Smart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Smart received a [[BSc degree]] in [[mathematics]] from the [[University of Reading]] in 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} He then obtained his [[PhD degree]]{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} from the [[University of Kent]] at [[Canterbury]] in 1992; his thesis was titled ''The Computer Solutions of Diophantine Equations''.

==Career==
Smart proceeded to work as a [[research fellow]] at the University of Kent, the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], and [[Cardiff University]] until 1995.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} From 1995 to 1997, he was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Kent, and then spent three years in industry at [[Hewlett-Packard]] from 1997 to 2000. From 2000 to 2017 he was at the University of Bristol, where he founded the cryptology research group. From 2018 he has been based in the COSIC group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

Smart held a [[Royal Society]] Wolfson Merit Award (2008–2013), and two [[European Research Council|ERC]] Advanced Grant (2011–2016 and 2016-2021). He was a director of the [[International Association for Cryptologic Research]] (2012–2014), and was elected Vice President for the period 2014-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iacr.org/elections/2013/ |title=IACR Election 2013 - List of Candidates and Propositions |publisher=Iacr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he was named as a Fellow of the IACR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iacr.org/fellows/2016/ |title=IACR Fellows 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Prof. Smart is best known for his work in [[elliptic curve cryptography]], especially work on the [[ECDLP]].&lt;ref&gt;S. D. Galbraith and N. P. Smart, ''A cryptographic application of the Weil descent,'' Cryptography and Coding, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gaudry, F. Hess, and N. P. Smart, [http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2000/HPL-2000-10.pdf Constructive and destructive facets of Weil descent on elliptic curves], Hewlett Packard Laboratories Technical Report, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Smart, ''The discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves of trace one,'' Journal of Cryptology, Volume 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked on [[pairing-based cryptography]] contributing a number of algorithms such as the [[SK-KEM]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbosa et. al, [http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/IBC/submissions/Barbosa-SK-KEM-2006-06.pdf SK-KEM: An Identity-Based KEM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ate-pairing&lt;ref&gt;F. Hess, N. Smart, F. Vercauteren. The Eta-pairing revisited. In IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 52(10), p. 4595-4602, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart carries out research on a wide variety of topics in cryptography. He has been instrumental in the effort to make secure multiparty computation practical. A few of his works in this direction include.&lt;ref&gt;B. Pinkas, T. Schneider, N. P. Smart and S. C. Williams. ''Secure two-party computation is practical,'' ASIACRYPT 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Damgard, V. Pastro, N. P. Smart, and S. Zakarias. ''Multiparty computation from somewhat homomorphic encryption,'' CRYPTO 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Damgard, M. Keller, E. Larraia, C. Miles and N. P. Smart. ''Implementing AES via an Actively/Covertly Secure Dishonest-Majority MPC Protocol,'' SCN 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His work with Gentry and Halevi on performing the first large calculation using Fully Homomomorphic Encryption&lt;ref&gt;C. Gentry, S. Halevi and N. P. Smart. ''Homomorphic Evaluation of the AES Circuit'' CRYPTO 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; won the [[IBM]] ''[[Pat Goldberg]] Best Paper Award'' for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5434 |title=Pat Goldberg Memorial 2012 Best Papers in CS, EE and Math - IBM |publisher=Researcher.watson.ibm.com |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his three years at [[HP Laboratories]], Smart was a founder of the startup [[Identum]] specialising in pairing based cryptography and identity based encryption. This was bought by [[Trend Micro]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/news/trend-micro-buys-into-encryption-with-identum-purchase-573095/ |title=Trend Micro buys into encryption with Identum purchase &amp;#124; News |publisher=Geek.com |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he formed, with [[Yehuda Lindell]], Unbound Tech (formally called Dyadic Security), a company focusing on deploying distributed cryptographic solutions based on multi-party computations. He is also the co-founder, along with [[Kenny Paterson]], of the Real World Cryptography conference series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rwc.iacr.org/ |title=Real World Crypto Symposium |date=2018-01-01 |accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, there was a group of ethnic Chinese called the '''[[Hoa people|Chinese Nùng]]''' ''([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Hoa Nùng or Tàu Nùng)''. These Chinese Nùng composed 72%{{sfn|Trần Đức Lai|2013|p = 42}}  to 78%{{sfn|Xiaorong Han|2009|p = 1–36}}of the population of the [[Nung Autonomous Territory of Hai Ninh]] (1947-1954) located in the [[Northeast (Vietnam)|northeast corner of Vietnam]], covering parts of present-day [[Quảng Ninh Province|Quảng Ninh]] and [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]] provinces. The Chinese Nùng's name originated from the fact that almost all of them were farmers (''nong nhan'' in [[Cantonese]]).{{sfn|Trần Đức Lai|2013|p = 3}} After [[Treaty of Tientsin (1885)]], the French refused to recognize this group as Chinese due to political and territorial issues on Vietnam's northern frontier border, therefore the French classified them as Nùng based on their main occupation. The most widely used languages of the Chinese Nùng were [[Ngái people|Ngai]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[San Diu people|San Diu]]{{sfn|Trần Đức Lai|2013|p = 7}} as they descended from people speaking these dialects. After 1954, more than 50,000 Nùng led by Colonel [[Vong A Sang]] (or Swong A Sang) fled as refugees, [[Operation Passage to Freedom|joining the 1 million northern Vietnamese who fled south]] and resettled in [[South Vietnam]]. During the Vietnam War, the Chinese Nung soldiers were best known for their loyalty to [[US Special Forces]]&lt;ref name="IVKim2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William H. Mott IV|author2=Jae Chang Kim|title=The Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture: Shih Vs.

After the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975, many of the Nungs fled Vietnam as [[Vietnamese boat people|Boat People]] political refugees, many to Hong Kong's and Malaysia's refugee camps. Most were resettled in the US, Canada, France, Australia, Singapore etc.

'''Perivaldo Lúcio Dantas''' (12 July 1953 – 27 July 2017), known simply as '''Perivaldo''', was a Brazilian [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]].

==Football career==
Born in [[Itabuna]], [[Bahia]], Perivaldo started his career with local amateurs [[Itabuna Esporte Clube]]. In [[1975 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1975]] he moved straight to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] where he would remain until his retirement, starting with [[Esporte Clube Bahia]].

In his country's top flight Perivaldo also represented [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas]], [[São Paulo FC]], [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gionioalviverde.blogspot.pt/2009/04/perivaldo-expulsao-mais-rapida-da.html|title=Perivaldo – A expulsão mais rápida da história do futebol|trans-title=Perivaldo – Football's fastest sending off|publisher=Gionio Alviverde|language=Portuguese|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangu Atlético Clube]]. He scored seven goals for the first in only 13 appearances in the [[1982 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1982 season]], helping it finish in 18th position amongst 44 teams.

Perivaldo earned two [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the late 80s, after living three years in [[South Korea]], he relocated to [[Portugal]] in hopes of finding a new club, but eventual poor choices and several misfortunes ended up with him as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] person having to resort to [[Hawker (trade)|street vending]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/futebol-internacional/interior/ex-internacional-do-brasil-e-sem-abrigo-em-portugal-3542505.html|title=Ex-internacional do Brasil é sem-abrigo em Portugal|trans-title=Former Brazil international is homeless in Portugal|newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]]|language=Portuguese|date=20 November 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/selecao-brasileira/noticia/2013/11/em-lisboa-solitario-perivaldo-assume-os-erros-foi-morte-do-artista.html|title=Em Lisboa, solitário, Perivaldo assume os erros: 'Foi a morte do artista'|trans-title=In Lisbon, alone, Perivaldo admits mistakes: 'It was the swan song'|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]|language=Portuguese|date=20 November 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=446247|title=Perivaldo deixa Feira da Ladra e vai regressar ao Brasil|trans-title=Perivaldo leaves flea market and will return to Brasil|newspaper=[[A Bola]]|language=Portuguese|date=10 December 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perivaldo returned to his homeland on 11 December 2013 at the age of 60, with the help of the Portuguese Professional Footballers Union. He had been subjected to a three-week follow-up by Portuguese TV channel [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação|SIC]], and that and posterior footage resulted in the making of a documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancenet.com.br/botafogo/Brasil-ex-lateral-Perivaldo-contada-filme_0_1045695560.html|title=De volta ao Brasil, ex-lateral Perivaldo terá sua vida contada em filme|trans-title=Back to Brazil, former fullback Perivaldo will have life told in movie|newspaper=[[Lance!]]|language=Portuguese|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

'''Robert Hillberg''' (August 27, 1917 – August 12, 2012) was a firearm designer and the head of Research &amp; Development at the [[High Standard Manufacturing Company]]. His designs included the folding shotgun stock, the [[Whitney Wolverine]], the [[Wildey|Wildey .45 gas-operated pistol]], and the four-shot [[COP 357 Derringer]].&lt;ref name="gundigest2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shideler|first=Dan|title=Gun Digest 2011|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1-4402-1337-3|page=91|quote=Robert L. Hillberg... is a national treasure, being one of the few surviving masters of post-WWII American firearms design|location = Iola, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillberg developed a variety of [[insurgency weapon]]s, primarily [[Multiple barrel firearm#Shotgun|multiple barrel shotgun]]s, which could be covertly distributed to partisan forces fighting in the United States' national interests.&lt;ref name="Houze2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houze|first=Herb|title=Winchester Repeating Arms Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeeiAgToOq4C&amp;pg=PA312|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2725-X|pages=309–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gun Digest]] editors have described Hillberg as a "national treasure."&lt;ref name="gundigest2011"/&gt;

==History==
Born in Anamosa, Iowa on August 27, 1917, as a boy Robert L. Hillberg accompanied his father, Carl Walter Hillberg,&lt;ref name=rep-am/&gt; on hunting trips in Minnesota and South Dakota. Although Hillberg did attend the University of Minnesota for several years, he was not formally trained in firearms design.&lt;ref name=oldestname/&gt; He demonstrated a working prototype [[.357 Magnum]] submachine gun of his own design to [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt Firearms]] located in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] in 1938. Colt did not buy the gun, but they did offer Hillberg a job. In 1940 Hillberg accepted employment in the engineering department of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] Aircraft, in [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]], where he designed engine components.&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite news|last1=Card|first1=James|title=Robert Hillberg, 1917-2012|url=http://www.gundigest.com/vintage-gun-history-articles/robert-hillberg-1917-2012|accessdate=19 June 2014|work=Gun Digest|publisher=F+W Media|date=4 September 2012|quote=History will surely remember Robert L. Hillberg as one of the foremost firearms designers of the 20th century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillberg moved to Burlington, Vermont in 1942 to work as a project engineer for [[Bell Aircraft]]'s ordinance division. In addition to aircraft projects (including the [[B-17]]) Hillberg completed a [[Hillberg Carbine|prototype .30 caliber carbine]] at Bell, which had been started at Pratt &amp; Whitney. After the war, in 1947, he was placed in charge of [[Republic Aviation]]'s armament division, in [[Farmingdale, New York]]. He worked on adapting weapons designed for use on the ground to aircraft, such as the [[F-84 Thunderjet]] as well as [[Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor|F-91]] prototypes, with all the challenges inherent in that problem. While at Republic Hillberg designed several automatic pistols, including for the first time in the gun industry solving the problem of having interchangeable barrels for multiple calibers in the same gun.&lt;ref name=Card/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldestname&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Oldest Name in Guns Comes Back|journal=Guns Magazine|date=August 1956|pages=24–27, 66–69|url=http://www.gunsmagazine.com/1956issues/G0856.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillberg left the aircraft industry in 1951, and went to work for [[High Standard Manufacturing Company]] in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], as head of research and development. In addition to High Standard pistols, Hillberg worked on new designs for the [[J. C. Higgins]] brand of guns for [[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company]]. High Standard manufactured some military weapons. Hillberg designed a tank version of the Browning .30 caliber machine gun for the [[Springfield Armory]] and the [[Detroit Tank Arsenal]]. This gun was later put into production as the [[M1919 Browning machine gun#M37|M37 machine gun]].&lt;ref name=Card/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldestname/&gt;

Moving on from High Standard, Hillberg had the opportunity to develop his idea for a futuristic [[.22LR]] sporting pistol design when in 1954 he became the co-founder of [[Whitney Firearms]] in [[North Haven, Connecticut]], with Howard "Howie" Johnson (of the [[Bellmore Johnson Tool Company]] in Hamden).&lt;ref name=oldestname/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=J.B. Wood|title=Writer Gets His Whitney Wolverine After Long Wait For Unusual .22|url=http://www.thegunmag.com/writer-gets-his-whitney-wolverine-after-long-wait-for-unusual-22/|accessdate=21 June 2014|work=GunMag|publisher=Second Amendment Foundation|date=29 July 2013|quote=The Whitney name was used because the company was located near the old Eli Whitney factory site.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the [[Whitney Wolverine]] commenced in 1954, but poor marketing lead to the demise of Whitney Firearms in mid-1957. From that time on, until 1980, Hillberg was the Chief Engineer for Bellmore Johnson Tool Company. He also provided firearms consulting and design services from his office in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]]. From 1980 to 2012, he was as an independent expert witness in court cases relating to firearms.&lt;ref name=Card/&gt;

In the late 1980s, Hillberg and [[Robert Schuets]], owner of Olympic Arms Inc., worked together to bring the Whitney Wolverine back to the market. [[Olympic Arms]] introduced a [[Whitney Wolverine#The Modern Wolverine|polymer-framed version]] of Hillberg's pistol in 2004, and he received one of the first production models.&lt;ref name=Horman&gt;{{cite news|author1=B. Gil Horman|title=Olympic Arms Whitney Wolverine .22 LR Pistol|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=34935|accessdate=21 June 2014|work=American Rifleman|publisher=National Rifle Association|date=20 June 2014|quote=This polymer revival of R. Hillberg’s 1950s rimfire 'ray gun' is sleek, light and fun to shoot.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Hillberg was a retired deputy sheriff and was a member of several police organizations. After a lifetime designing firearms from machine guns to pistols, shotguns and rifles, when asked what was his proudest accomplishment, Hillberg replied “The Whitney pistol.”&lt;ref name=Card/&gt;

'''Roberto de Jesús Escobar Gaviria''' (born January 13, 1947), nicknamed '''''El Osito''''' ('''Little Bear'''), was the brother of the drug kingpin, [[Pablo Escobar]], and the former [[accountant]] of the [[Medellín Cartel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/25/entertainment/et-rutten25 | title='The Accountant's Story' by Roberto Escobar | author= Rutten, Tim  | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 25, 2009 | accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was responsible for up to 80 percent of the [[cocaine]] smuggled into the United States.

For his part in the operations of the Medellín Cartel, Roberto was imprisoned. He escaped with his brother in July 1992 but surrendered to authorities a year later. On December 18, 1993, while still in prison, he was blinded in one eye by a letter bomb. After more than 10 years, he was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/meet-drug-lords-brother-pablo-escobar-tour-132996/|work=CNN|title=Meet a drug lord’s brother on the Pablo Escobar Tour|first=Justin|last=Calderon|date=January 8, 2013|accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/world/escobar-s-brother-injured-by-letter-bomb-in-prison.html|work=New York Times|title=Escobar's Brother Injured by Letter Bomb in Prison|date=December 19, 1993|accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=September 2016}}

'''Rose McNamara''' (10 September 1885 – 6 March 1957) was an Irish nationalist, [[Irish republicanism|republican]], and Vice Commandant during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.

==Early life==
Rose Anne McNamara was born to Benjamin McNamara, a van driver, and Johanna Mangan, at 8 [[Great Denmark Street|Denmark Street]], [[Dublin]], on 10 September 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/cc94551151859|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died in 1898. Rose was just 15.&lt;ref name="CSO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-1916/1916irl/cpr/cwr/rmcn/|title=Rose McNamara (1885-1957)|publisher=Central Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Perolz]] introduced McNamara to [[Inghinidhe na hÉireann]] around 1906. Perolz's sister Delia was her sister in law. Delia was married to Matthew McNamara. McNamara joined [[Sinn Féin]] and became a  member of [[Cumann na mBan]] when that formed out of the Inghinidhe na hÉireann. With them she marched in public parades, conducted demonstrations, learned to make field dressings and collected money for ammunition and equipment for the [[Irish Volunteers]].&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0482.pdf|title=Witness statement for Rose McNamara|publisher=Bureau of Military History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution==
On Good Friday 1916, in preparation for the [[Easter Rising]] McNamara and others of the Cumann made field dressings. On the Monday her branch from Cumann na mBan were matched in full uniform to Emerald Square where they were given their instructions from [[Eamonn Ceannt]]. Rose served as Vice Commandant of the group who served in the [[Marrowbone Lane]] garrison, which was based in [[Marrowbone Lane Distillery|Jameson's Distillery]].&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Her"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.her.ie/life/easter-rising-five-women-you-may-not-know-served-in-the-rebellion/28873|title=Five women you may not know}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-forgotten-role-of-women-insurgents-in-the-1916-rising-1.1030426|title=The forgotten role of women insurgents in the 1916 Rising}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pašeta2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Senia Pašeta|title=Irish Nationalist Women, 1900-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRPrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/devil-detail|title=The devil is in the detail|author=Greg Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent the Rising with a number of roles, working as quartermaster for the men, acting as a spotter for the snipers and ensuring nursing facilities for the wounded. On Sunday, April 30 they were told of the surrender. McNamara, refused the opportunity to leave as part of the women who were considered less important to the British accepting the surrender and she and the rest of the Cumann na mBan marched between the male Volunteers and were duly arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Her"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pašeta2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="details"/&gt;

''“On the route to Richmond Barracks we were right behind Commandant [[Thomas McDonagh]] and [[John MacBride|Major McBride]]. When we reached somewhere about Kilmainham, both Major McBride and T. McDonagh said: "That's right, girls, sing away" and Major McBride said to me: "Sing away, girls. You'll be alright. You'll be out tomorrow", and I replied "and what about you" meaning all the men. He said, very sadly, "Ah no. We won't be out. We'll be shot".''

While they were in prison in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] they could hear the men being executed by firing squad as McBride had predicted.&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;

In the aftermath the members of the Cumann were disheartened but collected funds for the prisoner's dependents.  In 1917 McNamarra was First Lieutenant of her branch. Military drills and training began again. In 1918 the branch, including McNamara were involved in the anti-conscription activities.&lt;ref name="Statement"/&gt;

During the Irish War of Independence McNamara worked with the other women in collecting funds, attending funerals and other parades and in protesting at the gaols where prisoners were on hunger-strike. in 1919 McNamara became Captain of her Cumann na mBan branch. Her role was to ensure nursing cover at first aid stations during planned ambushes. She was notified in advance to make sure the house was ready to receive any wounded men. Commandant Joe O'Connor and Seán Guilfoyle were working with her on these.&lt;ref name="Statement"/&gt;

In the [[Irish Civil War]] she served under [[Countess Markievicz]].&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Her"/&gt; She attended the events at the Four Courts where the Pro and Anti Treaty sides clashed. McNamara was on the Anti-Treaty side. She procured refreshements for the men and carried messages for them. The following day she was given orders to serve at the United Services Club. Fighting continued in the city over night.&lt;ref name="Statement"/&gt;

Rose McNamara died 6 March 1957.&lt;ref name="CSO"/&gt;

'''SS ''Ben Seyr''''' was a steel-built coastal cargo vessel which was operated out of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man]] for the Ramsey Steamship Company;  ostensibly to [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Belfast Harbour|Belfast]] and [[Whitehaven]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Ramsey Courier.'' Friday 28 May 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Her name, Ben Seyr, came from the [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic term]] for ''gentlewoman.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She was lost in a storm in either the northern part of the [[Celtic Sea]], or the southern part of the [[Irish Sea]], in October 1938, going down with the loss of all hands.

==Construction and dimensions==
''Ben Seyr'' was constructed by the Manchester Dry Docks Company at [[Ellesmere Port]] and was completed in 1920.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Length {{convert|126|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, beam {{convert|22|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, depth {{convert|10|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Ben Seyr's'' cargo hold was divided into fore and aft hatches with a combined space of 12,400 cubic feet and which could accommodate 265 tons of cargo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She was driven by a marine compound reciprocating engine with her boiler manufactured by [[Cammell Laird|Cammell Laird's]]. The high-pressure cylinder was 15 inches in [[diameter]], the low-pressure cylinder 32 inches with a 21-inch stroke.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
''Ben Seyr'' was fitted with a patented steam-powered steering gear designed by Fisher's of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which could be detached if necessary. She had bunker capacity for 40 [[ton]]s of coal with her bunkers designed to accommodate 20 tons on the [[Port and starboard|port side]] and the other 20 [[ton]]s on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She carried 20 tons of water ballast aft and 12 tons forward and had a tank installed which contained 300 [[imperial gallon|gallons]] of drinking water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For a vessel of her size, her engine room was said to be exceptionally large and airy and all accessories were said to be conveniently placed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The quarters of the seamen and firemen were situated forward, underneath the [[Forecastle|forecastle head]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Below the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheel house]] was the accommodation for the [[Sea captain|Captain]] and [[First mate]] with the [[Chief engineer]]'s quarters situated at the after end of the ship. The fittings were made of oak and she was furnished with spring beds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
''Ben Seyr'' was fitted with a steam-powered [[windlass]] and in addition a steam winch for loading and unloading of cargo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Service life==
''Ben Seyr'' underwent her Sea Trials in early May 1920 during the course of which she covered a measured mile off [[Formby]] at a speed of {{convert|9.5|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Ben Seyr'' entered service under the command of [[Sea captain|Captain]] E. Jones, who prior to this had served on the ''Ben Varrey''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On her maiden voyage she made passage from the Bar Lightship to [[Maughold Head]] in a time of 6.5 hours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
On joining the Ramsey Steamship Company fleet she was the largest vessel within the fleet and brought the total number to five.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Ben Seyr'' conveyed numerous types of cargo, with the mainstays being coal, grain and timber.

==Incidents==
With Captain Corlett in command, the ''Ben Seyr'' was approaching Ramsey Harbour on Friday, February 7, 1936, in challenging conditions. A southeasterly gale had developed making berthing in the port particularly difficult and leading to one of the ''Ben Seyr's'' ropes snapping following which she began to drift onto the Mooragh bank. Capt. Corlett displayed fine seamanship in raging control of the vessel and averting her grounding.&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner.'' Friday, February 14, 1936; Page: 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1937, one of the crew of the ''Ben Seyr'' was drowned in [[Maryport|Maryport Harbour]] following an accident.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''The Ramsey Courier.'' Friday 14 October 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Able seaman|Able Seaman]] Charles Kneale was 23 years old and came from [[Ramsey, Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
He was in a small boat sculling across the harbour together with another crew member [[Able seaman|Able Seaman]] Cecil Barber near to where the ''Ben Seyr'' was docked. In testimony Barber said that as they approached the dock gates Kneale fell into the water and although Barber did all he could to save him, he subsequently drowned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An inquest into Kneale's death was held later that night on board the ''Ben Seyr'' in order to allow the vessel to sail on the night tide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
The ''Ben Seyr'' conveyed the body of Able Seaman Kneale back to Ramsey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Loss==
''Ben Seyr'' departed [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] on Sunday, 2 October 1938 under [[Sea captain|Captain]] Ambrose Crebbin, bound for [[Cardiff]] with a cargo of oats. During the course of the passage, she encountered heavy seas and was forced to run towards the Irish Coast in order to seek shelter, with word being received by her owners on the morning of Wednesday 5, that she had arrived off [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]], [[County Wexford]]. The [[Station Master]] at [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]] reported that the ''Ben Seyr'' had departed at [[24-hour clock#Midnight 00:00 and 24:00|14:00hrs]] later that day resuming passage to Cardiff,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ramsey Courier''. Friday 14 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt; after which nothing more was seen or heard from her. ''Ben Seyr'' was not equipped with a [[Wireless#Radio|wireless]] and therefore no information was received regarding her position or the weather which she was encountering.

By the following Tuesday, 11 October, with still no news of the ''Ben Seyr,'' the following radio appeal was made on the [[BBC National Programme]] as well as on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]].

{{Quotation|''"There has been no news for nearly a week of the British steamer Ben Syer which left Rosslare for Cardiff on Wednesday last. Anybody or any ship hearing of the Ben Seyr or being in touch with the vessel, is asked to communicate with Lloyds, London."''|''BBC National Programme news bulletin.'' Tuesday 11 October 1938.}}

When Wednesday came with still no news of the ''Ben Seyr'' hope began to fade. It seemed highly improbable that she could still be sheltering, for her crew had with them food for approximately five days and her coal bunkers would have been running out.

On Thursday 13 October the body of Seaman James Bradford was washed ashore on Middleton Sands, near [[Heysham Harbour]] on the [[Lancashire|Lancashire Coast.]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner.'' Friday 14 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
His body was found fully clothed and in a standard type [[Personal flotation device#Life jacket|life jacket]]. Within his coat was found a badge of the Isle of Man Branch of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] to which he belonged.
He was formerly identified by his by his father,&lt;ref&gt;''Green Final.'' Saturday 15 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt; and an inquest was held into his death at [[Heysham]] on Saturday 15 October.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Final.'' Saturday 15 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
James Bradford's body was returned to the Isle of Man on board the steamer [[Mona's Isle (1905)|''Mona's Isle]]. Following his funeral which was reported to have been very well attended, his body was buried at Maughold Churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Final.'' Saturday 15 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

A relief fund for the dependents of the crew was set up on 18 October 1938. The fund raised a total of £1,387 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1387|1939|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}
added to which was the sum of £400 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|400|1939|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} from the Ramsey Steamship Company. During the years following, payments were made to the dependents at [[Christmas]] (£30) with financial aid also being given for medical and educational purposes.
The relief fund continued to pay those dependents until 1955, when with the children of the dependents having grown into adulthood it was decided that the Ben Seyr Relief Fund should be wound up. A meeting was called by the Trustees at the Town Hall, Ramsey, on Monday 17 January 1955, for the purpose of passing a resolution for the winding up of the fund and distributing the balance amongst the last five dependents.&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner''. Friday 7 January 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on sinking==
How the ''Ben Seyr'' met her fate is a matter of conjecture. Having been seen at [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]], it may be presumed that having sailed for [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday afternoon she soon encountered heavy seas. Her cargo of loose oats may have ran forward in the hold, the weight putting her nose under the water, in which case she could have sunk in a matter of minutes. Conversely, she may have attempted to turn back and run for the shelter of the Irish Coast during the course of which she was swamped by the heavy seas - again her sinking would have followed quickly.

The fact that the body of Seaman James Bradford was washed ashore on the northern part of the Lancashire Coast, could also support a theory that after leaving Rosslare the ''Ben Seyr'' [[Heaving to#Heaving to as a storm tactic|"''ran before the storm''"]] in an attempt to return to the [[Isle of Man]]. Local nautical theory at the time suggested this as a possibility, with the ''Ben Seyr'' subsequently [[Shipwrecking#Instability and foundering|foundering]] to the south of the [[Isle of Man]]. Also with the fact that Bradford's body was found in a [[Personal flotation device#Life jacket|life jacket]], it could suggest that the crew abandoned ship, however no other crew members bodies were found.

Several days after she had left [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]] rumours began to circulate that one of the ''Ben Seyr's'' [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] had been recovered on the Irish Coast. However, it turned out to be a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] belonging to the ''SS Donaghmnore'' of [[Belfast]], which had gone to the rescue of the ''SS Marjorie'' which was lost in the same storm off [[Dundrum, County Down|St. John's Point]], Ireland. Wreckage of the ''Marjorie'' was also washed up on the western coast of the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner.'' Friday 28 October 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1939, it was announced by the [[Board of Trade]] that after careful consideration of all the facts surrounding the loss of the ''Ben Seyr'' that it had been decided that there were no public grounds for the carrying out of a formal investigation into the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner.'' Friday 18 August 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==

A Memorial Service was held at St. Paul's Church [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] on Saturday 15 October 1938, conducted by the Rev. M. W. Harrison, vicar of St. Paul's and assisted by the Rev. E.C. Paton who read the lesson.

==Trivia==
In early March 1939, a message in a bottle was washed up on the shore at [[Silecroft]], [[Cumberland|southern Cumberland]] on which was written:
{{Quotation|''"Ben Seyr. Foundering with fore hatches battered in. Heavy seas. 22 miles S.S.W. Maughull Head."''}}&lt;ref&gt;''Green Final'' Saturday 11 March 1939&lt;/ref&gt;
The message was regarded with some reserve. There was only one set of hatches on the ''Ben Seyr'' and if the word ''"Maughull"'' was supposed to mean [[Maughold]], then it is highly unlikely that it would have been mis-spelt by any member of the crew in the manner indicated. Also the position indicated in the message would have put the vessel somewhere between [[Langness]] and the [[Chicken Rock]].

'''Scott Kevin Walker''' (born November 2, 1967) is an American politician serving as the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|45th]] and current [[governor of Wisconsin]] since 2011. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was first elected governor in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]], then won in an attempted recall election in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, 2012|2012]], and was elected a third time in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]], before being defeated in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]]. He formerly served as [[Milwaukee County Executive]] and in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].

Born in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], Walker was raised in [[Iowa]] and in [[Delavan, Wisconsin]], before attending [[Marquette University]]. He left Marquette before graduating, taking a full-time job with the [[American Red Cross]]. Walker was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1992, representing a district in western [[Milwaukee County]]. In 2002, Walker was elected County Executive in a special election following the resignation of [[F. Thomas Ament]]; he was elected for a full term in 2004 and was re-elected in 2008.

Walker campaigned for Governor of Wisconsin in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]] and ran again in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]]. Shortly after his inauguration in 2011, Walker introduced a [[Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill|budget plan]] which limited the [[collective bargaining]] of most Wisconsin public employees. The response to Walker's policies included [[2011 Wisconsin protests|protests]] at the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] and an effort to recall Walker. In the [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election|2012 recall election]], Walker again defeated Barrett, becoming the first governor in the United States to survive a recall effort.

In 2014, Walker defeated his Democratic challenger, businesswoman and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] School Board member [[Mary Burke]]. Walker [[Scott Walker presidential campaign, 2016|was briefly a candidate]] for his party's [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|presidential nomination]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]]. Walker sought a third term as governor in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]] but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[Tony Evers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democrat Tony Evers wins election for governor in Wisconsin.|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1060070757550702594|publisher=AP|accessdate=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Walker was born on November 2, 1967, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], the elder of two sons of Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Fitch; born December 30, 1938), a bookkeeper, and Llewellyn Scott "Llew" Walker (May 19, 1939 – October 7, 2018), a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2018/10/07/llewellyn-scott-walker-dies-during-sons-re-election-campaign/1558113002/|title = Llewellyn Scott Walker, father of Gov.

The family moved to [[Plainfield, Iowa]], in 1970, where Llew worked as pastor in the local Baptist Church, TBC, and served on the municipal council.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Stein (January 31, 2015) [http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-learned-early-lessons-at-fathers-iowa-church-b99435429z1-290442461.html "Scott Walker learned early lessons at father's Iowa church"], ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''; accessed September 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; When Walker was ten years old, the family moved to [[Delavan, Wisconsin]], where his father continued to work as a minister, at the First Baptist Church of Delavan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gonyea|first1=Dan|title=Now On The National Stage, Scott Walker Is Still A Guy From Delavan|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/17/423809006/now-on-the-national-stage-scott-walker-is-still-a-guy-from-delavan|accessdate=April 28, 2018|work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, when Walker was in high school, he attended and represented Wisconsin at two weeks of [[American Legion]]-sponsored training in leadership and government at [[Badger Boys State]] in Wisconsin and the selective [[Boys Nation]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="notable bbs graduates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; While at the event, he met [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Ronald Reagan]]&lt;ref name="preacher's kid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Scott Walker Biography | url=http://www.biography.com/people/scott-walker-20941829#synopsis | publisher=''Biography.com'' | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a photo taken with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Viser | first1=Matt | title=Scott Walker’s Political Ambitions Fostered at Marquette | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/02/11/scott-walker-dropped-out-marquette-but-his-education-campus-politics-set-him-ambitious-path/m41BjqIY9xAltlCgR6z5CM/story.html | date=February 11, 2015 | publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' | accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker has credited the experience with solidifying his interest in public service and giving him the "political bug".&lt;ref name="boys nation alum"/&gt; He attained the highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], in the [[Boy Scouts of America]],&lt;ref name="preacher's kid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="battleground"/&gt; and graduated from Delavan-Darien High School in 1986.&lt;ref name="close to home"/&gt;

=== College===
In 1986, Walker worked as a volunteer for [[Tommy Thompson]]'s gubernatorial campaign, and in the fall of that year, enrolled at [[Marquette University]].&lt;ref name="alumni"/&gt; Within a few weeks of beginning studies, Walker became a student senator and a few weeks later led a probe involving student government leaders misusing funds during homecoming.&lt;ref name=Politifact.college/&gt; Walker's committee recommended impeachment of those being investigated, leading many to resign, and earning Walker enemies, a number of whom, according to [[Politifact]], "continue to taunt him today".&lt;ref name=Politifact.college&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umhoefer|first1=Dave|title=Solving the "mystery" of Scott Walker's college years and entry into politics|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/dec/18/scott-walker-early-years|publisher=Politifact|accessdate=May 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519181456/http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/dec/18/scott-walker-early-years|archivedate=May 19, 2015|date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he ran for student government president, touting a 19-point resume.&lt;ref name=Politifact.college/&gt; On election day, a record number of students voted and Walker lost 927 to 1,245, following an alleged infringement of campaign guidelines; an election commission later found Walker guilty of beginning his campaign one week before he was allowed.&lt;ref name=Politifact.college/&gt; His opponent was impeached shortly after taking office but Walker did not apply for the position.&lt;ref name=Politifact.college/&gt; While at Marquette, Walker led the [[pro-life]] [[Students for Life of America|Students for Life]] group at the university.&lt;ref name="Remarkably"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Ben-Meir | first1=Ilan | title=Scott Walker’s Remarkably Consistent, Two Decade Fight Against Abortion | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/scott-walkers-remarkably-consistent-two-decade-fight-against | date=August 25, 2015 | publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wisconsin State Assembly==
In 1990, at age 22, Walker ran for Milwaukee's 7th District seat in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]]. He won the Republican nomination, but lost in the general election to incumbent Democrat [[Gwen Moore]], receiving less than one-third of the vote.&lt;ref name="1990 election"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politics calling"/&gt; In 1993, Walker moved to [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]], a suburb of Milwaukee, and ran in a [[special election]] in the more conservative 14th legislative district, based around Wauwatosa. He defeated Democrat Chris Ament, son of then-Milwaukee County Executive [[Tom Ament]].&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drawn to politics"/&gt;

During the campaign, Walker backed [[Welfare to work#1980s and 1990s|welfare reform]] and opposed the expansion of [[Public transport|mass transit]]. He supported a cap on state spending and said that the law on resolving labor disputes with local government employees needed to be reformed.&lt;ref name="assembly foes"/&gt; Walker received the endorsements of Wisconsin Right to Life and ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', which called him a [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] and noted his [[pro-life]], tough-on-crime, and pro-welfare reform positions.&lt;ref name="sentinel choice"/&gt; He was re-elected four times, serving until 2002 when he became a county executive.&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt;

While in the state assembly, he was interested in criminal justice matters&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt; and chaired the Committees on Correctional Facilities, and Corrections and the Courts. Over the years, he served on a number of other committees, including Health, Census and Redistricting, Financial Institutions, and Housing.&lt;ref name="historical society"/&gt; As a freshman legislator in 1993, he co-sponsored [[right-to-work law|right-to-work legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading from Behind: How Years of Denials Got Scott Walker In Position to Approve Right-to-Work|first=David|last=Weigel|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-23/leading-from-behind-how-years-of-denials-got-scott-walker-in-position-to-approve-right-to-work|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Backs Anti-Union Bill In State Senate: State Inches Toward Right-To-Work|first=Cole|last=Stangler|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker-backs-anti-union-bill-state-senate-state-inches-1825122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walker: Lawmakers Should Wait Until Budget's Passage Before Acting On Right-To-Work|date=December 5, 2014|first=Shawn|last=Johnson|accessdate=May 15, 2015|publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]]|url=http://www.wpr.org/walker-lawmakers-should-wait-until-budgets-passage-acting-right-work}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Walker keeps changing his mind|first=Leslie|last=Larson|date=March 11, 2015|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/scott-walker-keeps-changing-his-mind-2015-3|accessdate=May 15, 2015|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he took the lead in a [[truth-in-sentencing]] bill that increased prison time for some crimes, eliminated parole for others, and subsequently contributed to [[prison overcrowding]].&lt;ref name="Keyes"/&gt; Walker was a member of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) at the time, and credited the organization for much of the success of the legislation.&lt;ref name="Keyes"&gt;Keyes, Scott.

In 2001, he was the lead sponsor of a bill to prevent pharmacists from being disciplined for refusing to fill prescriptions for [[emergency contraception]]&lt;ref name="abortion, birth control"/&gt; and was a strong supporter of a bill to require voters to show photo ID at the polls.&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt; According to research by two political analysts, Walker was more conservative than about 90% of his peers in the assembly and about 80% of the Republicans in the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Walker's legislative years: A staunch conservative, then as now|first=Craig|last=Gilbert|date=February 28, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/294519901.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker had a strong pro-life record in the state assembly. With the exception of some bills while Walker was running for Milwaukee County Executive, Walker either sponsored or cosponsored all but three bills that would have restricted abortions.&lt;ref name="Remarkably"/&gt;

In 2001–02, Walker and fellow state assembly member [[Michael Huebsch]] [[Jamyi Witch hiring controversy|objected to the hiring]] of a state employee, Rev. Jamyi Witch, on the basis of her religious beliefs as a [[Wiccan]].&lt;ref name="AU2002"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090512184102/http://www.au.org/media/church-and-state/archives/2002/02/aub.html "Wiccan prison chaplain sparks controversy in Wisconsin"], ''Americans United Bulletin'', February 2002; accessed November 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes2002"&gt;Toosi, Nahal.

Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's chaplaincy or employment.&lt;ref name="AU2002"/&gt;

==Milwaukee County Executive==
[[File:Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker in 2009.jpg|thumb|Scott Walker in 2009]]
Walker became [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] [[county executive|Executive]] in a [[special election]] run in April 2002, after the former County Executive, [[Tom Ament]], resigned in the wake of a county pension fund scandal.&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="announcement expected"/&gt; Walker was elected to a four-year term in 2004, winning 57% of the vote to defeat former state budget director, David Riemer.&lt;ref name="2004 race"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2004 election results"/&gt; Although in a liberal county and running for a nonpartisan position, Walker ran openly as a conservative Republican.&lt;ref name="preacher's kid"/&gt; He won another four-year term in 2008, defeating State Senator [[Lena Taylor]] with 59% of the vote.&lt;ref name="2008 election results"/&gt; Upon first being elected, Walker became the youngest person and the first Republican ever elected to the position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stein | first1=Kate | title=Timeline: The Life and Career of Scott Walker | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/timeline-the-life-and-career-of-scott-walker/html_4c4013e6-9bfe-5cdd-b494-2ba6bcf88827.html | date=July 19, 2015 | publisher=''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the only Republican to hold this office to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (R) at the Iowa Freedom Summit|website=c-span.org|location=Recorded speech.

Walker won the office on a platform of [[Fiscal conservatism#Modern fiscal conservatism in the United States|fiscal conservatism]],&lt;ref name="Biography.com"/&gt; promising to give back part of his own salary. He said that his voluntary give-back gave him [[moral authority]] to make cuts in the budget.

[[File:Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker runs for Governor of Wisconsin in October 2010.jpg|left|thumb|Scott Walker speaks before the gubernatorial election]]
As part of his campaign platform, Walker said he would create 250,000 jobs in his first term through a program that would include tax cuts for small businesses, [[capital gains tax|capital gains]] tax cuts, and income tax cuts.&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt; He proposed cutting state employee wages and benefits to help pay for these tax cuts.

Walker indicated he would refuse an $810 million award from the federal [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] to build a high speed railroad line from Madison to Milwaukee as he believed it would cost the state $7.5 million per year to operate and would not prove profitable.&lt;ref name="no thanks"/&gt; This was in spite of offers by the mayor of Madison and the Dane County executive to help absorb costs the state might have incurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/capitol-report/capitol-report-madison-mayor-lashes-out-at-walker-over-high/article_07b1f032-03da-11e0-976c-001cc4c002e0.html "Mayor of Madison lashes out at Walker"], host.madison.com; accessed November 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The award was later rescinded and split among other states.&lt;ref name="rail funds"/&gt; This cost the state at least $60 million for rail repairs federal funds would have covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/121871844.html Report on rail repair federal funds rejected by Governor Walker], jsonline.com; accessed November 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social issues played a part in the campaign. Walker has stated that he is "100% pro-life" and that he believes life should be protected from conception to natural death.&lt;ref name="protecting"/&gt; He opposes [[abortion]], including in cases of [[rape]] and [[incest]].&lt;ref name="abortion, birth control"/&gt;&lt;ref name="even in"/&gt; He supports [[abstinence-only sex education]] in the public schools and opposes state supported clinical services that provide [[birth control]] and testing and treatment of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s to teens under age 18 without parental consent.&lt;ref name="abortion, birth control"/&gt; He supports the right of pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for [[contraceptive]]s on religious or moral grounds.&lt;ref name="abortion, birth control"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abortion debate"/&gt; He supports [[adult stem cell research]] but opposes human [[embryonic stem cell]] research.&lt;ref name="AP guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="even in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adult stem cell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wants to ban"/&gt;

As an opponent of [[same-sex marriage]], he opposed a law that allowed gay couples to register with counties to get certain benefits, such as hospital visitation rights. He later stated that his position on same-sex marriage was no longer relevant because Wisconsin's ban on same-sex marriage had been overturned by a federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/scott-walker-declines-to-say-where-he-stands-on-gay-marriage-today-b99290317z1-262952941.html|title=Walker declines to define stand on gay marriage today|author=Bice, Daniel|date=June 12, 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker said he would sign an [[Arizona SB 1070|Arizona-style immigration bill]], which would allow local police to stop suspected illegal immigrants, if he were elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Governor/Scott_Walker_Immigration.htm|title=Scott Walker on Immigration|publisher=Ontheissues.org|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 25, 2011, the state legislature passed a series of Walker-backed bills, the largest of which would cut taxes for businesses at "a two-year cost of $67 million", according to the ''[[Associated Press]]''.&lt;ref name="tax cuts"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bauer, Scott|date=January 26, 2011|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-25/wisconsin-legislature-set-to-pass-tax-cuts.html|title=Wisconsin Legislature passes tax cut|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128041240/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-25/wisconsin-legislature-set-to-pass-tax-cuts.html|archivedate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker became a figure of national recognition and controversy after he proposed the "[[2011 Wisconsin Act 10|Wisconsin budget repair bill]]" in 2011. The bill, which would eventually be passed by the [[Wisconsin Legislature]], significantly changed the [[collective bargaining]] process for most public employees in Wisconsin. Opponents of Walker's actions launched a push for a recall election and received enough support to force [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election|an election]] on June 5, 2012, the first time a Governor of Wisconsin had ever faced recall.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davey|first=Monica|title=Recall Election for Wisconsin Governor Who Battled Unions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/us/wisconsin-approves-recall-election-for-governor-walker.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Walker's first term as governor, the state's $3.6 billion budget deficit was turned into a surplus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/15/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-turned-36-billion-deficit|title=Gov.

====2011 Budget Repair Bill and protests====
{{Further|2011 Wisconsin protests}}
Walker proposed the [[Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill]] on February 11, 2011, estimated to save Wisconsin $30 million in the current fiscal year and $300 million over the next two years.&lt;ref name="may take an ax"/&gt; The bill requires additional contributions by state and local government workers to their health care plans and pensions, amounting to roughly an 8% decrease in the average government worker's take home pay.&lt;ref name="outline intentions"/&gt; The bill eliminated, for most state workers, other than certain public safety workers, many collective bargaining rights aside from seeking pay increases, and then not above the rate of inflation, unless approved by a voter [[referendum]].&lt;ref name="how we got here"/&gt; Under the bill, unions have to win yearly votes to continue representing government workers and could no longer have dues automatically deducted from government workers' paychecks.&lt;ref name="may take an ax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="read summary"/&gt; Certain law enforcement personnel and firefighters are exempt from the bargaining changes.&lt;ref name="ads attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="budget fights"/&gt;

On January 18, 2011, days after Walker's inauguration, [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] businesswoman and Walker supporter [[Diane Hendricks]] asked him, "Any chance we'll ever get to be a completely red state and work on these unions and become a right-to-work (state)?", and he replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, we're going to start in a couple weeks with our budget adjustment bill. The first step is, we're going to deal with collective bargaining for all public employee unions, because you use divide and conquer. So for us the base we've got for that is the fact that we've got – budgetarily we can't afford not to. If we have collective bargaining agreements in place, there's no way not only the state but local governments can balance things out. So you think city of Beloit, city of Janesville, any of the school districts, that opens the door once we do that. That's your bigger problem right there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marley|first1=Patrick|title=A transcript of the Walker-Hendricks union discussion|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/a-transcript-of-the-walkerhendricks-union-discussion-805952v-151052965.html|accessdate=March 16, 2015|agency=Journal Sentinel|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=May 10, 2012|title=In film, Walker talks of 'divide and conquer' union strategy|first1=Jason|last1=Stein|first2=Patrick|last2=Marley|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After video tape of the interaction was released in May 2012, Walker's opponents said Walker had revealed his intention to target private sector unions and pursue right-to-work legislation. Walker said he was not pursuing right-to-work legislation and that in his 2011 comment to Hendricks he was referring to his responsibility as governor to defend taxpayers from unions that he believed were frustrating resolution of the state's budget deficit.&lt;ref name=fox20120511&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/05/11/video-walker-explains-divide-conquer-strategy|date=May 11, 2012|title=Video: Walker explains divide, conquer strategy|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Walker Recall: Governor Outlines 'Divide And Conquer' Union Strategy In Video|first=Jeremy|last=White|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2015|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/scott-walker-recall-governor-outlines-divide-and-conquer-union-strategy-video-698009|publisher=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Scott Walker said budget strategy in Wisconsin was 'divide and conquer'|first=Aaron|last=Blake|date=May 11, 2012|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/scott-walker-said-budget-strategy-in-wisconsin-was-divide-and-conquer/2012/05/11/gIQARhmTIU_blog.html|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In announcing the proposed legislation, Walker said the [[Wisconsin National Guard]] and other state agencies were prepared to prevent disruptions in state services.&lt;ref name="is prepared"/&gt;&lt;ref name="national guard"/&gt; He later explained that police and firefighters were excluded from the changes because he would not jeopardize public safety. Walker stated that the bill was necessary to avoid laying off thousands of state employees and that no one should be surprised by its provisions. Union leaders and Democratic legislators immediately criticized the bill, claiming Walker had never campaigned on doing away with collective bargaining rights.&lt;ref name="national guard"/&gt; In a media interview a week later, Walker said he was not trying to break the public sector unions, noting that Wisconsin government employees would retain the protections of civil service laws. He said that asking employees to pay half the national average for health care benefits was a modest request.&lt;ref name="bold political"/&gt;

Demonstrators began protesting the proposed bill on February 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/on_campus/article_87a7eaa0-3853-11e0-bcc7-001cc4c002e0.html UW-Madison students to Walker: "Don't Break My ♥"], ''Wisconsin State Journal'', February 14, 2011. Retrieved December 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the sixth day of the protests, leaders of the two largest unions said publicly they were prepared to accept the financial concessions in the bill, but would not agree to the limitations of collective bargaining rights. All 14 of the Democratic state senators left the state to [[Illinois]] on February 17, preventing the passage of the bill by the mostly Republican legislature in the absence of the [[quorum]] necessary for a vote.&lt;ref name="shows no sign"/&gt; The missing legislators said they would not return to Madison unless Walker agreed to remove the limitations on collective bargaining from the bill.&lt;ref name="outline intentions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fake sick"/&gt; Walker warned that if the budget repair bill was not passed by March 1, refinancing of a $165&amp;nbsp;million state debt would fail, and more cuts would be needed to balance the budget.&lt;ref name="outline intentions"/&gt;

Appearing on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on February 27, Walker stated that he did not believe the unions were negotiating in good faith in offering pension and health-care concessions because local unions had recently pushed through contracts with school boards and city councils that did not include contributions to the pensions and health care and that, in one case, a contract even included a pay increase.&lt;ref name="shows no sign"/&gt; On February 28, the largest public union filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the state labor relations board, claiming that Walker had a duty to negotiate, but had refused.&lt;ref name="outline intentions"/&gt;

On March 8, private emails dating back to February 28 were released. These emails showed that Governor Walker had tried to negotiate with Democratic legislators, even proposing to allow some collective bargaining rights.&lt;ref name="will negotiate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/Email_exchange_030811.pdf|title=Email exchange|date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after failing to reach a compromise with Democratic legislators, the Republican Senate legislators removed certain fiscal provisions from the bill, allowing it to be passed by a simple senate majority.&lt;ref name="walker passes bill"/&gt;

On March 18, Judge Maryann Sumi issued a court order to prohibit publication of the bill by the Secretary of State while legal challenges to it were being considered. On March 26, the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) published the bill. Republicans contended the court order did not mention the LRB, which is (also) responsible for publishing laws, and that the publication made the bill law. Democrats maintained the bill could not become law until the Secretary of State took action, and the entire law was published in the state newspaper of record, the ''Wisconsin State Journal''. Sumi subsequently clarified that, pursuant to her order, the bill could not be considered to be published, pending completion of court review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1370357/Opponents-Wisconsin-anti-union-promise-tsunami-litigation.html|title=Opponents of 'anti-union' bill promise tsunami of litigation|work=Daily Mail|date=March 26, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2012|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jonsson|first=Patrik|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0326/Wisconsin-union-gutting-law-took-effect-Saturday-or-did-it|title=Wisconsin union-gutting law took effect Saturday – or did it?|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=March 26, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, Judge Sumi struck down the budget repair bill, finding that its passage was in violation of state open meetings laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge voids law limiting union rights|author=Bauer, Scott|agency=Associated Press|date=May 27, 2011|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-27/news/29600429_1_open-meetings-quorum-requirement-protests|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] overturned Sumi's ruling on June 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marley|first=Patrick|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/123859034.html|title=Supreme Court reinstates collective bargaining law|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker claimed the measures would "save jobs, protect taxpayers, reform government and help balance the budget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/03/10/police-remove-protesters-wisconsin-capitol|title=Police remove protesters Wisconsin Capitol|publisher=foxnews.com|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "You see, despite a lot of the rhetoric we've heard over the past 11 days the bill I put forward isn't aimed at state workers, and it certainly isn't a battle with unions. If it was, we would have eliminated collective bargaining entirely or we would have gone after the private-sector unions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116696249.html Excerpt from Walker speech re unions], jsonline.com; accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the cost savings resulting from the changes to collective bargaining, Walker points to significant reductions in the premiums for health insurance for many school districts. Prior to the deficit reduction bill, WEA Trust, which is affiliated with Wisconsin's largest teachers union, dominated the market for health insurance for the state's school districts. The changes to collective bargaining made it easier for school districts to change health insurance providers and negotiate better premiums. Walker claims that Wisconsin school districts have saved an estimated $30 million as a result of the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kertscher|first=Tom|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2012/may/21/behind-rhetoric-wea-trust-and-school-health-care-c|title=Behind the rhetoric: The WEA Trust and school health care costs|publisher=PolitiFact|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====John Doe campaign finance investigation=====
In August 2012, the first investigation, which had been launched by [[John T. Chisholm|John Chisholm]], Milwaukee County District Attorney, a Democrat, into missing funds, was rolled into a second [[Wisconsin Circuit Court#Grand jury and John Doe proceedings|John Doe probe]] based on a theory that Governor Walker's campaign had illegally coordinated with conservative groups engaged in issue advocacy during the recall elections.&lt;ref name="watchdog.org"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kittle|first1=MD|url=http://watchdog.org/149217/john-doe-wall-street-journal-investigation|title='Never-ending' John Doe never ended, WSJ reports|newspaper=Wisconsin Reporter|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial John Doe judge, retired Kenosha County Circuit Judge Barbara A. Kluka, overseeing the John Doe investigation issued 30 subpoenas and 5 search warrants. She also issued a secrecy order which meant those being investigated were legally bound from discussing any facet of the investigation publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304799404579155953286552832 "Wisconsin Political Speech Raid"], ''Wall Street Journal'', November 18, 2013; accessed May 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2013, she [[recusal|recused]] herself from the investigation without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/113658/judge-investigation-democrat|title=EXCLUSIVE: Judge in Democrat-led John Doe probe recuses herself|work=Watchdog.org|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kluka's replacement, Judge Gregory Peterson, quashed several subpoenas in January 2014, saying "there was no probable cause shown that they violated campaign finance laws".&lt;ref name="watchdog.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/113658/judge-investigation-democrat|title=EXCLUSIVE: Judge in Democrat-led John Doe probe recuses herself|work=Watchdog.org|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/115840/judge-milwaukee-investigation|title=Sources: New judge named in Democrat-led secret probe|work=Watchdog.org|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2015, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4–2 that Walker did not illegally collaborate with conservative groups during the recall campaigns. Writing for the majority in the case, Justice Michael Gableman stated: "To be clear, this conclusion ends the John Doe investigation because the special prosecutor's legal theory is unsupported in either reason or law," he said, "Consequently, the investigation is closed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensch|first1=Mark|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/248162-walker-cleared-in-campaign-finance-probe|title=Court ends Walker campaign finance probe|publisher=The Hill|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against the investigators of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Judge Dismisses Governor Scott Walker-Related John Doe Lawsuit | url=http://fox6now.com/2017/03/16/federal-judge-dismisses-governor-scott-walker-related-john-doe-lawsuit/ | date=March 16, 2017 | publisher=''fox6now.com'' | accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–2013 budget proposal====
Wisconsin faced an anticipated deficit of approximately $3.6 billion in the 2012–13 budget cycle&lt;ref name="may take an ax"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Reuters|title=Wisconsin boosts 3-year rev projection by $636 mln|date=May 11, 2011|author=Pierog, Karen|quote=The new revenue projection comes as the {{sic|the}} state wrestles with a $3.6&amp;nbsp;billion hole in its upcoming two-year budget.|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/11/wisconsin-revenue-idUKN1124356120110511|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which must be balanced according to state law. Walker's proposed budget cut $834 million in state aid for K-12 education, which would be a 7.9% reduction from the prior budget. He proposed a 5.5% decrease in the maximum amount of funding school districts can receive from state aid and property taxes, which would limit how much property taxes could be increased to compensate for the reduction in state aid. The budget lowered state capital gains taxes for investments in Wisconsin businesses. It increased spending on health care by $1.3 billion to cover increased costs for [[Medicaid]], and increased transportation funding by $410.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Jason|title=Walker's budget cuts would touch most Wisconsinites|publisher=Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel|date=March 1, 2011|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/117154428.html|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker's proposed budget for fiscal 2013–2015 froze spending on public schools and tightened the income requirements for Medicaid recipients. It proposed an increase in funding for fighting domestic violence, mental health care, higher education, and job training. It also included a $343 million cut in income taxes and an expansion of the state's school voucher program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Dee|title=Gov.

====Domestic partner registry defense====
On May 13, 2011, the Walker administration petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for permission to withdraw the state as a defendant from ''[[Appling v.

====Regulatory reform bill====
On May 23, 2011, Walker signed legislation changing the process of creating administrative rules for the state. This measure, which became 2011 Wisconsin Act 21 (and became effective June 8, 2011), changes State agency authority to promulgate rules, provides for gubernatorial approval of proposed rules, revised the requirement of an economic impact analysis for proposed rules and changes venue in the process of judicial review of agency rules.{{Clarify|date=February 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Best, Michael|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/wisconsin-governor-walker-signs-regulatory-reform-bill-law|title=Wisconsin Governor Walker Signs Regulatory Reform Bill into Law|publisher=The National Law Review|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rejection of health care funds====
In January 2012, Walker returned a $37.6 million federal grant meant to set up a health exchange in Wisconsin for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; Walker said "Stopping the encroachment of Obamacare in our state, which has the potential to have a devastating impact on Wisconsin's economy, is a top priority."&lt;ref name="APACA"/&gt; Walker rejected an $11 million federal grant designed to improve Medicaid enrollment systems.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; It can take up to 3 months to determine whether an applicant qualifies for the program. If the applicant does not qualify, the state must pay the medical costs for the first three months. The Walker administration previously said it wants to end the practice of presuming some applicants are eligible and go to a real-time system for determining eligibility.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; Walker rejected an expansion of Medicaid coverage for the state, but instead reduced the eligibility requirements for the state's [[BadgerCare]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Spicuzza, Mary.

====Education====
On April 2, 2012, Walker signed a law to fund evaluation of the reading skills of kindergartners as part of an initiative to ensure that students are reading at or above grade level by 3rd grade. The law also created a system for evaluating teachers and principals based in part on the performance of their students. It specified that student performance metrics must be based on objective measures, including their performance on [[standardized tests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raymond Neupert|url=http://wdez.com/news/articles/2012/apr/02/walker-signs-reading-teacher-evaluation-bill|title=Walker signs reading, teacher evaluation bill|publisher=KDEZ|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker approved a two-year freeze of tuition at the University of Wisconsin System in the 2013 budget. In 2014, he proposed a two-year extension of the freeze based on expected cash balances for the system in excess of $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Stein|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-proposes-another-two-year-uw-system-tuition-freeze-b99245814z1-254902211.html|title=Scott Walker proposes another two year UW System tuition freeze|publisher=Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel|date=April 11, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2015, Walker delivered a budget proposal to the Wisconsin Legislature, in which he recommended placing the [[University of Wisconsin]] system under the direction of a "private authority", governed by the Board of Regents (all the governor's appointees). The budget proposal called for a 13% reduction in state funding for the university system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/walker-proposes-13-cut-more-freedom-for-uw-system-b99433644z1-289880441.html|title=Walker proposes 13% cut, more freedom for UW System|last=Bauer|first=Scott|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=January 27, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The budget proposal also called for re-writing the [[Wisconsin Idea]], replacing the university's fundamental commitment to the "search for truth" with the goal of [[Economy of the United States|workforce]] readiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/documents-show-walker-administration-seeking-removal-of-uws-wisconsin-idea-b99439710z1-290927651.html Walker administration seeking removal of UWS 'Wisconsin Idea'], jsonline.com; accessed February 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker faced broad criticism for the changes and at first blamed the rewriting of the Wisconsin Idea on a "drafting error."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/06/scott-walker/despite-deliberate-actions-scott-walker-calls-chan Despite deliberate actions, Walker calls proposed change to UW System administration a "drafting error"], politifact.com; accessed February 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politifact]] and the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' later reported that Walker's administration had insisted to University of Wisconsin officials on scrapping the Wisconsin Idea, the guiding principle for the state's universities for more than a century. Walker then acknowledged that UW System officials had raised objections about the proposal and had been told the changes were not open to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/documents-show-walker-administration-seeking-removal-of-uws-wisconsin-idea-b99439710z1-290927651.html|title=Walker forced to admit UW objected to Wisconsin Idea changes|last1=Stein|first1=Jason|last2=Marley|first2=Patrick|last3=Herzog|first3=Karen|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian gaming====
Section 20(b)(1)(A) of the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA) gives governors unrestricted authority to approve or veto any off-reservation tribal casino located in their state.&lt;ref name="wargames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittlesey|first1=Dennis J.|author2=Dickinson Wright PLLC|title=War Games in Wisconsin (2013 Style) Re: Indian Tribes|journal=The National Law Review|date=November 6, 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/war-games-wisconsin-2013-style-re-indian-tribes|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker has said he will only approve new off-reservation casino projects if they are supported by every tribe in the state. This has been referred to as the "Walker Rule".&lt;ref name="wargames"/&gt; In January 2015, Walker rejected a proposed casino in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-rejects-menominee-bid-for-kenosha-casino-b99431696z1-289587411.html Walker rejects proposed casino in Kenosha], jsonline.com; accessed March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker signed the 2011 state budget that de-funded [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin Cuts Funds to Planned Parenthood|first=Maggie|last=Fox|magazine=[[National Journal]]|date=June 26, 2011|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/healthcare/wisconsin-cuts-funds-to-planned-parenthood-20110626|accessdate=May 12, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506142952/http://www.nationaljournal.com/healthcare/wisconsin-cuts-funds-to-planned-parenthood-20110626|archivedate=May 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Walker signed a bill that requires women seeking abortions to undergo an [[ultrasound]] and doctors to show the women the image of the fetus.&lt;ref name="APoct22"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-outlines-abortion-gay-marriage-positions-in-letter-b99375704z1-279975922.html|title=Scott Walker outlines abortion, gay marriage positions in letter|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Walker signed a bill requiring abortion providers in Wisconsin to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The law was found unconstitutional by the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2015. The court found the medical justifications for such restrictions "nonexistent" and said they "cannot be taken seriously as a measure to improve women's health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marley|first1=Patrick|title=Judges: Wisconsin abortion admitting privileges law unconstitutional|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-abortion-admitting-privileges-law-unconstitutional-court-affirms-b99621967z1-353085451.html|accessdate=June 5, 2016|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled on ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', and struck down admitting privileges and other similar restrictions, finding that they were an unconstitutional "undue burden" on women. The day after delivering this decision, the Court refused to hear the Walker administration's appeal of the Seventh Circuit decision, leaving its finding of unconstitutionality in place. Walker blamed an "activist court" for finding his law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Jason|title=U.S. Supreme Court denies Wisconsin's appeal on abortion clinic restrictions|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/us-supreme-court-denies-wisconsins-appeal-on-abortion-clinic-restrictions-b99752440z1-384689071.html|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to work===

In 2012, regarding [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work legislation]], Walker told reporters at the state Republican Party convention that "It's not going to get to my desk&amp;nbsp;... I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure it isn't there because my focal point (is) private sector [[trade union|unions]] have overwhelmingly come to the table to be my partner in economic development."&lt;ref name="Kertscher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kertscher|first1=Tom|title=On supporting 2015 right to work legislation, a Scott Walker reversal|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/23/scott-walker/supporting-2015-right-work-legislation-scott-walke|website=Politifact.com|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning for re-election in 2014, Walker again said he had no plans to pursue right-to-work legislation focused on private unions.&lt;ref name=npr20150225/&gt;

Once the legislation was initiated in the state legislature, Walker stated: "I haven't changed my position on it, it just wasn't a priority for me. But should they pass it within the next two weeks, which is their target, I plan on signing it."&lt;ref name=npr20150225&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/02/25/389028488/wisconsin-governor-to-sign-right-to-work-bill-amid-protests Governor Walker signs right to work bill amid protests], npr.org, February 25, 2015; accessed March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2015, Walker signed legislation making Wisconsin a right-to-work state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/us/gov-scott-walker-of-wisconsin-signs-right-to-work-bill.html Governor Walker of Wisconsin signs right-to-work bill], nytimes.com, March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The law applied to private employee unions as well as public.&lt;ref name=aj20150309&gt;{{cite news|title=How Scott Walker won by dividing and conquering Wisconsin unions|date=March 9, 2015|first=Ned|last=Resnikoff|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/9/how-scott-walker-won-by-dividing-and-conquering-wisconsin-labor.html|accessdate=May 12, 2015|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once signed, Walker claimed partial credit for the right-to-work law.&lt;ref name=aj20150309/&gt; Politifact.com rated Walker's position on right-to-work as a "major reversal of position."&lt;ref name=Kertscher /&gt;

Three trade unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]], subsequently sued to get the law overturned as unconstitutional. In March 2015, the court declined the unions' request to put the law on hold until the lawsuit is settled.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Harris (March 19, 2015) [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-19/scott-walker-fights-labor-over-dues-as-presidential-race-looms Wisconsin Unions Lose Bid to Block Walker's Right-to-Work Law], Bloomberg.com; accessed May 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a protracted legal battle, in 2017 the U.S. appeals court in Chicago upheld Wisconsin’s  right-to-work law ending the substantive legal challenges to the law.

===WEDC===

{{main|Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation}}
In 2011, the WEDC was created by Walker as a quasi-public entity to replace the state's [[Wisconsin Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] with the objective of incenting job creation in Wisconsin. A 2013 report from the state's Legislative Audit Committee indicated that the organization gave some "grants, loans, and tax credits to ineligible recipients, for ineligible projects, and for amounts that exceeded specified limits." It also reported that WEDC "did not consistently perform statutorily required program oversight duties such as monitoring the contractually specified performance of award recipients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jason|last2=Marley|first2=Patrick|title=Wisconsin jobs agency failed in tracking taxpayer money, audit finds|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-jobs-agency-failed-in-tracking-taxpayer-money-audit-finds-9a9pl8g-205595881.html|website=jsonline.com|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Inc|accessdate=June 23, 2005|date=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swensen|first1=Dean|last2=Ramirez|first2=Zach|last3=Baker|first3=Kelly|last4=Kleinmaier|first4=Dan|last5=Klusmeier|first5=Amy|last6=Malone|first6=James|last7=Natzke|first7=Noah|last8=Reed|first8=Bob|last9=Schindler|first9=Jacob|last10=Tippens|first10=Georges|title=Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation|journal=Legislative Audit Bureau|date=May 1, 2013|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/13-7full.pdf|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wisconsin Public Radio, "The agency has been plagued by mismanagement and questions about handing out loans without properly vetting recipients."&lt;ref name=npr0721&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Pat|title=WEDC Selects Chairman To Replace Walker|url=http://www.wpr.org/wedc-selects-chairman-replace-walker|website=wpr.org|publisher=Wisconsin Public Radio|accessdate=July 21, 2015|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was reported that under Walker, WEDC gave out $124 million between the years 2011 and 2013 without formal review. Based on the 27 awards during that period, 2,100 jobs had been created to date out of a total expected of 6,100. $62.5 million was awarded to [[Kohl's]] to create 3,000 jobs as part of a headquarters expansion but only 473 had been created, $18 million was awarded to [[Kestrel K-350|Kestrel Aircraft]] which was supposed to create 665 jobs but only created 24, and $15 million went to Plexus Corp. to create 350 jobs, but created zero. In July 2013, WEDC adopted a new policy requiring written reviews on all program awards. According to WEDC, it had approved more than 760 reviewed awards under the new policy by June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tribune Wire Reports|title=Scott Walker's Wisconsin jobs agency gave out $124 million without review|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-scott-walker-jobs-agency-20150619-story.html|accessdate=June 25, 2015|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=June 19, 2015|quote=The three highest un-reviewed awards all came through the enterprise zone program.

The next highest was $18 million to Kestrel Aircraft Company for an expected 665 jobs, but just 24 have been created. The third highest was $15 million to Plexus Corp. to create 350 jobs, but none have been created, according to a tally provided by WEDC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker introduced a state budget in February 2015 which removed all of the elected officials from the board. This included removing himself from chairmanship of WEDC. This was revised by the Legislature's budget committee who altered it to only remove Walker. Walker signed the budget in July 2015.&lt;ref name=npr0721/&gt;

=== Foxconn plant ===
Walker approved an agreement with the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to set up a plant in Racine County. As part of the agreement, Foxconn was set to receive subsidies ranging from $3 billion to $4.8 billion (paid in increments if Foxconn met certain targets), which would be by far the largest subsidy ever given to a foreign firm in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/02/its-a-huge-subsidy-the-48bn-gamble-to-lure-foxconn-to-america|title='It's a huge subsidy': the $4.8bn gamble to lure Foxconn to America|last=Rushe|first=Dominic|date=2018-07-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-11-02|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/|title=$3B to Foxconn largest state 'gift' to a foreign company?|work=@politifact|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18027032/foxconn-wisconsin-plant-jobs-deal-subsidy-governor-scott-walker|title=Wisconsin’s $4.1 billion Foxconn factory boondoggle|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/did-scott-walker-and-donald-trump-deal-away-the-governors-race-to-foxconn|title=Did Scott Walker and Donald Trump Deal Away the Wisconsin Governor’s Race to Foxconn?|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxconn said in return that it would set up a $10 billion factory that initially employed 3,000 (set to increase to 13,000).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/07/26/scott-walker-heads-d-c-trump-prepares-wisconsin-foxconn-announcement/512077001/|title=Foxconn announces $10 billion investment in Wisconsin and up to 13,000 jobs|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous economists expressed skepticism that the benefits would exceed the costs of the deal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://econofact.org/the-geography-of-need-and-the-proposed-foxconn-deal-in-wisconsin|title=The Geography of Need and the Foxconn Deal in Wisconsin {{!}} Econofact|date=2017-08-28|work=Econofact|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wisconsin-taxpayers-need-to-pull-the-plug-on-this-con-of-a-foxconn-deal-2018-11-02|title=Wisconsin taxpayers need to pull the plug on this con of a Foxconn deal|last=Hicks|first=Michael J.|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/08/13/chowdhury-hype-and-reality-foxconn-deal/559484001/|title=Chowdhury: The hype and the reality of the Foxconn deal|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/09/06/government-incentives-to-attract-jobs-are-terrible-deals-for-taxpayers/1#5b7ad9526eff|title=Government Incentives To Attract Jobs Are Terrible Deals For Taxpayers|last=Dorfman|first=Jeffrey|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-06/wisconsin-s-deal-with-foxconn-is-the-worst-of-corporate-welfare|title=Wisconsin’s Deal With Foxconn Was as Bad as They Come|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonpartisan Wisconsin’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that the Foxconn plant would not break even on the investment until 2043, and that was in the best-case scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/10/16125792/apple-foxconn-wisconsin-deal-jobs-profitable-2043|title=Wisconsin won’t break even on Foxconn plant deal for over two decades|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that Foxconn had in the past made similar claims about job creation in various localities which did not turn out to be true.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/27/technology/business/foxconn-china-us-wisconsin-workers/|title=Foxconn invests in Wisconsin: Workers 'should be wary'|last=Griffiths|first=James|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Foxconn sought to locate a plant in the Great Lakes region, because it need access to large amounts of water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The other Great Lakes states were not willing to offer as generous subsidies as Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Initially, the subsidies were set at $3 billion, which would have cost the state $231,000 per job created (under the assumption of 13,000 jobs).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cost of the subsidies were higher than yearly state funding for the University of Wisconsin system and the state prisons.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Other estimates of the subsidies go as high as $4.8 billion, which meant that the cost of the subsidy per job (assuming 13,000 jobs) was more than $346,000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Depending on how many jobs are created, the cost per job may go as high as more than a million dollars.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In late January 2015, Walker set up a [[527 organization]] called "Our American Revival" to "help spread his message and underwrite his activities" which ''The Washington Post'' described as helpful for building the political and fundraising networks for a run for the presidency.&lt;ref name="balz529"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balz|first1=Dan|title=Scott Walker forms committee in preparation for 2016 presidential bid|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/27/scott-walker-forms-committee-in-preparation-for-2016-presidential-bid|accessdate=February 27, 2015|agency=''Washington Post''|date=January 27, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, [[Trip Gabriel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as having "quickly vaulted into the top tier of likely candidates in the Republican presidential race".&lt;ref name="nyt2-22-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gabriel|first1=Trip|title=Scott Walker Hardens Tone on Social Issues to Woo Christian Conservatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/scott-walker-hardens-tone-on-social-issues-to-woo-christian-conservatives.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|accessdate=February 22, 2015|agency=New York Times|date=February 22, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, at a fundraising event for the New York State Republican Party, [[David Koch]] told donors that he and his brother, who oversee one of the biggest private political organizations in the country, believed that Walker would be the Republican nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/20/koch-brothers-signal-support-for-scott-walker/?_r=0|title=Kochs Signal Support for Scott Walker|author=Nicholas Confessore|publisher=www.nytimes.com|date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a controversial statement by [[Rudy Giuliani]], Walker declined to answer the question of whether he believes [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] loves America or was a true Christian, stating that he did not know President Obama's patriotism was in doubt.&lt;ref name="nyt2-22-15"/&gt;

In June 2015, Walker took a further step towards a presidential campaign when he established a "testing-the-waters" federal campaign committee. This allowed him to raise federal campaign dollars as he explored a possible presidential run.&lt;ref name="nbcnews1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rafferty|first=Andrew|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/scott-walker-makes-another-move-towards-2016-run-n377641|title=Scott Walker Makes Another Move Towards 2016 Run|publisher=NBC News|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 18, 2015, Crowdpac ranked Walker as the fourth-most conservative candidate (following [[Rand Paul]], [[Ted Cruz]] and [[Ben Carson]]) for the 2016 presidential election based on an analysis of campaign donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Presidential Election|url=https://www.crowdpac.com/elections/2016-presidential-election|publisher=Crowdpac|date=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on an analysis including Crowdpac's rating, public statements by candidates on issues, and congressional voting (not applicable to Walker), [[FiveThirtyEight]] had ranked Walker the third-most conservative among candidates as of May 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Enten|first=Harry|date=June 4, 2015|title=Rick Perry Fell Harder Than Anyone — And He's The First To Try Again|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rick-perry-fell-harder-than-anyone-and-hes-the-first-to-try-again/|publisher=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Throughout his life and career, Walker has had a strong and consistent position against abortion.&lt;ref name="Remarkably"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scott Walker Outlines Abortion, Gay Marriage Positions in Letter | url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-outlines-abortion-gay-marriage-positions-in-letter-b99375704z1-279975922.html | date=October 22, 2014 | publisher=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' (from the [[Associated Press]]) | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Walker told the editorial board of the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' he opposed abortion, without exception for rape or incest.&lt;ref name="even in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APoct22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2-22-15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|title=Scott Walker Wants to Totally Outlaw Abortion.

In an interview with the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' a few weeks before the November 2014 election, Walker declined to answer directly when asked if abortion should be prohibited after 20 weeks.&lt;ref name="nyt2-22-15"/&gt; In July 2015, Walker signed a state law banning abortion after 20 weeks, including in cases of rape or incest but excluding when immediate danger existed to the life of the mother.&lt;ref name="20WeekBan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schleifer|first1=Theodore|title=Scott Walker: I would sign 20-week abortion ban|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/scott-walker-abortion-ban-20-weeks/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Walker moved to weaken [[tenure]] for professors at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and to cut its funding, while offering authority to reduce spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauer|first1=Scott|title=Walker proposes 13% cut, more freedom for UW System|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/walker-proposes-13-cut-more-freedom-for-uw-system-b99433644z1-289880441.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended deleting parts of the system's mission that contribute to the [[Wisconsin Idea]].  Parts of the mission proposed for deletion, such as the "search for truth," were to be replaced with a directive  "to meet the state's workforce needs." Walker later called the change a "drafting error," but public records requests and litigation showed that Walker himself and his office were "the driving force" behind the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marley|first1=Patrick|last2=Stein|first2=Jason|title=Records: Scott Walker wanted Wisconsin Idea changes|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/judge-orders-scott-walker-to-release-emails-on-wisconsin-idea-b99733921z1-381151041.html|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He supports the public funding of private schools and religious schools in the form of vouchers for students.

===Environment===
Walker signed a "No Climate Tax" pledge promising not to support any legislation that would raise taxes to [[Climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] and has been a keynote speaker at the [[Heartland Institute]], which promotes [[climate change denial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldmann|first1=Paul|title=Where the 2016 GOP contenders stand on climate change|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/05/12/where-the-2016-gop-contenders-stand-on-climate-change|accessdate=April 27, 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed funding cuts for clean energy and other environmental programs. He has proposed giving many powers of the Environmental Protection Agency to the states. He opposed the Obama administration's efforts to reduce [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref name=nyt713/&gt;

In 2015, Walker indicated that he favored providing arms to Ukraine to fight [[War in Donbass|Russian-backed separatists]] in that country.&lt;ref name=nyt713/&gt;

In 2015, Walker stated in an interview with [[Charlie Sykes]] that if elected president, he would "absolutely" decide on his first day in office to "cancel [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|any Iranian deal the Obama administration makes]]," even if European allies which were also party to an agreement opted not to reimpose [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/02/scott-walker-ill-blow-up-any-iran-deal-no-matter-what-our-european-allies-think|title=Scott Walker: I'll blow up any Iran deal, no matter what our European allies think|last1=Sargent|first1=Greg|date=April 2, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, Walker faulted Obama for lack of strategy in dealing with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] group,&lt;ref name=nyt713&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullany|first1=Gerry|title=Scott Walker on the issues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/us/politics/scott-walker-on-the-issues.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=July 13, 2015|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not rule out sending U.S. troops to Syria to engage in ground combat with ISIL there.&lt;ref name=nyt713/&gt; In February 2015, when asked about the [[Syrian civil war|war in Syria]], Walker said that the U.S. should "go beyond just aggressive air strikes.

In a 2015 interview, Walker said that "the most significant foreign policy decision" of his lifetime was President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[1981 air traffic controllers strike|firing 11,000 striking air traffic controllers]] in 1981, saying: "It sent a message not only across America, it sent a message around the world ...

In 2015, Walker opposed [[Cuban Thaw|rapprochement in relations between the U.S. and Cuba]].&lt;ref name=nyt713/&gt;

===Guns===
Walker has been strongly in favor of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]]. In July 2011, he signed a bill into law making Wisconsin the 49th [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] state in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stein | first1=Jason | title=Walker Signs Concealed-Carry Measure Into Law | url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/125235719.html | date=July 8, 2011|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 7 of that same year he signed the [[castle doctrine]] into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stein | first1=Jason | title=Walker Signs 'Castle Doctrine' Bill, Other Measures | url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-to-sign-castle-doctrine-bill-wednesday-bh3brej-135197918.html | date=December 7, 2011 | publisher=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' | accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January and April 2015 speeches in Iowa, Walker included passing those laws among his accomplishments.&lt;ref name=fox20150127&gt;{{cite news|title=Our American Revival: Gov.

On June 24, 2015, Walker signed two bills into law, one which removed the state's 48-hour waiting period for buying a gun and another which gave retired or off-duty police officers the legal right to carry concealed guns in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Strauss | first1=Daniel | title=Scott Walker Signs Two Pro-Gun Bills | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/scott-walker-two-gun-bills-119380 | date=June 24, 2015 | newspaper=Politico| accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker opposes the Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare") and has signed Wisconsin onto a lawsuit seeking to have the ACA rolled back (including provisions for preexisting conditions).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/18/tony-evers/scott-walker-says-he-would-cover-pre-existing-cond/|title=Scott Walker backs plans to end pre-existing protections?|work=PolitiFact|date=October 18, 2018|author=Tom Kertscher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-republicans-medicaid-20181101-story.html|title=Republican candidates say they would protect sick Americans but fight coverage for poorest patients |last=Levey|first=Noam N.|website=Los Angeles Times|date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the [[Graham–Cassidy health care amendment|Graham-Cassidy legislation]] to repeal the ACA; this repeal bill would have eliminated blanket protections for preexisting conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2018, Walker pledged to pass legislation to protect individuals with preexisting conditions in case the Affordable Care Act were repealed; according to PolitiFact, "he hasn’t spelled out an alternative that would provide protections that Obamacare does."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As Governor, he has blocked [[Medicaid expansion|expansion of Medicaid]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Immigration===

====Illegal immigration====
Walker has stated that securing the United States border with Mexico is "our first priority". After that, [[illegal immigrants in the United States]] could "secure their citizenship" but would have to "get in the back of line", and wait like anyone else applying for citizenship.&lt;ref name="immigration"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/26/politics/election-2016-scott-walker-immigration/index.html Scott Walker comments on immigration], cnn.com; accessed April 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker says that he does not advocate deportation for all people in the country illegally, but he is not in favor of amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/scott-walker-believe-candidate-stands-10-issues|title=What does Scott Walker believe?

In a 2015 appearance on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Walker said proposals to build a wall along the {{convert|5525|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[Canada–United States border]] was "a legitimate issue for us to look at."&lt;ref&gt;Walker quickly switched the subject to the Middle East, rebuilding the military, and national security. The exchange about Canada never even made it to air. It was edited out of the interview highlights that ran on ''Meet The Press'', and was posted on NBC's website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradner|first=Eric|title=Scott Walker: U.S.-Canada Wall a 'legitimate' Idea|publisher=CNN|date=August 30, 2015|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/30/politics/scott-walker-northern-border-immigration-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal immigration====
Walker has stated that he would work to "protect American workers" by aligning his position with Sen. [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-AL), who wrote in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' op-ed that legal immigration needs to be "slowed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/slow-the-immigration-wave/2015/04/09/c6d8e3d4-dd52-11e4-a500-1c5bb1d8ff6a_story.html|title=America needs to curb immigration flows|website=washingtonpost.com|date=April 21, 2015|first=Jeff|last=Sessions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
Walker says he believes in "marriage between one man and one woman".&lt;ref name=nyt713/&gt; Walker voted for Wisconsin's constitutional amendment to ban [[same-sex marriage]], both as a legislator and as a voter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Washington Blade]]|date=April 30, 2015|first=Chris|last=Johnson|title=Walker calls for federal amendment against same-sex marriage|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/04/30/walker-calls-for-fedl-amendment-against-same-sex-marriage|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=politico20150426&gt;{{cite news|title=In Iowa, GOP field stresses opposition to same-sex marriage|first=James|last=Hohmann|date=April 26, 2015|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/iowa-faith-freedom-summit-2015-117346.html|accessdate=May 12, 2015|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Walker said he was defending the amendment.&lt;ref name="APoct22"/&gt; When the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently rejected the appeals of five states, including Wisconsin, in October 2014, allowing same-sex marriages to continue, Walker stated: "I think it's resolved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gay-marriages-to-resume-in-wisconsin-as-supreme-court-rejects-appeals-b99365650z1-278229621.html Gay marriages to resume in Wisconsin as US Supreme Court rejects appeal], jsonline.com; accessed March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, in [[New Hampshire]], Walker stated that marriage is "defined as between a man and a woman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage debate forces GOP contenders to tread carefully|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/same-sex-marriage-snarls-gop-contenders/2015/04/24/6b5a8d18-ea8c-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html|first1=Sandhya|last1=Somashekhar|first2=Robert|last2=Costa|date=April 24, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iowa said a federal constitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage was reasonable.&lt;ref name=politico20150426/&gt; Walker called the U.S. Supreme Court's ''[[Obergefell v.

===Youth rights===
On May 24, 2017, Walker signed a bill that allowed unaccompanied [[minor (law)|minors]] to attend [[concert]]s and other musical festivals where [[alcohol]] is being served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2017/05/24/gov-scott-walker-signs-bill-allowing-minors-at-music-festivals/?fref=gc|title=Gov.

During the summers of 2004 through 2009, as Milwaukee County Executive, Walker led a motorcycle tour called the "Executive's Ride" through Wisconsin and parts of neighboring states.

[[File:StephenPearlAndrews.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Pearl Andrews]]
'''Stephen Pearl Andrews''' (March 22, 1812&amp;nbsp;– May 21, 1886) was an American [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], [[linguist]], political philosopher, outspoken [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and author of several books on the [[labor movement]] and Individualist anarchism.

== Early life and work ==
Andrews was born in [[Templeton, Massachusetts]] on March 22, 1812, "the youngest of eight children of the Reverend Elisha Andrews and his wife, Ann Lathrop."&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Stephen Pearl Andrews's Fleeting Contribution to Anarchist Thought |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=April 1, 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5161/Stephen-Pearl-Andrewss-Fleeting-Contribution-to-Anarchist-Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up thirty-five miles northeast in [[Hinsdale, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; Andrews went to [[Louisiana]] at age 19 and studied and practiced law there. Appalled by slavery, he became an abolitionist. He was the first counsel of Mrs. [[Myra Clark Gaines]] in her celebrated suits. Having moved to Texas in 1839, Andrews and his family were almost killed because of his abolitionist lectures and had to flee in 1843. Andrews travelled to England where he was unsuccessful at raising funds for the abolitionist movement back in America.

While in England, Andrews became interested in [[Isaac Pitman|Pitman's]] new [[shorthand]] writing system and upon his return to the U.S. he taught and wrote about the shorthand writing system, and devised a popular system of phonographic reporting. To further this, he published a series of instruction books and edited two journals, ''[[The Anglo-Saxon]]'' and ''[[The Propagandist]]''. He devised a "scientific" language, "Alwato," in which he was wont to converse and correspond with pupils. At the time of his death, Andrews was compiling a dictionary of Alwato, which was published posthumously. A remarkable [[Linguistics|linguist]], he also became interested in phonetics and the study of foreign languages, eventually teaching himself "no fewer than 32" languages.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;

By the end of the 1840s, he began to focus his energies on utopian communities. Fellow [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]] was responsible for Andrew's conversion to radical individualism, and in 1851 they established [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]] in [[Brentwood, New York#History|Brentwood, NY]]. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1846.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857 Andrews established [[Unity Home]] in New York City. By the 1860s he was propounding an ideal society called [[Pantarchy]] which is a society with a voluntarty government strongly connected with a New Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pearl Andrews, Constitution or Organic Basis of the Pantarchy (New York: Baker &amp; Godwin, printers, 1860).&lt;/ref&gt; and from this he moved on to a philosophy he called "[[universology]]", which stressed the unity of all knowledge and activities. He was also "among the first Americans to discover [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and the first to publish his ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in the U.S."&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;

Andrews was one of the first to use the word "[[Scientology (disambiguation)|scientology]]".  The word is defined as a [[neologism]] in his 1871 book ''The Primary Synopsis of Universology and Alwato: The New Scientific Universal Language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Wage theory ==
{{See also|Just wage theory}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar}}

Like most of the nineteenth century individualist anarchists, and unlike the [[anarcho-communists]], Andrews supported the right of employment and [[wage labor]]. However, he believed that, in the system within which he was living, individuals were not receiving a wage commensurate with the amount of labor they exerted. He said:

{{quote|The 'Wages System' is essentially proper and right. It is a right to that one man employ another, it is right that he pay him wages, and it is right that he direct him absolutely, arbitrarily, if you will, in the performance of his labor, while, on the other hand, it is the business of him who is employed implicitly to obey, that is, to surrender any will of his own in relation to a design not his own, and to conceive and execute the will of the other...It is right that the great manufacturer should plan, and either alone, or through the aid of assistants under his direction, organize his mammoth establishment. It is right that he should employ and direct his hundreds, or his five hundred men...It is not in any, nor in all of these features combined, that the wrong of our present system is to be sought and found. It is in the simply failure to do Equity. It is not that men are employed and paid, but that they are not paid justly...&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Stephen Pearl. ''The Science of Society''. Nichols, 1854. p. 210–11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Andrews, to be paid "justly" was to be paid according to the "Cost Principle," which held that individuals should be paid according to the amount of labor they exert rather than according to the benefit that another receives from that labor (the latter being called the "Value Principle"). To help make this simple, he, after Josiah Warren, advocated an economy that uses "[[labor notes (currency)|labor notes]]". Labor notes are a form of currency marked in labor hours (adjusted for different types of labor based on their difficulty or repugnance). In this way, it is not how much the employer values the employee's labor that determines the employee's pay, but simply how much the employee has labored. For similar reasons he did not believe people should be paid [[interest]] for loaning capital; in other words, he did not see the loaning of capital as requiring any labor or deprivation on the part of the loaner. He insisted that the benefit received from goods or labor is not a just measure of price.&lt;ref&gt;As explained in ''The Science of Society'' by Stephen Pearl Andrews. Nichols, 1854. pp. 186–214&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Every variety of interpretation has been put upon my opinions, usually the least favorable which the imagination of the writer could devise, with a view, apparently, of cultivating still further the natural prejudice existing in the public mind against any one bold enough to agitate the delicate and difficult question of the true relations of the sexes, and the legitimate role which the Passions were intended to play in the economy of the Universe.

In the absence of any readiness on the part of the public to know the truth on the subject, false, extravagant and ridiculous notions have flooded the country in its stead.

I reject and repudiate the interference of the State, precisely as I do the interference of the Church.

A grand social revolution will occur. Tyranny of all kinds will disappear, freedom of all kinds will be revered, and none will be ashamed to confess that they believe in the Freedom of Love.}}

Andrews was following Josiah Warren's labor theory of value&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Stephen Pearl. ''The Science of Society''. Leopold Classic Library, Middletown, DE. 2016. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and hence Andrews' Individualist Anarchism is considered a form of economic [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James J. ''Men Against the State''. Ralph Myles Publisher, Inc. Colorado Springs. 1970. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susana Natividad Rinaldi''' (born December 25, 1935) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Tango music|tango]] singer.

==Biography==
Susana Natividad Rinaldi was born to a wealthy father and a poor mother in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1935. Dubbed "La Tana" (in reference to her Italian origins), she spent her childhood moving throughout different provinces of Argentina. She began studying chamber singing at the [[Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música (Argentina)|National Conservatory of Music]] at age 14, and in 1955 she entered the [[IUNA|School of Dramatic Art]]. Two years later, she made her [[Television in Argentina|television]] debut and in 1959 debuted on the [[Theatre in Argentina|stage]]. When she was asked to record a poetry concert in 1966 she offered them a tango album, and by the end of that year her first album, with music arranged by [[bandoneón]] virtuoso [[Roberto Pansera]], was released.

Her success over time prompted her to give up acting and to instead pursue a career as a singer. After touring Argentine tango bars and [[milonga (place)|milongas]], Rinaldi gained fame as a singer during the late 1960s. She called the attention of her audience by singing tangos which up to then had only been sung by men, including standards by [[José María Contursi]], [[Enrique Santos Discépolo]], [[Homero Manzi]], and [[Cátulo Castillo]]. This gave her a deserved reputation among a new audience made up mostly of young university students. She achieved fame when she incorporated into her repertoire songs by new authors, such as [[Eladia Blázquez]], Osvaldo Avena, Héctor Negro, and Chico Novarro.

She and her husband, bandoneón virtuoso [[Osvaldo Piro]], established Magoya, a [[café concert]] in seaside [[Mar del Plata]], in 1971. Following the [[March 1976 coup]], however, Rinaldi was forced to leave the country. After a long stay in [[Paris]], she returned to Argentina in 1989 with an innovative idea of a tango-show. Due to this, she was again rejected by traditional tango listeners, although she did become one of the main figures in the tango renewal movement of the time.

An artist with a political conscience, she supported her ideals through music in international concert tours and as [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]] since 1992. Her tireless defense of [[human rights in Argentina|human rights]] and her passionate promotion of a more just and peaceful world earned her the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires in 1990. Other distinctions earned during her lengthy career include the [[SADAIC]] Grand Prize in 1969 and 1999; and the [[Konex Award]] in 1985, 2001, and 2005.

'''Tevfik Esenç''' (1904 – 7 October 1992) was a [[Circassians|Circassian]] exile in [[Turkey]] and the last known fully competent speaker of the [[Ubykh language]].

==Biography==
Esenç was raised by his Ubykh-speaking grandparents for a time in the village of [[Hacı Osman]] in Turkey, and he served a term as the ''muhtar'' (mayor) of that village, before receiving a post in the [[civil service]] of [[Istanbul]]. There, he was able to do a great deal of work with the [[France|French]] [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Georges Dumézil]] and his associate [[Georges Charachidzé]] to help record his language.&lt;ref name=TECW&gt;[https://circassianworld.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/tevfik-esenc-the-last-person-able-to-speak-the-ubykh-language/ Tevfik Esenç's page in Circassian World]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all the writings of Charachidzé (1930-2010) have been published. Others who met Esenç and produced work on Ubykh are: the Norwegian Hans Vogt (1911–92) (see his ‘[http://apsnyteka.org/file/Vogt_Dictionnaire_de_la_langue_Oubykh.pdf Dictionnaire de la Langue Oubykh]’, 1963, Universitetsvorlaget); the British [http://georgehewitt.net George Hewitt], who in [http://georgehewitt.net/articles/miscellaneous/288-turkey-summer-of-1974 1974 visited] Hacı Osman Köyü and made recordings with Esenç in Istanbul ([http://georgehewitt.net/multimedia/recordings/281-george-hewitt-s-recordings-from-turkey-1974 the recordings are available] on the Net; his account of his meetings in 1974 has been published — ‘Encounterng Ubykh(s)’, in ''Arxeologija i ètnografija pontijsko-kavkazskogo regiona 5'', 195-204, 2016: Krasnodar; see also his ‘The labialised sibilants of Ubykh (North West Caucasian)’, in ''Revue des Etudes Géorgiennes et Caucasiennes, 2'', 1986, 21-30); the Abkhazian Viacheslav Chirikba, who has written on Ubykh settlements and [https://www.academia.edu/31381655/A_Dictionary_of_Ubykh_Personal_Names._-_Ubykh_Etudes._IV._Словарь_убыхских_личных_имен._-_Убыхские_этюды._IV Ubykh surnames]; the Turkish A. Sumru Özsoy.

Having an excellent memory and understanding quickly the goals of Dumézil and the other linguists who came to visit him, he was the primary source of not only the Ubykh language, but also of the [[mythology]], [[culture]] and customs of the [[Ubykh people]]. He spoke not only Ubykh, but also the [[Hakuchi Adyghe|Hakuchi]] dialect of [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]], allowing some comparative work to be done between these two members of the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] family. He was also a fluent speaker of Turkish. He was a purist, and his [[idiolect]] of Ubykh was considered by Dumézil as the closest thing to a standard "literary" Ubykh language that existed.&lt;ref name=TECW/&gt; He is perhaps single-handedly responsible for the world's current knowledge of Ubykh being much more extensive and detailed than it would otherwise be.

Esenç died in 1992 at the age of 88. The inscription that he wanted on his gravestone read as follows:&lt;ref name=TECW/&gt;

{{Quote|''This is the grave of Tevfik Esenç. He was the last person able to speak the language they called Ubykh.''|Gravestone|inscription}}

In 1994, A. Sumru Özsoy organized an international conference, namely Conference on Northwest Caucasian Linguistics, at [[Boğaziçi University]] in memory of Dumézil and Esenç.&lt;ref name="koe"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SYou4fhWUgC&amp;pg=PA33|title=First Person Singular III: Autobiographies by North American Scholars in the Language Sciences|author=E.

'''Tillie Paul''' (January 18, 1863 – August 20, 1952) was a [[Tlingit]] [[translator]], [[Civil rights history|civil rights advocate]], [[educator]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church elder.

==Early life and education==
Matilda Kinnon was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], the younger daughter of a Tlingit mother named Kut-XooX, and a [[Scotland|Scottish]] father named James Kinnon, who was employed by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].&lt;ref name="Jones2"&gt;Cherry Lyon Jones, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pWK9AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=d-URRZeb0s&amp;dq=Matilda%20Kinnon%20Paul&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage "Matilda Kinnon 'Tillie' Paul Tamaree"] in ''More Than Petticoats: Remarkable Alaska Women'' (Globe Pequot 2014): 11-20. {{ISBN|9780762774302}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her mother fell ill with [[tuberculosis]], she arranged to bring Tillie and her sister north to be raised by Tlingit relatives. Aided by a clansman, Kut-Xoox traveled by canoe with her two daughters along the [[Inside Passage]], a journey of 600 miles. After her mother's death, young Tillie was raised by a maternal aunt, Xoon-sel-ut, and her uncle, Chief Snook of the [[Naanya.aayi]], a clan of the [[Stikeen-quann]], near [[Wrangell, Alaska]]. Her adoptive family gave her the name Kah-thli-yudt, soon shortened to "Kah-tah-ah."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Haa k̲usteeyí, our culture : Tlingit life stories|last=Dauenhauer, Nora Marks and Richard Dauenhauer, eds.|first=|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1994|isbn=0295974001|location=Juneau, Alaska|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillie lived in Wrangell until she was 12 years old, when she received a marriage proposal from a Christian [[Tsimshian|Tsimishian]] chief, Abraham Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt; Her uncle consented to the marriage, but Tillie was ambivalent. They arranged that she would travel south to Lincoln's home in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] with the understanding that no marriage would take place against her will. After her decision not to marry, when she was no longer under the care of the Tsimishian, she went to live with a Methodist minister and his wife, missionaries at [[Lax Kw'alaams|Port Simpson]], British Columbia. There, she relearned English and was schooled in Christian worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wise women: from Pocahontas to Sarah Winnemucca, remarkable stories of Native American trailblazers|last=Turner, Erin, ed.|first=|publisher=TwoDot|year=2009|isbn=9780762755387|location=Guilford, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family arranged for her return to Wrangell and she was admitted to [[Amanda McFarland|Amanda McFarland's]] Presbyterian Home and School for Girls, where she started using the name "Tillie Kinnon." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Female Native Teachers in Southeast Alaska: Sarah Dickinson, Tillie Paul, and Frances Willard," in Margaret Connell Szasz, ed., Between Indian and White Worlds|last=Wyatt|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1994|isbn=0806133856|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching and missionary work ==
While at the McFarland School, Tillie worked as an interpreter for clergyman [[S. Hall Young]] in and around Wrangell. She married Louis Francis Paul and in 1882 the two became the first Native couple to be commissioned by the [[Presbyterian Board of Home Missions]] to found a new missionary school. Located in [[Klukwan, Alaska|Klukwan, Alaska,]] the school served 64 men and women; Tillie and her husband visited homes three times a week, sharing just twelve textbooks among their students. The couple opened a second school in the [[Tongass National Forest|Tongass]] region of Alaska, where Paul's family lived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Paul died in 1886, presumably drowned while scouting for a new school location. However, a contemporary biographer of Tillie Paul's, [[Mary Lee Davis House|Mary Lee Davis]], suggests that his death was a suspicious one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=We Are Alaskans|last=Davis|first=Mary (Caldwell)|publisher=W. A. Wilde Co.|year=1931|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's death left Tillie with three young sons to care for on her own. She moved to [[Sitka, Alaska]] to work at [[Sheldon Jackson College|Sitka Industrial Training School,]] invited by [[Sheldon Jackson]], a missionary and the General Agent of Education for the [[Territory of Alaska|Alaskan Territory]]. There, she performed a range of tasks, acting as an interpreter, supervising sewing classes, serving as a nurse in the boy's hospital ward, and eventually becoming matron of the girl's dormitory.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Haa k̲usteeyí, our culture : Tlingit life stories|last=Dauenhauer, Nora Marks and Richard Dauenhauer, eds.|first=|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1994|isbn=0295974001|location=Juneau, Alaska|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her years in Sitka, she worked with a fellow teacher, [[Fanny Willard]], to create a writing system for Tlingit language and together they compiled a Tlingit dictionary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She published several articles about Tlingit culture in the Presbyterian newspaper, ''The North Star''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and lectured on Tlingit culture in Sitka as a member of the Society of Alaskan Natural History and Ethnology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3761386/tillie_paul_donated_baskets_to_sheldon/ "Tlingit Baskets to be Displayed"] ''Sitka Daily Sentinel'' (March 7, 1997): 6. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tillie also learned to play the organ, becoming proficient enough to accompany school and church events. Some of her translated hymns and prayers are still in use among Tlingit Christians today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tillie traveled on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, attending its General Assembly in New York City at least twice. In 1902, she was invited to address the Assembly on the subject of women's role in the church.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt;

In 1931, Tillie Paul was the first woman ordained as an elder in the [[Alaska Northwest Synod]] of the Presbyterian Church, in the first year that Presbyterian women could be so ordained.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt;

== Civil rights advocacy ==
[[File:Tillie Paul and her son William.jpg|thumb|Tillie Paul and her son William]]
In 1905, Tillie founded the New Covenant Legion, a Christian temperance organization intended to reach Native communities considered especially at risk from alcohol abuse, with George Beck, a student at the Sitka school. The New Covenant Legion in turn became the [[Alaska Native Brotherhood/Sisterhood|Alaska Native Brotherhood]] (ANB) and Alaska Native Sisterhood, the first advocacy organizations for [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] rights. Tillie's sons, [[William Paul (attorney)|William Paul]] and Louis Paul, were leaders in the ANB as were many of the students Tillie taught at the Sitka school. While her sons are generally given credit for transforming the ANB from a service organization to a political one, Tillie's influence in shaping these leaders was recognized by her contemporaries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Politics and the Mass Media: Alaska Native Voices|last=Daley, Patrick J. and Beverly A. James|first=|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2004|isbn=0252029380|location=Urbana, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1922, Tillie assisted a Tlingit relative, Charlie Jones, to vote, after he was refused by election officials in Wrangell. Both were charged with felonies: Charlie Jones for "falsely swearing to be a citizen" and voting illegally and Tillie for aiding and abetting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/WilliamLewisPaul/021609_william_paul.html|title=William Paul Was The "Father of Native Land Claims"|last=Kiffer|first=Dave|date=February 16, 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son William, by this time an attorney, defended them both at a trial that took place in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] in 1923. The case hinged on the definition of Native citizenship, which, until 1915, had been determined by the [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]]. That act required Native people to sever tribal ties in order to be recognized as citizens. By 1915, the Alaska Territory had passed the [[Alaska Citizenship Act of 1915|Alaska Citizenship Act.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.alaska.gov/hist/fulltext/ASL-KFA-1225.A3-1915.htm|title=1915 Alaska Citizenship Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only recognized Native people as citizens under strict conditions, including the endorsement of at least five white citizens, certain testing requirements, as well as proof that they had "adopted the habits of civilization." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Battle Over Bilingual Ballots: Language Minorities and Political Access|last=Tucker|first=James Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=0754675726|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Paul argued that Jones fulfilled the requirements of citizenship under Dawes, insofar as he owned a house, paid taxes, made charitable contributions, and, generally "lived like a white person." Judge Thomas Reed ruled that Dawes preempted the 1915 Citizenship Act. Effectively, this meant that the territorial government could not add procedures such as endorsement by white citizens, testing, or obtaining a certificate of citizenship if the requirements for citizenship under Dawes were met. Tillie Paul Tamaree and Charlie Jones were acquitted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his ruling, Judge Reed wrote that "if you find that the defendant Charley (sic) Jones was born within the limits of the United States, then you must conclude that the said Charley Jones was born under and within the terms of the [[Citizenship Clause|1st Section of the 14th Amendment]]." In 1924, the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] conferred citizenship on all Native Americans born within the United States and its territories, extending the franchise, but not completely eradicating further attempts to limit Native American's right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Metcalfe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=83v8CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Tillie%20Paul%20Tamaree&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=Tillie%20Paul%20Tamaree&amp;f=false ''A Dangerous Idea: The Alaska Native Brotherhood and the Struggle for Indigenous Rights''] (University of Alaska Press 2014): 20. {{ISBN|9781602232402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Fletcher, [http://juneauempire.com/art/2015-05-13/breathing-life-history-locals-gather-remember-tlingit-civil-rights-hero-william-paul "Tlingit Civil Rights Hero William Paul Sr. Remembered"] ''Juneau Empire'' (May 12, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and legacy==
[[File:Tille Paul Manor.jpg|thumb|Tillie Paul Manor]]
In 1882, Tillie Kinnon married Louis Francis Paul, with whom she had three sons.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt;

In 1887, Tille was widowed.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt;

In 1905, Tillied married again to William Tamaree, with whom she had three daughters.&lt;ref name="Jones2" /&gt;

In 1924, Tillie's son, William became the first Alaska Native elected to the territorial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Finding aid, [http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv32848 William Lewis Paul Papers], University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Tillie Paul died at a hospital in Wrangell, age 90.

In 1979, an infirmary building on the campus of Sheldon Jackson College was named for Tillie Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3761301/campus_building_named_for_tillie_paul/ "SJ Names Place to Honor Tlingit Woman, Tillie Paul"] ''Daily Sitka Sentinel'' (October 19, 1979): 5. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, her daughter-in-law, Frances Lackey Paul, published a children's book, Kahtahah, based on her mother-in-law's early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Kahtahah-Frances-Lackey-Paul/dp/0882400584|title=Kahtahah, Frances Lackey Paul|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Sheldon Jackson School was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/places/sheldon-jackson-school.htm|title=Sheldon Jackson School National Historic Landmark|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Tillie Paul's great-granddaughter, Debra O'Gara, was named Tribal Court Presiding Judge by the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Raeanne Holmes, [http://alaska-native-news.com/debra-ogara-hired-as-tribal-court-presiding-judge-19869 "Debra O'Gara Hired as Tribal Court Presiding Judge"] ''Alaska Native News'' (October 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter J. Kauzmann''' (18 August 1916 – 27 January 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]] and professor emeritus of [[Princeton University]]. He was noted for his work in both [[physical chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]].  His most important contribution was recognizing that the [[hydrophobic effect]] plays a key role in determining the three-dimensional [[Protein structure|structure of proteins]].&lt;ref name = "Hydrophobic_effect"&gt;Walter Kauzmann, Some Factors in the Interpretation of Protein Denaturation, ''Advances in Protein Chemistry'' (1959) Vol. 14, pgs 1–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also well known for an insight into the nature of [[supercooled liquid]]s which is now known as [[Glass transition#Kauzmann's paradox|Kauzmann's paradox]].&lt;ref name = "Kauzmann_Paradox"&gt;[Walter Kauzmann, The Nature of the Glassy State and the Behavior of Liquids at Low Temperatures, Chemical Reviews (1948), Vol 43, pg. 219.]&lt;/ref&gt;  At Princeton, Kauzmann was the David B. Jones Professor Emeritus of Chemistry.  He chaired the Department of Chemistry from 1964 to 1968 and the Department of Biochemical Sciences from 1980 to 1981.

He was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York]] and grew up in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. He was the son of the German-born Albert F. Kauzmann, who came to the United States in 1895, and Julia (Kahle) Kauzmann.   Albert operated a gem-importing business in [[Lower Manhattan]] and would often bring his son to work on Saturday mornings. They would spend the afternoon at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] or attend a matinee at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], nurturing Walter's lifelong love of science and music.

Kauzmann earned a B.A. degree in 1937 from [[Cornell University]], which he attended on a full scholarship. He started his doctoral work at Princeton University in [[organic chemistry]], but switched to physical chemistry, earning a Ph.D. in 1940 under the direction of [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]].   Following his Ph.D., Kauzmann had a two-year postdoctoral appointment in Pittsburgh as a Westinghouse Research Fellow, in the laboratory led by [[Edward U. Condon]].  It was during this period that Kauzmann wrote his now classic paper on supercooled liquids and glasses that contained the Kauzmann paradox.&lt;ref name = "Kauzmann_Paradox" /&gt;  At the end of this fellowship, with the U.S. fighting [[Second World War|WWII]], Kauzmann joined the U.S. government's National Defense Research Council laboratory in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]], which was directed by [[George Kistiakowsky]], and worked on [[chemical explosive]]s.

In 1944, Kauzmann was recruited into the top secret [[Manhattan Project]] and he moved to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].  Eventually, Kauzmann was put in charge of producing the detonator for the [[Trinity test]], which was the first detonation of an [[atomic bomb]], and of the ([[Fat Man]]) plutonium bomb that was dropped on [[Nagasaki, Japan]].   Kauzmann witnessed the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, and his memories were recorded in a newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html Jon Blackwell, 1944: Brain power into nuclear power, ''The Trentonian'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifty years later, Kauzmann discussed why he worked on the atomic bomb:

"But there was another, even stronger reason that many of us felt justified our working as hard as we could on the bomb. It was felt that if it were possible to make atomic bombs, somewhere, someday, someone would figure out how to do it and some country would proceed to make them.  If this were done after World War II was over, the bomb would very likely be made as a secret weapon. This would inevitably lead to World War III. Therefore, there were strong reasons for trying to make the bomb - and use it - before the end of World War II. The people of the world would then know the terrible thing that could be unleashed if there were a World War III. And the politicians could then be encouraged to try to do something about preventing World War III." &lt;ref&gt;Walter Kauzmann’s [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121599163/PDFSTART Reminiscences from a life in protein physical chemistry], Protein Science (1993) Vol 2, pgs 671-691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Kauzmann returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and remained on the Princeton Faculty throughout his long academic career. His work was centered in the area of [[biophysical chemistry]], particularly the studies of the structure and [[thermodynamics]] of proteins.  His insight that hydrophobic interactions play a key role in stabilizing protein structure was made before [[X-ray crystallography]] provided the first three-dimensional structures of proteins.&lt;ref name = "Hydrophobic_effect" /&gt;  Kauzmann's model, that proteins fold to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] ones, has stood the test of time &lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tanford|Tanford, C.]] &amp; Reynolds, J. Nature's Robots: A History of Proteins Ch. 12 (Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the key principles of [[de novo protein structure prediction]]. Kauzmann became an emeritus professor in 1982.

His first book, ''Quantum Chemistry'', was published in 1957, followed by ''The Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1966) and ''Thermodynamics and Statistics'' (1967).  With [[David Eisenberg]], a former postdoctoral fellow of Kauzmann, he wrote ''The Structure and Properties of Water'' (1969), a book reissued in 2005 by Oxford University Press as part of its Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences series.   The first three are textbooks for undergraduate physical chemistry, which Kauzmann taught at Princeton for many years.  Kauzmann's pedagogy is discussed in an article by [[Bruce Alberts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Alberts, Walter Kauzmann’s contribution to the future of science: a personal recollection, Biophysical Chemistry (2003) Vol. 105, pgs. 175-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kauzmann married Elizabeth Flagler Kauzmann, then a research assistant in the laboratory of Frank Johnson in the Princeton Biology Department, in April, 1951.  Elizabeth died in 2004 after more than 50 years of marriage.  They are survived by two sons, a daughter, and eight grandchildren.  They summered on [[Cape Breton Island]], and eventually donated {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of their property to the Nova Scotia Nature Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsnt.ca/ourwork/explorer/?id=12 Nova Scotia Nature Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Pope McArthur''' (April 2, 1814 – December 23, 1850) was an [[United States Navy|American naval]] officer and [[hydrologist]] who was involved in the first surveys of the [[Pacific Coast]] for the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]].

==Early life==
McArthur was born in [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]] to John and Mary (Linn) McArthur. McArthur's maternal uncle, [[Lewis Fields Linn|Dr. Lewis F. Linn]], was [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] for [[Missouri]]. At Linn's request, McArthur was appointed [[Midshipman]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] on February 11, 1832.  In 1837 he attended the Naval School at [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

During the [[Second Seminole War]] (1837–1838), McArthur was promoted to the temporary rank of Lieutenant and placed in command of a small craft.  Among the passengers was [[Joseph E. Johnston]], who accompanied the vessel as a civilian topographical engineer.  He later served as a general in the US Army and then the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=LM&gt;McArthur, Lewis [http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/mcarthur_pacificcoast.html ''Pacific Coast Survey of 1849 and 1850''] Private history 1915 NOAA.gov retrieved December 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

McArthur was wounded in both legs by Seminole at [[Jupiter, Florida]].  While one musket ball was pulled from one leg, a ball remained in the other leg. He was sent to the Naval Hospital in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] for treatment and convalescence. There he met, courted, and married Mary Stone Young, the daughter of the Superintendent of the Hospital. Among their children was [[Lewis Linn McArthur]], an [[Oregon Supreme Court]] Justice.

In 1840 he began a survey of the [[Gulf Of Mexico]] aboard the brig ''[[USS Consort (1836)|Consort]]''.

==Survey of the Pacific Coast==
[[File:Cape Disappointment1.jpg|thumb|Cape Disappointment Lighthouse]]
On October 27, 1848 [[Alexander Dallas Bache|A.D. Bache]], Superintendent U.S. Coast Survey, instructed him to go to San Francisco, California to begin "the survey of the Western Coast of the United States."&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;

After sailing from New York McArthur was delayed in Panama by the influx of settlers in the [[California Gold Rush]]. In Panama, McArthur was asked  to captain a former coal storage ship to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; The ''von Humboldt''  left Panama on May 21, 1849 and took 102 days to arrive at San Francisco, the first 46 of which were spent getting to the Mexican port of Acapulco.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; Among the four hundred passengers on ''von Humboldt'' were [[Collis P. Huntington]], the future president of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and San Francisco Society portrait painter [[Stephen William Shaw|Stephen W. Shaw]].

In September 1849, [[Lieutenant Commander]] McArthur was placed in command of the US survey schooner ''Ewing'' which had been brought around the [[Cape Horn]] to the west coast by Lieutenant [[Washington Allon Bartlett]].&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/BACHE6.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon reaching San Francisco,  The ''Ewing'' and the ''[[USS Massachusetts (1845)|USS Massachusetts]]'' were hampered from progress in the survey due to desertions of their crews to the goldfields, including a mutiny when crew members rowing into the city from the ''Ewing'' threw an officer overboard in an attempt to desert to flee to the gold fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gudde|first=Dr. Erwin G.|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ewingmutiny.html|title=Mutiny on the Ewing|accessdate=January 2, 2008}} Originally published in The JOURNAL, Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1951-12-01, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt;  They managed to survey [[Mare Island Strait]]&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; before steaming to Hawaii to obtain crewmen from Hawaiian monarch [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]].&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; They returned to San Francisco in the spring of 1850 with the coastal survey of northern California beginning on 1850-04-03 and continued up to the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] On August 1, 1850, while still in Oregon, McArthur purchased a 1/16 interest in [[Mare Island]] for $468.50&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; then returned to San Francisco later that month to prepare charts and write reports.

===Cape Disappointment and Cape Flattery Lighthouses===

In 1848 Congress had appropriated funds for two [[lighthouses]] in the act creating the [[Oregon Territory]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} McArthur was to recommend placing one at [[Cape Disappointment Lighthouse|Cape Disappointment]] on the Columbia and one at [[Cape Flattery Lighthouse|Cape Flattery]] at the entrance to [[Puget Sound]]. In his report McArthur wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; The greatly increasing commerce of Oregon demands that these improvements be made immediately… Within the last eighteen months more vessels have crossed the [[Columbia Bar|Columbia river bar]] than had crossed it, perhaps, in all time past.&lt;ref&gt;Hannable. William [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5622 Historylink.org] 2003-12-06 retrieved 2008-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oregon Territory===

McArthur and some of his ship mates were quite taken with Oregon and the [[Willamette Valley]], he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The climate is agreeable and healthy. The water is not inferior to any in the world. The face of the country is too uneven to permit as general cultivation, still it will and must soon become a great agricultural and stock growing country. The scenery is beautiful and in some places and some points of view the grandest that the eye ever beheld.&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Simon F. Blunt|Lieutenant Blunt]] who accompanied him on the expedition even made a [[Homestead Act|land claim]] on behalf of himself, McArthur and Bartlett. McArthur's uncle, Senator Linn, along with Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], had been an advocate of [[Manifest Destiny|American expansion]] in the West.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwantes, Carlos Arnaldo ''The Pacific Northwest - An Interpretive History'' University of Nebraska Press 1989 1996 Rev. and enl. ed. p. 92 {{ISBN|0-8032-9228-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

McArthur was not to survive the voyage to the east coast in 1850. He became ill onboard with [[dysentery]], died, and was buried in Panama.   The Navy purchased the original 956 acres (387 ha) of the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] on January 4, 1853.  McArthur's family share  was $5,218.20.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; in 1867, his body was disinterred and he was reburied on Mare Island.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;

'''Yu Huiyong''' ({{zh|c=于会泳|p=Yú Huìyǒng|w=Yu Hui-yung}}) (1925–1977) was a Chinese artist and politician of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. He is known for the art he made of [[Mao Zhedong]], the then-leader of China.

==Biography==
Yu Huiyong was born in [[Shandong Province]] in 1925. He was greatly interested in [[music]] and learned to play a variety of instruments such as the erhu, the sanxian, and the dizi. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he joined a communist performance group, and in 1949 went to teach at the [[Shanghai Conservatory of Music]] (while simultaneously studying [[popular music]]), helping at turning a Western-oriented institution into a training ground for the communist art of [[People's Republic of China|People's China]]. In the meantime, he joined the [[Communist Party of China]]. He graduated in 1950 but continued to work in the field of music.

In the same year, Yu Huiyong was transferred to the Research Institute on Ethnic Music, where he wrote many essays on music styles in China's provinces and took part in creating orchestral performances. In later years, he continued teaching and writing, publishing a comprehensive essay on China's folk music in 1959. In 1962 he was promoted to [[lecturer]] at the [[Shanghai]] Conservatory, and deputy director of its musical theory department the following year. In 1965 he was appointed member of the Drama Reform and Creative Group, and worked on musical embellishment of ''Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'', one of the "eight model revolutionary theatrical works" re-elaborated by [[Jiang Qing]].

In 1966, when the [[Cultural Revolution]] broke out, Yu Huiyong and many of the Shanghai Conservatory staff were targeted as bourgeois intellectuals and forced to resign, submit to self-criticism and criticism by students, and do physical labor. Yu Huiyong however took active part at the movement: he was called to [[Beijing]] to stage the "eight model revolutionary theatrical works", then returned to Shanghai where he joined the "rebel faction". In 1967 he was appointed vice-chairman of the Shanghai Conservatory Revolutionary Committee, chairman of the preparatory committee for the Shanghai Cultural Revolutionary Committee, and put in charge of the Shanghai [[Peking Opera]] Theatre. He worked directly under [[Zhang Chunqiao]], one of the [[Gang of Four]].

Taking an ever more prominent role, in 1968 Yu Huiyong chaired the criticism meeting against [[He Luting]], president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 1969 he participated to the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|CPC 9th National Congress]] and was appointed standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

In 1970 Yu Huiyong was transferred to Beijing to become a member of the Cultural Group Under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] chaired by [[Wu De]]. He was in charge of following movie transposition of model operas like ''[[The Legend of the Red Lantern]]'', ''[[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|Red Detachment of Women]]'', etc. In 1973 he was elected member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]] by the Party's 10th Congress, and also appointed deputy head of the Cultural Group; later he was promoted to [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Culture]] in 1975 as the post was re-established by the 1st Session of the [[4th National People's Congress]].

In the last stages of the Cultura Revolution, Yu Huiyong oversaw art production and anti-revisionist works in China, as the film ''Chunmiao'' (Spring Sprout), which was criticized by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as "ultra-leftist". All of this led him to be accused of being part of the Gang of Four plot, aspiring to be a [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|vice-premier]] and [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] member. For that he was arrested in October 1976. He committed suicide in August 1977.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5368">'''Zbigniew Marian Wilczek Alba''' or '''Ziggy the bagman''' as he is known, is a man who chooses to be homeless and can be found in the inner [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Toowong]]. Ziggy objects to being labelled as "homeless" as he does not ask for food, money or clothing and actually enjoys his current living conditions, despite being without a home of his own and living in a public park. More recently he has gained much media attention, becoming a controversial issue in two consecutive local [[elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Biography==
Despite the lack of information pertaining to his early life it is known that Ziggy the bagman was born as Zbigniew Marian Wilczek in the early 1950s and was of a [[Poles|Polish]] nationality. His name was later changed to Tim Jenkins. While it is unknown when exactly he became homeless, he had been sighted in Jephson Street Toowong as early as 1989. He became known by the locals as either "Tim" or "Ziggy". "Ziggy the bagman" became his nickname throughout his ongoing media coverage.

He entered public view in the year 2000 with the then [[Lord Mayor]] [[Jim Soorley]] protesting the complaints of several Toowong businesses requesting that he be removed on the grounds that he was bad for business and his low levels of hygiene attracted rats.  Soorley claimed that he was completely within the law in his position.  As he gained attention, he was in increased danger, with his small home being attacked several times by various groups demanding his removal from Toowong. His publicity only grew and since then has featured in local news reports several times.

Early in 2004 he was the subject of "Operation Ziggy", an effort by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] presenter (from 612 AM) [[Spencer Howson]] to find him a home. After being interviewed on air, it was revealed that Ziggy was not so willing to be a party to this scheme and so the plan collapsed.&lt;ref name=operationziggy&gt;{{Cite web| title = Spencer's "Operation Ziggy" Collapses on Day One  | work = [[612 ABC Brisbane]]

Later that year a portrait of him painted by local artist Bruce Chapman was entered in the Archibald Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only requested payment was $8 worth of food, including [[ice cream]], several [[cookie|biscuits]] and a bottle of [[soft drink]]. Ziggy also gave an interview for a similar fee of $10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.sjc.uq.edu.au/2005/pdfs/timoct6.pdf Interview with Ziggy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824050110/http://upload.sjc.uq.edu.au/2005/pdfs/timoct6.pdf |date=August 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During July 2004, he is said to have had his first shower and his home became too messy by his own self-imposed rules; the police were called in to help clean up and Ziggy promised to move by Christmas. He found a new spot in a local barbecue area, remaining in Toowong. After more attacks on him midway through 2005, new calls were made to have him taken off the streets, Lord Mayor [[Campbell Newman]] insists, just as his predecessor did, that Ziggy is breaking no laws and will not be forced to move, despite Newman's personal hopes that he could be moved to a "proper place". In December 2005 his possessions were confiscated by police due to smell and vermin. 

In July 2006 Ziggy moved on from his High Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
