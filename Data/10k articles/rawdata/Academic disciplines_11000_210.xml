{{Anthropology}}

The '''anthropology of development''' is a term applied to a body of [[Anthropology|anthropological]] work which views development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? 

This ''anthropology of development'' has been distinguished from ''[[development anthropology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, David D. (1996) Review: The Anthropology of Development: Discourse, Agency, and Culture Reviewed work: An Anthropological Critique of Development: The Growth of Ignorance by Mark Hobart and Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World by Arturo Escobar, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' Vol. 69, No. 3, Healing and the Body Politic: Dilemmas of Doctoring in Ethnographic Fieldwork, Jul., pp. 165-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term development refers to the social action made by different agents ([[institutions]], [[business]], [[Organization|enterprise]], [[State (polity)|states]], independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty.  While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early approaches to development==

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous [[culture]], but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work.  In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based.  Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid.  The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself.  Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that:  systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development.

===Pre-WWII: Rhodes-Livingstone Institute===
The British government established the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]], was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of "culture contact" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=Expectations of modernity: myths and meanings of urban life on the Zambian Copperbelt|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the "[[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester school]]" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict.

===Culture of poverty===
{{main|Culture of poverty}}
The term "subculture of poverty" (later shortened to "culture of poverty") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty'' (1959) by anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]]. Lewis struggled to render "the poor" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by [[poverty]].  He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as "[[blaming-the-victim]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bourgois, Phillipe| year=2001 | title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences | chapter=Culture of Poverty| editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Waveland Press | id= | url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization Theory and its critics ===
The most influential modernization theorist in development was [[Walt Rostow]], whose ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system|economic]] side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach [[Rostovian take-off model|"take-off"]] to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name=mth&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, "The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary," pp. 4-16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023302/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |date=February 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Traditional society
# Preconditions for take-off
# Take-off
# Drive to maturity
# Age of High mass consumption

As should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the "[[Green Revolution|Green revolution]]" to combat the "[[Communist revolution|Red revolution]]".

====George Dalton and the substantivists====
George Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of [[Karl Polanyi]] to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were [[Embeddedness|embedded]] in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of "Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia" (1966, with [[Robert W. Clower]]) and "Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies" (1971).

====Dependency theory====
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}

Dependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

===='Women in development' (WID)====
{{main|Women in development|Gender and development}}
Women in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the [[Gender and development]] (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|pp=125}} The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of [[Esther Boserup]]. Boserup's most notable book is ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;(Chicago, Aldine, 1965, {{ISBN|0-415-31298-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; This book presents a "dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boserup|first=Esther|title=The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure|year=1965|publisher=Aldine|location=Chicago|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing [[shifting cultivation]], it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were "heads of households."

==Development discourse and the creation of the 'underdeveloped' world==

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar's]] seminal book ''Encountering Development'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views [[international development]] as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through [[decolonization]], development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]].  Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war,  when they were developed to 

1. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and 

2. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad.   

Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations.   Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of [[dependency theory]] and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault an other [[poststructuralists]].

==Governmentality: Development as 'anti-politics machine'==
{{main|The Anti-Politics Machine}}
[[File:Location Lesotho AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Lesotho in South Africa]]
At a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state’s repressive machinery of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Nikolas, Pat O'Malley, &amp; Mariana Valverde. (2006). ''Governmentality''. Annual Review of Law and Social Science Vol. 2: 83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]]’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “[[bio-power]]” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “[[governmentality]]” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the "development apparatus", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|title=Encountering Development: the making and unmaking of the third world|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]] utilized the governmentality framework in "The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho" (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how "development discourse" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what [[unintended consequences]] does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as "successes" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to "de-politicize" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. 

Ferguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a "Less-Developed Country."  In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the "independent" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as "isolated," "non-market" and "traditional" and thus a proper target for aid intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=25–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention.

Ferguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:
# It’s an “anti-politics machine”; it makes blatantly political decisions about the allocation of resources appear to be “technical solutions to technical problems”. Important questions such as the reallocation of land to a limited number (leaving them relatively wealthy, and others in poverty) are rephrased as a "necessity for the sustainable commercial management of livestock." A large proportion of men are deprived of their retirement savings.
# “Integrated development” served to strengthen the presence of a repressive government in an isolated and resistant area. Development projects are dependent upon local governments for implementation, and rarely challenge the nature of that government. The resources they supply frequently serve state needs more than local needs.
# It perpetuates the migrant labour system. The project neglected to look at Lesotho in the regional economy with South Africa. Lesotho was a labour reserve for Apartheid-era South African mines. The men of Lesotho were not farmers, but unemployed workers and retirees. Real commercial farming was never a possibility without large subsidies. The project thus served to preserve a pool of cheap labour for South Africa in a time when international sanctions against Apartheid were hitting its economy.

=== The Limits of Governmentality ===

===Ecogovernmentality===

{{main|Ecogovernmentality}}

Ecogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Malette, Sebastien. (2009) "Foucault for the next century: eco−governmentality" in Binkley, S. and Capetillo J. eds. A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis.  He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agrawal|first=Arjun|title=Environmentality: Technologies of Government and the Making of Subjects|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural development: the "Green Revolution"==

The term "Green Revolution" was first used in 1968 by former [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) director [[William Gaud]], who noted the spread of the new technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent [[October Revolution|Red Revolution]] like that of the Soviets, nor is it a [[White Revolution]] like that of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. I call it the Green Revolution."&lt;ref name="agbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/borlaug-green.html |title=The Green Revolution: Accomplishments and Apprehensions |last1= Gaud |first1=William S. |date=8 March 1968 |publisher=AgBioWorld |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bio21 accommodates over 500 research scientists, students and industry participants, making it one of the largest biotechnology research centres in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |title=About Bio21 |date=2015 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website=www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095837/http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}

In September 2006, Bio21 formed a partnership with Australian-based global bio-pharmaceutical company [[CSL Limited]]. 50 scientists from CSL were relocated to participate in activities at the Bio21. The goal of the partnership was for Bio21 to gain the expertise of industry professionals and for CSL to gain access to state-of-the-art equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSL scientists move to Melbourne Uni |work=NineMSN |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=2006 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920095034/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |archivedate=20 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Rebecca |title=Bio21 Inst to host CSL scientists |journal=UniNews |volume=15 |number=17 |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |date=2006 |url=http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912023818/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8142">'''The Cambridge English Corpus''' (formerly the Cambridge International Corpus) is a multi-billion word corpus of [[English language]] (containing both [[text corpus]] and spoken corpus data). The Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) contains data from a number of sources including written and spoken, British and American English. The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.

The Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press [[English Language Teaching]] publications as well as for research in [[corpus linguistics]]. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for [[Cambridge University Press]], and researchers at [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge International Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3637700/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-International-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.

== Spoken Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.

== Cambridge Learner Corpus ==
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different [[first language]]s and is growing all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Learner Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-Learner-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; The exams currently included are:

* KET [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (and KET for schools)
* PET [[Preliminary English Test]] (and PET for schools)
* FCE [[First Certificate in English]]
* CAE [[Certificate in Advanced English]]
* CPE [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]]
* BEC [[Business English Certificate]] (all levels)
* IELTS [[International English Language Testing System]] (academic and general training)
* CELS Certificates in English Language Skills
* ILEC International Legal English Certificate
* ICFE International Certificate in Financial English
* Skills for Life

A unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Nicholls, http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/publications/CL2003/papers/nicholls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of Cambridge [[English Language Teaching]] resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.

Conversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of [[English Profile]], a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile project, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The founding partners are [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Bedfordshire]], the [[British Council]] and English UK.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=22&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s aim is to describe what learners know and can do in English at each level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]] (CEFR).&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, CEFR levels,{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized corpora ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a number of specialized corpora:

=== Cambridge Business English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Business English Corpus is a large collection of British and American business language, including reports and documents, books relating to different aspects of business, and the business sections from many national newspapers.

The Cambridge Business English Corpus also includes the '''Cambridge and Nottingham Spoken Business English Corpus''' (CANBEC), the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. This is a collection of recordings of English from companies of all sizes, ranging from big multinational companies to small partnerships. It contains formal and informal meetings, presentations, telephone conversations, lunchtime conversations, and spoken language from other business situations.

=== Cambridge Legal English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Legal English Corpus contains books, journals and newspaper articles relating to the law and legal processes.

=== Cambridge Financial English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Financial English Corpus contains texts relating to economics and finance, including leading financial magazines and newspapers.

=== Cambridge Academic English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Academic English Corpus contains written and spoken academic language at undergraduate and post-graduate level from a range of US and UK institutions, including lectures, seminars, student presentations, journals, essays and text books.

=== CANCODE ===
The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE) is a collection of spoken English recorded at hundreds of locations across the British Isles in a wide variety of situations (e.g. casual conversation, socialising, finding out information, and discussions). The CANCODE corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

There are about five million words in the CANCODE corpus, and it's a very rich resource for researchers of spoken English.  However, the data does have some limitations.  Most people knew they were being recorded, and are chatting in informal situations such as while relaxing at home, with others of fairly equal social status.  This means the interactions are generally consensual and collaborative, so the corpus has minimal evidence of conflict or adversarial exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004) Language and Creativity: The Art of Common Talk. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge-Cornell Corpus of Spoken North American English ===
The Cambridge University Press/Cornell Corpus is a large collection of informal, highly interactive, multiparty conversations between family/friends in North America. The Cambridge-Cornell corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Cornell University]].

=== CAMSNAE ===
The Cambridge Corpus of Spoken North American English (CAMSNAE) is a large collection of spoken American English. It includes recordings of people going about their everyday life – at work, at home with their families, going shopping, having meals, etc.

[[File:Pushdown-overview.svg|thumb|Diagram of a counter automaton. Each cell of its stack either contains an "''A''" or a space symbol.]]
In [[computer science]], more particular in the theory of [[formal language]]s, a '''counter automaton''', or '''counter machine''', is a [[pushdown automaton]] with only two symbols, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the initial symbol in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the finite set of stack symbols.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-201-02988-X | author=John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | location=Reading/MA | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}

Equivalently, a counter automaton is a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] with an additional memory cell that can hold one nonnegative integer number (of unlimited size), which can be incremented, decremented, and tested for being zero.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Motwani.Ullman.2003"&gt;{{cite book | author=John E. Hopcroft and Rajeev Motwani and Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | location=Upper Saddle River/NJ | publisher=Addison Wesley | &lt;!---almost unknown:---isbn=0321210298---&gt; isbn=0-201-44124-1 | year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|351}}

==Properties==
The class of counter automata can recognize a proper superset of the [[regular language|regular]]{{#tag:ref|Every regular language ''L'' is accepted by some [[finite automaton]] ''F'' (see [[Regular language#Equivalent formalisms]]). Enriching ''F'' with a two-symbol stack which is ignored by ''F''’s control makes it a counter automaton accepting ''L''.|group=note}} and a subset of the [[deterministic context free language]]s.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Motwani.Ullman.2003"/&gt;{{rp|352}}

For example, the language &lt;math&gt;\{ a^nb^n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-regular&lt;ref group=note&gt;by the [[pumping lemma for regular languages#Use of the lemma|pumping lemma for regular languages]]&lt;/ref&gt; language accepted by a counter automaton: It can use the symbol &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to count the number of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;s in a given input string &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (writing an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;), after that, it can delete an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

A two-counter automaton, that is, a [[Multitape Turing machine#Two-stack Turing machine|two-stack Turing machine]] with a two-symbol alphabet, can simulate an arbitrary [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|172}}

{{For|the industrial-metal band|Crossbreed (band)}}
[[File:Rusty.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Labradoodle]], a crossbreed between a [[poodle]] and a [[retriever]]]]
A '''crossbreed ''' is an organism with [[purebred]] parents of two different breeds, varieties, or populations. ''Crossbreeding'', sometimes called [[Designer crossbreed|"designer crossbreeding"]], is the process of breeding such an organism, often with the intention to create offspring that share the traits of both parent lineages, or producing an organism with [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor]].  While crossbreeding is used to maintain health and viability of organisms, irresponsible crossbreeding can also produce organisms of inferior quality or dilute a [[purebred]] gene pool to the point of [[extinction]] of a given [[breed]] of organism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A domestic animal of unknown ancestry, where the breed status of only one parent or grandparent is known, may also be called a crossbreed though the term "mixed breed" is technically more accurate. [[Outcrossing]] is a type of crossbreeding used within a purebred breed to increase the genetic diversity within the breed, particularly when there is a need to avoid [[inbreeding]].

In animal breeding, ''crossbreeds'' are crosses within a single species, while ''[[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]'' are crosses between different species. In plant breeding terminology, the term ''crossbreed'' is uncommon. No universal term is used to distinguish hybridization or crossing within a population from those between populations, or even those between species.

== Crossbreeds in specific animals ==
=== Cats ===
The many newly developed and recognized [[List of cat breeds|breeds of domestic cat]] are crossbreeds between existing, well-established breeds (sometimes with limited [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with some wild species), to either combine selected traits from the [[foundation stock]], or propagate a rare [[mutation]] without excessive [[inbreeding]].  However, some nascent breeds such as the [[Aegean cat]] are developed entirely from a local [[landrace]] population.  Most [[List of experimental cat breeds|experimental cat breeds]] are crossbreeds.

=== Cattle ===
In cattle, there are systems of crossbreeding. In many crossbreeds, one is larger than the other. One is used when the purebred females are particularly adapted to a specific environment, and are crossed with purebred bulls from another environment to produce a generation having traits of both parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html Cross breeding systems for beef cattle larger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608174409/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html |date=2008-06-08 }} Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sheep ===
The large number of breeds of sheep, which vary greatly, creates an opportunity for crossbreeding to be used to tailor production of lambs to the goal of the individual stockman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm Crossbreeding In Sheep, by Angie Bailey, Jason Canup and Jorge Lucena] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20080524060408/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm |date=2008-05-24 }} Purdue University, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Llamas ===
Results of crossbreeding classic and woolly breeds of llama are unpredictable. The resulting offspring displays physical characteristics of either parent, or a mix of characteristics from both, periodically producing a fleeced llama. 
The results are increasingly unpredictable when both parents are crossbreeds, with possibility of the offspring displaying characteristics of a grandparent, not obvious in either parent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lostcreekllamas.com/classic.htm|title=classic llamas|author=|date=|website=lostcreekllamas.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824171648/http://lostcreekllamas.com/classic.htm|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogs ===
{{Main|Dog crossbreed}}

A ''crossbred'' dog is a cross between two (sometimes more) known breeds, and is usually distinguished from a ''[[mixed-breed dog]]'', which has ancestry from many sources, some of which may not be known.  Crossbreeds are popular, due to the belief that they have [[Hybrid vigor|increased vigor]] without loss of attractiveness of the dog.  Certain planned crossbreeding between purebred dogs of different breeds are now widely known as "designer dogs" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/meet-18-designer-dog-breeds|title=Meet 18 Designer Dog Breeds|author=|date=|website=vetstreet.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209002955/http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/meet-18-designer-dog-breeds|archivedate=9 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can produce puppies worth more than their purebred parents, due to a high demand.

===Horses===
[[File:National Show Horse.jpg|thumb|The [[National Show Horse]] was developed from crossbreeding programs in the 1970s and 1980s that blended [[Arabian horse]] and [[American Saddlebred]] bloodlines]]
Crossbreeding in horses is often done with the intent of ultimately creating a new breed of horse. One type of modern crossbreeding in horses is used to create many of the [[warmblood]] breeds.  Warmbloods are a type of horse used in the [[sport horse]] disciplines, usually registered in an [[open stud book]] by a [[studbook selection]] procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard.  Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of [[draft horse]] breeds on [[Thoroughbred]]s, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a [[closed stud book]].  Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the [[American Quarter Horse]], which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the "Appendix" registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard.   Another well-known crossbred horse is the [[Anglo-Arabian]], which may be produced by a purebred [[Arabian horse]] crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree.

== Hybrid animals ==
{{Main|Hybrid (biology)}}
A [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal is one with parentage of two separate species, differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. Hybrids are usually, but not always, sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Hybrids-Are-Sterile-42118.shtml|title=Why Are Hybrids Sterile ?|first=Stefan|last=Anitei|date=|website=softpedia.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101114415/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Hybrids-Are-Sterile-42118.shtml|archivedate=1 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most ancient types of hybrid animal is the [[mule]], a cross between a female [[horse]] and a male [[donkey]]. The [[liger]] is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cross between a male [[lion]] and female [[tiger]]. The [[yattle]] is a cross between a [[cow]] and a [[yak]]. Other crosses include the [[tigon]] (between a male tiger and female lion) and [[yakalo]] (between a yak and [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]]). The Incas recognized that hybrids of Lama glama (llama) and Lama pacos (alpaca) resulted in a hybrid with none of the advantages of either parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|title=An Ancient Livestock, by Barbara Lang|author=|date=|website=alpacasincanada.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082756/http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|archivedate=13 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time it was thought that dogs and wolves were separate species, and the [[Wolf-dog hybrid|crosses between dogs and wolves]] were called wolf hybrids. Today wolves and dogs are both recognized as ''[[Canis lupus]]'', but the old term "wolf hybrid" is still used.

== Mixed breeds ==
{{Main|Mixed breed}}
A mixed-breed animal is defined as having undocumented or unknown parentage, while a crossbreed generally has known, usually [[purebred]] parents of two distinct breeds or varieties. A dog of unknown parentage is often called a [[mixed-breed dog]], "mutt" or "mongrel." A cat of unknown parentage is often referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]] generically, and in some dialects is often called a "moggy". A horse of unknown bloodlines is a [[grade horse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9832">The '''Dark Ages Radio Explorer''' ('''DARE''') mission is a proposed concept [[robotic spacecraft|lunar orbiter]] intended to identify [[redshift]]ed emanations from primeval [[hydrogen atom]]s just as the first stars began to emit light. DARE will use the precisely [[redshift]]ed 21-cm transition line from [[neutral hydrogen]] (1420.00&amp;nbsp;MHz emissions) to view and pinpoint the formation of the first illuminations of the universe.

Also, this is the period ending the [[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|Dark Ages of the universe]].  The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the [[Big Bang]]. The mission will deliver data pertaining to the formation of the first stars, the initial [[black hole]] accretions, and the [[reionization]] of the universe.

This mission might also add to [[research]] on [[dark matter]] decay. The DARE program will also provide insight for developing and deploying [[lunar surface]] telescopes that add to refined [[exoplanet]] exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Universe's 'Dark Ages' May Come to Light with Moon Orbiter |url=http://www.space.com/31811-universe-dark-ages-dare-moon-orbiter.html |date=5 February 2016 |work=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=19 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The period after [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] occurred but before [[star]]s and [[galaxies]] formed is known as the "dark ages". During this time, the majority of [[matter]] in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the [[hydrogen line]] produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an [[electron]] in a neutral hydrogen [[atom]] is [[excited state|excited]] to a state where the electron and [[proton]] have aligned [[spin (physics)|spin]]s, or de-excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti-aligned. The energy difference between these two [[hyperfine]] states is &lt;math&gt;5.9 \times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; [[electron volts]], with a [[wavelength]] of 21 centimeters. At times when neutral hydrogen is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with the [[photons]] in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are said to be "coupled", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures differ, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed.&lt;ref name=Stiav&gt;

==Theoretical motivation==
The Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly [[homogeneous]] universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, [[particles]], then [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and finally [[atoms]] formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equivalent to about 400,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the [[Primordial nucleosynthesis|primordial plasma]] filling the universe cooled sufficiently for [[protons]] and [[electrons]] to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin whereby [[photons]] from this early era no longer interacted with [[matter]]. We detect these photons today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still remarkably smooth and uniform.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
After the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe consisted of a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) for which the dominant matter component was hydrogen gas. With no luminous sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, within which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
As more stars formed, and the first galaxies assembled, they flooded the universe with [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet photons]] capable of ionizing hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to reionize essentially all the universe’s hydrogen atoms. This Reionization era is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies, marking the phase transition of the IGM back to a nearly completely ionized state.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;
 
The beginning of structural complexity in the universe constituted a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet investigated observationally. By pushing even farther back than the [[Hubble telescope]] can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. [[Theoretical model]]s suggest that existing measurements are beginning to probe the tail end of [[Reionization]], but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie beyond our reach.&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;
 
DARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the otherwise invisible stellar populations. Such observations are essential for placing existing measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasadare/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

==Mission==
DARE’s approach is to measure the spectral shape of the sky-averaged, redshifted  21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40-120&amp;nbsp;MHz, observing the redshift range 11-35, which correlates to 80 - 420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside, the only location in the inner Solar System proven to be free of human-generated radio frequency interference and any significant ionosphere.

The science instrument is mounted to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is composed of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, [[Biconical antenna|biconical dipole antenna]]s, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and the differential spectral calibration approach used for DARE are effective in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected.

==Similar projects==
Besides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]] (PAPER), [[LOFAR|Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR), [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), and the [[Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages]] (LEDA).

'''Diaspora studies''' is an academic field established in the late 20th century to study dispersed [[ethnicity|ethnic]] populations, which are often termed [[diaspora peoples]]. The usage of the term [[diaspora]] carries the [[connotation]] of forced resettlement, due to expulsion, coercion, slavery, [[racism]], or war, especially [[nationalism|nationalist]] conflicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7323">In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] '''ELEMENTARY''' of '''elementary recursive functions''' is the union of the classes

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \mathrm{ELEMENTARY} &amp; = \mathrm{EXP}\cup\mathrm{2EXP}\cup\mathrm{3EXP}\cup\cdots \\
                   &amp; = \mathrm{DTIME}(2^n)\cup\mathrm{DTIME}(2^{2^n})\cup
                         \mathrm{DTIME}(2^{2^{2^n}})\cup\cdots
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The name was coined by [[László Kalmár]], in the context of [[Computable function|recursive functions]] and [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]]; most problems in it are far from elementary. Some natural recursive problems lie outside ELEMENTARY, and are thus [[NONELEMENTARY]]. Most notably, there are [[primitive recursive]] problems that are not in ELEMENTARY. We know

:LOWER-ELEMENTARY ⊊ [[EXPTIME]] ⊊ ELEMENTARY ⊊ [[PR (complexity)|PR]] ⊊ [[R (complexity)|R]]

Whereas ELEMENTARY contains bounded applications of [[exponentiation]] (for example, &lt;math&gt;O(2^{2^n})&lt;/math&gt;), [[PR (complexity)|PR]] allows more general [[hyper operator]]s (for example, [[tetration]]) which are not contained in ELEMENTARY.

==Definition==

The definitions of elementary recursive functions are the same as for [[primitive recursive function]]s, except that primitive recursion is replaced by bounded summation and bounded product. All functions work over the natural numbers. The basic functions, all of them elementary recursive, are:

# '''Zero function'''.  Returns zero: ''f''(x) = 0.
# '''Successor function''': ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' + 1. Often this is denoted by ''S'', as in ''S''(''x''). Via repeated application of a successor function, one can achieve addition.
# '''Projection functions''': these are used for ignoring arguments. For example, ''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''a'' is a projection function.
# '''Subtraction function''': ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' − ''y'' if ''y'' &lt; ''x'', or 0 if ''y'' ≥ ''x''. This function is used to define conditionals and iteration.

From these basic functions, we can build other elementary recursive functions.

# '''Composition''': applying values from some elementary recursive function as an argument to another elementary recursive function. In ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''h''(''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)) is elementary recursive if ''h'' is elementary recursive and each ''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is elementary recursive.
# '''Bounded summation''': &lt;math&gt;f(m, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^mg(i, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is elementary recursive if ''g'' is elementary recursive.
# '''Bounded product''': &lt;math&gt;f(m, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \prod\limits_{i=0}^mg(i, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is elementary recursive if ''g'' is elementary recursive.

== Basis for ELEMENTARY ==

The class of elementary functions coincides with the closure with respect to composition of the projections and one of the following function sets: &lt;math&gt;\{ n+1, n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m, \lfloor n/m \rfloor, n^m \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ n+m, n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m, \lfloor n/m\rfloor, 2^n \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ n+m, n^2, n \,\bmod\, m, 2^n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \, \stackrel{.}{-} \, m = \max\{n-m, 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the subtraction function defined above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazzanti | first1 = S | year = 2002 | title = Plain Bases for Classes of Primitive Recursive Functions | url = | journal = Mathematical Logic Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 93–104 | doi=10.1002/1521-3870(200201)48:1&lt;93::aid-malq93&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Marchenkov, "Superpositions of elementary arithmetic functions", ''Journal of Applied and Industrial Mathematics'', September 2007, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 351-360, {{doi|10.1134/S1990478907030106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lower elementary recursive functions ==

''Lower elementary recursive'' functions follow the definitions as above, except that bounded product is disallowed. That is, a lower elementary recursive function must be a zero, successor, or projection function, a composition of other lower elementary recursive functions, or the bounded sum of another lower elementary recursive function.

Also known as Skolem elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;Th. Skolem, "Proof of some theorems on recursively enumerable sets", ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'', 1962, Volume 3, Number 2, pp 65-74, {{doi|10.1305/ndjfl/1093957149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volkov_skolem"&gt;S. A. Volkov, "On the class of Skolem elementary functions", ''Journal of Applied and Industrial Mathematics'', 2010, Volume 4, Issue 4, pp 588-599, {{doi|10.1134/S1990478910040149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas elementary recursive functions have potentially more than exponential growth, the lower elementary recursive functions have polynomial growth.

The class of lower elementary functions has a description in terms of composition of simple functions analogous to that we have for elementary functions.&lt;ref name="volkov_skolem" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Volkov |first=Sergey | year= 2016 |eprint=1611.04843 |title=Finite Bases with Respect to the Superposition in Classes of Elementary Recursive Functions [dissertation] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, a polynomial-bounded function is lower elementary if and only if it can be expressed using a composition of the following functions: projections, &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;nm&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \,\stackrel{.}{-}\, m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\wedge m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/m \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, one exponential function (&lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n^m&lt;/math&gt;) with the following restriction on the structure of formulas: the formula can have no more than two floors with respect to an exponent (for example, &lt;math&gt;xy(z+1)&lt;/math&gt; has 1 floor, &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^{yz+x}+z^{x+1}&lt;/math&gt; has 2 floors, &lt;math&gt;2^{2^x}&lt;/math&gt; has 3 floors). Here &lt;math&gt;n\wedge m&lt;/math&gt; is a bitwise AND of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Descriptive characterization ==

In [[descriptive complexity]], ELEMENTARY is equal to the class of [[HO (complexity)|high order queries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Lauri Hella and José María Turull-Torres | title =Computing queries with higher-order logics | journal = [[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]] | volume = 355 | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | pages = 197–214   | issn =0304-3975 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142890.1142897 | doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that every language in the ELEMENTARY complexity class can be written as a high order formula that is true only for the elements on the language.  More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NTIME}(2^{2^{\cdots{2^{O(n)}}}}) = \exists{}\mathrm{HO}^i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; indicates a tower of {{mvar|i}} exponentiations and &lt;math&gt;\exists{}\mathrm{HO}^i&lt;/math&gt; is the class of queries that begin with existential quantifiers of {{mvar|i}}th order and then a formula of {{math|(''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}}th order.

'''Eukaryotic transcription''' is the elaborate process that [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells use to copy genetic information stored in [[DNA]] into units of [[RNA]] replica. Gene transcription occurs in both eukaryotic and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA, RNA polymerase in eukaryotes (including humans) comes in three variations, each encoding a different type of gene. A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus that separates the processes of transcription and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into [[nucleosomes]] and higher order [[chromatin]] structures. The complexity of the eukaryotic genome necessitates a great variety and complexity of gene expression control.

==Overview==
Transcription is the process of copying genetic information stored in a DNA strand into a transportable [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand of RNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=James|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-321-76243-6|edition=7th|author2=Tania A. Baker |author3=Stephen P. Bell |author4=Alexander Gann |author5=Michael Levine |author6=Richard Losik |author7=Stephen C. Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcriptional machinery that catalyzes this complex reaction has at its core three multi-subunit RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcribing RNA that codes for genes that become structural components of the ribosome.
&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

Protein coding genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that carry the information from DNA to the site of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Although mRNAs possess great diversity, they are not the most abundant RNA species made in the cell. The so-called non-coding RNAs account for the large majority of the transcriptional output of a cell.&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattick|first=J.

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) catalyses the transcription of all rRNA genes except 5S.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer /&gt; These rRNA genes are organised into a single transcriptional unit and are transcribed into a continuous transcript.

The [[C-terminus|carboxyl terminal]] domain (CTD) of [[POLR2A|RPB1]], the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, plays an important role in bringing together the machinery necessary for the synthesis and processing of Pol II transcripts.&lt;ref name=corden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corden|first=Jeffry L.|title=RNA Polymerase II C-Terminal Domain: Tethering Transcription to Transcript and Template|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=13 November 2013|volume=113|issue=11|pages=8423–8455|doi=10.1021/cr400158h|pmid=24040939|pmc=3988834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long and structurally disordered, the CTD contains multiple repeats of heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS that are subject to [[phosphorylation]] and other [[posttranslational modification]]s during the transcription cycle. These modifications and their regulation constitute the operational code for the CTD to control transcription initiation, elongation and termination and to couple transcription and RNA processing.&lt;ref name=corden /&gt;

==Initiation==

The initiation of gene transcription in eukaryotes occurs in specific steps.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  First, an RNA polymerase along with general [[transcription factor]]s binds to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the gene to form a closed complex called the [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]]. The subsequent transition of the complex from the closed state to the open state results in the melting or separation of the two DNA strands and the positioning of the template strand to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Without the need of a primer, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of a new RNA chain using the template DNA strand to guide ribonucleotide selection and polymerization chemistry.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; However, many of the initiated syntheses are aborted before the transcripts reach a significant length (~10 nucleotides). During these abortive cycles, the polymerase keeps making and releasing short transcripts until it is able to produce a transcript that surpasses ten nucleotides in length. Once this threshold is attained, RNA polymerase passes the promoter and transcription proceeds to the elongation phase.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Eukaryotic promoters and general transcription factors===
Pol II-transcribed genes contain a region in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) that binds and positions the preinitiation complex. This region is called the core promoter because of its essential role in transcription initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Jennifer|author2=James T. Kadonaga|title=The RNA polymerase II core promoter: a key component in the regulation of gene expression|journal=Genes Dev.|year=2002|volume=16|issue=20|pages=2583–2592|doi=10.1101/gad.1026202|pmid=12381658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhard|first=Boris|author2=Sandelin, Albin |author3=Carninci, Piero |title=Metazoan promoters: emerging characteristics and insights into transcriptional regulation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=6 March 2012|doi=10.1038/nrg3163|pmid=22392219|volume=13|pages=233–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different classes of sequence elements are found in the promoters. For example, the [[TATA box]] is the highly conserved DNA recognition sequence for the TATA box binding protein, [[TATA Binding Protein|TBP]], whose binding initiates transcription complex assembly at many genes.

Eukaryotic genes also contain regulatory sequences beyond the core promoter. These [[Cis-regulatory element|cis-acting control elements]] bind transcriptional activators or repressors to increase or decrease transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized regulatory elements include [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], [[Silencer (DNA)|silencers]], and [[Insulator (genetics)|insulators]]. These regulatory sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

General transcription factors are a group of proteins involved in transcription initiation and regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These factors typically have DNA-binding domains that bind specific sequence elements of the core promoter and help recruit RNA polymerase to the transcriptional start site.
General transcription factors for RNA polymerase II include [[Transcription factor II D|TFIID]], [[Transcription factor II A|TFIIA]], [[Transcription factor II B|TFIIB]], [[Transcription factor II F|TFIIF]], [[Transcription factor II E|TFIIE]], and [[Transcription factor II H|TFIIH]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orphanides|first=G|author2=Lagrange, T |author3=Reinberg, D |title=The general transcription factors of RNA polymerase II.|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 November 1996|volume=10|issue=21|pages=2657–2683|doi=10.1101/gad.10.21.2657|pmid=8946909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROEDER|first=R|title=The role of general initiation factors in transcription by RNA polymerase II|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=327–335|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly of preinitiation complex===
To prepare for transcription, a complete set of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase need to be assembled at the core promoter to form the ~2 million dalton preinitiation complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yuan|author2=Jie Fang |author3=Dylan J. Taatjes |author4=Eva Nogales |title=Structural visualization of key steps in human transcription initiation|journal=Nature|date=28 March 2013|volume=495|pages=481–486|doi=10.1038/nature11991 |pmid=23446344 |pmc=3612373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, for promoters that contain a TATA box near the TSS, the recognition of TATA box by the TBP subunit of TFIID initiates the assembly of a transcription complex. The next proteins to enter are TFIIA and TFIIB, which stabilize the DNA-TFIID complex and recruit Pol II in association with TFIIF and additional transcription factors. TFIIF serves as the bridge between the TATA-bound TBP and polymerase. One of the last transcription factors to be recruited to the preinitiation complex is TFIIH, which plays an important role in promoter melting and escape.&lt;ref name=holstege /&gt;

[[Image:Preinitiation complex.png|thumb|right|200px|The diagram describes the eukaryotic preinitiation complex which includes the general transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II. Credit: [[commons:User:ArneLH|ArneLH]].]]

===Promoter melting and open complex formation===
For pol II-transcribed genes, and unlike bacterial RNA polymerase, promoter melting requires hydrolysis of ATP and is mediated by TFIIH.&lt;ref name=holstege&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holstege|first=F. C.P.|title=Three transitions in the RNA polymerase II transcription complex during initiation|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=15 December 1997|volume=16|issue=24|pages=7468–7480|doi=10.1093/emboj/16.24.7468|pmid=9405375|pmc=1170346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFIIH is a ten-subunit protein, including both [[ATPase]] and [[protein kinase]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SVEJSTRUP|first=J|author2=VICHI, P |author3=EGLY, J |title=The multiple roles of transcription/repair factor TFIIH|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=346–350|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10046-3|pmid=8870499}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the upstream promoter DNA is held in a fixed position by TFIID, TFIIH pulls downstream double-stranded DNA into the cleft of the polymerase, driving the separation of DNA strands and the transition of the preinitiation complex from the closed to open state. TFIIB aids in open complex formation by binding the melted DNA and stabilizing the [[transcription bubble
]].

===Abortive initiation===
{{Main|Abortive initiation}}
Once the initiation complex is open, the first ribonucleotide is brought into the active site to initiate the polymerization reaction in the absence of a primer.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This generates a nascent RNA chain that forms a hetero-duplex with the template DNA strand. However, before entering the elongation phase, polymerase may terminate prematurely and release a short, truncated transcript. This process is called abortive initiation.&lt;ref name=revyakin /&gt; Many cycles of abortive initiation may occur before the transcript grows to sufficient length to promote polymerase escape from the promoter. Throughout abortive initiation cycles, RNA polymerase remains bound to the promoter and pulls downstream DNA into its catalytic cleft in a scrunching-kind of motion.&lt;ref name=revyakin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR |title=Abortive Initiation and Productive Initiation by RNA Polymerase Involve DNA Scrunching|journal=Science|date=17 November 2006|volume=314|issue=5802|pages=1139–1143|doi=10.1126/science.1131398|pmid=17110577|pmc=2754787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoter escape===
When a transcript attains the threshold length of ten nucleotides, it enters the RNA exit channel.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The polymerase breaks its interactions with the promoter elements and any regulatory proteins associated with the initiation complex that it no longer needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Arik|title=Promoter escape by RNA polymerase II|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression|date=September 2002|volume=1577|issue=2|pages=208–223|doi=10.1016/S0167-4781(02)00453-0|pmid=12213653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter escape in eukaryotes requires ATP hydrolysis and, in the case of Pol II-phosphorylation of the CTD. Meanwhile, the transcription bubble collapses down to 12-14 nucleotides, providing kinetic energy required for the escape.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Elongation==
After escaping the promoter and shedding most of the transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for the next phase of transcription: elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pokholok|first=Dmitry K|author2=Hannett, Nancy M |author3=Young, Richard A |title=Exchange of RNA Polymerase II Initiation and Elongation Factors during Gene Expression In Vivo|journal=Molecular Cell|date=April 2002|volume=9|issue=4|pages=799–809|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wade|first=Joseph T|author2=Struhl, Kevin|title=The transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=130–136|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.12.008|pmc=2563432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcription elongation is a [[Processivity|processive]] process. Double stranded DNA that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for RNA synthesis. For every DNA [[base pair]] separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand RNA emerges alone.

===Elongation factors===
Among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Abbie|author2=Core, Leighton J. |author3=Lis, John T. |title=Breaking barriers to transcription elongation|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=August 2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=557–567|doi=10.1038/nrm1981|pmid=16936696}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different classes of elongation factors. Some factors can increase the overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arndt|first=Karen|author2=Caroline Kane|title=Running with RNA polymerase: eukaryotic transcript elongation|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=1 October 2003|volume=19|issue=10|pages=543–550|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2003.08.008|pmid=14550628}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elongation factors, [[P-TEFb]], is particularly important.&lt;ref name=bres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brès|first=Vanessa|author2=Yoh, Sunnie M |author3=Jones, Katherine A |title=The multi-tasking P-TEFb complex|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=June 2008|volume=20|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.04.008|pmc=2628440}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit [[Five prime cap|5'-capping]] enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.&lt;ref name=bres /&gt;

===Transcription fidelity===
Transcription fidelity is achieved through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct [[nucleoside triphosphate]] (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding base in the DNA is admitted to the active center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westover|first=Kenneth D.|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription|journal=Cell|date=November 2004|volume=119|issue=4|pages=481–489|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dong|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Westover, Kenneth D. |author4=Kaplan, Craig D. |author5= Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription: Role of the Trigger Loop in Substrate Specificity and Catalysis|journal=Cell|date=December 2006|volume=127|issue=5|pages=941–954|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.023 |pmid=17129781 |pmc=1876690}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=D.|author2=Bushnell, D.

===Pausing, poising, and backtracking===
Transcription elongation is not a smooth ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes for long periods of time before resuming transcription.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter.&lt;ref name=Adelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelman|first=Karen|author2=Lis, John T.|title=Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=18 September 2012|volume=13|issue=10|pages=720–731|doi=10.1038/nrg3293|pmc=3552498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Missra|first=A.|author2=Gilmour, D. S.|title=Interactions between DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor), NELF (negative elongation factor), and the Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=4 June 2010|volume=107|issue=25|pages=11301–11306|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000681107|pmid=20534440|pmc=2895096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===RNA processing===
Elongating polymerase is associated with a set of protein factors required for various types of RNA processing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the RNA splicing machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for [[Polyadenylation|3’-polyadenylation]], the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Termination==
The last stage of transcription is termination, which leads to the dissociation of the complete transcript and the release of RNA polymerase from the template DNA.The process differs for each of the three RNA polymerases.&lt;ref name="Richard_rnap"/&gt; 
The mechanism of termination is the least understood of the three transcription stages.

===Factor-dependent===
The termination of transcription of pre-rRNA genes by polymerase Pol I is performed by a system that needs a specific transcription termination factor.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt; The mechanism used bears some resemblance to the rho-dependent termination in prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancey|first=Suzanne|title=DNA transcription|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=41|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-transcription-426|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of ribosomal DNA repeats, sometimes distributed over multiple chromosomes. Termination of transcription occurs in the ribosomal intergenic spacer region that contains several transcription termination sites upstream of a Pol I pausing site. Through a yet unknown mechanism, the 3’-end of the transcript is cleaved, generating a large primary rRNA molecule that is further processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs.

As Pol II reaches the end of a gene, two protein complexes carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.&lt;br /&gt;
 
In the process of terminating transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richard|first=P.|author2=Manley, J. L.|title=Transcription termination by nuclear RNA polymerases|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 June 2009|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1247–1269|doi=10.1101/gad.1792809|pmc=2763537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature /&gt;&lt;ref name=RNAPII&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosonina|first=E.|title=Terminating the transcript: breaking up is hard to do|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 May 2006|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1050–1056|doi=10.1101/gad.1431606|pmid=16651651}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.&lt;ref name=RNAPII /&gt;

===Factor-independent===
RNA polymerase III can terminate transcription efficiently without the involvement of additional factors. The Pol III termination signal consists of a stretch of [[thymine]]s (on the nontemplate strand) located within 40bp downstream from the 3' end of mature RNAs.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The poly-T termination signal pauses Pol III and causes it to backtrack to the nearest [[Hairpin loop|RNA hairpin]] to become a “dead-end” complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=S.|author2=Yuzenkova, Y. |author3=Zenkin, N. |title=Mechanism of Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase III Transcription Termination|journal=Science|date=27 June 2013|volume=340|issue=6140|pages=1577–1580|doi=10.1126/science.1237934|pmc=3760304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of termination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epshtein|first=Vitaly|author2=Cardinale, Christopher J. |author3=Ruckenstein, Andrei E. |author4=Borukhov, Sergei |author5= Nudler, Evgeny |title=An Allosteric Path to Transcription Termination|journal=Molecular Cell|date=December 2007|volume=28|issue=6|pages=991–1001|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RNA hairpin allosterically opens Pol III and causes the elongation complex to disintegrate. The extensive structure embedded in the Pol III-transcript thus is responsible for the factor-independent release of Pol III at the end of a gene. RNA-duplex-dependent termination is an ancient mechanism that dates back to the last universal common ancestor.

==Eukaryotic transcriptional control==
The [[regulation of gene expression]] in eukaryotes is achieved through the interaction of several levels of control that acts both locally to turn on or off individual genes in response to a specific cellular need and globally to maintain a chromatin-wide gene expression pattern that shapes cell identity.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shandilya|first=J|author2=Robert SG|title=The transcription cycle in eukaryotes: from productive initiation to RNA polymerase II recycling|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta|year=2012|volume=1819|issue=5|pages=391–400|doi=10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.01.010|pmid=22306664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because eukaryotic genome is wrapped around [[histone]]s to form nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structures, the substrates for transcriptional machinery are in general partially concealed.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Without regulatory proteins, many genes are expressed at low level or not expressed at all. Transcription requires displacement of the positioned nucleosomes to enable the transcriptional machinery to gain access of the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulaeva|first=Olga|author2=Daria Gaykalova |author3=Vasily M. Studitsky |title=Transcription Through Chromatin by RNA polymerase II: Histone Displacement and Exchange|journal=Mutat. Res.|year=2007|volume=618|issue=1–2|pages=116–129|doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.05.040|pmc=1924643|pmid=17313961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All steps in the transcription are subject to some degree of regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Transcription initiation in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for the cell. Transcription initiation is regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific [[trans-acting factor]]s that act as activators or repressors.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Gene transcription can also be regulated post-initiation by targeting the movement of the elongating polymerase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterlin|first=BM|author2=DH Price|title=Controlling the elongation phase of transcription with P-TEFb|journal=Molecular Cell|year=2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=297–305|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2006.06.014|pmid=16885020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global control and epigenetic regulation===
{{main|Epigenetic regulation}}

The eukaryotic genome is organized into a compact chromatin structure that allows only regulated access to DNA. The chromatin structure can be globally "open" and more transcriptionally permissive, or globally "condensed" and transcriptionally inactive. The former ([[euchromatin]]) is lightly packed and rich in genes under active transcription. The latter ([[heterochromatin]]) includes gene-poor regions such as [[telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s but also regions  with normal gene density but transcriptionally silenced. Transcription can be silenced by [[histone modification]] ([[Histone deacetylase|deaceltylation]] and [[Histone methylation|methylation]]), [[RNA interference]], and/or [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bannister|first=Andrew J. |author2=Kouzarides, Tony |title=Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications |journal=Cell Research |date=15 February 2011 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=381–395 |doi=10.1038/cr.2011.22 |pmid=21321607 |pmc=3193420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gene expression patterns that define cell identity are inherited through cell division.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This process is called [[epigenetic regulation]]. DNA methylation is reliably inherited through the action of maintenance methylases that modify the nascent DNA strand generated by replication.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is the primary marker of transcriptionally silenced regions. Specialized proteins can recognize the marker and recruit [[histone deacetylases]] and methylases to re-establish the silencing. Nucleosome histone modifications could also be inherited during cell division, however, it is not clear whether it can work independently without the direction by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Gene-specific activation===
The two main tasks of transcription initiation are to provide RNA polymerase with an access to the promoter and to assemble general transcription factors with polymerase into a transcription initiation complex. Diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter have been identified.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic genes have acquired extensive regulatory sequences that encompass a large number of regulator-binding sites and spread overall kilobases (sometimes hundreds of kilobases) from the promoter–-both upstream and downstream.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The regulator binding sites are often clustered together into units called enhancers. Enhancers can facilitate highly cooperative action of several transcription factors (which constitute [[enhanceosome]]s). Remote enhancers allow transcription regulation at a distance. Insulators situated between enhancers and promoters help define the genes that an enhancer can or cannot influence.

Eukaryotic transcriptional activators have separate DNA-binding and activating functions.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors needed by the transcriptional machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin in the vicinity of the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the transcriptional machinery, or by helping each other bind to their DNA sites.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate transcriptional responses to address cellular needs.

===Gene-specific repression ===
Eukaryotic transcription repressors share some of the mechanisms used by their prokaryotic counterparts. For example, by binding to a site on DNA that overlaps with the binding site of an activator, a repressor can inhibit binding of the activator. But more frequently, eukaryotic repressors inhibit the function of an activator by masking its activating domain, preventing its nuclear localization, promoting its degradation, or inactivating it through chemical modifications.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressors can directly inhibit transcription initiation by binding to a site upstream of a promoter and interacting with the transcriptional machinery. Repressors can indirectly repress transcription by recruiting histone modifiers (deacetylases and methylases) or nucleosome remodeling enzymes that affect the accessibility of the DNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressing histone and DNA modifications are also the basis of transcriptional silencing that can spread along the chromatin and switch off multiple genes.&lt;ref name=Brownbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Terrance A.|title=Genomes|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Liss.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-25046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elongation and termination control===
The elongation phase starts once assembly of the elongation complex has been completed, and progresses until a termination sequence is encountered.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The post-initiation movement of RNA polymerase is the target of another class of important regulatory mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional activator [[Tat (HIV)|Tat]] affects elongation rather than initiation during its regulation of [[HIV]] transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kao|first=Shaw-Yi|author2=Andrew Calman |author3=Paul Luciw |author4=Matija Peterlin |title=Anti-termination of transcription within the long terminal repeat of HIV-1 by tat gene product|journal=Nature|date=3 December 1987|volume=330|pages=489–493|doi=10.1038/330489a0|issue=6147 |pmid=2825027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many eukaryotic genes are regulated by releasing a block to transcription elongation called promoter-proximal pausing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lis|first=J|title=Promoter-associated Pausing in Promoter Architecture and Postinitiation Transcriptional Regulation|journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol|year=1998|volume=63|pages=347–56|doi=10.1101/sqb.1998.63.347|pmid=10384299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausing can influence chromatin structure at promoters to facilitate gene activity and lead to rapid or synchronous transcriptional responses when cells are exposed to an activation signal.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; Pausing is associated with the binding of two negative elongation factors, DSIF (SPT4/SPT5) and NELF, to the elongation complex. Other factors can also influence the stability and duration of the paused polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cheng B, Li T, Rahl PB, Adamson TE, Loudas NB, Guo J, Varzavand K, Cooper JJ, Hu X, Gnatt A, Young RA, Price DH |title=Functional Association of Gdown1 with RNA Polymerase II Poised on Human Genes|journal=Molecular Cell|date=January 2012|volume=45|issue=1|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.022|pmid=22244331|pmc=3259526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pause release is triggered by the recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin /&gt;

Transcription termination has also emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation. Termination is coupled with the efficient recycling of polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feige|first=MJ|author2=LM Hendershot|title=Disulfide bonds in ER protein folding and homeostasis|journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=167–75|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.10.012|pmid=21144725|pmc=3078216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation.

==Transcription-coupled DNA repair==
When transcription is arrested by the presence of a [[Molecular lesion|lesion]] in the transcribed strand of a gene, [[DNA repair]] proteins are recruited to the stalled RNA polymerase to initiate a process called transcription-coupled repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MELLON|first=I|title=Selective removal of transcription-blocking DNA damage from the transcribed strand of the mammalian DHFR gene|journal=Cell|date=October 1987|volume=51|issue=2|pages=241–249|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90151-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this process is the general transcription factor TFIIH that has ATPase activity. TFIIH causes a conformational change in the polymerase, to expose the transcription bubble trapped inside, in order for the DNA repair enzymes to gain access to the lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarker|first=Altaf H.|author2=Tsutakawa, Susan E. |author3=Kostek, Seth |author4=Ng, Cliff |author5=Shin, David S. |author6=Peris, Marian |author7=Campeau, Eric |author8=Tainer, John A. |author9=Nogales, Eva |author10= Cooper, Priscilla K. |title=Recognition of RNA Polymerase II and Transcription Bubbles by XPG, CSB, and TFIIH: Insights for Transcription-Coupled Repair and Cockayne Syndrome|journal=Molecular Cell|date=October 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=187–198|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2005.09.022|pmid=16246722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, RNA polymerase serves as damage-sensing protein in the cell to target repair enzymes to genes that are being actively transcribed.

==Comparisons between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription==
Eukaryotic transcription is more complex than [[Bacterial transcription|prokaryotic transcription]]. For instance, in eukaryotes the genetic material (DNA), and therefore transcription, is primarily localized to the nucleus, where it is separated from the cytoplasm (in which translation occurs) by the nuclear membrane. This allows for the temporal regulation of gene expression through the sequestration of the RNA in the nucleus, and allows for selective transport of mature RNAs to the cytoplasm. Bacteria do not have a distinct nucleus that separates DNA from ribosome and mRNA is translated into protein as soon as it is transcribed. The coupling between the two processes provides an important mechanism for prokaryotic gene regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

At the level of initiation, RNA polymerase in prokaryotes (bacteria in particular) binds strongly to the promoter region and initiates a high basal rate of transcription. No ATP hydrolysis is needed for the close-to-open transition, promoter melting is driven by binding reactions that favor the melted conformation. Chromatin greatly impedes transcription in eukaryotes. Assembly of large multi-protein preinitiation complex is required for promoter-specific initiation. Promoter melting in eukaryotes requires hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, eukaryotic RNA polymerases exhibit a low basal rate of transcription initiation.&lt;ref name=Brownbook /&gt;

==Regulation of transcription in cancer==
{{main|Regulation of transcription in cancer}}

In vertebrates, the majority of gene [[Promoter (genetics)#CpG islands in promoters|promoters]] contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]] with numerous [[CpG site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16432200"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxonov S, Berg P, Brutlag DL |title=A genome-wide analysis of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome distinguishes two distinct classes of promoters |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=1412–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16432200 |pmc=1345710 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510310103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When many of a gene's promoter CpG sites are [[DNA methylation|methylated]] the gene becomes silenced.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 [[Somatic evolution in cancer#Glossary|driver]] mutations and 33 to 66 [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] or passenger mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23539594"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW |title=Cancer genome landscapes |journal=Science |volume=339 |issue=6127 |pages=1546–58 |year=2013 |pmid=23539594 |pmc=3749880 |doi=10.1126/science.1235122 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer.  For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms, such as altered expression of [[MicroRNA#DNA repair and cancer|microRNAs]].&lt;ref name="pmid24616890"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tessitore A, Cicciarelli G, Del Vecchio F, Gaggiano A, Verzella D, Fischietti M, Vecchiotti D, Capece D, Zazzeroni F, Alesse E |title=MicroRNAs in the DNA Damage/Repair Network and Cancer |journal=Int J Genom |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=820248 |year=2014 |pmid=24616890 |pmc=3926391 |doi=10.1155/2014/820248 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of [[BRCA1]] may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see [[BRCA1#Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers|Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers]]).

The term '''evolutionary trap''' has retained several definitions associated with different [[Biology|biological disciplines]].

Within [[evolutionary biology]], this term has been used sporadically to refer to cases in which an evolved, and presumably adaptive, trait has suddenly become maladaptive, leading to the extinction of the species.

Within [[Ethology|behavioral]] and [[ecological]] sciences, evolutionary traps occur when rapid [[environmental change]] triggers organisms to make maladaptive behavioral decisions.&lt;ref name=schlaepfer02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schlaepfer |first=M.A. |authorlink= |author2=Runge, M.C. |author3=Sherman, P.W. |year=2002 |title=Ecological and evolutionary traps |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17 |issue= 10|pages=478–480 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02580-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these traps may take place within any type of behavioral context (e.g. mate selection, navigation, nest-site selection), the most empirically and theoretically well-understood type of evolutionary trap is the [[ecological trap]]&lt;ref name=dwernychuk72&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwernychuk |first=L.W. |authorlink= |author2=Boag, D.A. |year=1972 |title=Ducks nesting in association with gulls-an ecological trap? |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=50 |issue= 5|pages=559–563 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1139/z72-076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents maladaptive [[habitat]] selection behavior.

Witherington&lt;ref name=witherington97&gt;{{cite book |last=Witherington |first=B.E. |editor=Clemons, J.R. |editor2= Bucholz, R. |title=Behavioral approaches to conservation in the wild |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-58054-4 |pages=303–328 |chapter=The problem of photopollution for sea turtles and other nocturnal animals }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates an interesting case of a "navigational trap". Over evolutionary time, hatchling [[sea turtle]]s have evolved the tendency to migrate toward the light of the moon upon emerging from their sand nests. However, in the modern world, this has resulted in them tending to orient towards bright beach-front lighting, which is a more intense light source than the moon. As a result, the hatchlings migrate up the beach and away from the ocean where they exhaust themselves, desiccate and die either as a result of exhaustion, dehydration or predation.

[[Habitat]] selection is an extremely important process in the lifespan of most organisms. That choice affects nearly all of an individual’s subsequent choices,&lt;ref name=orians91&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orians |first=G.H. |authorlink= |author2=Wittenberger, J.F. |year=1991 |title=Spatial and temporal scales in habitat selection |journal=American Naturalist |volume=137 |issue= |pages=S29–S49 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1086/285138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so it may not be particularly surprising the type of evolutionary trap with the best empirical support is the ecological trap. Even so, traps may be relatively difficult to detect and so the lack of evidence for other types of evolutionary trap may be a result of the paucity of researchers looking for them coupled with the demanding evidence required to demonstrate their existence.&lt;ref name=robertson06&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=B.A. |authorlink= |author2=Hutto, R.L. |year=2006 |title=A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence |journal=Ecology |volume=87 |issue= 5|pages=1075–1085 |id= |url= http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&amp;context=biosci_pubs|accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1075:AFFUET]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=16761584 |issn=0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1973, feminist scholar [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] wrote an influential essay, ''The Rhetoric of Women’s Liberation: An Oxymoron'', that drew feminists' attention to women's role as communicators within rhetorical frameworks, and to the relevance of feminist theory to the study of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer | first=Michaela D. E. | title=Women Speak(ing): Forty Years of Feminist Contributions to Rhetoric and an Agenda for Feminist Rhetorical Studies | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=55 | issue=1 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0146-3373 | doi=10.1080/01463370600998293 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar [[Patricia Bizzell]] noted in 1992 that classical canon of rhetoric consists almost entirely of well-educated male authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bizzell|first1=Patricia|date=1992|title=Opportunities for Feminist Research in the History of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminist rhetoric scholars argued that the world of rhetoric was suffused with patriarchal values. To address this perceived problem, they made efforts to include women authors in the history of rhetoric; pointed out connections between feminist issues and theories of rhetoric; and wrote rhetorical criticism from feminist perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-feminist-rhetoric-1690791|title=Feminist Rhetoric|last1=Nordquist|first1=Richard|website=Thought Co.|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics were initially inspired by feminist scholarship outside of rhetoric and composition studies, but eventually developed a distinctive school within this tradition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the initial feminist rhetoric movement, the Coalition of Women (later Feminist) Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition was formed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to its mission statement, this coalition “fosters inquiry in the histories, theories, and pedagogues of rhetoric and composition” for the "advancement of feminist research".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwshrc.org/about-us/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|website=Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting the [[intersectionality]] of communication and collaboration within feminist rhetoric and research methods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Founding members included Winifred Horner, Jan Swearingen, Nan Johnson, Marjone Curry Woods, and Kathleen Welch.&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ratcliffe |first= Krista |chapter=The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries |title=Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric: A Twenty-First Century Guide|editor1=Lynée Lewis Gaillet |editor2=Winifred Bryan Horner |publisher=University of Missouri Press|date=2010 |pages=185–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues with [[Andrea Lunsford]], Jackie Royster, [[Cheryl Glenn (academic)|Cheryl Glenn]], Shirley Logan, and other contemporary feminist writing scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 1996 brought the publication of ''Peitho'', the coalition’s newspaper, published by [[Susan Jarratt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In present day feminist rhetoric, a point of emphasis is changing research methods and methodologies to include the discourse of marginalized groups.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Feminist rhetoric works to expand the rhetorical canon. The rhetorical canon is traditionally composed of five parts: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Canons/Canons.htm|title=the canons of rhetoric|website=rhetoric.byu.edu|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced by the Roman orator [[Cicero]] in his treatise ''De Inventione'' around 50 BC. The idea was expanded by the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] 150 years later in ''Institutio Oratoria.'' The rhetorical canon has been used in rhetorical education since its creation. Rhetorical treatises have based their purpose off these canons. Rhetoric is integrated in the education system, which means that students are taught the rhetorical canon as well. Feminist rhetoric scholars argue that this canon, and its methods of persuasion or argument, exclude some valuable forms of public discourse and narrative, and seek to expand it accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Methodology in rhetoric studies ===
Scholars, such as Jessica Enoch and Jaqueline Jones Royster, introduced the idea of changing the way research is recognized and constructed. Scholars in rhetoric studies agree there is a plethora of voices and demographics to draw upon for data necessary for research in the field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enoch|first=Jessica|date=2004|title="Para La Mujer": Defining a Chicana Feminist Rhetoric at the Turn of the Century|url=|journal=College English|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest this is achieved by asking questions that have never been asked before, recognizing the wealth of materials (or lack thereof) in archives, and expanding the idea of an archive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In recent years, archives have been deconstructed, or critically analyzed, outside of scholarly articles. Feminist rhetorical academics work to develop research methods and methodologies by including new types of archival research such as- yearbooks, small town newspapers, and community contributing archival websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck|first=Amy|date=2017|title=Classbook Sense': Genre and Girls' School Yearbooks in the Early-Twenties- Century American High School|url=|journal=College English|volume=79.4|pages=358–383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global narratives ===
Another main idea in feminist rhetoric is making the point of view, and the rhetorical canon, more expansive than what lies within the United States' domain of discourse.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for  Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies|last1=Royster|first1=Jacqueline Jones|last2=Kirsch|first2=Gesa E.|date=2012|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric scholars ask the questions of how rhetoric, writing studies, and social change intersect, or may be influenced by politics, the economy, religions, cultures, and education.&lt;ref name="Kirsh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Gesa E.|last2=Royster|first2=Jacqueline J.|date=2010|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: In Search of Excellence|jstor=27917867|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=61|issue=4|pages=640–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key term used in this field is "[[transnationality]]", defined as the culture of one nation moving through borders to another nation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is used with the terms cultural hybridity and intertextuality, which continue the theory of cultures, texts, and ideas mixing with one another.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Feminist rhetoric works to represent the voices and discourse of genders that go beyond the binary of male and female. [[Transgender]] discourse is another main point of focus in feminist rhetoric, which is recognized by scholars as a lack of privilege some authors have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawson|first1=K.J.|last2=Ronald|first2=Kate|date=2010|title=Queering Feminist Rhetorical Canonization|journal=Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royster and others have called for research focused on how gender dynamics affect communication, including rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
[[Race and ethnicity]] is an area of focus for several scholars in feminist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have changed research methods to include international races and ethnicity outside the typical rhetoric canon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric focuses on how archiving cultural rhetoric, such as that of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women, can create a better understanding of the pedagogy of research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Jim|date=2008-10-14|title=A Review of: "Refiguring Rhetorical Education: Women Teaching African American, Native American, and Chicano/a Students, 1865–1911, by Jessica Enoch."|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=467–469|doi=10.1080/02773940802405546|issn=0277-3945}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen in feminist rhetoric is the discourse of colored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some female scholars of color have written about their perceived need to mask their identity when sharing their voices and opinions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sano-Franchini, Jennifer, Donnie Sackey and Stacey Pigg. “Methodological Dwellings: A Search for Feminisms in Rhetoric &amp; Composition.” Present Tense, Vol. 1, Issue 2. Michigan State Univ. Press. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric theory works to legitimize the ethnic discourse of women and give it a platform in the academia of rhetoric and writing studies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Challenges ==
Feminist rhetoric scholars have noted the difficulty in including diverse voices in the rhetorical canon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scholars have argued that changes in research methods may be needed to better include the voices of those who are disabled, trans, and [[queer]] in rhetoric studies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dolmage, Jay, et al. “Refiguring Rhetorica: Linking Feminist Rhetoric and Disability Studies.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 23–38. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite longstanding feminist opposition to processes of canonization as inherently imposing limits and excluding perspectives, feminist rhetoric has begun to develop its own canon of commonly referenced texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, feminist rhetoric scholars try to include the works of unknown feminist rhetors in their theorization processes, and develop a gendered analysis or approach that actively includes rhetors who are traditionally excluded from rhetorical canons, such as women of color or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Rhetors, along with expanding the feminist rhetorical canon, work to make feminist rhetoric applicable in pedagogy and education. Scholars discuss the importance of research, whether that be changing research methods or looking further into textual research.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some suggest this can be done by theorizing, others want to employ critical imagination.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Addison, Joanne, and Kate Ronald. “Researching Literacy as a Lived Experience.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 136–151. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Theory as a research method approaches discourse from different communities as a generalized idea that allows people to participate in the world through rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric sees theory in this sense as a form for people to speak out and be included in the rhetorical canon. Critical imagination is using the silence, or lack of work from feminist rhetors, to extrapolate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Scholars discuss how this involves understanding that there is more to not only feminist rhetoric, but feminist practice in theory, than what is written down in textbooks or history. Scholars, such as Royster and Kirsch, acknowledge that feminist rhetoric needs to draw from the silence to help set a new precedent for rhetorical practices in the future.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A part of critical imagination is knowing that the documentation of rhetoric thus far isn’t the only important rhetoric that should contribute to pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Eves, Rosalyn. “Landmark Essays on Rhetoric and Feminism, 1973–2000 ed. by Cheryl Glenn and Andrea Lunsford (Review)” ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'', Volume 19, Number 4. pp. 705-708. Michigan State Univ. Press. Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
A goal of feminist rhetoric is to be viewed as a rhetorical theory of writing as opposed to a social theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Micciche, Laura R., and Kate Ronald. “Writing as Feminist Rhetorical Theory.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 173–188. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric seeks to influence the pedagogy of writing in high school and other levels of academia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Scholars in the field of feminist rhetoric seek to open academic discourse and pedagogy of rhetoric to all types of people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="632">Plant process by which the [[meristem|shoot apical meristem]] changes its anatomy to generate a [[flower]] or [[inflorescence]] in lieu of new [[Node (botany)|nodes]] with [[leaves]]. Anatomical changes begin at the edge of the [[meristem]], generating first the outer whorls of the [[flower]] - the [[sepal|calyx]] and the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]], and later the [[androecium]] and [[gynoecium]].

Flower differentiation can take from only a few days (in [[annual plants]]) to 4–11 months (in [[fruit crops]]).

The process is preceded by [[flower induction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">In [[oncology]], the fact that one round of [[chemotherapy]] does not kill all the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in a [[tumor]] is a poorly understood phenomenon called '''fractional kill''', or '''fractional cell kill'''.

The fractional kill hypothesis states that a defined chemotherapy concentration, applied for a defined time period, will kill a constant fraction of the cells in a population, independent of the absolute number of cells.&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, M. C. (1972). "In vivo determination of the fractional kill of human tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents." Cancer Chemother Rep 56(5): 563-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E. (1979). "Historic milestones in cancer biology: a few that are important in cancer treatment (revisited)." Semin Oncol 6(4): 506-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabner&gt;Chabner, B. and D. L. Longo (2006). Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Philadelphia, Lippincott Willians &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;  In solid tumors, poor access of the tumor to the drug can limit the fraction of tumor cells killed, but the validity of the fractional kill hypothesis has also been established in animal models of leukemia, as well as in human leukemia and lymphoma, where drug access is less of an issue.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;

Because only a fraction of the cells die with each treatment, repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  The goal is to reduce the tumor population to zero with successive fractional kills.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  For example, assuming a 99% kill per cycle of chemotherapy, a tumor of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cells would be reduced to less than one cell with six treatment cycles: 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; * 0.01&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  However, the tumor can also re-grow during the intervals between treatments, limiting the net reduction of each fractional kill.&lt;ref name=skeel&gt;Skeel, R. T. (2003). Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cited cause of fractional killing: cell cycle effects==

The fractional killing of tumors in response to treatment is assumed to be due to the [[cell cycle]] specificity of chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  [[Cytarabine]], a DNA-synthesis inhibitor also known as ara-C, is cited as the classic cell cycle phase-specific agent.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Chemotherapy dosing schedules have been optimized based on the fact that cytarabine is only expected to be effective in the [[S phase|DNA synthesis (S) phase]] of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Consistent with this, leukemia patients respond better to cytarabine treatments given every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours.  This finding that can be explained by the fact that S-phase in these leukemia cells lasts 18–20 hours, allowing some cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of the drug if it is given every 24 hours.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  However, alternative explanations are possible, as described below.

==Lack of cell cycle effect in drugs documented to be cell cycle phase specific==

Very little direct information is available on whether cells undergo [[apoptosis]] from a certain point in the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter&gt;Cotter, T. G., J. M. Glynn, et al. (1992). "The induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents occurs in all phases of the cell cycle." Anticancer Res 12(3): 773-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  One study which did address this topic used [[flow cytometry]] or elutriation of synchronized cells treated with [[actinomycin D1]], [[camptothecin]], or [[aphidicolin]], each of which had been documented to exert its effects in a particular phase of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  Surprisingly, the authors found that each of the agents was able to induce apoptosis in all phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that the mechanism through which the drugs induce apoptosis may be independent of the drugs’ biochemical targets.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  In fact, a trace through the literature on the S-phase specificity of cytarabine leads to studies that simply assume S-phase specificity based on cytarabine’s reported site of biochemical action,&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E., F. M. Schabel, Jr., et al. (1970). "Implications of biochemical, cytokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic relationships in the design of optimal therapeutic schedules." Cancer Chemother Rep 54(6): 431-50.&lt;/ref&gt; which the later papers reference.  The lack of a cell cycle effect for camptothecin has also been reported recently in a live-cell microscopy study.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. A., N. Geva-Zatorsky, et al. (2008). "Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug." Science 322(5907): 1511-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-to-cell variation in protein levels==

A recent paper by Spencer et al.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;Spencer, S. L., S. Gaudet, et al. (2009). "Non-genetic origins of cell-to-cell variability in TRAIL-induced apoptosis." Nature.   http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08012.html.&lt;/ref&gt; raises the possibility that cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations may contribute to fractional killing in the case of treatment with [[TRAIL]] (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand).  TRAIL is a ligand native to the human body that is currently being developed as a cancer treatment.  Spencer et al. observed fractional killing at a single cell level in several cell lines, even in genetically identical populations grown in homogeneous environments.  This paper ruled out the conventional explanation (cell cycle effects) in two of these cell lines, and provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that random variation in cellular initial conditions causes some cells to die while allowing others to survive.

[[File:Friendly Floatees.png|thumb|360px|Route taken by the Friendly Floatees initially lost in the Pacific Ocean in 1992.]]&lt;!--really nice map but a bit inaccurate; spill occurred much farther north, just south of the Aleutians--&gt;

'''Friendly Floatees'''{{clarify|Where did "Friendly" come from? original package just says "Floatees"|date=December 2014}} are plastic bath toys marketed by [[The First Years, Inc]]. and made famous by the work of [[Curtis Ebbesmeyer]], an oceanographer who models [[ocean current]]s on the basis of [[flotsam]] movements. Ebbesmeyer studied the movements of a consignment of 29,000 Friendly Floatees—yellow ducks, red beavers, blue turtles and green frogs—which were washed into the Pacific Ocean in 1992. Some of the toys landed along Pacific Ocean shores, such as Hawaii. Others traveled over 17,000 miles, floating over the site where the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' sank, and spent years frozen in Arctic ice to reach the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], British and Irish shores 15 years later in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mail-1000s"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Clerkin |title=Thousands of rubber ducks to land on British shores after 15 year journey|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-464768/Thousands-rubber-ducks-land-British-shores-15-year-journey.html |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanography==
A consignment of Friendly Floatee toys, manufactured in China for The First Years Inc., departed from [[Hong Kong]] on a [[container ship]], the ''Ever Laurel'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hohn |first=Donovan |date=March 2011 |title=The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them |url= |location= |publisher= |isbn= 9780670022199 |accessdate= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; destined for [[Tacoma, Washington]]. On 10 January 1992, during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean close to the [[International Date Line]], twelve 40-foot (12-m) [[intermodal container]]s were washed overboard. One of these containers held 28,800 Floatees,&lt;ref name="Harper's"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Moby-Duck: Or, The Synthetic Wilderness of Childhood | last = Hohn | first = Donovan | date = January 2007 | publisher = [[Harper's Magazine]] | url = http://mysite.verizon.net/donovanhohn/Moby-Duck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a child's bath toy which came in a number of forms: red [[beaver]]s, green frogs, blue turtles and yellow [[rubber duck|duck]]s. At some point, the container opened (possibly because it collided with other containers or the ship itself) and the Floatees were released. Although each toy was mounted in a plastic housing attached to a backing card, subsequent tests showed that the cardboard quickly degraded in sea water allowing the Floatees to escape. Unlike many bath toys, Friendly Floatees have no holes in them so they do not take on water.

Seattle oceanographers Curtis Ebbesmeyer and James Ingraham, who were working on an ocean surface current model, began to track their progress. The mass release of 28,800 objects into the ocean at one time offered significant advantages over the standard method of releasing 500–1000 drift bottles. The recovery rate of objects from the Pacific Ocean is typically around 2%, so rather than the 10 to 20 recoveries typically seen with a drift bottle release, the two scientists expected numbers closer to 600. They were already tracking various other spills of flotsam, including 61,000 [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] running shoes that had been lost overboard in 1990.

Ten months after the incident, the first Floatees began to wash up along the [[Alaska]]n coast. The first discovery consisted of ten toys found by a [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] near [[Sitka, Alaska]] on 16 November 1992, about 2,000&amp;nbsp;miles&lt;!--are these really [[statute mile]]s, and if so, WHY?--&gt; (3,200&amp;nbsp;km) from their starting point. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham contacted beachcombers, coastal workers, and local residents to locate hundreds of the beached Floatees over a 530&amp;nbsp;mile (850&amp;nbsp;km) shoreline. Another beachcomber discovered twenty of the toys on 28 November 1992, and in total 400 were found along the eastern coast of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] in the period up to August 1993. This represented a 1.4% recovery rate. The landfalls were logged in Ingraham's computer model OSCUR (Ocean Surface Currents Simulation), which uses measurements of air pressure from 1967 onwards to calculate the direction of and speed of wind across the oceans, and the consequent surface currents. Ingraham's model was built to help fisheries but it is also used to predict flotsam movements or the likely locations of those lost at sea.

Using the models they had developed, the oceanographers correctly predicted further landfalls of the toys in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] in 1996 and theorized that many of the remaining Floatees would have travelled to [[Alaska]], westward to Japan, back to Alaska, and then drifted northwards through the [[Bering Strait]] and become trapped in the [[Arctic]] pack ice. Moving slowly with the ice across the Pole, they predicted it would take five or six years for the toys to reach the North Atlantic where the ice would thaw and release them. Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US [[savings bond]] reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in [[New England]], Canada or Iceland.&lt;ref name="Mail-1000s"/&gt; More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007. In July 2007, a retired teacher found a plastic duck on the Devon coast, and British newspapers mistakenly announced that the Floatees had begun to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title =  First of the plastic duck invasion fleet makes landfall on the Devon coast | date = 2000-07-14 | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2072458.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The First of the Duck Armada | last = Coles | first = John | date = 14 July 2007 | work = [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article246146.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the day after breaking the story, the Western Morning News, the local Devon newspaper, reported that Dr. Simon Boxall of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton had examined the specimen and determined that the duck was not in fact a Floatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Expert rules out toy duck as lost ocean adventurer | date = 14 July 2007 | publisher = ''Western Morning News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors.

==Legacy==
At least two children's books have been inspired by the Floatees. In 1997, [[Houghton_Mifflin_Harcourt|Clarion Books]] published ''Ducky'' ({{ISBN|0-395-75185-3}}), written by [[Eve Bunting]] and illustrated by [[Caldecott_Medal|Caldecott Medal]] winner [[David Wisniewski]]. [[Hans_Christian_Andersen_Award|Hans Christian Andersen Award]] winner [[Eric Carle]] wrote ''10 Little Rubber Ducks'' (Harper Collins 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-00-720242-3}}).&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Carl|title=Ugly Ducklings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ea32a4-5732-11e1-be25-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1n2AiRVJ0|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Donovan Hohn]] published ''[[Moby-Duck|Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them]]'' (Viking, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02219-9}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea by Donovan Hohn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/moby-duck-toys-donovan-hohn |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2014, [[The Disney Channel]] and [[Disney Junior]] aired ''Lucky Duck'', a Canadian-American animated tv movie that is loosely based on and inspired by the Friendly Floatees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucky Duck |url=http://disneyjunior.com/lucky-duck |publisher=[[Disney Junior]] |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toys themselves have become collector's items, fetching prices as high as $1,000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7651">A '''fuzzy set operation''' is an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] on [[fuzzy sets]].  These operations are generalization of [[crisp set]] operations. There is more than one possible generalization.  The most widely used operations are called ''standard fuzzy set operations''.  There are three operations:  [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy complements|fuzzy complement]]s, [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy intersections|fuzzy intersection]]s, and [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy unions|fuzzy union]]s.

==Standard fuzzy set operations==
Let A and B be fuzzy sets that A,B ⊆ U, u is any element (e.g. value) in the U universe: u ∈ U.

;Standard complement
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\lnot{A}}(u) = 1 - \mu_A(u)&lt;/math&gt;
The complement is sometimes denoted by '''∁'''A or A&lt;sup&gt;'''∁'''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of '''¬'''A.

;Standard intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cap B}(u) = \min\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Standard union
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cup B}(u) = \max\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the triple (i,u,n) is called '''[[t-norm#Non-standard negators|De Morgan Triplet]]''' [[iff]]
* i is a [[t-norm#Definition|t-norm]],
* u is a [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]] (aka s-norm),
* n is a [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]],
so that for all ''x'',''y'' ∈ [0, 1] the following holds true: 
:''u''(''x'',''y'') = ''n''(''i''(''n''(''x''), ''n''(''y'')) 
(generalized De Morgan relation).&lt;ref&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the axioms provided below in detail.

==Fuzzy complements==
''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is defined as the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''A''. Let ''∁A'' denote a fuzzy complement of ''A'' of type ''c''. Then ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''∁A'', and the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''A''. (''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is therefore the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''∁A''.) Let a complement '''''∁'''A'' be defined by a function

:''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1]

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''c''(''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''))

===Axioms for fuzzy complements===
;Axiom c1. ''Boundary condition''
:''c''(0) = 1 and ''c''(1) = 0

;Axiom c2. ''Monotonicity''
:For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ [0, 1], if ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then ''c''(''a'') &gt; ''c''(''b'')

;Axiom c3. ''Continuity''
:''c'' is continuous function.

;Axiom c4. ''Involutions'' 
:''c'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], which means that ''c''(''c''(''a'')) = ''a'' for each ''a'' ∈ [0,1]
''c'' is a ''strong [[T-norm#Non-standard negators|negator]]'' (aka ''fuzzy complement'').

A function c satisfying axioms c1 and c2 has at least one fixpoint a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with c(a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
and if axiom c3 is fulfilled as well there is exactly one such fixpoint. For the standard negator c(x) = 1-x the unique fixpoint is a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 .&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010"&gt;Günther Rudolph: [https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/rudolph/teaching/lectures/CI/WS2009-10/lec06.pps Computational Intelligence (PPS)], TU Dortmund, Algorithm Engineering LS11, Winter Term 2009/10. Note that this power point sheet may have some problems with special character rendering&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuzzy intersections==
{{main|T-norm}}
The intersection of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval, a function of the form      
  
:''i'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∩ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''i''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy intersection===
;Axiom i1. ''Boundary condition''
:''i''(''a'', 1) = ''a''

;Axiom i2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''i''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''i''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom i3. ''Commutativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''b'') = ''i''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom i4. ''Associativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''i''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''i''(''i''(''a'', ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom i5. ''Continuity''
:''i'' is a continuous function

;Axiom i6. ''Subidempotency''
:''i''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''a''

;Axiom i7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Axioms i1 up to i4 define a '''t-norm''' (aka '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-norm min is the only idempotent t-norm (that is, ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a'' for all ''a'' ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

FUZZY UNION
The union of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval function of the form

:''u'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∪ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''u''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy union===
;Axiom u1.  ''Boundary condition''
:''u''(''a'', 0) =''u''(0 ,''a'') = ''a''

;Axiom u2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''u''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''u''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom u3. ''Commutativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''b'') = ''u''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom u4. ''Associativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''u''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''u''(''u''(''a, ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom u5. ''Continuity''
:''u'' is a continuous function

;Axiom u6. ''Superidempotency''
:''u''(''a'', ''a'') ≥ ''a''

;Axiom u7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  implies ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

Axioms u1 up to u4 define a '''t-conorm''' (aka '''s-norm''' or '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-conorm max is the only idempotent t-conorm (i. e. u (a1, a1) = a for all a ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

==Aggregation operations==
Aggregation operations on fuzzy sets are operations by which several fuzzy sets are combined in a desirable way to produce a single fuzzy set.

Aggregation operation on ''n'' fuzzy set (2 ≤ ''n'') is defined by a function

:''h'':[0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,1]

===Axioms for aggregation operations fuzzy sets===
;Axiom h1. ''Boundary condition''
:''h''(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0  and  ''h''(1, 1, ..., 1) = one

;Axiom h2. ''Monotonicity''
:For any pair &lt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; and &lt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; of ''n''-tuples such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ [0,1] for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''h''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, ''h'' is monotonic increasing in all its arguments.

;Axiom h3. ''Continuity''
:''h'' is a continuous function.

There is a row of triangular [[amulet]] [[kilim motifs|motifs]] (Muska) at top and bottom; each of the four lower guls has a star motif (Yıldız) at its centre.]]
[[File:Oriental rugs, antique and modern (1922) (14780627715).jpg|thumb|[[Turkmens|Turkmen]] carpet with 3 central gul medallions]]

A '''gul''' (also written gol, göl and gül) is a medallion-like design element typical of traditional hand-[[Weaving|woven]] carpets from [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]]. In Turkmen weavings they are often repeated to form the pattern in the main field.

==Shape==

Guls are medallions, often [[octagon]]al, and often somewhat angular on a generally octagonal plan, though they can be somewhat rounded within the constraints of carpet-weaving, and some are lozenge-shaped ([[rhombus]]es). They usually have either [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|twofold rotational symmetry]] or mirror [[reflection symmetry]] (often both left/right and up/down).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Gallery. Carpet Turkey (Kurdish) 18th century |url=http://mathforum.org/geometry/rugs/gallery/08.html |publisher=MathForum |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guls were historically described in the West as being elephant's foot motifs. Other Western guesses held that the gul was a drawing of a round Turkmen tent, with lines between tents representing irrigation canals; or that the emblem was a [[totem]]ic bird. None of these descriptions have any basis in weaving tradition or culture.&lt;ref name=ThompsonElephant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term gul, gol, göl or gül is used widely across Central and West Asia, and among carpet specialists in the West. It may derive from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word gol, which means flower or rose,&lt;ref name=LittlePersia&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Layouts and Designs|url=http://www.little-persia.com/?action=RugDesign#gul |publisher=Little Persia |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Turkish word gül which similarly means a rose or roundel.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] weavings, such as bags and rugs, guls are often repeated to form the basic pattern in the main field (excluding the border).&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan&gt;{{cite web|title=Carpet Motifs: A Beginner’s Guide|url=http://arastan.com/journey/carpet-motifs-beginners-guide|publisher=Arastan|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This use of guls is occasionally found also in Turkish carpets, though they more often have one or a few guls arranged centrally in the main field.--&gt;

The different Turkmen tribes such as [[Teke tribe|Tekke]], [[Salor]], [[Ersari]] and [[Yomut]] traditionally wove a variety of guls, some of ancient design, but gul designs were often used by more than one tribe, and by non-Turkmens.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan/&gt;

Western authors have used comparison of the "design vocabulary" of tribal guls, reproduced on traditional rugs, in studying the [[ethnogenesis]] of Asian peoples.&lt;ref name=Mace&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mace, Ruth |author2=Holden, Clare J. |author3=Shennan, Stephen |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YP_p5eS898C |title=The evolution of cultural diversity: a phylogenetic approach |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-84472-099-3 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Western culture==
[[File:Hans Memling 065.jpg|thumb|Triptych by [[Hans Memling]], 1479, with a gul-patterned carpet at the Virgin's feet]]
{{further|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}

Western artists including [[Hans Memling]] depicted [[oriental carpet]]s from Turkish Anatolia with guls in several of his paintings, to the extent that these are known as [[Memling carpet]]s. These guls often contain star or (hooked) dragon [[Kilim motifs|motifs]] as found on 15th century [[Konya]] carpets.&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;{{cite web |last1=Howe |first1=R.

[[File:Holartico.png|thumb|250px|Holarctic]]
The '''Holarctic''' is the name for the [[biogeographic realm]] that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining [[Alfred_Russel_Wallace | Wallace]]'s [[Palearctic]] [[Zoogeography | zoogeographical region]], consisting of [[North Africa]] and all of [[Eurasia]] (with the exception of the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]), and the [[Nearctic]] zoogeographical region, consisting of [[North America]], north of [[Mexico]].  These regions are further subdivided into a variety of [[ecoregions]].  Many [[ecosystems]], and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm.  The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm.  The [[Floristic kingdom|floristic]] [[Boreal Kingdom]] corresponds to the Holarctic realm.

== Major ecosystems ==
Within the Holarctic realm, there are a variety of ecosystems.  The type of ecosystem found in an area depends on the latitude and local geography.  In the far north, a band of arctic [[tundra]] circles the shore of the [[Arctic Ocean]].  The ground beneath this land is [[permafrost]], frozen year-round.  In these difficult growing conditions, few plants can survive.  South of the tundra, the [[boreal forest]] stretches across North America and Eurasia.  This land is characterized by coniferous trees.  South of here, the ecosystems become more diverse.  Some areas are covered in [[temperate grassland]], while others are covered in [[temperate forest]], dominated by deciduous trees.  The southern extent of the Holarctic typically reaches into the [[desert]], which is dominated by plants and animals adapted to the dry conditions (Schultz 2007).

== Species with a holarctic distribution ==
A variety of animal species are distributed across continents, throughout much of the Holarctic realm.  Some of these included the brown bear, grey wolf, red fox, wolverine,  moose, caribou, golden eagle and the common raven.

The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is found in mountainous and semi-open areas distributed throughout the Holarctic.  It once occupied much larger areas, but has been driven out by human development and the resulting habitat fragmentation.  Today it is only found in remaining wilderness areas.

The [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') is found in a wide variety of habitats from tundra to desert, with different populations adapted for each.  Its historical distribution encompasses the vast majority of the Holarctic realm, though human activities such as development and active extermination have extirpated the species from much of this range.

The [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') is a highly adaptable predator.  It has the widest distribution of any terrestrial carnivore, and is adapted to a wide range of habitats, including areas of intense human development.  Like the wolf, it is distributed throughout the majority of the Holarctic, but it has avoided extirpation.

The [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'') is a large member of the weasel family found primarily in the arctic and in boreal forests, ranging south in mountainous regions.  It is distributed in such areas throughout Eurasia and North America.

The [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') is the largest member of the deer family.  It is found throughout most of the boreal forest through continental Eurasia into Scandinavia, eastern North America, and boreal and montane regions of western North America.  In some areas it ranges south into the deciduous forest.  
 
The caribou, or [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus'') is found in boreal forest and tundra in the northern parts of the Holarctic.  In Eurasia it has been domesticated.  It is divided into several subspecies, which are adapted to different habitats and geographic areas.

The [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).

The [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') is the most widespread of the corvids, and one of the largest.  It is found in a variety of habitats, but primarily wooded northern areas.  It has been known to adapt well to areas of human activity.  Their distribution also makes up most of the Holarctic realm.

''[[Leptothorax acervorum]]'' is a small red holarctic ant widely distributed across Eurasia, ranging from central Spain and Italy to the northernmost parts of Scandinavia and Siberia.

== Origin ==
The continuity of the northern parts of the holarctic results from their shared [[glacial]] history.  During the [[Pleistocene]], these areas were subjected to repeated glaciations.  Icecaps expanded, scouring the land of life and reshaping its topography.  During glacial periods, species survived in [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], small areas that maintained a suitable climate due to local geography.  These areas are believed to have been primarily in southern regions, but some genetic and [[paleontological]] evidence points to additional refugia in the sheltered areas of the north (Stewart and Lister 2001).

Wherever these areas were found, they became source populations during interglacial periods.  When the glaciers receded, plants and animals spread rapidly into the newly opened areas.  Different taxa responded to these rapidly changing conditions in different ways.  Tree species spread outward from refugia during interglacial periods, but in varied patterns, with different trees dominating in different periods (Taberlet and Chedadi 2002).  [[Insects]], on the other hand, shifted their ranges with the climate, maintaining consistency in species for the most part throughout the period (Coope 1994).  Their high degree of mobility allowed them to move as the glaciers advanced or retreated, maintaining a constant habitat despite the climatic oscillations.  Despite their apparent lack of mobility, plants managed to colonize new areas rapidly as well.  Studies of fossil pollen indicate that trees recolonized these lands at an exponential rate (Bennet 1986).  Mammals recolonized at varying rates.  Brown bears, for instance, moved quickly from refugia with the receding glaciers, becoming one of the first large mammals to recolonize the land (Sommer and Benecke 2005).  The last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago, resulting in the present distribution of ecoregions.

Another factor contributing to the continuity of Holarctic ecosystems is the movement between continents allowed by the [[Bering land bridge]], which was exposed by the lowering of sea level due to the expansion of the ice caps.  The communities found in the Palearctic and the Nearctic are different, but have many species in common.  This is the result of several faunal interchanges that took place across the Bering land bridge.  However, these migrations were mostly limited to large, cold-tolerant species (Rodriguez et al. 2006).  Today it is mainly these species which are found throughout the realm.

== Threats ==
As the Holarctic is an enormous area, it is subject to environmental problems of international scale.  The primary threats throughout the region result from [[global warming]] and [[habitat fragmentation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The former is of particular concern in the north, as these ecosystems are adapted to cold.  The latter is more of a concern in the south, where development is prevalent.

Global warming is a threat to all the Earth's ecosystems, but it is a more immediate threat to those found in cold climates.  The communities of species found at these latitudes are adapted to the cold, so any significant warming can upset the balance.  For instance, insects struggle to survive the cold winters typical of the boreal forest.  Many do not make it, especially in harsh winters.  However, recently the winters have grown milder, which has had a drastic effect on the forest.  Winter mortality of some insect species drastically decreased, allowing the population to build on itself in subsequent years.  In some areas the effects have been severe.  [[Spruce beetle]] outbreaks have wiped out up to ninety percent of the [[Kenai Peninsula]]'s spruce trees; this is blamed primarily on a series of unusually warm years since 1987 (Logan et al. 2003).

In this case a native species has caused massive disturbance of habitat as a result of climate change.  Warming temperatures may also allow pest species to enlarge their range, moving into habitats that were previously unsuitable.  Studies of potential areas for outbreaks of [[bark beetle]]s indicate that as the climate shifts, these beetles will expand to the north and to higher elevations than they have previously affected (Williams &amp; Liebhold 2002).  With warmer temperatures, insect infestation will become a greater problem throughout the northern parts of the Holarctic.

Another potential effect of global warming to norther ecosystems is the melting of [[permafrost]].  This can have significant effects on the plant communities that are adapted to the frozen soil, and may also have implications for further climate change.  As permafrost melts, any trees growing above it may die, and the land shifts from forest to peatland.  In the far north, shrubs may later take over what was formerly tundra.  The precise effect depends on whether the water that was locked up is able to drain off.  In either case, the habitat will undergo a shift.  Melting permafrost may also accelerate climate change in the future.  Within the permafrost, vast quantities of [[carbon]] are locked up.  If this soil melts, the carbon may be released into the air as either [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]].  Both of these are [[greenhouse gas]]es (Stokstad 2004).

Habitat fragmentation threatens a wide variety of habitats throughout the world, and the Holoarctic is no exception.  Fragmentation has a variety of negative effects on populations.  As populations become cut off, their genetic diversity suffers and they become susceptible to sudden disasters and extinction.   While the northern parts of the Holarctic represent some of the largest areas of wilderness left on Earth, the southern parts are in some places extensively developed. This realm contains most of the worlds [[developed countries]], including the [[United States]] and the nations of [[Western Europe]].  Temperate forests were the primary ecosystem in many of the most developed areas today.  These lands are now used for intensive agriculture or have become urbanized.  As lands have been developed for agricultural uses and human occupation, natural habitat has for the most part become limited to areas considered unsuitable for human use, such as slopes or rocky areas (Schultz 2007).  This pattern of development limits the ability of animals, especially large ones, to migrate from place to place.

Large carnivores are particularly affected by habitat fragmentation.  These mammals, such as brown bears and wolves, require large areas of land with relatively intact habitat to survive as individuals.  Much larger areas are required to maintain a sustainable population.  They may also serve as [[keystone species]], regulating the populations of the species they prey on.  Thus, their conservation has direct implications for a wide range of species, and is difficult to accomplish politically due to the large size of the areas they need (Paquet 1996).  With increasing development, these species in particular are at risk, which could have effects that carry down throughout the ecosystem.

== Conservation actions ==
The threats to the Holarctic realm are not going unrecognized.  Many efforts are being made to mitigate these threats, with the hope of preserving the biodiversity of the region.  International agreements to combat global warming may help to lessen the effects of climate change on this region.  Efforts are also underway to fight habitat fragmentation, both on local and regional scales.

The most comprehensive effort to combat global warming to date is the [[Kyoto Protocol]].  Developed countries who sign this protocol agree to cut their collective greenhouse gas emissions by five percent since 1990 by sometime between 2008 and 2012.  The vast majority of these nations are found within the Holarctic.  Each country is given a target for emission levels, and they may trade emissions credits in a market-based system that includes [[developing countries]] as well.  Once this period is ended, a new agreement will be written to further mitigate the effects of climate change.  The process of drafting a new agreement has already begun.  In late 2007, an international meeting in [[Bali]] was held to begin planning for the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  This agreement will aim to build on the successes and failures of Kyoto to produce a more effective method of cutting greenhouse gas emissions ([[UNFCCC]]).  If these efforts are successful, the biodiversity of the Holarctic and the rest of the world will see fewer effects of climate change.

Fighting habitat fragmentation is a major challenge in conserving the wide-ranging species of the Holarctic.  Some efforts are limited to a local scale of protection, while others are regional in scope.  Local efforts include creating [[Nature reserve|reserves]] and establishing safe routes for animals to cross roads and other human-made barriers.  Regional efforts to combat habitat fragmentation take a broader scope.

One major such effort in the Holarctic is the [[Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative]].  This organization was started in 1997 to help establish a contiguous network of protection for the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], from mid [[Wyoming]] to the border between [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]]'s [[Yukon]].  It brings together a wide variety of environmental organizations for a shared purpose.  The goal of the Initiative is to create a core of protected areas, connected by corridors and surrounded by buffer zones.  This will build on the many existing protected areas in this region, with a focus on integrating existing and future human activities into the conservation plan rather than seeking to exclude them (Yellowstone to Yukon).  If these efforts are successful, they will be especially beneficial to wide-ranging species such as [[grizzly bear]]s.  If these species can survive, other members of the communities they live in will survive as well.

{{Thermoreg}}
[[File:Phylogenetic-Groups.svg|thumbnail|300px|The group that includes mammals and birds, both "warm-blooded" homeothermic animals (in red) is [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]].]]
'''Homeothermy''' or '''homothermy''' is [[thermoregulation]] that maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence. This internal [[body temperature]] is often, though not necessarily, higher than the immediate environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanov|first=K.P.|year=2005|title=The development of the concepts of homeothermy and thermoregulation|url=http://www.fvet.uba.ar/areas/fisica/articulos_cient_divulgacion/The_development_of_the_concepts_of_homeothermy_and_thermoregulation.pdf|journal=Journal of Thermal Biology|volume=31|pages=24–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὅμοιος ''homoios'' "similar" and θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). Homeothermy is one of the three types of thermo regulation in [[warm-blooded]] animal species.  Homeothermy's opposite is [[poikilothermy]].

Homeotherms are ''not'' necessarily [[endotherm]]ic. Some homeotherms may maintain constant body temperatures through behavioral mechanisms alone, ''i.e.'', behavioral thermoregulation. Many reptiles use this strategy. For example, desert lizards are remarkable in that they maintain near-constant activity temperatures that are often within a degree or two of their lethal critical temperatures.

==Pros==
[[Enzyme]]s have a relatively narrow temperature range at which their efficiencies are optimal. Temperatures outside this range can greatly reduce the rate of a reaction or stop it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Roy M.|last2=Peterson|first2=Michelle E.|last3=Danson|first3=Michael J.|last4=Price|first4=Nicholas C.|last5=Kelly|first5=Sharon M.|last6=Monk|first6=Colin R.|last7=Weinberg|first7=Cristina S.|last8=Oudshoorn|first8=Matthew L.|last9=Lee|first9=Charles K.|date=2010-01-15|title=The molecular basis of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity|url=http://www.biochemj.org/content/425/2/353|journal=Biochemical Journal|language=en|volume=425|issue=2|pages=353–360|doi=10.1042/BJ20091254|issn=0264-6021|pmid=19849667}}&lt;/ref&gt; A creature with a fairly constant body temperature can therefore specialize in enzymes which are efficient at that particular temperature. A [[poikilothermic|poikilotherm]] must either operate well below optimum efficiency most of the time, migrate, hibernate or expend extra resources producing a wider range of enzymes to cover the wider range of body temperatures.

However, some environments offer much more consistent temperatures than others. For example, the tropics often have seasonal variations in temperature that are smaller than their diurnal variations. In addition, large bodies of water, such as the [[ocean]] and very large [[lake]]s, have moderate temperature variations. The waters below the ocean surface are particularly stable in temperature.

==Cons==
Because many homeothermic animals use enzymes that are specialized for a narrow range of body temperatures, [[hypothermia]] rapidly leads to [[torpor]] and then death.  Additionally, homeothermy obtained from endothermy is a high energy strategy and many environments will offer lower [[carrying capacity]] to these organisms. In cold weather the energy expenditure to maintain body temperature accelerates starvation and may lead to death.

[[File:Cribbing.jpg|thumb|A house raised and held on box cribs during foundation work]]
'''House raising''' (house lifting, house jacking, barn jacking, building jacking) is the process of separating a building from its [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and temporarily raising it with hydraulic  screw [[Jack (device)|jacks]]. The process is the first step in [[structure relocation]] in which the building is moved to a different location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nachi.org/house-raising.htm House Raising], [[International Association of Certified Home Inspectors]]&lt;/ref&gt; House raising may also be a part of a [[renovation]] to build a foundation under an existing house or make a house larger by building a new floor level creating a two story house. Often employed in areas that are prone to flooding and storm damage, this process can be achieved through the use of either timber piles or helical piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.myfoundationsolutions.com/disaster-recovery/|title = House Raising Solutions by My Foundation Solutions|website = www.myfoundationsolutions.com|access-date = 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a house is raised and supported on [[Box crib|cribbing]], a new foundation can be constructed beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/rebuild/mat/sec5.pdf Elevating Your House - Federal Emergency Management Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] large numbers of houses in parts of Louisiana, New York and New Jersey were raised to avoid future flooding.

Other house raising technologies include the Atlas House Lifting System which is emerging as an alternative to traditional jacking and shoring methods. Utilizing an electromechanical jacking mechanism, the engineered system offers clear span maneuvering beneath lifted structures.

Jacking and [[shoring]], such as using [[jack post]]s, are used to hold a wooden building up during foundation and [[Sill plate|sill]] repairs.

Little published information is available about building jacking methods. The skills are usually acquired through experience working for a building jacking or moving company.

The '''International Centre for Tax and Development''' ('''ICTD''') is a research centre based at the [[Institute of Development Studies]], and funded by the UK's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) and the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]]. Founded in 2010 with close to £6 million in funding, its mission is to generate knowledge that will help developing countries to mobilise domestic resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably, and develop tax systems that promote good governance and pro-poor economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=2010 |title=Research for Development Project Record/ International Centre for Tax and Development |publisher=[[DFID]] |url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60813 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714143321/http%3A//r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60813/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title=Beyond Magic Bullets in Governance Reform |publisher= [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/11/04/beyond-magic-bullets-in-governance-reform }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards these ends, the ICTD fosters a network of social science researchers from developing countries to engage with taxation issues by funding research, building research capacity through courses and workshops, and collaborating with a range of partners including the [[African Tax Administration Forum]], the [[Institute for Security Studies]], and the [[Chr.

'''''Kiplinger's Personal Finance''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|p|l|ɪ|ŋ|ər|z}} KIP-ling-ers) is an American [[personal finance]] [[magazine]] published by [[Kiplinger]] since 1947. It claims to be the first American personal finance magazine and to deliver "sound, unbiased advice in clear, concise language". It offers advice on managing money and achieving financial security, saving, investing, planning for retirement, paying for college, and major purchases like automobiles and homes. [[Janet Bodnar]] has been the editor of ''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' magazine since January 2009.

==History==
[[W.M. Kiplinger]], founder of the [[Kiplinger]] family of publications, said he founded the magazine because "The times will always be changing. Much of life and work consists of looking for the changes in advance and figuring out what to do about them."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Upon initial production, the magazine was known simply as ''Kiplinger Magazine'', changing its name to ''Changing Times'' in 1949 and acquiring its present name in 1991.

Much like ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, ownership of the Kiplinger's franchise has been kept in the family.  The current editor-in-chief is [[Knight Kiplinger]], who succeeded his father, [[Austin H. Kiplinger]].

On July 14, 2001, it was announced that ''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' would be acquiring ''Individual Investor'' magazine.  Details of the deal included Kiplinger agreeing to pay $3.5 million for the ''Individual Investor'' subscription list and Kiplinger agreeing to assume $2.6 million in debt. At the time of the acquisition, ''Individual Investor'' had 430,000 subscribers (reportedly, Kiplinger had 1,000,000 subscribers before the acquisition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/07/14/fin_individual_investor.html Individual Investor magazine shuts down].

'''Limitations of animal running speed''' provides an overview of how various factors determine the maximum [[Sprint (running)|running]] speed. Some terrestrial animals are built for achieving extremely high speeds, such as the [[cheetah]], [[pronghorn]], race [[Horse racing|horse]] and [[Greyhound racing|greyhound]], while humans can train to achieve high sprint speeds. There is no single determinant of maximum running speed: however, certain factors stand out against others and have been investigated in both animals and humans. These factors include: Muscle moment arms, foot morphology, muscle architecture, and muscle fiber type. Each factor contributes to the [[Ground reaction force|ground reaction force (GRF)]] and foot contact time of which the changes to increase maximal speed are not well understood across all species.

==Ground reaction force and foot contact time==
*GRF is a common variant which is studied in running gait. It has been shown in humans that as [[velocity]] increases, there is a linear increase in the vertical GRF.&lt;ref&gt;He, J. P., R. Kram, et al. (1991). "Mechanics of running under simulated low gravity." Journal of Applied Physiology 71(3): 863-870.&lt;/ref&gt; The GRF during running exceeds the body weight and therefore the extra force must be applied by the body. In a study by Weyand et al., it was shown that faster human runners achieved higher speeds by applying greater vertical GRF and not by increasing swing time.&lt;ref&gt;Weyand PG, Sternlight DB, Bellizzi MJ, Wright S. Faster top running speeds are achieved with greater ground forces not more rapid leg movements. J Appl Physiol 81: 1991–1999, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be the case in cheetahs.
*Foot contact time, or stance time, is the time that the foot is in contact with the ground. There is evidence that shows that foot contact time is significantly decreased in humans as speed is increased.&lt;ref name = "Weyand"&gt;Weyand, P. G., R. F. Sandell, et al. (2010). "The biological limits to running speed are imposed from the ground up." Journal of Applied Physiology 108(4): 950-961.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It has been shown that the fastest speeds are attained when the product of the foot contact time and vertical GRF are decreased to minimums which provides enough time for the swinging limb to get in position for the next step.&lt;ref name = Weyand/&gt; Both the GRF and foot contact time are determined by variables such as muscle moment arm, foot morphology, [[muscle fascicle]] length, and muscle fiber type.

[[File:Torque.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An example of torque in real life.]]

===Muscle moment arm===
A muscle's [[Torque|moment arm]] is defined as the perpendicular distance from the muscle's line of action to the joint's center of rotation. As a general rule, the larger the moment arm of a muscle, the greater [[torque]] it can produce with the same amount of force. At the same time, the muscle would cause a smaller change in joint angle for the same amount of length change. As an example, holding a wrench at the very end of the handle (point B) makes it easier to loosen a bolt, however, requires your hand to travel a greater distance compared to holding the wrench closer to the bolt (point A). Although both the cheetah and greyhound are similar in size, the cheetah can attain speeds nearly twice as fast as the greyhound. This can be explained partly by the finding that moment arms of muscles at the knee and ankle joint in the cheetah are proportionally larger than those of the greyhound.&lt;ref name = "hudson"&gt;Hudson, P. E., S. A. Corr, et al. (2011). "Functional anatomy of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) hindlimb." Journal of Anatomy 218(4): 363-374.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar comparison can be made between two similar species of [[lizard]]s. It was found that geckoes more adapted for climbing have greater hip and shoulder retractor moment arms. Geckoes adapted for horizontal locomotion have greater knee and ankle extensor moment arms.&lt;ref&gt;Zaaf, A., A. Herrel, et al. (1999). "Morphology and morphometrics of the appendicular musculature in geckoes with different locomotor habits (Lepidosauria)." Zoomorphology 119(1): 9-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foot morphology===
[[Image:Lever Principle 3D.png|thumb|right|300px|A lever in balance]]

[[Comparative foot morphology|Foot morphology]] in this context mainly refers to the ratio of forefoot (in front of the ankle joint) to the hindfoot (behind the ankle joint). This ratio is an indication of the effective [[mechanical advantage]] (EMA) and can also be represented by a balancing seesaw. A study done on humans, comparing ankle-foot structure using MRI, showed that sprinters had a longer forefoot:hindfoot ratio compared to non-sprinters.&lt;ref name = "baxter"&gt;Baxter, J. R., T. A. Novack, et al. (2012). "Ankle joint mechanics and foot proportions differ between human sprinters and non-sprinters." Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 279(1735): 2018-2024.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the foot to remain in contact with the ground for longer amount of time while decreasing the moment arm. This decreases the rate of muscle shortening and increases the force generated by extensor muscles during the push off phase.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, D., Heglund, N. &amp; Earls, K. 1994 Variable gearing during locomotion in the human musculoskeletal system. Science 265, 651–653.&lt;/ref&gt; These larger gear ratios during the push off phase have been shown to occur in accelerating humans as well as top animal sprinters.&lt;ref name = hudson/&gt;&lt;ref name = baxter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, M. 1994 Analysis of vertebrate structure, 4th edn. New York, NY: J. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger moment arms of the cheetah may be achieved if the forefoot is also proportionally larger.

===Muscle architecture and fiber type===
[[Image:Illu muscle structure.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Structure of a skeletal muscle]]

Both the [[Skeletal striated muscle#Structure of skeletal muscle fiber|architecture]] and [[Skeletal striated muscle#Muscle fibers|type of muscle]] play a crucial role in determining foot contact time and production of GRF. In humans, it has been shown that sprinters have longer muscle fascicle lengths and smaller pennation angles than non-sprinters.&lt;ref&gt;Kumagai, K., T. Abe, et al. (2000). "Sprint performance is related to muscle fascicle length in male 100-m sprinters." Journal of Applied Physiology 88(3): 811-816.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abe, T., Fukashiro, S., Harada, Y. &amp; Kawamoto, K. 2001 Relationship between sprint performance and muscle fascicle length in female sprinters. J. Physiol. Anthropol. Appl. Human. Sci. 20, 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes by increasing the muscle's shortening velocity. Other studies have shown that particular muscle fiber types are favored in sprinters versus non-sprinters, as well as within different levels of sprinters. Faster individuals tend to have a greater percentage of Type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, A. and R. Robergs (2011). "The Science of Speed: Determinants of Performance in the 100 m Sprint." International Journal of Sports Science and Coaching 6(3): 479-494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadoyama, T., Masuda, T., Miyata, H. &amp; Katsuta, S. 1988 Fibre conduction velocity and fibre composition in human vastus lateralis. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup. Physiol. 57, 767–771.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers lead to increased force production capability, as well as increased speed of contractions leading to shorter contact times.

===Other===
Other factors also play a role:
*[[Muscle#Strength|Muscle Strength]]
**Larger muscles are able to generate higher amounts of force and are therefore able to produce larger GRF's
*Elastic Energy Storage
**Cheetahs use flexion and extension of the spine to contribute significantly to speed by increasing foot contact time and swing time&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, M. (1959). "Motions of the Running Cheetah and Horse." Journal of Mammalogy 40(4): 481-495.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]] is the leading theory of the first instant of the [[universe]], called the [[Big Bang theory]].

{{About|the carnal desire}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Luxuria).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Detail: ''Luxuria'' (Lust), in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
{{emotion}}
'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions'', 1994, New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==

Religions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes)  is maintained to be something God-given and moral.

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|tanha}}

Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality.  It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by ''lust''.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is that way.

Lust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other "[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]") in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]

===Christianity===
==== New Testament ====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word "lust" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{"|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term "lust" is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for ''desire'', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests "set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{"|You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbor.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when [the [[prodigal son]]] had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

====Catholicism====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], a Christian's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name="PopeJohn"&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is "sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 39-40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, "Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'", ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, p. 165-194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).

In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his [[Psychomachia]] or Battle of the Soul had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) p. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent [[Thomism]], included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present:&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the "sulphur" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is "impure", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity "poisons" the body and leads to many kinds of "diseases".

The Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172. Elizabeth Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the "second glance", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt; [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]],2701 "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.".&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not advocate [[celibacy]] but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.

===Judaism===

{{main article|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

===Paganism===

Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[Wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

===Meher Baba's teachings===

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===

Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in "red light districts." In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England. New York: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==

[[File:Mujeres riendo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goya]]'s [[Man Mocked by Two Women]] (''Dos Mujeres y un hombre''), c. 1820]]

=== Literature ===

From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others," insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==

The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===

[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of "voluptuous emotions," and makes the point that sexual pleasures, "unloosen the human spirit," and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, "if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present," (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a "nocturnal orgasm," it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, "stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm," (Pg. 225).  In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The "mind's awareness is less hindered," as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence "invading of a bed not one's own," (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it "wrongs the offspring," because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, "fornication is a deadly crime," (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, "Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, "…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must "endow her and have her to wife," and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a "thing of another species," for example animals. Aquinas said, "bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity" and is therefore, unnatural.

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==

[[Barry Long]] states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an [[sexual fantasy|imagined sexual scene]] and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrylong.org/statements/manschallenge.shtml |title=Barry Long Foundation International |publisher=Barrylong.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'MAKING LOVE Sexual Love the Divine Way' Barry Long, Book {{ISBN|978-1-899324-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, Gold Coast Talks audio, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: "You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==

{{Main article|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of "heightened [[libido]]".

A person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003| title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: Context-specific effects of facial resemblance| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 272| issue = 1566| pages = 919–22| year = 2005| last1 = Debruine | first1 = L.

[[Image:RWS Tarot 01 Magician.jpg|thumb|200px|The Magician (I), an illustration from the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]] first published in 1910.]]
'''Magic''' is a category in [[Western culture]] into which since the [[Age_of_Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] have been placed various beliefs and practices considered separate from both [[religion]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|last=Bailey|first=Michael D.|title=Magic and Superstition in Europe: A Concise History from Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=2–3|isbn=9780742533875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the term often had pejorative connotations, with things labelled ''magical'' perceived as being primitive, foreign, and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. The concept has been adopted by scholars in the [[study of religion]] and the [[social sciences]], who have proposed various different—and often mutually exclusive—definitions of the term; much contemporary scholarship regards the concept to be so problematic that it is better to reject it altogether as a useful analytic construct.

The term ''magic'' comes from the [[Old Persian]] ''magu'', a word that applied to a form of religious functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, this term was adopted into [[Ancient Greek]], where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by [[Latin]] in the first century BCE. Via Latin, the concept was incorporated into [[Christian theology]] during the first century CE, where magic was associated with [[demons]] and thus defined against (Christian) religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, when Christian authors categorised a diverse range of practices—such as enchantment, [[witchcraft]], [[incantation]]s, [[divination]], [[necromancy]], and [[astrology]]—under the label ''magic''. In [[early modern Europe]], Italian [[Humanism|humanists]] reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to create the idea of [[natural magic]]. Both negative and positive understandings of the term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.

Since the nineteenth century, academics in various disciplines have employed the term ''magic'' but have defined it in different ways and used it in reference to different things. One approach, associated with the [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Edward Tylor]] and [[James G. Frazer]], uses the term to describe beliefs in [[sympathetic magic|hidden sympathies]] between objects that allow one to influence the other. Defined in this way, magic is portrayed as the opposite to science. An alternative approach, associated with the [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], employs the term to describe private rites and ceremonies and contrasts it with religion, which it defines as a communal and organised activity. Many scholars of religion have rejected the utility of the term ''magic'', arguing that it is arbitrary and ethnocentric; it has become increasingly unpopular within scholarship since the 1990s.

Throughout Western history, there have been examples of individuals who engaged in practices that their societies called ''magic'' and who sometimes referred to themselves as ''magicians''. Within modern [[occultism]], there are many self-described magicians and people who practice ritual activities that they term magic. In this environment, the concept of magic has again changed, usually being defined as a technique for bringing about changes in the physical world through the force of one's will. This definition was pioneered largely by the influential British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].

==Definition==

{{Main|Magic and religion}}

Since the emergence of the [[study of religion]] and the [[social science]]s, magic has been a "central theme in the theoretical literature" produced by scholars operating in these academic disciplines.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=3}} According to the scholar of religion Randall Styers, attempting to define magic represents "an act of demarcation" by which it is juxtaposed against "other social practices and modes of knowledge" such as "religion" and "science".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=25}} Scholars have engaged in extensive debates as to how to define magic,{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=3}} with such debates resulting in intense dispute.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} Throughout such debates, the scholarly community has failed to agree on a definition of magic, in a similar manner to how they have failed to agree on a definition of religion.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} Even among those throughout history who have described themselves as magicians, there has been no common understanding of what magic is.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=7}} Thus, as the historian Michael D. Bailey describes it, "magic" represents "a deeply contested category and a very fraught label";{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=8}} the fellow historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] stated that the word was "beyond simple definition".{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=2}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Magic has often been dismissed as either primitive and irrational and therefore alien to modern society, as inherently opposed to the Judeo-Christian traditions of the West, or as incompatible with religion in general. These antipathetic sentiments are deeply embedded in Western culture, and the term magic has typically been used to describe non-mainstream beliefs and practices — non-Christians, heretics, non-Westerners, indigenous, ancient or 'primitive' cultures — any that might be considered 'Other.' The image of magic as inherently linked with the Other has functioned as an important factor in the construction of the self-identity of Western culture, for by defining magic as something alien, exotic, primitive, evil, deviant or even ridiculous, our society also makes a tacit statement as to its self-perceptions."|source=&amp;ndash; Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=2}} }}

Many scholars have argued that the use of the term as an analytical tool within academic scholarship should be rejected altogether.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=2003|1p=103|2a1=Styers|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Otto|3a2=Stausberg|3y=2013|3p=1|4a1=Bailey|4y=2018|4p=3}}  The scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example argued that it had no utility as an [[etic]] term that scholars should use.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=166}} The historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] agreed, stating that "the term magic is an important object ''of'' historical research, but not intended ''for'' doing research."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=168}} The scholars of religion Berndt-Christian Otto and [[Michael Stausberg]] suggested that it would be perfectly possible for scholars to talk about [[amulet]]s, [[curse]]s, healing procedures, and other cultural practices often regarded as magical in Western culture without any recourse to the concept of magic itself.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=11}} The idea that "magic" should be rejected as an analytic term developed in anthropology, before moving into [[Classical studies]] and [[Biblical studies]] in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=100}} Since the 1990s, the term's usage among scholars of religion has declined.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=166}}

The concept and term "magic" developed in European society and thus using it when discussing non-Western cultures or pre-modern forms of Western society raises problems, as it may impose Western categories that are alien to them.{{sfnm|1a1=Otto|1a2=Stausberg|1y=2013|1p=6|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=27}} While "magic" remains an emic term in the history of Western societies, it remains an etic term when applied to non-Western societies.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=27}} During the twentieth century, many scholars focusing on Asian and African societies rejected the term "magic", as well as related concepts like "[[witchcraft]]", in favour of the more precise terms and concepts that existed within these specific societies.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=19}} A similar approach has been taken by many scholars studying pre-modern societies in Europe, such as [[Classical antiquity]], who find the modern concept of 'magic' inappropriate and favour more specific terms originating within the framework of the ancient cultures which they are studying.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=2003|1p=104|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=20}} Alternately, this term implies that all categories of magic are ethnocentric and that such Western preconceptions are an unavoidable component of scholarly research.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=6}}

Within Western culture, the term "magic" has been linked to ideas of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]],{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=2}} foreignness,{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=89}} and primitivism.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}} In Styers' words, it has become "a powerful marker of cultural difference".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}} It has also been repeatedly presented as the archetypally non-modern phenomenon.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=8}} Among Western intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, magic was seen as a defining feature of "primitive" mentalities and was commonly attributed to marginal groups, locations, and periods.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}}

==Etymology and conceptual development==

===Ancient world===

====The Old Persian ''maguš''====

[[File:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|150px|thumb|right|One of the earliest surviving accounts of the Persian ''mágoi'' was provided by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].]]

The English words ''magic'', ''mage'' and ''magician'' come from the Latin ''magus'', through the Greek ''μάγος'', which is from the [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'' ("magician").{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=169|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}} The Old Persian ''magu-'' is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*magh'' ("be able"), which was absorbed into the Iranian language; Iranians thereafter began using the word ''maguš'' ("magician"; i.e., an "able [specialist in ritual]") or ''*maghu'', which may have led to the [[Old Chinese|Old Sinitic]] ''*Mᵞag'' ("mage" or "shaman").{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=47}} The Old Persian form seems to have permeated Ancient [[Semitic languages]] as the [[Talmudic]] [[Hebrew]] ''magosh'', the [[Aramaic]] ''amgusha'' ("magician"), and the [[Chaldea]]n ''maghdim'' ("wisdom and philosophy"); from the first century BCE onwards, [[Syria]]n ''magusai'' gained notoriety as magicians and soothsayers.{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=36}}

The Magi are mentioned in both the [[Book of Jeremiah]] and the [[Behistun Inscription]] of [[Darius I]], indicating that they had gained considerable power and influence by the middle of the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=36-37}} A number of ancient Greek authors discuss these Persian ''mágoi'' in their works. Among the first to do so was the historian [[Herodotus]], who states that the ''mágoi'' were one of seven Median tribes and that they served as functionaries at the court of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], where they acted as advisers to the king.{{sfnm|1a1=Bremmer|1y=2002|1p=2|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}} According to Herodotus, these Persian ''mágoi'' were also in charge of various religious rites, namely sacrifices and the interpretation of dreams.{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=3|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}}

====In ancient Greece====

The term ''magic'' has its origins in [[Ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Bremmer|2002|p=1}}
During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, the Persian ''maguš'' was Graecicized and introduced into the ancient Greek language as ''μάγος'' and ''μαγεία''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In doing so it underwent a transformation of meaning, gaining negative connotations, with the ''magos'' being regarded as a charlatan whose ritual practices were fraudulent, strange, unconventional, and dangerous.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} As noted by Davies, for the ancient Greeks—and subsequently for the ancient Romans—"magic was not distinct from religion but rather an unwelcome, improper expression of it - the religion of the other".{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=41}}

This change in meaning was influenced by the military conflicts that the Greek city-states were then engaged in against the Persian Empire.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In this context, the term makes appearances in such surviving text as [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', [[Hippocrates]]' ''[[De morbo sacro]]'', and [[Gorgias]]' ''[[Encomium of Helen]]''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} In Sophocles' play, for example, the character [[Oedipus]] derogatorily refers to the seer [[Tiresius]] as a ''magos''—in this context meaning something akin to 'quack' or 'charlatan'—reflecting how this epithet was no longer reserved only for Persians.{{sfnm|1a1=Bremmer|1y=2002|1pp=2–3|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=19}}

In the first century BCE, the Greek concept of the ''magos'' was adopted into [[Latin]] and used by a number of [[ancient Roman]] writers as ''magus'' and ''magia''.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} The Roman use of the term was similar to that of the Greeks, but placed greater emphasis on the judicial application of it.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} Within the [[Roman Empire]], laws would be introduced criminalising things regarded as magic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}}
In ancient Roman society, magic was associated with societies to the east of the empire; the first century CE writer [[Pliny the Elder]] for instance claimed that magic had been created by the Persian philosopher [[Zoroaster]], and that it had then been brought west into Greece by the magician [[Osthanes]], who accompanied the military campaigns of the Persian King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=32–33}}

===Early Christianity and the Middle Ages===

In the first century CE, early Christian authors absorbed the Greco-Roman idea of magic and incorporated it into their developing [[Christian theology]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} These Christians retained the Graeco-Roman negative connotations of the term and enhanced them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed from Jewish thought.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} Like earlier Graeco-Roman thinkers, the early Christians attributed the origins of magic to an area to the east of Europe, among the Babylonians, Persians, or Egyptians.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=34}}

For early Christian writers like [[Augustine of Hippo]], magic did not merely constitute fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices, but was the very opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from [[demons]], the henchmen of [[Satan]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} In this, Christian ideas of magic were closely linked to the Christian category of [[paganism]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=41–42}} Ever since, the idea that magic is something defined in opposition to religion has been pervasive throughout Western culture.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=1}} This Christian emphasis on the inherent immorality and wrongness of magic as something conflicting with good religion was far starker than the approach in the other large [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions of the period, Judaism and Islam.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}} For instance, while Christians regarded demons as inherently evil, the [[jinn]]—comparable entities in [[Islamic mythology]]—were perceived as more ambivalent figures by Muslims.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}}

The model of the magician in Christian thought was provided by [[Simon Magus]], or "Simon the Magician", a figure who opposed [[Saint Peter]] in both the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the apocryphal yet influential [[Acts of Peter]].{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=99}} The historian Michael D. Bailey stated that in medieval Europe, "magic" was a "relatively broad and encompassing category".{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=21}} Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic, the majority of which were types of [[divination]].{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|pp=10–11}} For instance, [[Isidore of Seville]] produced a catalogue of things he regarded as magic in which he listed [[augury]], [[necromancy]], [[astrology]], [[incantations]], [[horoscopes]], [[amulets]], [[geomancy]], [[hydromancy]], [[aeromancy]], [[pyromancy]], enchantment and [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Kieckhefer|1y=2000|1p=11|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=21}} Medieval Europe also saw magic come to be associated with the Old Testament figure of [[Solomon]]; various [[grimoires]], or books outlining magical practices, were written that claimed to have been written by Solomon, most notably the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=35}}

In early medieval Europe, ''magia'' was a term of condemnation.{{sfn|Flint|1991|p=5}} In medieval Europe, Christians often suspected Muslims and Jews of engaging in magical practices;{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=6|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=88}} in certain cases, these perceived magical rites—including the [[Blood libel|alleged Jewish sacrifice of Christian children]]—resulted in Christians massacring these religious minorities.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=6}} Christian groups often also accused other, rival Christian groups—which they regarded as [[heresy|heretical]]—of engaging in magical activities.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=99}} Medieval Europe also saw the term ''maleficium'' applied to forms of magic that were conducted with the intention of causing harm.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=21}} The later Middle Ages saw words for these practitioners of harmful magical acts appear in various European languages: ''sorcière'' in French, ''Hexe'' in German, ''strega'' in Italian, and ''bruja'' in Spanish.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=22}} The English term for malevolent practitioners of magic, ''witch'', derived from the earlier [[Old English]] term ''wicce''.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=22}}

===Early modern Europe===

[[File:Natural Magick by Giambattista della Porta.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of an English translation of ''Natural Magick'' published in London in 1658.]]

During the early modern period, the concept of magic underwent a more positive reassessment through the development of the concept of ''[[natural magic|magia naturalis]]'' (natural magic).{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} This was a term introduced and developed by two Italian humanists, [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} For them, ''magia'' was viewed as an elemental force pervading many natural processes,{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} and thus was fundamentally distinct from the mainstream Christian idea of demonic magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Kieckhefer|1y=2000|1p=12|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=170}} Their ideas influenced an array of later philosophers and writers, among them [[Paracelsus]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Johannes Reuchlin]], and [[Johannes Trithemius]].{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=17}} According to the historian [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the concept of ''magia naturalis'' took "firm hold in European culture" during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|p=12}} attracting the interest of [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] of various theoretical orientations, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]].{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=35}}

Adherents of this position argued that ''magia'' could appear in both good and bad forms; in 1625, the French librarian [[Gabriel Naudé]] wrote his ''Apology for all the Wise Men Falsely Suspected of Magic'', in which he distinguished "Mosoaicall Magick"—which he claimed came from God and included prophecies, miracles, and [[speaking in tongues]]—from "geotick" magic caused by demons.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=35–36}} While the proponents of ''magia naturalis'' insisted that this did not rely on the actions of demons, critics disagreed, arguing that the demons had simply deceived these magicians.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=739}} By the seventeenth century the concept of ''magia naturalis'' had moved in increasingly 'naturalistic' directions, with the distinctions between it and science becoming blurred.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=738}} The validity of ''magia naturalis'' as a concept for understanding the universe then came under increasing criticism during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}}

Despite the attempt to reclaim the term ''magia'' for use in a positive sense, it did not supplant traditional attitudes toward magic in the West, which remained largely negative.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}} At the same time as ''magia naturalis'' was attracting interest and was largely tolerated, Europe saw an active persecution of accused witches believed to be guilty of ''maleficia''.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=35}} Reflecting the term's continued negative associations, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] often sought to denigrate [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] sacramental and devotional practices as being magical rather than religious.{{sfnm|1a1=Styers|1y=2004|1pp=9, 36–37|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=7}} Many Roman Catholics were concerned by this allegation and for several centuries various Roman Catholic writers devoted attention to arguing that their practices were religious rather than magical.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}} At the same time, Protestants often used the accusation of magic against other Protestant groups which they were in contest with.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=37}} In this way, the concept of magic was used to prescribe what was appropriate as religious belief and practice.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}}
Similar claims were also being made in the Islamic world during this period. The Arabian cleric [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]—founder of [[Wahhabism]]—for instance condemned a range of customs and practices such as divination and the veneration of spirits as ''sihr'', which he in turn claimed was a form of ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'', the sin of idolatry.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=9}}

===Colonialism and academia===

In the sixteenth century, European societies began to conquer and colonise other continents around the world, and as they did so they applied European concepts of "magic" and "witchcraft" to practices found among the peoples whom they encountered.{{sfnm|1a1=Styers|1y=2004|1p=60|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=23}} Usually, these European colonialists regarded the natives as primitives and savages whose belief systems were diabolical and needed to be eradicated and replaced by Christianity.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=23}} Because Europeans typically viewed these non-European peoples as being morally and intellectually inferior to themselves, it was expected that such societies would be more prone to practicing magic.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=98}} Women who practiced traditional rites were labelled "witches" by the Europeans.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=98}}

[[File:Affaire de Bizoton 1864.png|thumb|left|In the nineteenth century, the Haitian government began to legislate against Vodou, describing it as a form of witchcraft; this conflicted with Vodou practitioners' own understanding of their religion.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=25}}]]

In various cases, these imported European concepts and terms underwent new transformations as they merged with indigenous concepts.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=24}} In West Africa, for instance, Portuguese travellers introduced their term and concept of the ''feitiçaria'' (often translated as ''sorcery'') and the ''feitiço'' (spell) to the native population, where it was transformed into the concept of the ''[[Fetishism|fetish]]''. When later Europeans encountered these West African societies, they wrongly believed that the ''fetiche'' was an indigenous African term rather than the result of earlier inter-continental encounters.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=24}} Sometimes, colonised populations themselves adopted these European concepts for their own purposes. In the early nineteenth century, the newly independent Haitian government of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] began to suppress the practice of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], and in 1835 Haitain law-codes categorised all Vodou practices as ''sortilège'' (sorcery/witchcraft), suggesting that it was all conducted with harmful intent, whereas among Vodou practitioners the performance of harmful rites was already given a separate and distinct category, known as ''maji''.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=25}}

By the nineteenth century, European intellectuals no longer saw the practice of magic through the framework of [[sin]] and instead regarded magical practices and beliefs as "an aberrational mode of thought antithetical to the dominant cultural logic - a sign of psychological impairment and marker of racial or cultural inferiority".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=27}}
As educated elites in Western societies increasingly rejected the efficacy of magical practices, legal systems ceased to threaten practitioners of magical activities with punishment for the crimes of diabolism and witchcraft, and instead threatened them with the accusation that they were defrauding people through promising to provide things which they could not.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=103}}

This spread of European colonial power across the world influenced how academics would come to frame the concept of magic.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=61}}
In the nineteenth century, a number of scholars adopted the traditional, negative concept of magic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}} That they chose to do so was not inevitable, for they could have followed the example adopted by prominent [[Western esotericism|esotericists]] active at the time like [[Helena Blavatsky]] who had chosen to use the term and concept of magic in a positive sense.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=18}}
Various writers also used the concept of magic to criticise religion by arguing that the latter still displayed many of the negative traits of the former. An example of this was the American journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] in his polemical 1930 work ''[[Treatise on the Gods]]''; he sought to critique religion by comparing it to magic, arguing that the division between the two was misplaced.{{sfn|Styers|2004|pp=9–10}}

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[folkloristics|folklorists]] examined rural communities across Europe in search of magical practices, which at the time they typically understood as survivals of ancient belief systems.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=29}} It was only in the 1960s that anthropologists like [[Jeanne Favret-Saada]] also began looking in depth at magic in European contexts, having previously focused on examining magic in non-Western contexts.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=30–31}}

The scholarly application of magic as a ''sui generis'' category that can be applied to any socio-cultural context was linked with the promotion of [[modernity]] to both Western and non-Western audiences.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=167}}

The term ''magic'' has become pervasive in the popular imagination and idiom.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}}
In contemporary contexts, the word ''magic'' is sometimes used to "describe a type of excitement, of wonder, or sudden delight", and in such a context can be "a term of high praise".{{sfn|Flint|1991|p=3}} Despite its historical contrast against science, scientists have also adopted the term in application to various concepts, such as [[magic acid]], [[Magic bullet (medicine)|magic bullets]], and [[magic angle]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}}

===Modern Western occultism===

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Concepts of modern magic are often heavily influenced by the ideas of Aleister Crowley]]

Modern Western magic has challenged widely-held preconceptions about contemporary religion and spirituality.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|pp=1–2}}
The polemical discourses about magic influenced the self-understanding of modern magicians, a number of whom—such as [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Julius Evola]]—were well versed in academic literature on the subject.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}}
According to scholar of religion Henrik Bogdan, "arguably the best known emic definition" of the term "magic" was provided by Crowley.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} Crowley—who favoured the spelling "[[Magick (Thelema)|magick]]" over "magic" to distinguish it from stage illusionism{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2012|1p=12|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2pp=22–23}}—was of the view that "Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will".{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} Crowley's definition influenced that of subsequent magicians.{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} [[Dion Fortune]] of the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]] for instance stated that "Magic is the art of changing consciousness according to Will".{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], stated that magic was "attempting to cause the physically unusual",{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}} while [[Anton LaVey]], the founder of [[LaVeyan Satanism]], described magic as "the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally acceptable methods, be unchangeable."{{sfn|Bogdan|2012|p=11}}

The [[chaos magic]] movement emerged during the late 20th century, as an attempt to strip away the [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic, [[Theology|theological]] or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions and distill magic down to a set of basic techniques.&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Urban |year=2006 |title=Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wVBx9yriTUC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=240–243 |isbn=9780520932883 |ref=refUrban}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult |last=Drury |first=Nevill |author-link=Nevill Drury |publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers| year=2011 |orig-year=2002 |isbn=9781780283623 |url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bmg8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |page=86 |ref = refDrury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These modern Western concepts of magic rely on a belief in correspondences connected to an unknown occult force that permeates the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=741}} As noted by Hanegraaff, this operated according to "a ''new'' meaning of magic, which could not possibly have existed in earlier periods, precisely because it is elaborated in reaction to the "disenchantment of the world"."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=741}}
For many, and perhaps most, modern Western magicians, the goal of magic is deemed to be personal spiritual development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}
The perception of magic as a form of self-development is central to the way that magical practices have been adopted into forms of [[modern Paganism]] and the [[New Age]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}
One significant development within modern Western magical practices has been [[sex magic]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}} This was a practice promoted in the writings of [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and subsequently exerted a strong interest on occultist magicians like Crowley and [[Theodor Reuss]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006b|p=743}}

The adoption of the term "magic" by modern occultists can in some instances be a deliberate attempt to champion those areas of Western society which have traditionally been marginalised as a means of subverting dominant systems of power.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=19}} The influential American [[Wicca]]n and author [[Starhawk]] for instance stated that "''Magic'' is another word that makes people uneasy, so I use it deliberately, because the words we are comfortable with, the words that sound acceptable, rational, scientific, and intellectually correct, are comfortable precisely because they are the language of estrangement."{{sfn|Styers|2004|pp=19–20}}

==Academic definitions==

Magic is one of the most heavily theorized concepts in the study of religion,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=164}} and also played a key role in early theorising within anthropology.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=21}} Styers believed that it held such a strong appeal for social theorists because it provides "such a rich site for articulating and contesting the nature and boundaries of modernity".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=21}} Scholars have commonly used it as a foil for the concept of religion, regarding magic as the "illegitimate (and effeminized) sibling" of religion.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=6}} Alternately, others have used it as a middle-ground category located between religion and science.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=6}}

The context in which scholars framed their discussions of magic was informed by the spread of European colonial power across the world in the modern period.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=61}}
These repeated attempts to define magic resonated with broader social concerns,{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=8}} and the pliability of the concept has allowed it to  be "readily adaptable as a polemical and ideological tool".{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=9}} The links that intellectuals made between magic and "primitives" helped to legitimise European and Euro-American imperialism and colonialism, as these Western colonialists expressed the view that those who believed in and practiced magic were unfit to govern themselves and should be governed by those who, rather than believing in magic, believed in science and/or (Christian) religion.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}} In Bailey's words, "the association of certain peoples [whether non-Europeans or poor, rural Europeans] with magic served to distance and differentiate them from those who ruled over them, and in large part to justify that rule."{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=89}}

Many different definitions of magic have been offered by scholars, although — according to Hanegraaff — these can be understood as variations of a small number of heavily influential theories.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=164}}

===Intellectualist approach===

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edward Tylor, an anthropologist who used the term ''magic'' in reference to sympathetic magic, an idea that he associated with his concept of animism]]

The intellectualist approach to defining magic is associated with two prominent British [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[James G. Frazer]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|pp=164–165}} This was an approach that viewed magic as being the theoretical opposite of [[science]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=165|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=4}} and came to preoccupy much anthropological thought on the subject.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=4}} This approach was situated within the evolutionary models which underpinned thinking in the social sciences during the early 19th century.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=14–15}} The first social scientist to present magic as something that predated religion in an evolutionary development was [[Herbert Spencer]];{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=15}} in his ''A System of Synthetic Philosophy'', he used the term ''magic'' in reference to [[sympathetic magic]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=16–17}} Spencer regarded both magic and religion as being rooted in false speculation about the nature of objects and their relationship to other things.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=17}}

Tylor's understanding of magic was linked to his concept of [[animism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=15|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=15}} In his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor characterized magic as beliefs based on "the error of mistaking ideal analogy for real analogy".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=164}} In Tylor's view, "primitive man, having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact, proceeded erroneously to invert this action, and to conclude that association in thought must involve similar connection in reality. He thus attempted to discover, to foretell, and to cause events by means of processes which we can now see to have only an ideal significance".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=716}} Tylor was dismissive of magic, describing it as "one of the most pernicious delusions that ever vexed mankind".{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=18|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=16}} Tylor's views proved highly influential,{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=16}} and helped to establish magic as a major topic of anthropological research.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=15}}

[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|James Frazer regarded ''magic'' as the first stage in human development, to be followed by religion and then science]]

Tylor's ideas were adopted and simplified by James Frazer.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=16}} He used the term "magic" to mean sympathetic magic,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2pp=15–16}} describing it as a practice relying on the magician's belief "that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy", something which he described as "an invisible ether".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=716}} He further divided this magic into two forms, the "homeopathic (imitative, mimetic)" and the "contagious". The former was the idea that "like produces like", or that the similarity between two objects could result in one influencing the other. The latter was based on the idea that contact between two objects allowed the two to continue to influence one another at a distance.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=19|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716}} Like Taylor, Frazer viewed magic negatively, describing it as "the bastard sister of science", arising from "one great disastrous fallacy".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=19}}

Where Frazer differed from Taylor was in characterizing a belief in magic as a major stage in humanity's cultural development, describing it as part of a tripartite division in which "magic" came first, "religion" came second, and eventually "science" came third.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=19|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716|3a1=Davies|3y=2012|3p=16|4a1=Bailey|4y=2018|4pp=15–16}} For Frazer, all early societies started as believers in magic, with some of them moving away from this and into religion.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=20}} He believed that both magic and religion involved a belief in spirits but that they differed in the way that they responded to these spirits. For Frazer, magic "constrains or coerces" these spirits while religion focuses on "conciliating or propitiating them".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=20}} He acknowledged that their common ground resulted in a cross-over of magical and religious elements in various instances; for instance he claimed that the [[sacred marriage]] was a fertility ritual which combined elements from both world-views.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=20–21}}

Some scholars retained the evolutionary framework used by Frazer but changed the order of its stages; the German ethnologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] argued that ''religion''—by which he meant [[monotheism]]—was the first stage of human belief, which later degenerated into both magic and [[polytheism]].{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=18–19}} Others rejected the evolutionary framework entirely. Frazer's notion that magic had given way to religion as part of an evolutionary framework was later deconstructed by the folklorist and anthropologist [[Andrew Lang]] in his essay "Magic and Religion"; Lang did so by highlighting how Frazer's framework relied upon misrepresenting ethnographic accounts of beliefs and practiced among indigenous Australians to fit his concept of magic.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=17}}

===Functionalist approach===

The functionalist approach to defining magic is associated with the French [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Emile Durkheim]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=165}}
In this approach, magic is understood as being the theoretical opposite of religion.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=165}}

Mauss set forth his conception of "magic" in a 1902 essay, "A General Theory of Magic".{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1y=2012|1p=18|2a1=Bailey|2y=2018|2p=16}} Mauss used the term ''magic'' in reference to "any rite that is not part of an organized cult: a rite that is private, secret, mysterious, and ultimately tending towards one that is forbidden".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2012|2p=165}} Conversely, he associated religion with organised cult.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=47}} By saying that magic was inherently non-social, Mauss had been influenced by the traditional Christian understandings of the concept.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=717}} Mauss deliberately rejected the intellectualist approach promoted by Frazer, believing that it was inappropriate to restrict the term ''magic'' to sympathetic magic, as Frazer had done.{{sfnm|1a1=Cunningham|1y=1999|1p=47|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2006|2p=716}} He expressed the view that "there are not only magical rites which are not sympathetic, but neither is sympathy a prerogative of magic, since there are sympathetic practices in religion".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=47}}

Mauss' ideas were adopted by Durkheim in his 1912 book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=716|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2p=17}} Durkheim was of the view that both magic and religion pertained to "sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=44}} Where he saw them as being different was in their social organisation. Durkheim used ''magic'' to describe things that were inherently anti-social, existing in contrast to what he referred to as a "Church," the religious beliefs shared by a social group; in his words, "There is no Church of magic."{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=165|2a1=Davies|2y=2012|2pp=17–18}} Durkheim expressed the view that "there is something inherently anti-religious about the maneuvers of the magician",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=165}} and that a belief in magic "does not result in binding together those who adhere to it, nor in uniting them into a group leading a common life."{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=44}}

Scholars have criticized the idea that magic and religion can be differentiated into two distinct, separate categories.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|pp=5–6}} The social anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] suggested that "a simple dichotomy between magic and religion" was unhelpful and thus both should be subsumed under the broader category of [[ritual]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=49}} Many later anthropologists followed his example.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=49}}
Nevertheless, this distinction is still often made by scholars discussing this topic.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|pp=5–6}}

===Emotionalist approach===
{{Further|Magical thinking|Psychological theories of magic}}
The emotionalist approach to magic is associated with the English anthropologist [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], the Austrian psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]], and the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=23}}

Marett viewed magic as a response to stress.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} In a 1904 article, he argued that magic was a cathartic or stimulating practice designed to relieve feelings of tension.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} As his thought developed, he increasingly rejected the idea of a division between magic and religion and began to use the term "magico-religious" to describe the early development of both.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=24}} Malinowski understood magic in a similar manner to Marett, tackling the issue in a 1925 article.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|pp=28–29}} He rejected Frazer's evolutionary hypothesis that magic was followed by religion and then science as a series of distinct stages in societal development, arguing that all three were present in each society.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} In his view, both magic and religion "arise and function in situations of emotional stress" although whereas religion is primarily expressive, magical is primarily practical.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} He therefore defined magic as "a practical art consisting of acts which are only means to a definite end expected to follow later on".{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} He for instance believed that fertility rituals were magical because they were carried out with the intention of meeting a specific need.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=29}} As part of his [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] approach, Malinowski saw magic not as irrational but as something that served a useful function, being sensible within the given social and environmental context.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=22}}

Freud also saw magic as emerging from human emotion but interpreted it very differently to Marett.{{sfn|Cunningham|1999|p=25}}
Freud explains that "the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; it does not explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace the laws of nature by psychological ones".{{sfn|Freud|Strachey|1950|p=83}} Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: "His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth in order to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation in such a way that it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor [[hallucination]]s. This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the ''motives'' for the magical act on to the ''measures'' by which it is carried out—that is, on to the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result."{{sfn|Freud|Strachey|1950|p=84}}

In the early 1960s, the anthropologists Murray and Rosalie Wax put forward the argument that scholars should look at the "magical worldview" of a given society on its own terms rather than trying to rationalize it in terms of Western ideas about scientific knowledge.{{sfn|Davies|2012|pp=25–26}} Their ideas were heavily criticised by other anthropologists, who argued that they had set up a false dichotomy between non-magical Western worldview and magical non-Western worldviews.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=26}} The concept of the "magical worldview" nevertheless gained widespread use in history, folkloristics, philosophy, cultural theory, and psychology.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=27}}

According to [[Stanley Tambiah]], magic, science, and religion all have their own "quality of rationality", and have been influenced by politics and ideology.{{sfn|Tambiah|1991|p=2}} As opposed to religion, Tambiah suggests that mankind has a much more personal control over events. Science, according to Tambiah, is "a system of behavior by which man acquires mastery of the environment."{{sfn|Tambiah|1991|p=8}}

Many of the practices which have been labelled magic can be performed by anyone.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} For instance, some charms can be recited by individuals with no specialist knowledge nor any claim to have having a specific power.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Others require specialised training in order to perform them.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Some of the individuals who performed magical acts on a more than occasional basis came to be identified as magicians, or with related concepts like sorcerers/sorceresses, [[witch]]es, or cunning folk.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Identities as a magician can stem from an individual's own claims about themselves, or it can be a label placed upon them by others.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} In the latter case, an individual could embrace such a label, or they could reject it, sometimes vehemently.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}}

There can be economic incentives that encouraged individuals to identify as magicians.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=103}} In the cases of various forms of traditional healer, as well as the later stage magicians or illusionists, the label of magician could become a job description.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=85}} Others claim such an identity out of a genuinely held belief that they have specific unusual powers or talents.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=105}}

Some historians have drawn a differentiation between those practitioners who engage in high magic, and those who engage in low magic.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} In this framework, high magic is seen as more complex, involving lengthy and detailed ceremonies as well as sophisticated, sometimes expensive, paraphernalia.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} Low magic is associated with simpler rituals such as brief, spoken charms.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}}

In some cultures, terms such as ''sorcerer'', ''sorceress'', ''wizard'', ''witch'', etc. are applied to specific types of magicians based on their gender, abilities, sources of power, moral standing within the community, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Filotas|first1=Bernadette|title=Pagan Survivals, Superstitions, Popular Cultures|date=2005|publisher=Pontifical Inst. of Medieval Studies|location=Toronto|isbn=9780888441515|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=classification+of+magicians#v=onepage&amp;q=classification%20of%20magicians&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of personal traits may be credited with giving magical power, and frequently they are associated with an unusual birth into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glucklich|first1=Ariel|title=The End of Magic|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195355239 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most common method of identifying, differentiating, and establishing magical practitioners from common people is by [[initiation]]. By means of rites the magician's relationship to the supernatural and his entry into a closed professional class is established (often through rituals that simulate death and rebirth into a new life).{{sfn|Mauss|Bain|Pocock|2007|pp=41–44}}
Mauss argues that the powers of both specialist and common magicians are determined by culturally accepted standards of the sources and the breadth of magic: a magician cannot simply invent or claim new magic. In practice, the magician is only as powerful as his peers believe him to be.{{sfn|Mauss|Bain|Pocock|2007|p=33, 40}}

Throughout recorded history, magicians have often faced scepticism regarding their purported powers and abilities.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=49}} For instance, in sixteenth-century England, the writer [[Reginald Scot]] wrote ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', in which he argued that many of those accused of witchcraft or otherwise claiming magical capabilities were fooling people using illusionism.{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=51}}

===Suspicions and accusations of witchcraft===
{{See also|Witchcraft}}

Those regarded as being magicians have often faced suspicion from other members of their society.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=68}} This is particularly the case if these perceived magicians have been associated with social groups already considered morally suspect in a particular society, such as foreigners, women, or the lower classes.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=71}} In contrast to these negative associations, many practitioners of activities that have been labelled magical have emphasised that their actions are benevolent and beneficial.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|pp=71–2}} This conflicted with the common Christian view that all activities categorised as being forms of magic were intrinsically bad regardless of the intent of the magician, because all magical actions relied on the aid of demons.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=72}} There could be conflicting attitudes regarding the practices of a magician; in European history, authorities often believed that cunning folk and traditional healers were harmful because their practices were regarded as magical and thus stemming from contact with demons, whereas a local community might value and respect these individuals because their skills and services were deemed beneficial.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=90}}

In Western societies, the practice of magic, especially when harmful, was usually associated with women.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=92}} For instance, during the witch trials of the early modern period, around three quarters of those executed as witches were female, to only a quarter who were men.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=93}} That women were more likely to be accused and convicted of witchcraft in this period might have been because their position was more legally vulnerable, with women having little or no legal standing that was independent of their male relatives.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=93}} The conceptual link between women and magic in Western culture may be because many of the activities regarded as magical—from rites to encourage fertility to potions to induce [[abortion]]s—were associated with the female sphere.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=94}} It might also be connected to the fact that Western cultures regularly portrayed women as being inferior to men on an intellectual, moral, spiritual, and physical level.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=96}}

The following is a chronology of discoveries concerning the [[magnetosphere]].

*1600 - [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] in London suggests the Earth is a giant magnet.
*1741 - [[Hiorter]] and [[Anders Celsius]] note that the polar aurora is accompanied by a disturbance of the magnetic needle.
*1820 - [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovers electric currents create magnetic effects. [[André-Marie Ampère]] deduces that magnetism is basically the force between electric currents.
*1843 - [[Samuel Heinrich Schwabe|Samuel Schwabe]], a German amateur astronomer, shows the existence of an 11-year sunspot cycle.
*1859 - [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] in England observes a solar flare;  17 hours later a [[Solar storm of 1859|large magnetic storm]] begins.
*1892 - [[George Ellery Hale]] introduces the [[spectroheliograph]], observing the Sun in hydrogen light from the [[chromosphere]], a sensitive way of detecting flares. He confirms the connection between flares and magnetic storms.
* 1900-3 - [[Kristian Birkeland]] experiments with beams of electrons aimed at a magnetized sphere ("terrella") in a vacuum chamber. The electrons hit near the magnetic poles, leading him to propose that the [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar aurora]] is created by electron beams from the Sun. Birkeland also observes magnetic disturbances associated with the aurora, suggesting to him that localized  "polar magnetic storms" exist in the auroral zone.
* 1902 - [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] successfully sends radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. Oliver Heaviside suggests that the radio waves found their way around the curving Earth because they were reflected from electrically conducting layer at the top of the atmosphere.
* 1926 - [[Gregory Breit]] and [[Merle Tuve]] measure the distance to the conducting layer—which R. Watson-Watt proposes naming "[[ionosphere]]"—by measuring the time needed for a radio signal to bounce back.
* 1930-1 - After Birkeland's "electron beam" theory is disproved, [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and Vincent Ferraro in England propose that magnetic storms are caused when [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] clouds ejected from the Sun envelope the Earth.
* 1949 - A sudden increase in cosmic rays is traced to an eruption on the Sun. A much larger "flare event" occurs on February 23, 1956.
* 1953 - Owen Storey proves that "[[Whistler (radio)|whistler]]" radio waves are produced by lightning and are often guided through distant space along field lines of the Earth's magnetic field. 
* 1954 - [[Leslie H. Meredith|Meredith]], [[Melvin B. Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] and [[James Van Allen|Van Allen]] use a rocket in the auroral zone to detect radiation from the aurora.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Meredith, J. A. Van Allen, and M. B. Gottlieb, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v99/i1/p198_1 Cosmic-Ray Intensity above the Atmosphere at High Latitudes], Phys. Rev. 99, 198 – Published 1 July 1955&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1957 - [[Sputnik 1]] launched by the Soviet Union, the first artificial satellite.
* 1958 - [[Explorer 1]], built by [[James Van Allen|Van Allen]] and his Iowa group and launched by the US January 31, observes the radiation belt. [[Explorer 3]], launched in March, comes up with the first clear evidence for its existence.
* 1958 - [[Eugene Parker]] (Chicago) proposes the theory of the solar wind.
* 1958 - [[Pioneer 3]] observes the [[Van Allen radiation belt|outer radiation belt]].
* 1958 - [[Project Argus]], 3 small nuclear bombs above the south Atlantic Ocean, creates artificial radiation belts, lasting about 2 weeks. The project also creates artificial aurora.
* 1959 - [[Thomas Gold]] proposes the name "Magnetosphere"
* 1961 - James Dungey in Britain proposes a reconnection mechanism for transmitting solar wind energy to the magnetosphere by direct magnetic linkage between the two.
* 1961 - Ian Axford and Colin Hines (Canada) raise an alternative possibility, of energization by fluid friction at the boundary between the two.
* 1961 - The [[magnetopause]], boundary between magnetosphere and the solar wind, is observed by [[Explorer program|Explorer 12]]. The measurements confirm predictions made in 1931 by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and Ferraro.
* 1962 - In July, a U.S. H-bomb test ([[Project Starfish]]) above the central Pacific Ocean creates a radiation belt of high-energy electrons, parts of which remain until 1967. The new belt creates aurora at Samoa and unexpectedly knocks out 3 artificial satellites.
* 1964 - [[IMP-1]] (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform 1) reports a large bow shock formed in the solar wind ahead of the magnetosphere, and a long magnetic tail on the night side of the Earth.
* 1964 - [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]] (Japan-U.S.) and Sydney Chapman revive and expand Birkeland's notion of a "polar magnetic storm", now named "magnetic substorm."
* 1971 - Ionospheric O+ ions found among energetic particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field, evidence that O+ ions are pulled out of the ionosphere and accelerated 
* 1972 - Observations of the diffuse aurora are reported, made by the Canadian spacecraft Isis 2.
* 1974 - A large-scale pattern of "Birkeland currents" between space and the auroral zone traced by Alfred Zmuda and Jim Armstrong, using the Navy's "Triad" satellite.
* 1974 - David Evans presents evidence that auroral electrons are accelerated within 8000&amp;nbsp;km or so of Earth.
* 1977 - The [[S3-3]] satellite of the U.S. Air Force observes the upward acceleration of O+ ions, related to the downward acceleration of electrons in the polar aurora.
* 1981 - High resolution auroral images are obtained by the [[Dynamics Explorer]] satellite.
* 1983 - [[International Cometary Explorer|ISEE-3]] (International Sun-Earth Explorer 3) explores the distant magnetotail, observes that the distant tail plasma flows (past about 70 RE) away from Earth.
* 1985  - An "artificial comet" is produced by a cloud of barium ions, released by the German IRM ([[Ion Release Module]]) satellite. Meanwhile, another [[AMPTE]] spacecraft, CCE ([[Charge Composition Explorer]]) observes mass and energy distribution in the ring current, including its peak energies around 65 keV.

The '''Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI)''' is an independent nonprofit [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[research institute|research institution]] in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/for-visitors/directions|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a world leading mathematical center for collaborative research, drawing thousands of visiting researchers from around the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/12/06_chern.shtml|title=12.06.2004 - Renowned mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern, who revitalized the study of geometry, has died at 93 in Tianjin, China|website=www.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/our-mission|title=MSRI|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/programs/diversity/ProgramDescription_MSRI_2012v2.pdf|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgesmathart.org/mosaic/about-msri/|title= About MSRI|website=[[The Bridges Organization]] |access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/tag/msri/|title=MSRI |publisher=[[Simons Foundation]] |access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/features/foundation-news/17-gauss-way/|title=17 Gauss Way |publisher=Simons Foundation|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSRI was founded in 1982, and its funding sources include the [[National Science Foundation]], foundations, corporations, and more than 90 universities and institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/history|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/our-mission|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located at 17 Gauss Way on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus, close to [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]] (on the [[Berkeley Hills|hills]] overlooking [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History ==
The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute was founded in September 1982 by three UC Berkeley professors [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], [[Calvin C. Moore|Calvin Moore]], and [[Isadore Singer|Isadore M. Singer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/shiing-shen-chern|title=Shiing-Shen Chern|work=Institute for Advanced Study|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/isadore-m-singer-0|title=Isadore M. Singer |publisher=Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley |language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiing-Shen Chern acted as the founding Director of the institute and Calvin Moore acted as the founding Deputy Director. 

MSRI was originally located at the UC Extension Building at 2223 Fulton Street, and on April 1, 1985, MSRI moved into its current facility on Berkeley hills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially, MSRI paid rent for this new building to the [[University of California]]. However, since August 2000, it has occupied the building without the rental burden, as one of several contributions of the UC campus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Governance ==
MSRI is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of up to 35 elected members and 7 ex-officio members: the Director of the Institute, the Deputy Director, the Chair of the Committee of Academic Sponsors, the co-Chairs of the Human Resources Advisory Committee and the co-Chairs of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many mathematical institutes, MSRI has no permanent faculty or members, and its research activities are overseen by its Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), a panel of distinguished mathematicians drawn from a variety of different areas of mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 regular members in the SAC, and each member serves a four-year term and is elected by the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Research Activities==
MSRI hosts about 85 mathematicians and [[postdoctoral research fellow]]s each semester for extended stays and holds programs and workshops, which draw approximately 2,000 visits by mathematical scientists throughout the year.  The visitors come to MSRI to work in an environment that promotes creativity and the effective interchange of ideas and techniques. MSRI features two focused programs each semester, attended by foremost mathematicians and postdocs from the United States and abroad; the Institute has become a world center of activity in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/programs|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSRI takes advantage of its close proximity to the [[University of California Berkeley]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and also collaborates nationally with organizations such as the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].  The Institute’s prize-winning forty-eight thousand square foot building has views of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. After 30 years of activity, the reputation of the Institute is such that mathematicians make it a professional priority to participate in the Institute’s programs.{{fact|date=January 2018}} 

Because of its contribution to the nation’s scientific potential, MSRI’s activity is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Security Agency]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/support-msri|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private individuals, foundations, and nearly 100 Academic Sponsor Institutions, including the top mathematics departments in the United States, provide crucial support and flexibility. [[James Simons]], founder of [[Renaissance Technologies]] and a [[University of California, Berkeley]] mathematics alumnus, is a long-time supporter of MSRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/people/230|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion''' was a television signal hijacking occurring in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, on the evening of November 22, 1987, involving at least two unknown individuals. It is an example of what is known in the television business as [[broadcast signal intrusion]]. Two [[Chicago]] television stations had their broadcast signals hijacked by an unknown person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses. A homemade Max Headroom background rocked back and forth in the background.

The intruder was successful in interrupting two broadcast [[television station]]s within the course of three hours. The first incident took place for 25 seconds during the sportscast on the 9:00 PM news on [[WGN-TV]] Channel 9, and the second, two hours later, after 11:00 PM on [[PBS]] affiliate [[WTTW]] Channel 11 for about 90 seconds during a broadcast of an episode of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]''.

The second pirate broadcast, which lasted 90 seconds and pre-recorded on videotape, featured the individual parodying WGN and television in general. The hacker rambled on making reference to Headroom's endorsement of Coke, the series ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and WGN anchor [[Chuck Swirsky]], then pretended to defecate as a "masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds", a reference to WGN's call letters ("[[WGN-TV#History|World's Greatest Newspaper]]"). The video ended with the hacker’s exposed buttocks being spanked with a flyswatter by an accomplice before normal programming resumed.

The incident made national headlines&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | title = Bogus 'Max Headroom' Interrupts Broadcasts On 2 Chicago Stations | newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | publisher = Inquirer Wire Services | via = philly-archives | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160626221203/http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | archivedate = June 26, 2016 | dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people responsible have never been identified.

==Signal intrusion==
===WGN-TV===
The first occurrence of the signal intrusion took place during [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9)'s live telecast of its primetime newscast, ''The Nine O'Clock News'' (now known as ''WGN News at Nine''). During highlights from the [[Chicago Bears]]' 30–10 home victory over the [[Detroit Lions]] that afternoon in the sports report, the screen went black for 15 seconds, then returned with a person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses,&lt;ref name="interruptedtothemax"&gt;{{cite news | first = Don | last = Hayner | title = 2 channels interrupted to the Max | newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | id = CHI265386 | page = 3 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3857222.html | subscription = yes | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving around and acting in a similar manner to Max Headroom. His head was in front of a sheet of moving corrugated metal, which imitated the electronic background effect used in the Max Headroom TV and movie appearances. There was no audio other than a buzzing noise and an oscillating sound. The hijack was stopped after engineers at WGN switched the [[frequency]] of their [[Studio/transmitter link|studio link]] to the [[John Hancock Center]] transmitter.&lt;ref name=jailroom&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Camper | first1 = John | last2 = Daley | first2 = Steve | url = http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/203310798/ | url-access = subscription | title = A powerful video prankster could become Max Jailroom | department = Chicagoland | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 21 | quote = Strutzel said an engineer quickly changed the frequency of the signal that was transmitting the news show to the Hancock building, thus breaking the lock established by the video pirate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident left sports anchor Dan Roan bemused, saying, "Well, if you're wondering what's happened, so am I", and that the computer running the news "took off and went wild", then repeating his report on the Bears' victory earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKnwhokvgxE|title=WGN Channel 9 – The Nine O'Clock News – "The 1st 'Max Headroom' Incident" (1987)|date=23 November 2017|publisher=[[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|via=YouTube|type=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTTW===
[[File:Max Headroom broadcast intrusion.webm|thumb|video of the WTTW signal intrusion]]
Later that night, around 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]], during a broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'', [[PBS]] member station [[WTTW]]'s signal was hijacked by the same person, apparently, who had broadcast the [[WGN-TV]] hijack, this time with distorted and crackling audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycVTXtm0U0|title=WTTW Chicago – The Max Headroom Pirating Incident (1987) – Original Upload

The show was interrupted by television static, after which the unidentified man wearing the Max Headroom mask and sunglasses appeared, saying "That does it. He's a fricking nerd." He mentioned WGN sports pundit [[Chuck Swirsky]], whom he said he was "better than", going on to call Swirsky a "fricking [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]". The man started to moan, scream and laugh. He continued to laugh and utter various random phrases, including [[New Coke]]'s advertising slogan "Catch the Wave" while holding a [[Pepsi]] can (Max Headroom was a [[Coca-Cola]] spokesperson at the time), then tossed it out of sight, leaned towards the camera and presented [[the finger]] wearing a [[sex toy|rubber extension]] over his [[middle finger]], though the gesture was partially off-screen. The man then retrieved the Pepsi can, and sang "[[Lou Pride|Your love is fading]]", removed the rubber extension, and then began humming the theme song to ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', pausing to say "I still see the X" (often misheard as "I stole [[CBS]]"), which referred to the final episode of the series, before resuming humming again. He then began to moan painfully, exclaiming about his [[Hemorrhoid|piles]] (again, the muffled audio, or perhaps as a deliberate computer pun, makes it sound as if he is saying "files"), after which a flatulence sound was heard and he gyrated. He then stated that he had "made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds" (the WGN [[call letters]] used by the Chicago television station as well as its [[WGN (AM)|sister radio station]] are an acronym for "World's Greatest Newspaper", in reference to the flagship newspaper of their corporate parent, the [[Tribune Company]]'s ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''). He then held up a gardening [[glove]] and said, "My brother is wearing the other one." After putting the glove on, he continued, "But it's dirty! It's like you got bloodstains on it!" He then removed the glove and threw it away in disgust.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The picture suddenly cuts over to a shot of the man's lower torso. His [[buttocks]] were partly exposed, and he was holding the now-removed mask up to the camera with the rubber extension now placed in the mouth of the mask, howling, "They're coming to get me!" An unidentified accomplice wearing a [[French maid]] costume then told him to "bend over, bitch." The accomplice then started to [[spanking|spank]] the man with a [[flyswatter]] as the man screamed loudly, shouting "Oh, do it!" part way. The transmission then blacked out for a few seconds before resuming the ''Doctor Who'' episode in progress; the hijack lasted for about 90 seconds.&lt;ref name="remember"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160515162926/http://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | dead-url = no | archive-date = May 15, 2016 | title = Remember, Remember the 22nd of November | first = Alan | last = Bellows | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | date = November 22, 2016 | publication-date = January 9, 2007 | publisher = Damn Interesting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WTTW, which maintained its transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]], found that its engineers were unable to stop the hijacker due to the fact that there were no engineers on duty at the Sears Tower at the time of the hijacking. According to station spokesman Anders Yocom, technicians monitoring the transmission from WTTW headquarters "attempted to take corrective measures, but couldn't".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/306943044.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+24%2C+1987&amp;author=Carmody%2C+John&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=d.01&amp;desc=NBC+Lands+Gorbachev+Interview | first = John | last = Carmody | title = NBC Lands Gorbachev Interview | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | id = 95520 | page = D1 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes | via = [[ProQuest#Archived newspapers|ProQuest Archiver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By the time our people began looking into what was going on, it was over," he told the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref name=jailroom/&gt; WTTW was able to find copies of the hijacker's telecast with the help of ''Doctor Who'' fans who had been taping the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Reaction==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
The Max Headroom incident made national headlines and was reported on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' the next day. WTTW received numerous phone calls from viewers who wondered what had occurred for the duration of the intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = The Associated Press | title = Bogus Max Headroom pirates 2 TV stations, drops his pants | newspaper = [[The Palm Beach Post]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 3A | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigating [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] engineer quoted at the time said the perpetrators of the intrusion faced a maximum $10,000 fine, up to a year in prison, or both.&lt;ref name="jailroom" /&gt;

Not long after the incident, [[WMAQ-TV]] humorously inserted clips of the hijacking into a newscast during [[Mark Giangreco]]'s sports highlights. "A lot of people thought it was real – the pirate cutting into our broadcast. We got all kinds of calls about it," said Giangreco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ruane | first = John | title = Casting final look at '87 // Local sportscasters recall year's memorable events | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3863222.html | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = January 1, 1988 | page = 94 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes  | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[red kangaroo]].

In practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of [[Quaternary glaciation|the last ice age]], such as [[mammoth]]s, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and [[Australian megafauna|Australia]] became extinct within the last forty thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/ice_age_animals.html# Ice Age Animals]. Illinois State Museum&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly used for the largest [[extant taxon|extant]] wild land animals, especially [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, and large [[bovines]]. (Of these five categories of large herbivorous mammals, only [[bovine]]s are presently found outside of [[Africa]] and southern [[Asia]], but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging.) Megafauna may be subcategorized by their [[Trophic species|trophic]] position into megaherbivores (e.g., [[elephants]]), megacarnivores (e.g., [[lion]]s), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., [[bear]]s).

Other common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially [[whales]], any larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger [[antelope]] and [[cattle]], as well as numerous [[dinosaur]]s and other extinct giant reptilians.

The term is also sometimes applied to animals (usually [[extinction|extinct]]) of great size ''relative to'' a more common or surviving type of the animal, for example [[Meganisoptera|the {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} dragonflies]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period.

==Ecological strategy==
Megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally [[R/K selection theory|K-strategist]]s, with high longevity, slow population growth rates, low mortality rates, and (at least for the largest) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/K-selected-species. ''Britannica.'' Retrieved 2017-4-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics, although not exclusive to such megafauna, make them vulnerable to human [[overexploitation]], in part because of their slow population recovery rates.&lt;ref name="Barnosky2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Barnosky|first1=A. D.|title=Assessing the Causes of Late Pleistocene Extinctions on the Continents|journal= Science|volume= 306|issue=5693|date= 2004-10-01|pages= 70–75|doi= 10.1126/science.1101476|pmid=15459379|bibcode=2004Sci...306...70B|citeseerx=10.1.1.574.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brook2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Brook|first1=B.

==Evolution of large body size==
One observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of [[insular dwarfism]]. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

===In terrestrial mammals===

Megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg.

Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; vs. time (in Ma) occurred in [[perissodactyl]]s (a slope of 2.1), followed by [[rodent]]s (1.2) and proboscids (1.1),&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; all of which are hindgut fermenters. The rate of increase for [[artiodactyl]]s (0.74) was about a third that of perissodactyls.

Terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several [[eutheria]]n groups (the [[artiodactyl]] ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' - formerly considered a [[mesonychid]], the [[creodont]]s ''[[Megistotherium]]'' and ''[[Sarkastodon]]'', and the carnivorans ''[[Amphicyon]]'' and ''[[Arctodus]]'') all reached a maximum size of about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"/&gt; (the carnivoran ''[[Arctotherium]]'' apparently actually got somewhat larger).

Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the [[Oligocene]]) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern [[blue whale]]. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming movements]] as opposed to [[terrestrial locomotion]]. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] advantage of large body size in marine [[endotherm]]s, although diminishing returns apply.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

Cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach unprecedented size in the modern era. The largest [[carnivora]]n of all time is the mostly aquatic modern [[southern elephant seal]].

This is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous [[gastornithid]] birds evolved in the Northern Hemisphere, while flightless [[paleognath]]s evolved to large size on [[Gondwana]]n land masses and [[Europe]]. Gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in Europe, both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45&amp;nbsp;kg (in contrast with other landmasses like [[North America]] and [[Asia]], which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals) and were the largest European tetrapods in the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Buffetaut2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buffetaut|first1=E.|last2=Angst|first2=D.|title=Stratigraphic distribution of large flightless birds in the Palaeogene of Europe and its palaeobiological and palaeogeographical implications|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=138|date=November 2014|pages=394–408|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early [[Cenozoic]]. Later in the Cenozoic, however, they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out. In North America, the [[bathornithids]] ''[[Paracrax]]'' and ''[[Bathornis]]'' were apex predators but became extinct by the [[Early Miocene]]. In South America, the related [[phorusrhacid]]s shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian [[Sparassodonta|sparassodont]]s during most of the Cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]) during the [[Pliocene]]. In contrast, large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present.

However, none of the largest predatory (''[[Brontornis]]''), possibly omnivorous (''[[Dromornis]]''&lt;ref name = "Murray 2004"&gt;{{cite book

Outside the mainland of [[Afro-Eurasia]], these megafaunal extinctions followed a highly distinctive landmass-by-landmass pattern that closely parallels the spread of humans into previously uninhabited regions of the world, and which shows no overall correlation with climatic history (which can be visualized with plots over recent geological time periods of climate markers such as [[:Image:Five Myr Climate Change.png|marine oxygen isotopes]] or [[:Image:Atmospheric CO2 with glaciers cycles.gif|atmospheric carbon dioxide levels]]).&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book

An analysis of ''[[Sporormiella]]'' fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from [[Lynch's Crater]] in [[Queensland]], Australia, showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when [[climate change]]s were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name="Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional [[Holocene extinction#Ongoing Holocene extinction|megafaunal extinctions in the recent past]], and has created a [[IUCN Red List critically endangered species|serious danger of further extinctions]] in the near future (see examples below).

A number of other [[Extinction event|mass extinction]]s occurred earlier in Earth's geologic history, in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out. Famously, in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated. However, the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna; i.e., many species of other types, including plants, marine invertebrates&lt;ref name="Alroy"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Consequences of depletion of megafauna===

====Effect on nutrient transport====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name="Wolf2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C. E.|last3=Malhi|first3=Y.|authorlink3=Yadvinder Malhi|title=Lateral Diffusion of Nutrients by Mammalian Herbivores in Terrestrial Ecosystems|journal=[[PLoS ONE]]|volume= 8|issue= 8|year= 2013|pages= e71352|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0071352|pmid=23951141|pmc=3739793|bibcode=2013PLoSO...871352W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South America's [[Amazon Basin]], it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago.&lt;ref name = "Marshall_2013"&gt;{{cite web

====Effect on methane emissions====
Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

==Examples==
The following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna (in the sense of the "large animal" definition). This list is not intended to be exhaustive:

*Clade [[Synapsida]]
**Class [[Mammalia]] ([[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetically]], a [[clade]] within Therapsida; see below)
***Infraclass [[Metatheria]]
****Order [[Diprotodontia]]
*****The [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') is the largest living [[Australia]]n mammal and [[marsupial]] at a weight of up to {{convert|85|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, its extinct relative, the [[Procoptodon|giant short-faced kangaroo]] ''Procoptodon goliah'' reached {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}}, while extinct [[diprotodon]]ts attained the largest size of any marsupial in history, up to an estimated {{convert|2750|kg|abbr=on}}. The extinct [[marsupial lion]] (''Thylacleo carnifex''), at up to {{convert|160|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was much larger than any extant carnivorous marsupial.
***Infraclass [[Eutheria]]
****Superorder [[Afrotheria]]
*****Order [[Proboscidea]]
******[[Elephants]] are the largest living land animals. They and their relatives arose in [[Africa]], but until recently had a nearly worldwide distribution. The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') has a shoulder height of up to {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|10.4|tonnes|ST}}.&lt;ref name=probos_mass&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larramendi | first1 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–574 |jstor =  | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | url = https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app001362014.pdf | accessdate = 2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among recently extinct proboscideans, [[mammoth]]s (''Mammuthus'') were close relatives of elephants, while [[mastodon]]s (''Mammut'') were much more distantly related. The [[steppe mammoth]] (''M. trogontherii'') is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes, making it possibly the largest [[Proboscidea|proboscid]], which would make it the second largest land mammal after [[Indricotheriinae|indricotherines]].
*****Order [[Sirenia]]
******The largest sirenian at up to {{convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is the [[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus''). [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') was probably around five times as massive, but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote [[Commander Islands]] in 1741. In prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern [[Asia]] and northwestern [[North America]]; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters.
****Superorder [[Xenarthra]]
*****Order [[Cingulata]]
******The [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodonts]] were a group of large, heavily armored [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaur]]-like [[xenarthra]]ns related to living [[armadillos]]. They originated in [[South America]], invaded North America during the [[Great American Interchange]], and went extinct at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|epoch]].&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fariña, Richard A.|author2=Vizcaíno, Sergio F.|author3=De Iuliis, Gerry |title=Megafauna: Giant Beasts of Pleistocene South America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUAKgNfiAvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00719-3|oclc= 779244424}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*****Order [[Pilosa]]
******[[Ground sloth]]s were another group of slow, terrestrial xenarthrans, related to modern [[sloth|tree sloth]]s. They had a similar history, although they reached North America earlier, and spread farther north (e.g., ''[[Megalonyx]]''). The largest genera, ''[[Megatherium]]'' and ''[[Eremotherium]]'', reached sizes comparable to elephants.&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013" /&gt;
****Superorder [[Euarchontoglires]]
*****Order [[Primates]]
******The largest living primate, at up to {{convert|266|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is the [[gorilla]] (''[[Gorilla beringei]]'' and ''[[Gorilla gorilla]]'', with three of four subspecies being [[critically endangered]]). The extinct Malagasy [[sloth lemur]] ''[[Archaeoindris]]'' reached a similar size, while the extinct ''[[Gigantopithecus#Gigantopithecus blacki|Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' of [[Southeast Asia]] is believed to have been at least two times larger.

The extinct [[blunt-toothed giant hutia]] (''Amblyrhiza inundata'') of several [[Caribbean]] islands may have been larger still.

Retrieved 2007-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; or more in weight. The [[sperm whale]] (''Physeter macrocephalus'') is the largest [[toothed whale]], (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history) as well as the planet's loudest and [[Sperm whale#Brain|brainiest animal]] (with a [[brain]] about five times as massive as a [[human brain|human's]]). The [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca'') is the largest dolphin.
**Order [[Pelycosauria]] (traditional; [[paraphyletic]])
***''[[Cotylorhynchus]]'' was a large, big-clawed, herbivorous [[Caseidae|caseid]] of Early [[Permian]] North America, reaching {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and 2 tonnes.
**Order [[Therapsida]]
*** ''[[Anteosaurus]]'' was a [[headbutting]], semiaquatic, carnivorous [[dinocephalia]]n of Middle Permian South Africa. It reached {{convert|5|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and weighed about {{convert|500|–|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeos.org/Anteosaurus ''Anteosaurus'']. Palaeos.org (2013-04-22)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clade [[Sauropsida]]
**Class [[Aves]] (phylogenetically, a clade within [[Coelurosauria]], a [[taxon]] within the order Saurischia; see below)
***Order [[Struthioniformes]]
****The [[ratite]]s are an ancient and diverse group of [[flightless bird]]s that are found on fragments of the former [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. The largest living bird, the [[ostrich]] (''Struthio camelus'') was surpassed by the extinct ''[[Vorombe]]'' of [[Madagascar]], the heaviest of the group at up to ({{convert|860|kg|lb|abbr=on}}), and the extinct [[Dinornis|giant moa]] (''Dinornis'') of [[New Zealand]], the tallest, growing to heights of {{convert|3.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The latter two are examples of [[island gigantism]].
***Order [[Gastornithiformes]]
****Extinct [[Dromornithidae|dromornithid]]s of Australia such as ''[[Dromornis]]'' approached the largest ratites in size. (Due to its small size for a continent and its isolation, Australia is sometimes viewed as the [[Australia#Geography and climate|world's largest island]]; thus, these species could also be considered insular giants.)
***Order [[Cathartiformes]]
****The extinct [[condor]]-like [[teratorn]] ''[[Argentavis]]'' of South America had an estimated wing span of {{convert|5|to|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a mass of approximately {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it the best example of a megafaunal flying bird.
**Class [[Reptilia]] (traditional; [[paraphyletic]])
***Order [[Saurischia]]
****Saurischian [[dinosaur]]s of the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] include [[Sauropoda|sauropod]]s, the longest (at up to {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and most massive terrestrial animals known (''[[Argentinosaurus]]'' reached 80–100&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]nes, or 90–110&amp;nbsp;[[short ton|ton]]s), as well as [[Theropoda|theropod]]s, the largest terrestrial carnivores (''[[Spinosaurus]]'' grew to 7–9 tonnes; the more famous ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', to 6.8 tonnes).
***Order [[Pterosauria]]
****The largest [[azhdarchid]] [[pterosaur]]s, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'' and ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'', attained wingspans around {{cvt|11-12|m}} and weights probably in the {{cvt|70-250|kg}} range. The former is thought to have been the apex predator of its [[Hațeg Island|island ecosystem]].
***Order [[Crocodilia]]
****[[Alligators]] and [[crocodiles]] are large semiaquatic reptiles, the largest of which, the [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), can grow to a weight of {{convert|1360|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. Crocodilians' distant ancestors and their kin, the [[Pseudosuchia#Evolution|pseudosuchians]] (traditional [[crurotarsan]]s), dominated the world in the late [[Triassic]], until the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] allowed dinosaurs to overtake them. They remained diverse during the later [[Mesozoic]], when [[Crocodyliformes|crocodyliforms]] such as ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' and ''[[Sarcosuchus]]'' reached lengths of 12 m. Similarly large crocodilians, such as ''[[Mourasuchus]]'' and ''[[Purussaurus]]'', were present as recently as the [[Miocene]] in South America.
***Order [[Squamata]]
****While the largest extant [[lizard]], the [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''), another island giant, can reach {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length, its extinct Australian relative ''[[Megalania]]'' may have reached more than twice that size. These [[monitor lizard]]s' marine relatives, the [[mosasaur]]s, were [[apex predator]]s in late Cretaceous seas.
****The heaviest extant [[snake]] is considered to be the [[Eunectes murinus|green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), while the [[Python reticulatus|reticulated python]] (''Python reticulatus''), at up to 8.7 m or more, is considered the longest. An extinct Australian [[Pliocene]] species of ''[[Liasis]]'', the [[Bluff Downs giant python]], reached 10 m, while the [[Paleocene]] ''[[Titanoboa]]'' of South America reached lengths of 12–15 m and an estimated weight of about {{convert|1135|kg|lb|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}.
***Order [[Testudines]]
****The largest turtle is the [[critically endangered]] marine [[leatherback turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea''), weighing up to {{convert|900|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. It is distinguished from other [[sea turtle]]s by its lack of a [[bone|bony]] [[exoskeleton|shell]]. The most massive terrestrial chelonians are the [[giant tortoise]]s of the [[Galápagos Islands]] (''[[Chelonoidis nigra]]'') and [[Aldabra|Aldabra Atoll]] (''[[Aldabrachelys gigantea]]''), at up to {{convert|300|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}.

*Class [[Amphibia]] (in the wide, probably paraphyletic, sense)
**Order [[Temnospondyli]] (relationship to [[Lissamphibia|extant amphibians]] is unclear)
***The Permian temnospondyl ''[[Prionosuchus]]'', the largest amphibian known, reached 9 m in length and was an aquatic predator resembling a crocodilian. After the appearance of real crocodilians, temnospondyls such as ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' (5 m long) had retreated to the Antarctic region by the Cretaceous, before going extinct.
*Class [[Actinopterygii]]
**Order [[Tetraodontiformes]]
***The largest extant [[bony fish]] is the [[ocean sunfish]] (''Mola mola''), whose average adult weight is {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. While phylogenetically a "bony fish", its skeleton is primarily [[cartilage]] (which is lighter than [[bone]]). It has a disk-shaped body, and propels itself with its long, thin [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s; it feeds primarily on [[jellyfish]]. In these three respects (as well as in its size and diving habits), it resembles a leatherback turtle.
**Order [[Lampriformes]]
***The [[giant oarfish]] (''Regalecus glesne'') is the longest bony fish, reaching {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
**Order [[Acipenseriformes]]
***The [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]] (European sturgeon, ''Huso huso'') at up to {{convert|1476|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is the largest [[sturgeon]] (which are also mostly cartilaginous) and is considered the largest [[anadromous]] fish.
**Order [[Siluriformes]]
***The [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[Mekong giant catfish]] (''Pangasianodon gigas''), at up to {{convert|293|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is often viewed as the largest [[freshwater fish]].
*Class [[Chondrichthyes]]
**Order [[Lamniformes]]
***The largest living predatory fish, the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), reaches weights up to {{convert|2240|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Its extinct relative ''[[megalodon|C. megalodon]]'' (the disputed genus being either ''Carcharodon'' or ''Carcharocles'') was more than an [[order of magnitude]] larger, and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history); it preyed on whales and other [[marine mammal]]s.
**Order [[Orectolobiformes]]
***The largest extant [[shark]], [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]], and [[fish]] overall is the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''), which reaches weights in excess of {{convert|21.5|t|lb|abbr=off}}. Like baleen whales, it is a [[filter feeder]] and primarily consumes [[plankton]].
**Order [[Rajiformes]]
***The [[manta ray]]  (''Manta birostris'') is another filter feeder and the largest [[Batoidea|ray]], growing to up to 2300&amp;nbsp;kg.

The arthrodires were eliminated by the environmental upheavals of the [[Late Devonian extinction]], after existing for only about 50 million years.
*Class [[Cephalopoda]]
**Order [[Teuthida]]
***A number of deep ocean creatures exhibit [[Deep-sea gigantism|abyssal gigantism]]. These include the [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis'') and [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni''); both (although rarely seen) are believed to attain lengths of {{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} or more. The latter is the world's largest [[invertebrate]], and has the largest [[eye]]s of any animal. Both are preyed upon by sperm whales.
*Stem-group [[Arthropoda]]
**Order [[Radiodonta]]
***[[Anomalocarid]]s were a group of very early legless marine arthropods that included the largest predators of the [[Cambrian]], such as ''[[Anomalocaris]]''. By the early [[Ordovician]] they had evolved into giant (for the time) filter feeders, apparently in response to the proliferation of plankton during the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]]. ''[[Aegirocassis]]'' grew to over 2 m in length.&lt;ref name="Van_Roy2015"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anomalocaridid trunk limb homology revealed by a giant filter-feeder with paired flaps|authors=Van Roy, P.; Daley, A.

**Order [[Eurypterida]]
***Eurypterids (sea scorpions) were a diverse group of aquatic and possibly amphibious predators that included the most massive [[arthropod]]s to have existed. They survived over 200 million years, but finally died out in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] along with [[trilobite]]s and most other forms of life present at the time, including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids. The Early [[Devonian]]'' [[Jaekelopterus]]'' reached an estimated length of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, not including its [[raptorial]] [[chelicerae]], and is thought to have been a freshwater species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12533">{{About|an American analog television standard for sound multiplex|the secondary audio feed on television in general|Sound multiplex in broadcasting}}
'''Multichannel television sound''', better known as '''MTS''' (often still as '''BTSC''', for the [[Broadcast Television Systems Committee]] that created it), is the method of [[encoder|encoding]] three additional [[channel (communications)|channels]] of [[Sound|audio]] into an [[analog television|analog]] [[NTSC]]-format [[Sound|audio]] [[carrier wave|carrier]].

== History ==
Multichannel Television Sound was adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] as the [[United States|U.S.]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] [[television]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in 1984. Initial work on design and testing of a stereophonic audio system began in 1975 when Telesonics approached [[Chicago]] public television station [[WTTW]]. WTTW was producing a music show titled ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'' at that time, and was [[simulcast]]ing the stereo audio mix on local [[Frequency modulation|FM]] stations. Telesonics and WTTW formed a working relationship and began developing the system which was similar to FM stereo modulation.  Twelve WTTW studio and transmitter engineers added the needed broadcast experience to the relationship.  The Telesonics system was tested and refined using the WTTW transmitter facilities on the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]]. In 1979, WTTW had installed a stereo [[Thomson Grass Valley|Grass Valley]] master control switcher, and had added a second audio channel to the [[Microwave radio relay|microwave]] STL (Studio Transmitter Link). By that time, WTTW engineers had further developed stereo audio on [[videotape recorder]]s in their plant, using split audio track heads manufactured to their specifications, outboard record electronics, and [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby noise reduction]] that allowed ''Soundstage'' to be recorded and electronically edited. In addition, an [[Ampex]] MM1100, 24-track audio recorder was also used for music production and mixing. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member stations who wished to deliver ''Soundstage'' in stereo were provided with a four-track (left, right, vertical drive, and [[time code]]) audio tape that could be synced with the video machines in those cities.

During the FCC approval process, several manufacturers applied to the FCC for consideration.  Most notably the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA) and Japanese EIA asked to be included in order to represent their members in the testing and specification phases of the approval process. WTTW engineers helped set standards for [[frequency response]], separation, and other uses of the spectrum. They also provided program source material used for the testing and maintained the broadcast chain. A [[3M]] 24-track audio recorder was used to allow the selection of 12 different stereo programs for testing. The [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] Quasar TV manufacturing plant and laboratory, just west of Chicago, was used as the source for all testing of the competing systems. Following the testing, several questions were raised about the validity of some of the tests, and a second round of testing began.

WTTW installed a Broadcast Electronics prototype stereo modulator in October 1983, and began full-time broadcasting in stereo at that time using the Telesonics system prior to FCC rule-making on the BTSC system. Following EIA and FCC recommendations, the BE modulator was modified to meet BTSC specifications, and by August 1984 was in full-time use on WTTW.

Sporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', although at the time only the network's New York City flagship station, [[WNBC]], had stereo broadcast capability;&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Kaplan, "TV Notes", ''New York Times'', July 28, 1984, sec. 1, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; regular stereo transmission of NBC programs began during early 1985. ABC and CBS followed suit in 1986 and 1987, respectively. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] was the last network to join around 1990, with the four networks having their entire prime-time schedules in stereo by late 1994 ([[The WB]] and [[UPN]] launched the following season with their entire line-ups in stereo). One of the first television receiving systems to include BTSC capability was the [[RCA Dimensia]], released in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/fkc2600-1.html RCA Dimensia FKC2600E and FKC2601T Monitors]. Cedmagic.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s and also in the 2000s, the networks would display the disclaimer "In stereo (where available)" at the beginning of stereo programming.

== Adopted in ==
It has also been adopted by
* [[United States]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Canada]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Mexico]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Chile]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Brazil]] for [[PAL-M]]
* [[Taiwan]] for [[NTSC]] (historic, switched to DVB-T)
* [[Argentina]] for PAL-N
* [[Philippines]] for [[NTSC]]

== How MTS works ==
The first channel is the stereo ''difference'' (left minus right), used to add [[stereophonic]] sound to the existing [[Monaural|monophonic]] (the left plus right stereo ''sum'') audio track.

In other words, the normal mono television audio consists of L+R information. A second signal (MTS) rides on top of this mono carrier wave. This MTS signal consists of L ''minus'' R.
* When the two audio channels are added together, or summed (L+R plus L-R), the left channel is derived.
* When the second audio channel is subtracted from the first by a phase reversal (L+R minus L-R), the right channel is derived.

== MTS real world performance ==
* In ideal circumstances MTS Stereo is about 1.5 db better in performance than standard VHF FM stereo.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Usually with MTS, as with VHF FM stereo, a certain amount of crosstalk is encountered, limiting stereo separation.

The stereo information is [[DBX (noise reduction)|dbx]]-[[Code|encode]]d to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (at low levels), to aid in [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]].

Typical S/N (signal to noise) is better than -50 dB.

The original specifications called for a brick wall elliptical filter in each of the audio channels prior to encoding.  The cutoff frequency of this filter was 15 kHz to prevent any horizontal sync crosstalk from being encoded.  Manufacturers of modulators, however, used lower cutoff frequencies as they saw fit.  Typically, they chose 14 kHz although some used filters as low as 12.5 kHz.  The elliptical filter was chosen for having the greatest bandwidth with the lowest phase distortion at the cutoff frequency.  The filter used during EIA testing had a characteristic that was -60dB at 15.5kHz.  As transformer audio coupling was common at that time, the lower frequency limit was set to 50 Hz although modulators without transformer inputs were flat down to at least 20Hz.

Typical separation was better than 35 dB.  However, level matching was essential to achieve this specification.  Left and Right audio levels needed to be matched within less than 0.1 dB to achieve the separation stated.

Maintaining the phase stability of the horizontal sync is essential to good audio in the decode process.  During transmission, the phase of the horizontal sync could vary with picture and chroma levels.  ICPM (Incidental Carrier Phase Modulation), a measure of transmitted phase stability, needs to be less than 4.5% for best audio sub channel decoding.  This was more of a problem with UHF transmitters of the day.  Multi-cavity klystron amplifiers of that time typically had an ICPM above 7%.

== MTS licensing ==
Because of the use of dbx [[companding]], every TV device that decoded MTS originally required the payment of [[royalties]], first to [[dbx, Inc.]], then to [[THAT Corporation]] which was spun off from dbx in 1989 and acquired its MTS patents in 1994; however, those patents expired worldwide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxtv-time.html dbx-TV Timeline (THAT Corporation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009222002/http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxtv-time.html |date=2008-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though THAT now owns some patents related to digital implementations of MTS, a letter from THAT to the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] in 2007 confirms that no license is required from THAT for all analog and some digital implementations of MTS.&lt;ref name="THAT-NTIA_Letter"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071029182109/http://www.thatcorp.com/NTIA-letter-2.html Letter to NTIA, August 21, 2007 (THAT Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How MTS audio channels are used ==
The [[second audio program]] (SAP) also is part of the standard, providing another [[language]], a [[video description]] service like [[Descriptive Video Service|DVS]], or a completely separate service like a [[campus radio]] station or [[weatheradio]].  This sub-carrier is at 5x horizontal sync and is also dBx encoded.

A third PRO (professional) channel is provided for internal use by the station, and may handle audio or data. The PRO channel is normally used with [[electronic news gathering]] during [[news]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s to talk to the remote location (such as a [[reporter]] on-location), which can then talk back through the [[remote pickup unit|remote link]] to the [[TV station]]. Specialized [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] for the PRO channel are generally only sold to broadcast professionals. This sub-carrier is at 6.5x horizontal sync.

MTS signals are indicated to the television receiver by adding a 15.734&amp;nbsp;kHz [[pilot tone]] to the signal.
The MTS pilot is locked or derived from the horizontal sync signal used to lock the video display.  Variations in phase or frequency of the horizontal sync are therefore transferred to the audio.  UHF transmitters in use in 1984 generally had significant phase errors introduced in this signal making the transmission of stereo audio on UHF stations of that time nearly impossible.  Later refinements in UHF transmitters minimized these effects and allowed stereo transmission for those stations.

Most FM broadcast receivers are capable of receiving the audio portion of NTSC Channel 6 at 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz, but only in [[monaural]]. Because the pilot tone frequency at 15.734&amp;nbsp;kHz is different from that of the ordinary FM band (19&amp;nbsp;kHz), such radios cannot decode MTS.

== MTS and the DTV transition in the United States ==
As a component of the NTSC standard, MTS is no longer being used in U.S. full-power television broadcasting after the June 12, 2009 [[DTV transition in the United States]]. It remains in use in [[LPTV]] and in analogue [[cable television]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} All [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es (CECBs) are required to output [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] via [[RCA connector]]s, but MTS is merely optional for the [[RF modulator]] that every CECB contains. NTIA has stated that MTS was made optional for cost reasons;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/datashts/Kneuer_letter_8-2-07.pdf NTIA Letter to THAT Corporation, August 2, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720084528/http://www.thatcorp.com/datashts/Kneuer_letter_8-2-07.pdf |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this may have been due to a belief that MTS still required royalty payments to THAT Corporation, which is no longer true except for some digital implementations.&lt;ref name="THAT-NTIA_Letter" /&gt;

THAT has created consumer pages on the DTV transition and how it affects MTS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html dbx-TV and the Digital TV Transition (THAT Corporation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015130126/http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html |date=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site describes the situation by stating that most consumers with CECBs will end up with [[monaural]] TV sound, since RF-only connections are common and MTS is optional (and rare) for CECBs.

The '''Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography''' ({{lang-ru|'''Полярный научно-исследовательский институт морского рыбного хозяйства и океанографии имени Н. М. Книповича'''}}), its acronym being '''PINRO''' ({{lang-ru|'''ПИНРО'''}}), is one of several research institutes of [[Russian Federation|Russia]] subordinate to the [[Russian Federal Agency for Fisheries]] (Rosrybolovstvo). It is based in [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=The data are in the hands of the Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography, known as PINRO.  PINRO, based in Murmansk, has been collaborating with Norwegian researchers for years. |title=Soviet Cold War oceanographic surveys opened up to western scientists |first=Asle |last=Rønning |date=May 23, 2013 |translator-first=Glenn |translator-last=Ostling |url=http://sciencenordic.com/soviet-cold-war-oceanographic-surveys-opened-western-scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was created on March 10, 1921 as the Floating Marine Research Institute (Plavmornin). It was preceded (though not directly) by the Imperial Russian organization Murman Scientific Fisheries Expedition, which existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and conducted early research with the vessel ''[[Saint Andrew (ship)|Saint Andrew]]''.

Between 1929 and 1933, the Institute was named State Oceanographic Institute of the USSR (SOI). Since 1935, it has borne the name of fisheries science pioneer [[Nikolai Knipovich]].

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II]] (called, in Russia, the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]) the Institute was evacuated to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The Institute's main expedition ship ''[[Perseus (Soviet ship)|Perseus]]'', which had been with the Institute since its early days and undertaken close to 100 expeditions, was sunk by German air raiders in the early days of the war. The ''Perseus''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s flag, showing a stylized representation of the [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus constellation]], remains the Institute's symbol to this day.

Since then, the institute has operated several research vessels, including large purpose-built research ships, and [[submersible]]s.

==Activities==
The main task of the team of scientists of the institute is conducting annual studies to help determine the total allowable catch of commercial fish species, invertebrates, algae and marine mammals. The main focus is on [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[capelin]], [[herring]], [[Greenland halibut]], the Barents Sea population of the [[Kamchatka crab]], and [[salmon]]. The Institute's area of responsibility includes the northern waters near European Russia – the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Kara Sea]], the [[White Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[Greenland Sea]] and the Northwest [[Atlantic Ocean]] – as well as freshwater lakes in the [[Murmansk region|Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangelsk]] Regions, the [[Komi Republic]], and the [[Nenets Autonomous District]].

There is a Northern Branch of PINRO, headquartered in [[Arkhangelsk]].

{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong'."&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900–1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page=186 |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also often quoted as "That is not only not right; it is not even wrong", or in Pauli's native [[German language|German]], "{{lang|de|Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!}}". Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">In [[engineering]], a nutating motion is similar to that seen in a [[swashplate]] mechanism. In general, a nutating plate is carried on a skewed bearing on the main shaft and does not itself rotate, whereas a swashplate is fixed to the shaft and rotates with it.  The motion is similar to the motions of coin or a tire wobbling on the ground after being dropped with the flat side down. ''[[Precession]]'' is the physical term for this kind of motion.

Nutating mixers are used in gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological scientific procedures by repetitively moving the vessels holding the liquids.  &lt;ref&gt;Trivedi. [http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/9/942/htm Open Source 3-D Printed Nutating Mixer]. ''Applied Sciences'',  2017, 7(9), 942; doi:10.3390/app7090942 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The nutating motion is widely employed in [[flow measurement|flowmeters]] and [[pump]]s.  The displacement of volume for one revolution is first determined.  The speed of the device in revolutions per unit time is measured.  In the case of flowmeters, the product of the rotational speed and the displacement per revolution is then taken to find the flow rate.

A [[nutating disc engine]] was patented in 1993 and a prototype was reported in 2006. The engine consisted of an internal disk wobbling on a Z-shaped shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peter L.

[[File:Rossi lhf safdao Y1.jpg|thumb|Input images of the omniview system]]
[[File:Rossi lhf safdao Z1.jpg|thumb|A common output interface of the omniview system]]
'''Omniview technology''' (also known as "surround view" or "bird view technology") is a [[Intelligent Parking Assist System|vehicle parking assistant]] technology that first became available in vehicle electronic products in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/17/infinitis-ex35-around-view-monitor-system-makes-windows-redunda/&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to help drivers in parking a vehicle in small space.

== Principle==
Early vehicle parking assistant products use proximity sensors or a single [[Backup camera|rear-view camera]] to get information about obstacles around, and provide drivers with sound alarm or rear-view video. There are some drawbacks about such products: the alarm is not intuitive, and the rear-view camera has blind area. However, omniview technology overcomes these problems and has seen increasing applications.

In a common omniview system, there are four wide-field cameras: one in the front of the vehicle, one in the back of the vehicle, one in the left rear view mirror, and one in the right outside mirror. The four cameras cover the whole area around vehicle. The system synthesizes a [[bird view]] image in front of the vehicle by distortion correction, projection transformation, and [[image fusion]]. The images shown below are input and output of a common omniview product.

[[Image:PeloidsCarboniferousNV.jpg|thumb|Pellets and a [[brachiopod]] shell visible in a [[limestone]] thin-section; Bird Spring Formation ([[Carboniferous]]) of southern Nevada.]]

'''Pellets''' are small spherical to ovoid or rod-shaped grains that are common component of many [[limestone]]s. They are typically 0.03 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm long and composed of carbonate [[mud]] ([[micrite]]). Their most common size is 0.04 to 0.08&amp;nbsp;mm. Pellets typically lack any internal structure and are remarkably uniform in size and shape in any single limestone sample. They consist either of aggregated carbonate mud, precipitated [[calcium carbonate]], or a mixture of both. They either are or were composed either of [[aragonite]], [[calcite]], or a mixture of both. Also, pellets composed of either [[glauconite]] or [[phosphorite]] are common in marine sedimentary rocks. Pellets occur in [[Precambrian]] through [[Phanerozoic]] strata. They are an important component mainly in Phanerozoic strata. The consensus among sedimentologists and petrographers is that pellets are the fecal products of [[invertebrate]] organisms because of their constant size, shape, and extra-high content of organic matter.&lt;ref name="Folk1959a"&gt;Folk, R.L. (1959) ''Practical petrographic classification of limestones.'' American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin. 43, pp. 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folk(1962a)"&gt;Folk, R.L., 1962, ''Spectral subdivision of limestone types. ''. In Ham, W. E.. Classification of carbonate rocks. American Association of Petroleum Geologists Memoir. no. 1, pp. 62-84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" ScholleOther2003a"&gt;Scholle, P.A., and D.S. Ulmer-Scholle (2003) ''A Color Guide to the Petrography of Carbonate Rocks: Grains, textures, porosity, diagenesis. '' American Association of Petroleum Geologists Memoir no. 77. Tulsa, Oklahoma, American Association of Petroleum Geologists. 474 pp. {{ISBN|0-89181-358-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellets differ from [[oolite]]s and [[intraclasts]], which are also found in limestones. They differ from oolites in that pellets lack the radial or concentric structures that characterize oolites. They differ from intraclasts in that pellets lack the complex internal structure, which is typical of intraclasts. In addition, pellets, quite unlike intraclasts, are characterized by a remarkable uniformity of shape, extremely good sorting, and small size.&lt;ref name="Folk1959a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folk(1962a)"/&gt;

By definition, pellets differ from [[peloid]]s, in that pellets have a specific size, shape, and implied origin—while peloids vary widely in size, shape, and origin. Pellets, in the strict sense, are fecal products of invertebrate organisms. Peloids are allochems of any size, structure, or origin. As a result, peloids not only include possible pellets, but also include a variety of other distinctly non-pellet grains—such as indistinct intraclasts, micritized ooids, or fossil fragments. In addition, some peloids are even microbial or inorganic precipitates. Carbonate geologists consider the vast majority of peloids as secondary allochems created by biological degradation or “micritization” of other primary carbonate grains, i.e., ooids, bioclasts, or pellets.&lt;ref name=" ScholleOther2003a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1420">The '''pluriblast''' is a [[Pluripotency|pluripotent]] population of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[embryogenesis]] of [[marsupial]]s, called the [[inner cell mass]] in [[eutherian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheng | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Epiblast morphogenesis before gastrulation | url = | journal = Dev.

Both the pluriblast and trophoblast arise from the [[Totipotency|totipotent]] cells of the early [[conceptus]].  By definition, the pluriblast does not give rise to trophoblast cells during normal development, although it may retain this potential under experimental conditions.

In [[metatherian]]s ([[marsupial]])s the pluriblast forms part of the blastocyst wall and no structure exists that can be described as an inner cell mass.  "Inner cell mass" is thus a morphological term peculiar to eutherian mammals, whereas "pluriblast" is a functional term more widely applicable to conserved aspects of mammalian development.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24222">'''Political economy of climate change''' is an approach that applies the [[political economy]] thinking of collective or political processes to study the critical issues surrounding the decision-making on climate change.

As the issue of [[climate change]] reaching the top of international agenda, the complexity of the [[environmental problems]] in combination with various other social political challenges have put great pressures on the scholars to explore a better understanding of the multiple actors and influencing factors that affect the climate change negotiation and to seek more effective solutions to [[Climate change mitigation|tackle climate change]]. Analyzing these issues from a political economy perspective helps to explain the complex interactions between different stakeholders in respond to climate change impacts and provides broader opportunities to achieve better implementation of [[Climate change policy|climate change policies]].

Climate Change is first and foremost a political issue now that it has become a widely believed fact. Before tackling the issue, it is important to determine how drastic the effects can be in order to address it in an appropriate manner. When dealing with climate change, the inhabitants of countries must see themselves as “global citizens” rather than separate entities if any real long-term progress is to be made. In accordance with a global perspective, countries balance legislation regarding climate change in a way that benefits developing nations while refraining from discouraging developed nations from contributing to the effort. 

== Introduction ==
=== Background ===
Climate change and [[global warming]] have become one of the most pressing [[environmental concerns]] and the greatest global challenges in society today, despite the fact that a consensus has never been reached in the debates over its causes and consequences. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of [[Climate change adaptation|mitigating]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapting]] to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods. However, Cammack (2007)&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Cammack, D. (2007) ''Understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it'', Prepared by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] for UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level. Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions. In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that “understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it”.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change and the resulting inequity and unfairness on the poor who contribute least to the problem have linked the issue of climate change with development study,&lt;ref&gt;Adger, W.N., Paavola, Y., Huq, S. and Mace, M.J. (2006) ''Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tol | first1 = R.S.J. | last2 = Downing | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Kuik | first3 = O.J. | last4 = Smith | first4 = J.B. | year = 2004 | title = Distributional Aspects of Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = [[Global Environmental Change]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 259–72 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has given rise to various programmes and policies that aim at addressing climate change and promoting development.&lt;ref&gt;IEA, UNDP and UNIDO (2010) Energy Poverty: ''How to Make Modern Energy Access Universal?,'' special early excerpt of the [[World Energy Outlook]] 2010 for the UN General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, Paris: OECD/IEA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabuurs, G.J., Masera, O., Andrasko, K., Benitez-Ponce, P., Boer, R., Dutschke, M., Elsiddig, E., Ford-Robertson, J., Frumhoff, P., Karjalainen, T., Krankina, O., Kurz, W.A., Matsumoto, M., Oyhantcabal, W., Ravindranath, N.H., Sanz Sanchez, M.J. and Zhang, X. (2007) ‘Forestry’, in: ''Mitigation of Climate Change'', Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Although great efforts have been made on international negotiations concerning the issue of climate change, it is argued that much of the theory, debate, evidence-gathering and implementation linking climate change and development assume a largely apolitical and linear policy process.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;6.	Tanner, T. and Allouche, J. (2011) 'Towards a New Political Economy of Climate Change and Development', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Tanner and Allouche (2011) suggest that [[List of climate change initiatives|climate change initiatives]] must explicitly recognise the political economy of their inputs, processes and outcomes so as to find a balance between effectiveness, efficiency and equity.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

=== Definition ===
In its earliest manifestations, the term “political economy” was basically a [[synonym]] of [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Groenewegen, E.(1987) 'Political economy and economics', in: Eatwell J. et al., eds., ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', Vol.3: 904-907, Macmillan &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; while it is now a rather elusive term that typically refers to the study of the collective or political processes through which public economic decisions are made.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Oates, W.E.and Portney, P.R.(2003) 'The political economy of environmental policy', in: ''Handbook of Environmental Economics'', chapter 08: p325-54&lt;/ref&gt; In the climate change domain, Tanner and Allouche (2011) define the political economy as “the processes by which ideas, power and resources are conceptualised, negotiated and implemented by different groups at different scales”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; While there have emerged a substantial literature on the political economy of [[environmental policy]], which explains the “political failure” of the environmental programmes to efficiently and effectively protect the environment,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; systematic analysis on the specific issue of climate change using the political economy framework is relatively limited.

== Current Context: The Urgent Need for Political Economy ==

=== Characteristics of Climate Change ===
The urgent need to consider and understand the political economy of climate change is based on the specific characteristics of the problem.

The key issues include:
* '''The cross-sectoral nature of climate change''': The issue of climate change usually fits into various sectors, which means that the integration of climate change policies into other policy areas is frequently called for.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2009) ''Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation'', Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this has resulted in the highly complexity of the issue, as the problem needs to be addressed from multiple scales with diverse actors involved in the complex [[governance]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = B.G. | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | url = | journal = [[Governance (journal)|Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 423–44 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of these facets leads to the political processes with multiple and overlapping conceptualisation, negotiation and governance issues, which requires the understanding of political economy processes.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The problematic perception of climate change as simply a “global” issue''': Climate change initiatives and governance approaches have tended to be driven from the global scale. While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of [[climate change and poverty]] could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The growth of climate change finance''': Recent years have witnessed a growing number of financial flows and development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena. The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico has committed significant amount of money from [[developed countries]] to developing world in supportive of the adaptation and mitigation technologies. In short terms, the fast start finance will be transferred through variety channels including bilateral and multilateral official development assistance, the [[Global Environment Facility]] and the [[UNFCCC]].&lt;ref&gt;Harmeling, S. and Kaloga, A. (2011)'Understanding the Political Economy of the Adaptation Fund', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 23-32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, a growing number of public funds have provided greater incentives to tackle climate change in developing countries. For instance, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience aims at creating an integrated and scaled-up approach of climate change adaptation in some low-income countries and preparing for future finance flows. In addition, climate change finance in developing countries could potentially change the traditional aid mechanisms, through the differential interpretations of [[Kyoto Protocol|‘common but differentiated responsibilities’]] by developing and developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okereke | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Equity Norms in Global Environmental Governance | url = | journal = Global Environmental Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 25–50 | doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of equity and [[climate justice]], climate change resource flows are increasingly called on developed world according to the culpability for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah, A., Muyungi, R., Jallow, B., Reazuddin, M. and Konate, M. (2009) ''National Adaptation Funding: Ways Forward for the Poorest Countries'', IIED Briefing Paper, International Institute for Environment and Development, London.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is inevitable to change the governance structures so as for developing countries to break the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Within these contexts, the understanding of the political economy processes of financial flows in climate change arena would be crucial to effectively governing the resource transfer and to tackling the climate change.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Different [[ideological]] worldviews of responding to climate change''': Nowadays, because of the perception of science as a dominant policy driver, much of the policy prescription and action in climate change arena have concentrated on assumptions around standardised governance and planning systems, linear policy processes, readily transferable technology, economic rationality, and the ability of science and technology to overcome resource gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, M., Scoones, I. and Stirling, A. (2010), ''Dynamic Sustainabilities–Technology, Environment, Social Justice'', London: [[Earthscan]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there tends to be a bias towards technology-led and managerial approaches to address climate change in apolitical terms. Besides, a wide range of different ideological worldviews would lead to a high divergence of the perception of climate change solutions, which also has a great influence on decisions made in response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carvalho | first1 = A | year = 2007 | title = Ideological Cultures and Media Discourses on Scientific Knowledge: Re-reading News on Climate Chang | url = | journal = [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 223–43 | doi=10.1177/0963662506066775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring these issues from a political economy perspective provides the opportunity to better understand the “complexity of politic and decision-making processes in tackling climate change, the power relations mediating competing claims over resources, and the contextual conditions for enabling the adoption of technology”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Unintended negative consequences of adaptation policies that fail to factor in environmental-economic trade-offs''': Successful adaptation to climate change requires balancing competing economic, social, and political interests. In the absence of such balancing, harmful unintended consequences can undo the benefits of adaptation initiatives. For example, efforts to protect coral reefs in Tanzania forced local villagers to shift from traditional fishing activities to farming that produced higher greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Editorial|title=Adaptation trade-offs|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=November 2015|volume=5|page=957|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n11/pdf/nclimate2853.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2016|doi=10.1038/nclimate2853}} See also Sovacool, B. and Linnér, B.-O. (2016), ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Adaptation,'' Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-political Constraints ===
The role of political economy in understanding and tackling climate change is also founded upon the key issues surrounding the domestic socio-political constraints:&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

* '''The problems of''' '''[[fragile state]]s''': Fragile states—defined as poor performers, conflict and/or post-conflict states—are usually incapable of using the aid for climate change effectively. The issues of power and social equity have exacerbated the climate change impacts, while insufficient attention has been paid to the dysfunction of fragile states. Considering the problems of fragile states, the political economy approach could improve the understanding of the long-standing constraints upon capacity and resilience, through which the problems associated with weak capacity, state-building and conflicts could be better addressed in the context of climate change.
* ''' Informal governance:''' In many poorly performing states, [[decision-making]] around the distribution and use of state resources is driven by informal relations and private incentives rather than formal state institutions that are based on equity and law. This informal governance nature that underlies in the domestic social structures prevents the political systems and structures from rational functioning and thus hinders the effective response towards climate change. Therefore, domestic institutions and incentives are critical to the adoption of reforms. Political economy analysis provides an insight into the underlying social structures and systems that determine the effectiveness of climate change initiatives (1).
* '''The difficulty of social change:''' Developmental change underdeveloped countries is painfully slow because of a series of long-tem collective problems, including the societies’ incapacity of working collectively to improve wellbeing, the lack of technical and social ingenuity, the resistance and rejection to innovation and change. In the context of climate change, these problems significantly hinder the promotion of climate change agenda. Taking a political economy view at the underdeveloped countries could help to understand and create incentives to promote transformation and development, which lays a foundation for the expectation of implementing a climate change adaptation agenda.

== Research focuses and approaches ==

Brandt and Svendsen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, U.S. and  Svendsen, G.T. (2003) ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Policy in the EU: Auction and Grandfathering'', IME Working Papers No. 51/03.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce a political economy framework that based on the political support function model by Hillman (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillman | first1 = A.L. | year = 1982 | title = Declining industries and political-support protec-tionist motives | url = | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1180–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into the analysis of the choice of instruments to control climate change in the [[European Union]] policy to implement its [[Kyoto Protocol]] target level. In this political economy framework, the climate change policy is determined by the relative strength of stakeholder groups. By examining the different objective of different interest groups, namely industry groups, consumer groups and environmental groups, the authors explain the complex interaction between the choices of instrument for the EU climate change policy, specifically the shift from the green taxation to a grandfathered permit system.

A report by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) (2011) takes a political economy approach to explain why some countries adopt climate change policies while others do not, specifically among the countries in the transition region.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD (2011) 'Political economy of climate change policy in the transition region', in: ''Special Report on Climate Change: The Low Carbon Transition, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development'', Chapter Four.&lt;/ref&gt; This work analyzes the different political economy aspects of the characteristics of climate change policies so as to understand the likely factors driving climate change mitigation outcomes in many [[Transition country#Countries in transition|transition countries]]. The main conclusions are listed below:
* The level of [[democracy]] alone is not a major driver of climate change policy adoption, which means that the expectations of contribution to global climate change mitigation are not necessarily limited by the political regime of a given country.
* Public knowledge, shaped by various factors including the threat of climate change in a particular country, the national level of education and existence of free media, is a critical element in climate change policy adoption, as countries with the public more aware of the climate change causes are significantly more likely to adopt climate change policies. The focus should therefore be on promoting public awareness of the urgent threat of climate change and prevent [[information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] in many transition countries.
* The relative strength of the carbon-intensive industry is a major deterrent to the adoption of climate change policies, as it partly accounts for the information asymmetries. However, the carbon-intensive industries often influence government’s decision-making on climate change policy, which thus calls for a change of the incentives perceived by these industries and a transition of them to a low-carbon production pattern. Efficient means include the energy price reform and the introduction of international [[Emissions trading|carbon trading]] mechanisms.
* The competitive edge gained national economies in the transition region in a global economy, where increasing international pressure is put to reduce emissions, would enhance their political regime’s domestic legitimacy, which could help to address the inherent economic weaknesses underlying the lack of economic diversification and global economic crisis.

Tanner and Allouche (2011)&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; propose a new conceptual and methodological framework for analysing the political economy of climate change in their latest work, which focuses on the climate change policy processes and outcomes in terms of ideas, power and resources. The new political economy approach is expected to go beyond the dominant political economy tools formulated by international development agencies to analyse climate change initiatives&lt;ref&gt;DFID (2009) ''Political Economy Analysis: How to Note'', DFID Practice Paper, [[Department for International Development]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2009) ''Problem-Driven Governance and Political Economy Analysis: Good Practice Framework'', [[World Bank]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2004) ''Operationalizing Political Analysis: The Expected Utility Stakeholder Model and Governance Reforms'', PREM Notes 95, World Bank, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; that have ignored the way that ideas and ideologies determine the policy outcomes (see [[#table-comparison|table]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, M.N. and Finnemore, M. (2004) ''Rules for the World: International Organizations in Global Politics'', [[Cornell University Press]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assume that each of the three lenses, namely ideas, power and resources, tends to be predominant at one stage of the policy process of the political economy of climate change, with “ideas and ideologies predominant in the conceptualisation phase, power in the negotiation phase and resource, institutional capacity and governance in the implementation phase”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; It is argued that These elements are critical in the formulation of international climate change initiatives and their translation to national and sub-national policy context.

'''RX J0806.3+1527''' or '''HM Cancri''' (sometimes shortened to ''HM Cnc'' or ''J0806'' after establishing identity) is an [[X-ray binary]] star system about {{convert|1600|ly|pc+km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises two dense [[white dwarf]]s orbiting each other once every 321.5&amp;nbsp;seconds (in this system the "year" duration is of only 5.4 minutes), at an estimated distance of only {{convert|80000|km|miles}} apart (about 1/5 the distance between the Earth and the Moon). The two stars orbit each other at speeds in excess of {{convert|400|km/s|mph}}. The stars are estimated to be about half as massive as the [[Sun]]. Like typical white dwarfs, they are extremely dense, being composed of degenerate matter, and so have radii of order the radius of Earth. Astronomers believe that the two stars will eventually merge, based on data from many X-ray satellites, such as  [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]], [[XMM-Newton]] and the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]]. These data show that the orbital period of the two stars is steadily decreasing at a rate of 1.2&amp;nbsp;milliseconds per year as they thus are getting closer by approximately {{convert|60|cm|ft}} per day. At this rate, they can be expected to merge in approximately 340,000 years. With a revolution period of  5.4 minutes RX J0806 is the '''shortest orbital period binary system''' currently known.

==Observations==
As RX J0806.3+1527 is a pair of white dwarfs, it has a relatively low optical luminosity. Scientists discovered periodic spikes occurring every 321.5&amp;nbsp;s by looking at the source in the [[X-rays]]. In fact, the 321.5&amp;nbsp;s modulation of RX J0806.3+1527 was discovered serendipitously in 1999 thanks to the [[ROSAT]] mission  working in the X-ray band. Optical follow-up observations with the [[ESO]]  [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT), [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] (TNG) and [[Nordic Optical Telescope]] (NOT) allowed the counterpart to be identified, a relatively dim (20.7 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] in the B filter) object which shows an optical modulation at the same period detected in the X-ray band. The optical monitoring of the counterpart of RX J0806.3+1527 during 2001-2004 clearly shows that the period is decreasing at a rate of about 1/1000&amp;nbsp;s each year. This result was confirmed by monitoring the source in the X-rays for several years.

==Relation to general relativity==
The decreasing separation of the components of the system mean that the system is losing orbital energy.  [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[General Relativity]] predicts such a system will lose orbital energy through the generation of [[gravitational waves]]. Scientists believe that RX J0806.3+1527 may be one of the strongest sources of gravitational waves in the Milky Way galaxy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''Reaction bonded silicon carbide''', also known as '''siliconized silicon carbide''' or '''SiSiC''', is a type of [[silicon carbide]] that is manufactured by a [[chemical reaction]] between [[porous]] [[carbon]] or [[graphite]] with molten [[silicon]]. Due to the left over traces of silicon, reaction bonded silicon carbide is often referred to as siliconized silicon carbide, or its abbreviation SiSiC.

If pure silicon carbide is produced by [[sintering]] of silicon carbide powder, it usually contains traces of chemicals called ''sintering aids'', which are added to support the sintering process by allowing lower sintering temperatures. This type of silicon carbide is often referred to as ''sintered silicon carbide'', or abbreviated to SSiC.

The silicon carbide powder is gained from silicon carbide produced as described in the article [[silicon carbide]].

'''''Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]] that discusses the life and sculptures of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sensibility-Objectified-Scluptures-Sarbari-Choudhury/dp/1890206032|title=Sensibility Objectified: The Scupltures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury|first=Siva R.|last=Kumar|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Gp Pty Ltd|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[R. Siva kumar]] the 'sculptural sensibility' of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]], represented in his figurative and animated works, reveals the artist’s connection with the Indian traditions of sculpture, despite being strongly influenced by the West.

Some of Roy's best works are of classical musicians—[[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]] and [[Kesarbai Kerkar]]. Starting from the 1950s, the monograph traces his work of each decade, revealing the artistic journey of one of India’s leading sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinpub.in/bookinfo.php?id=189#visit|title=Sensibility Objectified|website=mapinpub.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''septum transversum''' is a thick mass of cranial [[mesenchyme]], formed in the [[embryo]], that gives rise to parts of the [[thoracic diaphragm]] and the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut in the developed human being.

== Origins ==
The septum transversum originally arises as the most cranial part of the [[mesenchyme]] on day 22. During craniocaudal folding it assumes a position caudal to the developing heart at the level of the cervical vertebrae. During subsequent weeks the dorsal end of the embryo grows much faster than its ventral counterpart resulting in an ''apparent descent'' of the ventrally located septum transversum. At week 8 it can be found at the level of the thoracic vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;Persaud, T.V.N; Moore, K.L.: ''The Developing Human: Clinically oriented embryology''; Saunders, 7th ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nerve supply==
After successful craniocaudal folding the septum transversum picks up innervation from the adjacent [[ventral rami]] of spinal nerves C3, C4 and C5, thus forming the precursor of the [[phrenic nerve]]. During the descent of the septum, the [[phrenic nerve]] is carried along and assumes its descending pathway.

During embryonic development of the [[thoracic diaphragm]], [[myoblast]] cells from the septum invade the other components of the diaphragm. They thus give rise to the motor and sensory innervation of the muscular diaphragm by the [[phrenic nerve]].

== Derivatives ==
The [[cranium|cranial]] part of the septum transversum gives rise to the [[central tendon of diaphragm|central tendon]] of the diaphragm and is the origin of the [[myoblasts]] that invade the [[pleuroperitoneal]] folds resulting in the formation of the muscular diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N.A.; Roy, W.A.: ''Rapid Review Gross and Developmental Anatomy''; Mosby, 2nd ed., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the septum transversum is invaded by the [[hepatic diverticulum]] which divides within it to form the liver and thus gives rise to the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut, which in turn is the precursor of the [[lesser omentum]], the [[visceral peritoneum]] of the [[liver]] and the [[falciform ligament]].

Though not derived from the septum transversum, development of the liver is highly dependent upon signals originating here.  [[Bone morphogenetic protein 2]] (BMP-2), [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP-4]] and [[Bone morphogenetic protein 7|BMP-7]] produced from the septum transversum join [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) signals from the cardiac mesoderm induce part of the foregut to differentiate towards a hepatic fate.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, B: ''Human Embryology and Developmental Biology''.  Mosby, 3rd ed., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">Conservationists, ecologists, biodiversity scientists, lawmakers, and many others rely heavily on [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] information to manage, conserve, use, and share our biodiversity. The world-wide shortage of this important taxonomic information, the gaps in our taxonomic knowledge, and the shortage of trained taxonomists and curators to fill this need has come to be known as the '''taxonomic impediment'''. The importance of the taxonomic impediment was recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], signed at the 1992 Rio [[Earth Summit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/gti/|title=Convention on Biological Diversity: the Global Taxonomic Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiatives have occurred that have not yet solved the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wheeler, Q.D. |date=2008 |title= The New Taxonomy |chapter=Taxonomic shock and awe |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton  |editor= Q.D. Wheeler |pages= 211–226|volume=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest contributions of taxonomy to science and humanity are yet to come. Against formidable odds and with minimal funding, equipment, infrastructure, organization and encouragement, taxonomists have discovered, described, and classified nearly 1.8 million species. While increasing attention is being paid to making this substantial amount of accumulated taxonomic information more easily accessible, comparatively little attention has been paid to opening access to the research resources required by taxonomists themselves. Benefits associated with ease of access to museum records (e.g. [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]]) or 'known' species (e.g. [[Encyclopedia of Life]]) are seriously restricted when such information is untested for validity or is simply unavailable, as is the case for three-quarters or more of the species on Earth. We act as if taxonomy is done but nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Impediments to taxonomy ==
The causes of the current crisis in taxonomy have been ascribed to a loss of perspective in ecology &lt;ref&gt;Bortolus A. 2008. Error cascades in the biological sciences: the unwanted consequences of using bad taxonomy in ecology.  AMBIO 37: 114-118.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary biology as the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] developed during the 1930s and 40s: a conflation of "pattern with process",&lt;ref name=Wheeler2008Intro&gt;{{cite book|author=Wheeler, Q.D. |date=2008 |title= The New Taxonomy |chapter= Introductory: Toward the New Taxonomy |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton  |editor= Q.D.

It is argued that some initiatives that aim to bypass the bottleneck of insufficient taxonomic expertise continue to draw funds away from solving the fundamental problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=de Carvalho, M.R. |author2=Bockmann, F.A. |author3=Amorim, D.S. |author4=Brandao, C.R.F. |author5=de Vivo, M. |author6=de Figueiredo, J.L. |author7=Britski, H.A. |author8=de Pinna, M.C.C. |author9=Menezes, N.A. |author10=Marques, F.P.L. |author11=Papavero, N. |author12=Cancello, E.M. |author13=Crisci, J.V. |author14=McEachran, J.D. |author15=Schelly, R.C. |author16=Lundberg, J.G. |author17=Gill, A.C. |author18=Britz, R. |author19=Wheeler, Q.D. |author20=Stiassny, M.L.J. |author21=Parenti, L.R. |author22=Page, L.M. |author23=Wheeler, W.C. |author24=Faivovich, J. |author25=Vari, R.P. |author26=Grande, L. |author27=Humphries, C.J. |author28=DeSalle, R. |author29=Ebach, M.C. |author30=Nelson, G.J. |year=2007|title=Taxonomic impediment or impediment to taxonomy?

He expanded the department to ten faculty members, two scientists, twelve junior and twelve senior residents.

==DNA Laboratory==
Dogra started DNA facility at department of forensic medicine [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi|AIIMS]], in Feb 1991 with recruiting of Dr Anupuma Raina as PhD student and Dr G. Bomjen as MD student both taking DNA profiling related thesis topics, Dogra as Chief Guide and [[Seyed E.

Dr Dogra developed Medical Toxicological laboratory in the department of forensic medicine and toxicology in 1987. It was the first laboratory in a medical college where it was aimed to carry out analysis of samples for clinical and forensic purposes. The analytical toxicologist late H C Srivastava worked hard to get a reputation that the honourable courts ordered the tests to be conducted in this laboratory. The laboratory was well equipped with TLC, HPTLC, HPLC, GLC, Voltammetry, Atomic Absorption spectrometry etc. It worked in close collaboration with CFSL, CBI Delhi, FSL Rohini Delhi and JPN NICFS Rohini Delhi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiims.edu/aiims/departments/forensic/forensic_patientcare.htm|accessdate=13 April 2016|title= All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Department of forensic medicine|publisher=AIIMS, New Delhi 110029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icfmt.net/web/conferences/6th_conf/|title=sixth annual conference of Indian academy of forensic medicine and toxicology|publisher=ICFMT|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">'''Unfigured bass''', less commonly known as '''under-figured bass''', is a kind of [[musical notation]] used during the Baroque music era in Western [[Classical music]] (ca. 1600–1750) in which a [[basso continuo]] performer playing a chordal instrument (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], or [[lute]]) improvises a chordal accompaniment from a notated [[bass line]] which lacks the guidance of figures indicating which harmonies should be played above the bass note (see [[figured bass]]).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Lester, Joel (1994), ''Compositional Theory in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Figured bass parts have numbers or accidentals below the bass line which indicate which intervals above the bass should be played in the chord. However, not all basso continuo parts from the Baroque period were figured.

==History==
From the earliest days of [[thoroughbass]], [[composers]] and copyists have been chastised for providing bass parts without any figures to guide performers. Despite perennial complaints, however, unfigured basses persisted right through the eighteenth century. Though it is speculated that unfigured basses would not have existed if it were not for the suggestion of harmonies in bass lines of the time.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Performance===
In the early [[Baroque music|baroque]] period published parts were as likely to be unfigured as figured, leading to unusual clashes of [[harmony]] on a first reading. In an effort to perform a piece the first time without such harmonic clashes, various methods were devised and used to anticipate the harmonic structure and progression of a piece.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Among these are:

*Specific chords might be placed over a given [[solmization]] syllable, or an easily identified note, such as a sharped note.
*Specific chords might be applied to various patterns of bass intervals.
*Model bass lines with chords might be learned by rote to be used whenever applicable.
*Or specific chords might be placed over particular scale degrees.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Unfigured bass notes in an otherwise figured part===
[[File:Purcell diatonic chromaticism.png|thumb|right|300px|The recitative portion of this Purcell excerpt is mostly figured (i.e., almost every bass note has numbers and/or accidental symbols underneath it to indicate the harmony).  The last three bass notes here (the first three notes of the subsequent aria)  are unfigured. A continuo musician would then revert to deducing harmonies based on the scale function of each note, or not adding any harmonies (playing [[tasto solo]]) through the initial phrase.]]
In a figured bass part, not all bass notes were necessarily figured. By convention, bass notes of root-position chords ({{su|b=3|p=5}}) were often left unfigured. Exceptions to this rule, however, abound, as in the Purcell excerpt shown here.

===Pedagogy===
Many music masters in the [[Baroque]] period educated students in the art of playing unfigured bass accompaniment fluently. Many pieces such as [[partimento |Partimenti]] were written for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Sanguinetti, Giorgio (2012), ''The Art of Partimento: History, Theory, and Practice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vacuum evaporation''' is the process of causing the [[pressure]] in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal. Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of [[water]] by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard [[atmospheric pressure]] and causing the water to boil at [[room temperature]].

The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. In addition, there are other technical advantages such as the ability to distill other liquids with high boiling points and avoiding the decomposition of substances that are sensitive to temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Gemma|last2=Cambiella|first2=Ángel|last3=Benito|first3=José M.|last4=Pazos|first4=Carmen|last5=Coca|first5=José|title=The effect of additives on the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions by vacuum evaporation|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=June 2007|volume=144|issue=3|pages=649–654|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
When the process is applied to [[food]] and the water is [[evaporate]]d and removed, the food can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as [[egg whites]] [[coagulating]] when attempting to [[dehydrate]] the [[albumen]] into a powder.

This process was invented by [[Henri Nestlé]] in 1866, of [[Nestlé]] Chocolate fame,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  although the [[Shakers]] were already using a [[vacuum pan]] earlier than that (see [[condensed milk]]).

This process is used industrially to make such food products as [[evaporated milk]] for [[milk chocolate]], and [[tomato paste]] for [[ketchup]].

[[File:Vacuum evaporation plant.jpg|thumb|Vacuum evaporation plant]]
[[File:00-vacuum-pan-sugar-factory.JPG|thumb|right|vacuum pans in a beet sugar factory]]In the sugar industry vacuum evaporation is used in the [[crystallization]] of [[sucrose]] solutions. Traditionally, this process was performed in batch mode, but nowadays continuous vacuum pans are available.&lt;ref&gt;BMA Gruppe. [http://www.bma-worldwide.com/products/sugar-and-sweeteners/vacuum-pans-batch-and-continuous-types-vkt.html Article on continuous vacuum pans.] Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==
Vacuum evaporators are used in a wide range of industrial sectors to treat [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Condorchem Envitech. [http://condorchem.com/en/view/50-Vacuum-evaporators "Vacuum evaporators"] as a technology for industrial water-based liquid waste minimization and treatment. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a clean, safe and very versatile technology having low management costs, which in most cases serves as a zero-discharge treatment system.

==Thin film deposition==
Vacuum evaporation is also a form of [[physical vapor deposition]] used in the [[semiconductor]], [[microelectronics]], and [[optic]]al industries and in this context is a process of depositing [[thin films]] of material onto surfaces.  Such a technique consists of pumping a [[vacuum chamber]] to pressures of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] and heating a material to produce a [[flux]] of [[vapor]] in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its [[vapor pressure]] is high enough to produce a flux of several [[Angstroms]] per second by using an [[electrical]]ly [[resistive]] heater or bombardment by a high [[voltage]] beam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17412">[[File:IXOFlyby1Large.jpg|thumb|right|''[[International X-ray Observatory]] concept'']]
An '''X-ray telescope''' (XRT) is a [[telescope]] that is designed to observe remote objects in the [[X-ray]] spectrum.  In order to get above the Earth's atmosphere, which is opaque to X-rays, X-ray telescopes must be mounted on high altitude rockets, [[High-altitude balloon|balloons]] or artificial satellites.

The basic elements of the telescope are the optics (focusing or collimating), that collects the radiation entering the telescope, and the detector, on which the radiation is collected and measured. A variety of different designs and technologies have been used for these elements. 

Many of the existing telescopes on satellites are compounded of multiple copies or variations of a detector-telescope system, whose capabilities add or complement each other and additional fixed or removable elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chandra :: About Chandra :: Science Instruments|url = http://chandra.si.edu/about/science_instruments.html|website = chandra.si.edu|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Instruments|url = http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/|website = sci.esa.int|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (filters, spectrometers) that add functionalities to the instrument.  

==Optics==
{{main|X-ray optics}}
The most common methods used in X-ray optics are [[Wolter telescope|grazing incidence mirrors]] and [[Collimator|collimated apertures]].

===Focusing mirrors===
[[File:Pointing X-ray Eyes at our Resident Supermassive Black Hole.jpg|thumb|NuSTAR, has captured these first, focused views of the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in high-energy X-ray light.]]
The utilization of X-ray mirrors allows to focus the incident radiation on the detector plane. 

Different geometries (e.g. Kirkpartick-Baez or Lobster-eye) have been suggested or employed, but almost the totality of existing telescopes employs some variation of the [[Wolter telescope|Wolter I design]]. The limitations of this type of [[X-ray optics]] result in much narrower fields of view (typically &lt;1 degree) than visible or UV telescopes.

With respect to collimated optics, focusing optics allow:
* a high resolution imaging
* a high telescope sensitivity: since radiation is focused on a small area, [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] is much higher for this kind of instruments.

The mirrors can be made of [[ceramic]] or [[metal foil]]&lt;ref name="xraysMirror"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mirror Laboratory |url=http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrays/MirrorLab/xoptics.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; coated with a thin layer of a reflective material (typically [[gold]] or [[iridium]]). Mirrors based on this construction work on the basis of [[total reflection]] of light at grazing incidence.

This technology is limited in energy range by the inverse relation between critical angle for total reflection and radiation energy. The limit in the early 2000s with [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] and [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray [[Space observatory|observatories]] was about 15 kilo-[[electronvolt]] (keV) light.&lt;ref name="nustar1"&gt;[http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar/instrumentation/optics NuStar: Instrumentation: Optics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101113623/http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar/instrumentation/optics |date=November 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using new multi-layered coated mirrors, the X-ray mirror for the [[NuSTAR]] telescope pushed this up to 79 keV light.&lt;ref name="nustar1" /&gt; To reflect at this level, glass layers were multi-coated with [[tungsten]] (W)/[[silicon]] (Si) or [[platinum]] (Pt)/[[silicon carbide]](SiC).&lt;ref name="nustar1" /&gt;

===Collimating Optics===
{{main | coded aperture}}
While earlier X-ray telescopes were using simple collimating techniques (e.g. rotating collimators, wire collimators),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exploring the X-ray Universe - Cambridge Books Online - Cambridge University Press|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511781513|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511781513|first = Frederick D.|last = Seward|first2 = Philip A.|last2 = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology most currently used on present days employs coded aperture masks. This technique uses a flat aperture patterned grille in front of the detector. This design results less sensitive than focusing optics and imaging quality and identification of source position is much poorer, however it offers a larger [[field of view]] and can be employed at higher energies, where grazing incidence optics become ineffective. Also the imaging is not direct, but the image is rather reconstructed by post-processing of the signal.

==Detectors==
{{main|X-ray astronomy detector}}Several technologies have been employed on detectors for X-ray telescopes, ranging from counters like Ionization chambers, [[geiger counters]] or [[Scintillator|scintillators]] to imaging detectors like [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] or [[CMOS sensor|CMOS]] sensors. The use of micro-calorimeters, that offer the added capability of measuring with great accuracy the energy of the radiation, is planned for future missions.

===Exosat===
The two low-energy imaging telescopes onboard [[Exosat]] used [[Wolter telescope|Wolter]] I [[X-ray optics]] and were equipped with two focal plane detectors:
* a position-sensitive [[proportional counter]] (PSD) and
* a channel multiplier array (CMA).&lt;ref name=Hoff&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Hoff HA |title=Exosat — the new extrasolar x-ray observatory |journal=J Brit Interplan Soc (Space Chronicle) |date=Aug 1983 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=363–7 |bibcode=1983JBIS...36..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard X-ray telescope===
On board [[OSO 7]] was a hard X-ray telescope. Its effective energy range: 7–550 keV, field of view (FOV) 6.5°, effective area ~64&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Filin telescope===
The Filin telescope carried aboard [[Salyut 4]], consisted of four gas flow proportional counters, three of which had a total detection surface of 450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the energy range 2–10 keV, and one of which has an effective surface of 37&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the range 0.2–2 keV. The FOV was limited by a slit collimator to 3° × 10° FWHM. The instrumentation included optical sensors mounted on the outside of the station together with the X-ray detectors. The power supply and measurement units were inside the station. Ground-based calibration of the detectors occurred along with in-flight operation in three modes: inertial orientation, orbital orientation, and survey. Data were collected in 4 energy channels: 2–3.1 keV, 3.1–5.9 keV, 5.9–9.6 keV, and 2–9.6 keV in the larger detectors. The smaller detector had discriminator levels set at 0.2 keV, 0.55 keV, and 0.95 keV.

===SIGMA telescope===
The hard X-ray and low-energy gamma-ray [[Granat#SIGMA|SIGMA]] telescope covered the energy range 35–1300&amp;nbsp;keV,&lt;ref name=Mandrou&gt;{{ cite journal |bibcode=1993A&amp;AS...97....1M |author=Mandrou P |author2=Jourdain E. |title=Overview of two-year observations with SIGMA on board GRANAT |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume=97 |date=1993 |issue=97 |pages=1 |displayauthors=1 |last3=Bassani |last4=Vedrenne |last5=Paul |last6=Leray |last7=Lebrun |last8=Ballet |last9=Churazov |last10=Gilfanov |last11=Sunyaev |last12=Bogomolov |last13=Khavenson |last14=Kuleshova |last15=Tserenin |last16=Sukhanov }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an effective area of 800&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5° &amp;times; 5°.

===ART-P X-ray telescope===
The [[Granat#ART-P|ART-P X-ray telescope]] covered the energy range 4 to 60&amp;nbsp;keV for imaging and 4 to 100&amp;nbsp;keV for spectroscopy and timing. There were four identical modules of the ART-P telescope, each consisting of a position sensitive [[Wire chamber|multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC)]] together with a URA coded mask. Each module had an effective area of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, producing a [[field of view|FOV]] of 1.8° × 1.8°. The [[angular resolution]] was 5 [[Minute of arc|arcmin]]; temporal and energy resolutions were 3.9&amp;nbsp;[[Millisecond|ms]] and 22% at 6&amp;nbsp;keV, respectively.&lt;ref name="ART-P"&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=Molkov, S.V. |author2=Grebenev, S.A. |author3=Pavlinsky, M.N. |author4=Sunyaev |eprint=astro-ph/9903089v1 |title=GRANAT/ART-P Observations of GX3+1: Type I X-Ray it also  Burst out and Persistent Emission |date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument achieved a sensitivity of 0.001 of the [[Crab nebula]] source (= 1 "mCrab") in an eight-hour exposure. The maximum time resolution was 4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=IKI/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA2007"/&gt;

===Focusing X-ray telescope===
The [[Broad Band X-ray Telescope]] (BBXRT) was flown on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] ([[STS-35]]) as part of the ASTRO-1 payload. BBXRT was the first focusing X-ray telescope operating over a broad energy range 0.3–12 keV with a moderate energy resolution (90 eV at 1 keV and 150 eV at 6 keV). The two Co-Aligned Telescopes with a segmented Si(Li) solid state spectrometer each (detector A and B) composite of five pixels. Total FOV 17.4´ diameter, Central pixel FOV 4´ diameter. Total area 765&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.5 keV, and 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 7 keV.

===XRT on the Swift MIDEX mission===
The XRT on the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|''Swift'']] MIDEX mission (0.2–10 keV energy range) uses a Wolter I telescope to focus X-rays onto a thermoelectrically cooled CCD.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Burrows DN |author2= Hill JE |author3=Nousek JA |author4=Kennea JA |author5=Wells A |author6=Osborne JP |author7=Abbey AF |author8=Beardmore A |author9=Mukerjee K |author10=Short ADT |author11=Chincarini G |author12=Campana S |author13=Citterio O |author14=Moretti A |author15=Pagani C |author16=Tagliaferri G |author17=Giommi P |author18=Capalbi M |author19=Tamburelli F |author20=Angelini L |author21=Cusumano G |author22=Bräuninger HW |author23=Burkert W |author24=Hartner GD |title=The ''Swift'' X-ray Telescope |journal=Space Sci Rev |date=Oct 2005 |volume=120 |issue=3–4 |pages=165–95 |doi=10.1007/s11214-005-5097-2 |arxiv=astro-ph/0508071 |bibcode = 2005SSRv..120..165B }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to measure the fluxes, spectra, and lightcurves of [[Gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) and afterglows over a wide dynamic range covering more than 7 orders of magnitude in flux. The XRT can pinpoint GRBs to 5-arcsec accuracy within 10 seconds of target acquisition for a typical GRB and can study the X-ray counterparts of GRBs beginning 20–70 seconds from burst discovery and continuing for days to weeks.

The overall telescope length is 4.67 m with a focal length of 3.500&amp;nbsp;mm and a diameter of 0.51 m.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt; The primary structural element is an aluminum optical bench interface flange at the front of the telescope that supports the forward and aft telescope tubes, the mirror module, the electron deflector, and the internal alignment monitor optics and camera, plus mounting points to the ''Swift'' observatory.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt;

The 508&amp;nbsp;mm diameter telescope tube is made of graphite fiber/cyanate ester in two sections. The outer graphite fiber layup is designed to minimize the longitudinal coefficient of thermal expansion, whereas the inner composite tube is lined internally with an aluminum foil vapor barrier to guard against outgassing of water vapor or epoxy contaminants into the telescope interior.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt; The telescope has a forward tube which encloses the mirrors and supports the door assembly and star trackers, and an aft tube which supports the focal plane camera and internal optical baffles.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt;

The mirror module consists of 12 nested Wolter I grazing incidence mirrors held in place by front and rear spiders. The passively heated mirrors are gold-coated, electroformed nickel shells 600&amp;nbsp;mm long with diameters ranging from 191 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt;

The X-ray imager has an effective area of &gt;120&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.15 keV, a field of view of 23.6 × 23.6 arcmin, and [[angular resolution]] (θ) of 18 arcsec at half-power diameter (HPD). The detection sensitivity is 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; erg cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s. The mirror point spread function (PSF) has a 15 arcsec HPD at the best on-axis focus (at 1.5 keV). The mirror is slightly defocused in the XRT to provide a more uniform PSF for the entire field of view hence the instrument PSF θ = 18 arcsec.&lt;ref name=Burrows/&gt;

===Normal incidence X-ray telescope===
Like [[MSSTA]], [[NIXT]] used [[normal incidence]] reflective [[multilayer optics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hoover | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Walker II | first2 = A. B.

==History of X-ray telescopes==
{{See also|History of X-ray astronomy}}
The first X-ray telescope employing Wolter Type I grazing-incidence optics was employed in a rocket-borne experiment in 1965 to obtain X-ray images of the Sun (R. Giacconi et al., ApJ '''142''', 1274 (1965)).

The [[Einstein Observatory]] (1978–1981), also known as HEAO-2, was the first orbiting X-ray observatory with a Wolter Type I telescope (R. Giacconi et al., ApJ '''230''',540 (1979)). It obtained high-resolution X-ray images in the energy range from 0.1 to 4 keV of stars of all types, supernova remnants, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. [[HEAO-1]] (1977-1979) and
[[HEAO-3]] (1979-1981) were others in that series. Another large project was [[ROSAT]] (active from 1990-1999), which was a heavy X-ray space observatory with focusing X-ray optics.

The [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] is among the recent satellite observatories launched by NASA, and by the Space Agencies of Europe, Japan, and Russia. Chandra has operated for more than 10 years in a high elliptical orbit, returning thousands 0.5 arc-second images and high-resolution spectra of all kinds of astronomical objects in the energy range from 0.5 to 8.0 keV. Many of the spectacular images from Chandra can be seen on the NASA/Goddard website.

[[NuStar]] is one of the latest X-ray space telescopes, launched in June 2012. The telescope observes radiation in a high-energy range (3 - 79 keV), and with high resolution.  NuStar is sensitive to the 68 and 78 keV signals from decay of &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti in supernovae.

[[Gravity and Extreme Magnetism]] (GEMS) would have measured X-ray polarization but was canceled in 2012.
