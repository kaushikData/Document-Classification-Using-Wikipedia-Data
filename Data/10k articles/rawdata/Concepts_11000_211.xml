'''Advesha''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''adosa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''zhes sdang med pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-aggression"  or "non-hatred". It is defined as the absence of an aggressive attitude towards someone or something that causes pain.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 538-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is advesha? It is the absence of the intention to harm sentient beings, to quarrel with frustrating situations, and to inflict suffering on those who are the cause of frustration. It functions as a basis for not getting involved with unwholesome behavior.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}} 
'''Avidyā''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word whose literal meaning is [[ignorance]], misconceptions, misunderstandings, incorrect knowledge, and it is the opposite of ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|Vidya]]''.&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt; It is used extensively in [[Hindu]] texts, including the [[Upanishads]], and in other Indian religions such as [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], particularly in the context of metaphysical reality.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt;&lt;ref name="GombrichScherrer2008p209"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|author2=Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub|title=Buddhist Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7_Rea05eAMC|year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3248-0|pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidyā, in all [[Dharma|Dharmic systems]], represents fundamental ignorance and misperception of the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt; However, the Indian religions disagree on the details, for example with Hinduism considering a denial and misconceptions of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) as a form of Avidya, and Buddhism considering the denial and misconceptions of [[Anatta|An-atman]] (non-soul, non-self) as a form of Avidya.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sengaku Mayeda |title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jc9RHYN3qsC |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2771-4 |pages=76–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Trainor | first =Kevin | year =2004 | title =Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide | publisher =Oxford University Press | isbn =978-0-19-517398-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and meaning ==
''Avidyā'' (अविद्या) is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of "a" and "vidya", meaning "not vidya". The word ''vidya'' is derived from the Sanskrit root ''Vid'', which means "to know, to perceive, to see, to understand".&lt;ref name=mmwp918&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''avidya'' means to "not know, not perceive, not understand". The ''Vid*''-related terms appears extensively in the [[Rigveda]] and other [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt; Avidya is usually rendered as "ignorance" in English translations of ancient Indian texts, sometimes as "spiritual ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Whicher |title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3815-2 |page=110, see both translations on the same page by Ian Whicher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mariasusai Dhavamony |title=Phenomenology of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALfSPvRO7DgC&amp;pg=PA297|date=1973 |publisher=Gregorian |isbn=978-88-7652-474-5|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word avidyā is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''weid''-, meaning "to see" or "to know". It is a [[cognate]] of Latin ''vidēre'' (which would turn to "video") and English "wit".

While Avidya found in Indian philosophies is translated as "ignorance", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because Avidya means more than ignorance. He suggests the term "unwisdom" to be a better rendition.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Meaning of Unwisdom (Avidya)| author= Alex Wayman|journal = Philosophy East and West| volume= 7| number= 1/2| year= 1957| pages= 21–25 | jstor= 1396830| doi=10.2307/1396830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions).&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt; Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;

Avidya represents fundamental ignorance, state Jones and Ryan, a misperception of the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name=ryanjones57&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, Avidya includes confusing the mundane reality to be the only reality, and it as a permanent though it is ever changing.&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt; Its doctrines assert that there is a spiritual reality consisting of Atman-Brahman, one that is the true, eternal, imperishable reality beyond time.&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] M Hiriyanna (2000), ''The Essentials of Indian Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pp. 25, 160-161;&lt;br&gt;[b] Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, pages 118-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston14&gt;Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), ''Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1902210438}}, pages 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
Avidya in the earliest Vedic texts is ignorance, and in later Vedic texts evolves to include anything that is a "positive hindrance" to spiritual or nonspiritual knowledge.&lt;ref name=scharfstein376/&gt; In the Upanishads, the concept includes "lack of knowledge, inadequate knowledge and false knowledge".&lt;ref name=scharfstein376&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein |title=Comparative History of World Philosophy, A: From the Upanishads to Kant |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xXJBZLn04IC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-1887-2|pages=376–377 with footnotes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Advaita Vedanta==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
The effect of avidya is to suppress the real nature of things and present something else in its place. In effect it is not different from [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (pronounced Māyā) or illusion. Avidya relates to the individual Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]''), while Maya is an adjunct of the cosmic Self (''[[Brahman]]''). In both cases it connotes the principle of differentiation of an experienced reality into the subject ('I') and an object, as is implicit in human thinking. Avidya stands for that delusion which breaks up the original unity (refer: [[nonduality]]) of what is real and presents it as subject and object and as doer and result of the deed. What keeps humanity captive in [[Samsara]] is this avidya. This ignorance,"the ignorance veiling our true self and the truth of the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohrhoff|first=Ulrich|title=The Veil of Avidya|url=http://thisquantumworld.com/PDF/Avidya.pdf|publisher=Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, Pondicherry, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not lack of [[erudition]]; it is ignorance about the nature of 'Being' (''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]''). It is a limitation that is natural to human sensory or intellectual apparatus. This is responsible for all the misery of humanity. [[Advaita Vedanta]] holds that the eradication of it should be humanity's only goal and that will automatically mean realisation of the Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'').

[[Adi Shankara]] says in his Introduction to his commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras]], "Owing to an absence of discrimination, there continues a natural human behaviour in the form of 'I am this' or 'This is mine'; this is avidya. It is a superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another. The ascertainment of the nature of the real entity by separating the superimposed thing from it is vidya (knowledge, illumination)". In Shankara's philosophy avidya cannot be categorized either as 'absolutely existent' or as 'absolutely non-existent'.

In Cathal O'Byrne's book ''As I Roved Out'' there are a couple of chapters on Steel. She lived in a cottage in the townland of Poleglass, on the outskirts of [[Belfast]] and [[Lisburn]], along what is now the Stewartstown Road. Her place in history comes from her sympathy for the [[Roman Catholic]] faithful who, under [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Law]], were denied their church buildings for worship. Steel was the trusted custodian of the sacred vessels used in the [[Liturgy]], as well as a small horn used to summon the faithful to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Her name is commemorated in the name of one of the roads through Poleglass. She kept watch and provided warnings to the people attending mass when the soldiers were approaching. She is depicted in many of Belfast's [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] murals.

'''Biocomplexity''' is the study of complex structures and behaviors that arise from nonlinear interactions of active biological agents, which may range in scale from molecules to cells to organisms. Almost every biological system exhibits complexity - [[emergent properties]] where the ensemble possesses capabilities that its individual agents lack. Classical examples of biocomplexity include the behavior of [[molecular motor]]s during [[DNA transcription]], genetic and metabolic networks within cells, the interacting [[Cytoskeleton#The Eukaryotic Cytoskeleton|filament]]s of the [[cytoskeleton]], which allow the cell to move, the differentiation, organization and movement of cells during embryonic development, the function of the networks of neurons which compose the brain and the schooling of fish or birds. 

Primarily as a result of funding policy changes at the American [[National Science Foundation]] around 2000, some researchers have begun to use the term biocomplexity in a narrower sense to denote the [[complexity|complex]] behavioral, biological, social, chemical, and physical [[interaction]]s of [[life|living]] [[organism]]s with their [[natural environment|environment]]. This relatively new subfield of biocomplexity encompasses other domains such as [[biodiversity]] and [[ecology]].

Biocomplexity research aims to provide quantitative models of complex biological phenomena both to understand them in their own right and to interpret and guide quantiative biomedical experimentation.

[[Kluwer]] planned to publish a journal called ''Biocomplexity''. A disappointingly low number of submitted manuscripts resulted in the publisher cancelling the journal's launch issue.

The '''black elite''' in the [[Southern United States|South]] of the [[United States]] started forming before the [[American Civil War]] among free blacks who managed to acquire property. Of the free [[people of color]] in [[North Carolina]] in the censuses from 1790 to 1810, 80% can be traced to [[African Americans]] free in [[Virginia]] during the colonial period.  Free blacks migrated from Virginia to other states as did their neighbors.  Extensive research into colonial court records, wills and deeds has demonstrated that most of those free families came from relationships or marriages between white women, servant or free, and black men, servant, free or slave.  Such relationships were part of the more fluid relationships among the working class before the boundaries of [[slavery]] hardened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040328102300/http://www.freeafricanamerican.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, there were additional relationships between whites and blacks, not always of a consensual nature. What is notorious is that white slaveholders could take advantage of slave women because of their power. There were also slaveholders who had caring relationships, common-law marriages, and real marriages with black slave women, and who sometimes freed them and their children. Some slaveholders did provide for their mixed-race children by ensuring they got education although, in other cases, they were simply apprenticed to a trade or craft. Whatever property the father passed on to the child was important in helping that person get a start in life.  

The [[mulatto]]s patterned their lives after "polite" white society. 

In the South, because of their [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in acquiring property, the black elite began to exercise leadership roles within the church, black schools, and community, but as in any society, there were natural leaders who rose up from many classes.  

Catering services and other skilled employment were important because they had the white contacts needed to remain within the “status quo”. The black elite also enjoyed the benefits of living within the white neighborhoods which further isolated them from the darker-skinned African Americans which caused them to blame them for the downward shifts in life-style choices. They felt that by “emulating” the white man could social standing and class be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} 
	
The [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[affirmative action]] brought about many changes for the black elite. As the old elite died away, it made room for the new black elite to emerge. Within its realm are the educated, the entrepreneurs, actors, singers, and those who comprise the top nine percent of the elite status.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
The '''Boehm system''' is a system of [[key (instrument)|keywork]] for the [[flute]], created by [[inventor]] and [[flautist]] [[Theobald Boehm]] between 1831 and 1847.  

Prior to the development of the Boehm system, flutes were most commonly made of wood, with an inverse conical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], eight keys, and [[tone hole]]s (the openings where the fingers are placed to produce specific notes) that were small in size, and thus easily covered by the fingertips.  Boehm's work was inspired by an 1831 concert in London, given by soloist [[Charles Nicholson (flautist)|Charles Nicholson]] who, with his father in the 1820s, had introduced a flute constructed with larger tone holes than were used in previous designs.  This large-holed instrument could produce greater volume of sound than other flutes, and Boehm set out to produce his own large-holed design.

In addition to large holes, Boehm provided his flute with "full venting", meaning that all keys were normally open (previously, several keys were normally closed, and opened only when the key was operated).  Boehm also wanted to locate tone holes at acoustically optimal points on the body of the instrument, rather than locations conveniently covered by the player's fingers.  To achieve these goals, Boehm adapted a system of axle-mounted keys with a series of "open rings" (called ''brille'', German for "eyeglasses", as they resembled the type of eyeglass frames common during the 19th century) that were fitted around other tone holes, such that the closure of one tone hole by a finger would also close a key placed over a second hole.

In 1832 Boehm introduced a new conical-bore flute, which achieved a fair degree of success.  Boehm, however, continued to look for ways to improve the instrument.  Finding that an increased volume of air produced a stronger and clearer tone, he replaced the conical bore with a cylindrical bore, finding that a parabolic contraction of the bore near the [[embouchure]] hole improved the instrument's [[Register (music)|low register]].  He also found that optimal tone was produced when the tone holes were too large to be covered by the fingertips, and he developed a system of finger plates to cover the holes.  These new flutes were at first made of [[silver]], although Boehm later produced wooden versions.  

The cylindrical Boehm flute was introduced in 1847, with the instrument gradually being adopted almost universally by professional and amateur players in Europe and around the world during the second half of the 19th century. The instrument was adopted for the performance of orchestral and chamber music, opera and theater, wind ensembles (e.g., military and civic bands), and most other music which might be loosely described as relating to "[[Western classical music]]" (including, for example, [[jazz]]). Many further refinements have been made, and countless design variations are common among flutes today (the "offset G" key, addition of the low B foot, etc.) The concepts of the Boehm system have been applied across the range of flutes available, including [[piccolo]]s, [[alto flute]]s, [[bass flute]]s, and so on, as well as other wind instruments. The material of the instrument may vary (many piccolos are made of wood, some very large flutes are wooden or even made of [[PVC]]).

The [[flute]] is perhaps the oldest musical instrument, other than the human voice itself. There are very many flutes, both traversely blown and end-blown "[[fipple]]" flutes, currently produced which are not built on the Boehm model.

The fingering system for the [[saxophone]] closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm's for the [[clarinet]] family is also known as the "[[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]]", although it was developed by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] and not Boehm himself.  The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of [[flageolet]]s. Boehm did work on a system for the [[bassoon]], and Boehm-inspired [[oboe]]s have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The [[Albert system]] is another key system for the clarinet.

'''Brenda Cherry''' (born March 19, 1958), is an American Civil Rights Activist from [[Paris, Texas]]. 

Cherry is the President and co-founder of Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, a non-profit [[civil rights organization]] located in Paris, Texas. Founded in 2003, CCFRE co-sponsored events with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], Lone Star Legal Aid, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Dept Intervene on Racial Tensions in Paris, TX (Public Meeting 1.29)|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/128805|publisher=PR.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal aid rally draws crowd|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_f4ce57b9-0e1a-5d4c-bc0d-85c9819316a6.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Cherry grew up in Blossom Texas. Her late father, Zeb Reynolds, was a farmer, and her mother, Irene Whitney, was a domestic worker.  She began school at T.G. Givens, which was then, a segregated school in Paris, Texas. She had to be bused 10 miles to the school even though there was a local school district in the town where she lived.  After the schools were forced to integrate, she attended the formerly "whites only" school in Blossom. Cherry graduated from [[Prairiland High School]] in [[Pattonville, Texas]]. She went on to attend [[Paris Junior College]] and [[East Texas State University]]. Cherry worked as a Licensed Vocational Nurse for 9 years before becoming a civil rights activist. Cherry has two daughters, Shauncia Cherry and Tiffany Cherry, and one son, Rico Lewis.

=== Schoolyard assault ===
On October 23, 2003, an 11-year-old black student was reportedly attacked by a principal at [[Crockett Middle School]] in Paris, Texas. The child was removed from the school and sent to a detention center. Cherry, along with a small group of people, including the child’s mother and grandfather, staged a protest in front of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest: Mother claims son beaten|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_aedc00d4-a144-5f26-8dac-3ec73fad0179.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest|url= http://theparisnews.com/article_9034f8b8-af93-51ad-991e-0be9af4bd6a7.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the protest, the child was released from the detention center. This event marked the beginning of several future protest demonstrations in the town.

[[Shaquanda Cotton]] was an African-American student that attended Paris High School in Paris, Texas. On March 16, 2006, Cotton, aged 14, was arrested for allegedly shoving a school hall monitor. 
Having no prior criminal history, Cotton was tried and sentenced to up to 7 years in the [[Texas Youth Commission]]. During the same time frame, the judge in the case, Chuck Superville, sentenced a Caucasian 14-year-old girl who had a prior criminal history to probation after committing the confirmed crime of arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge keeps juvenile on probation|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_51118b41-045a-5e58-98e2-5fa7ffa0ca34.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Darwin Campbell with ''[[African-American News and Issues]]'' broke the story, which garnered attention to Cotton’s sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1-Willie Lynch and Jim Crow Join Forces in Lamar County to Destroy Black Youth |url=http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |publisher=African American News and Issues |accessdate=19 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105060808/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |archivedate=5 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving a year and one month in prison, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' story written by Howard Witt led the case to national exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To some in Paris, sinister past is back. |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703120170mar12,0,1435953.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large protest led by comedian [[Rickey Smiley]] was held at the Lamar County Courthouse in Paris, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiley: "It is time for a new movement." |url= http://theparisnews.com/news/article_0379c3d6-6538-5d24-a001-6427071e6af6.html|publisher= TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately two weeks after the ''Tribune'' article and protest, ShaQuanda was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl in prison for shove gets released early |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703310265mar31,0,4450616.story|publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry was interviewed by the [[BBC]] regarding Cotton, and the case was included in a BBC documentary by United Kingdom reporter Julian O'Halloran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fourteen, and at the heart of a race row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/7064473.stm|publisher= BBC News|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Julian|last=O'Halloran|date=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brandon McClelland ===
[[File:1parisrally.jpg|thumb|Rally for Brandon McClelland in Paris, Texas]]

[[Death of Brandon McClelland|Brandon McClelland]] was a 24-year-old African American male who lived in Paris, Texas. On September 16, 2008, his body was found partially dismembered and mutilated on a farm road approximately 17 miles from his home. The local newspaper, ''The Paris News'', reported the death as a hit-and-run by an unknown truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hit-run death still under investigation |url=  http://theparisnews.com/news/article_d11c225c-529d-5b19-ba81-3c9d45a5feee.html |publisher= The Paris News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activism of Cherry and the Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, the case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was his death a hate crime? |url=  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-05/news/0810040299_1_civil-rights-paris-unknown-driver |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Two charged with murder after black man dragged to death in troubled Paris, Texas |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-081212-paris-witt,0,3694385.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dispute about whether McClelland was dragged under the truck or behind it, and while awaiting autopsy reports, ''[[USA Today]]'' interviewed Cherry. "Authorities have not seriously considered the possibility that this was a hate crime. There's a problem in Paris, Texas. I don't see a difference in getting dragged behind a truck and getting dragged under a truck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Another dragging death in Texas raises tensions |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-10-24-164308463_x.htm |publisher= USA Today|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Jeff|last=Carlton|date=25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation revealed that McClelland was last seen alive with two Caucasian men, Shannon Finley and Charles Ryan Crostley, both of whom had extensive criminal history. ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' reported that the two men were charged with killing McClelland and both subsequently plead "not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The turbulent racial history of Paris, Texas |url=   http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/07/27/the-turbulent-racial-history-of-paris-texas/ |publisher= Anderson Cooper 360|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special prosecutor Toby Shook cited lack of evidence to the case, and the murder charges were dropped in June 2009. The two men were released. [[CBS News]] quoted Cherry, "His body was dragged and nobody gets charged? Even if a trucker came forward, that's all it takes? Even the trucker's not charged? If you hit someone, you don't get charged? Nobody gets charged with this? It's not surprising, but it's sad. It appears that a black man's life means nothing here in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Charges dropped in Texas Dragging Death |url=   http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5065180.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple protests have been led by Cherry, along with Jim Blackwell and the New Black Panther Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jasper-style lynching in Paris Texas? |url=   http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_5348.shtml |publisher= Final Call|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Protesters clash over Texas Dragging Death |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5176952.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains an open murder investigation.

=== Brandarian Thomas ===
Brandarian Thomas was a 14-year-old African American student at Travis Junior High School in Paris, Texas. In June 2008, Police handcuffed and arrested Thomas at his home for allegedly "touching a female student's butt and crotch" in class. Thomas denied the accusations. Thomas' mother contacted Cherry, who convinced her to take the case to trial rather than accept a plea deal. ''[[Texas Observer]]'' reporter Forrest Wilder documented the case. Cherry views the Cotton and Thomas prosecutions as extreme examples of a larger pattern of racial discrimination in Paris public schools. Cherry stated, "The black kids are punished more often, more harshly. I think they go to extremes; they punish them for little things. A lot of times, they see a black kid as more menacing." Though prosecutors offered a plea deal to Thomas (two years of probation in exchange for a guilty plea), Cherry helped convince Thomas' mother to take the matter to trial in front of the same judge who heard the Cotton case. "It's ridiculous," Cherry stated. "He was 14. You're going to ruin his life because you can't make him plead guilty?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Too black for school?

=== Cornelius Gill ===
Cornelius Gill was an 18-year-old African American high school student in Paris, Texas.  On November 11, 2009, Gill was picking up pecans when he was approached by a Paris police officer who questioned him about a stolen car that had been found a few blocks away. Gill refused to be questioned and said a curse word. The officer arrested Gill and placed him in handcuffs behind his back. When another police car pulled up, Gill was lifted and body slammed face down onto the vehicle. Cherry witnessed a portion of the incident and she, along with Gill's mother, filed a complaint with the Paris Police Department. Cherry obtained the video of the incident. Gill was sentenced to 100 days in jail by Judge Chuck Superville. Although the video footage shows no evidence of such, the officer claimed Gill assaulted him while placing him in the patrol car. Gill was charged with Assault of a Public Servant and Resisting Arrest. The complaint resulted in a suspension of the officer, but the suspension was lifted when the officer appealed. The case resulted in an outcry from civilians regarding police brutality and unnecessary force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Video of Black Teen's Arrest leads to more Paris Texas controversy |url= http://www.wiredprnews.com/2010/07/16/video-of-black-teens-arrest-leads-to-more-paris-texas-controversy_2010071612646.html|publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Small Texas Town Seized by Racial Controversy |url= http://www.blackradionetwork.com/small_texas_town_seized_by_racial_controversy |publisher= Minority News| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Released of Paris arrest incident |url= http://www.kxii.com/news/headlines/98466019.html |publisher= KXII.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', Cherry stated that the ruling sends a message to local police that they can do whatever they want. "What's going to stop the officer from doing that again and again? It makes me fearful," she said. The dash cam video was released after Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality filed an open records request. "We're already in a bad situation here in Paris, and this just makes it worse," Cherry stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Police Brutality VIDEO: SHOCKING Texas Incident Caught on Tape |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/cornelius-gill/1 |publisher= The Huffington Post| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bobby Yates ===
Bobby Yates was a 51-year-old African American man in Paris, Texas. Yates was paralyzed from the waist down due to a gunshot wound during a hunting accident approximately 20 years earlier. His lower body was removed from his hips down due to an infection. On a late night in 2008, Yates made a 911 call to the local police stating that he had been beaten by a 16-year-old white female and two adult males who were at his home that refused to leave. When the police came, the female claimed that Yates had sexually assaulted her. The two males were with her the entire time. The police sided with the female, and Yates was later arrested and charged with sexual assault. Cherry along with her organization held protests and filed complaints on Yates' behalf. After 3 years of legal action, the sexual assault charge was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lower Body Amputee Accused of Sexual Assault: Group Claims Racism is Factor |url=   http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/04/24/lower-body-amputee-accused-of-sexual-assault-group-claims-racism-is-factor_2011042418764.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Paris, Texas: ‘Mississippi 50 Years Ago’ |url= http://www.texasobserver.org/forrestforthetrees/paris-texas-mississippi-50-years-agol |publisher= Texas Observer |accessdate= 19 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aaron Hart ===
Aaron Hart was an 18-year-old mentally retarded youth with an IQ of 47 when he was arrested and charged with sexual assault. Hart had been playing with a 5-year-old child and they exposed and touched each other's private parts. At trial, Hart's court-appointed attorney called no witnesses on Hart's behalf and failed to obtain an independent doctor for a competency hearing. Judge Eric Clifford sentenced Hart to 100 years in prison on June 10, 2009, claiming that he had no other choice.

Numerous protest marches were held, led by CCFRE and Jim Blackwell of the Tarrant County Local Organizing Committee. The case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mentally Retarded Texas teen serving 100-year prison term for sex assault of boy |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_for_monapr06,0,5597484.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is just horrible," stated Cherry in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article after Judge Clifford made his ruling.

Hart was given a new trial on appeal. Hart ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 10 years in prison where he remains.

=== Turner Industries ===
[[File:Brenda Cherry and Turner men.jpg|thumb|left|Brenda Cherry with Turner Industries employees in Louisiana]]
Turner Industries is a privately owned industrial plant with facilities in several cities and states including Paris, Texas. In February 2009, Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality received complaints and photos regarding a noose, racist graffiti, Confederate flags, and salary and advancement discrimination against black workers in the Turner Industries Paris plant. Activism led to a federal investigation by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism bedevils Texas town |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_webfeb25,0,4203830.story |work= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Factory employees file federal racial discrimination, harassment complaint |url=  http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/41178052.html |publisher= KXII.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings led to a federal lawsuit which was settled out of court, as well as changes in Turner Industries employment practices. Cherry stated, "One of my biggest concerns regarding the racist graffiti, noose, and other things found at the plant is the mentality of those who put it there. Those same people serve on juries, and some go on to have supervisory positions or other positions of authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noose, Racist Graffiti Proves Efforts Must Continue to Expose 'Ghosts' and Truths About Paris Racism |url=http://www.lonestarpowerpages.com/feb-21-2009---special-report.html |publisher= LoneStarPowerPages.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turner Industries investigation was one of the largest civil rights investigations ever undertaken in the State of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nooses, Swastikas, Racist Graffiti Harass Employees of Texas Company – EEOC |url= http://www.bvblackspin.com/2010/04/15/nooses-swastikas-racist-graffitti-harass-black-employees-of-te/ |publisher= Black Spin| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roping and bullying of autistic student ===
On April 20, 2011, a 14-year-old African American autistic student was taken by an 18-year-old Caucasian student into the greenhouse at Paris High School. The 18-year-old threw a rope over a beam and placed the other end around the waist of the 14-year-old. He kicked his feet and beat his hand with a stick until bloody when the 14-year-old attempted to get free. The girlfriend of the 18-year-old student stood laughing and recorded the incident with her cell phone. When the group returned to class, a male teacher took the recording and erased it. After the school refused to discipline the 18-year-old and his girlfriend, or the teacher who erased the evidence, Cherry and CCFRE advocated on behalf of the mother, Tina Washington, and her son. The county attorney refused to charge the 18-year-old student even though it was a felony offense. Several protests were led by Cherry and Jim Blackwell regarding the incident. The case is currently under investigation by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Autistic Teen roped by another student, Recording erased by Teacher |url=     http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/07/24/autistic-teen-roped-by-another-student-recording-erased-by-teacher_2011072420998.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality co-sponsored a community reconciliation meeting with the U.S. Department of Justice which was featured in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. "I'm here to talk about racism. I don't see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn't exist," stated Cherry. "When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention—it's racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that's not racism, what is it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hard truth, but little reconciliation in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-paris-web31,0,922958.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Organizations to hold community forum on school discipline in Paris, Texas |url=  http://www.aclutx.org/2010/11/30/organizations-to-hold-community-forum-on-school-discipline-in-paris-texas/ |publisher= American Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This town is being forced to look at things they never wanted to look at before," stated Cherry in an excerpt from ''[[Newsweek]]''. Cherry, along with Lone Star Legal Aid, a local nonprofit law firm, compiled statistics showing that the Paris Independent School District punished black kids eight times more often than white ones, even though blacks make up a minority of the population. The U.S. Department of Education ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to attribute the discrepancy to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Problems in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/01/30/problems-in-paris-texas.html |publisher= Newsweek Magazine| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Cherry, "I think we are probably stuck in 1930 right about now.

[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

[[File:Double pendulum simultaneous realisations.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Experimental demonstration of the butterfly effect with different recordings of the same double pendulum. In each recording, the pendulum starts with almost the same initial condition. Over time the differences in the dynamics grow from almost unnoticeable to drastic ones.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos at fifty|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003926/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|archivedate=2016-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever.

According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In quantum mechanics===

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]]. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Quantum Chaotic Environments, the Butterfly Effect, and Decoherence |first=Zbyszek P. |last=Karkuszewski |first2=Christopher |last2=Jarzynski |first3=Wojciech H. |last3=Zurek |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=89 |issue=17 |year=2002 |page=170405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.170405 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..89q0405K|arxiv = quant-ph/0111002 |pmid=12398653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics".

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">A '''cold peace''' is a state of relative [[peace]] between two countries which is marked by the enforcement of a [[peace treaty]] ending the [[war|state of war]] while the government or populace of at least one of the parties to the treaty continues to domestically treat the treaty with vocal disgust. 

It is contrasted against a [[cold war (general term)|cold war]], in which at least two states which are not openly pursuing a state of war against each other, openly or covertly support conflicts between each other's client states or allies. Cold peace, while marked by similar levels of mistrust and antagonistic domestic policy between the two governments and populations, do not result in proxy wars, formal incursions, or similar conflicts.

==Examples==

===Egypt and Israel===
The [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] and the aftermath of [[Egypt–Israel relations|relations between Israel and Egypt]] are considered a modern example of a cold peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14603812]&lt;/ref&gt; After having engaged each other in five prior wars, the populations had become weary of the loss of life, and the negotiation of the Accords and Treaty were considered a high point of the Middle East Peace Process. However, Egyptian popular support for the treaty plummeted following the 1981 assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] and the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and perception of the treaty has not recovered in the Egyptian populace ever since. 

This drop in support for the treaty was not entirely reflected in Egyptian government policy, as from 1981 until his 2011 ouster, Sadat's successor [[Hosni Mubarak]] continued to retain the treaty's terms, while also playing public sentiment against Israelis and Jews through state media. Following Mubarak's ouster and the installation of a military junta in power until inauguration of the next civilian government, protesters voiced strong opposition against the 1979 treaty with Israel, and the Israeli response to [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel]] resulted in the withdrawal of the Egyptian ambassador over the deaths of 5 Egyptian security personnel in the Sinai, ostensibly by either Palestinian militants or Israeli military personnel engaged in a retaliatory air raid on Gaza. 

The lack of Egyptian support for the 1979 treaty is due in part to panethnic and religious fundamentalist sympathies in Egypt for Palestinian and other Arab Muslim militancies against Israel, a Jewish-majority state currently in conflict over the territory of Israel and the Palestinian territories, as well as Egyptian nationalist sentiment against Israel dating back to before Israel's independence in 1948. Furthermore, while most of the letter of both the Accords and the treaty has been maintained, the spirit of normalization which had been intended are perceived as not having been fulfilled.

===India and Pakistan===
A ceasefire signed between India and Pakistan over [[Kashmir]] has kept open hostilities from developing between the two countries, but numerous incidents involving Pakistani nationals, such as the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], likewise Indian involvement in Baluchistan have often strained both diplomatic relations and popular support for peace between the two [[nuclear powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/14/us-kashmir-border-idUSTRE77D0EX20110814]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming''' ({{lang-de|Der Dichter und das Phantasieren}}), was an informal talk given in 1907 by [[Sigmund Freud]], and subsequently published in 1908, on the relationship between unconscious [[fantasy (psychology)|phantasy]] and creative art.

Freud's argument – that artists, reviving memories of childhood [[daydream]]s and play activities, succeeded in making them acceptable through their aesthetic technique&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; – was to be widely influential for interwar [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Berman, ''Translating Modernism'' (2010) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic sources==
Freud began his talk by raising the question of where writers drew their material from, suggesting that children at play, and adults day-dreaming, both provided cognate activities to those of the literary artist.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 307-8&lt;/ref&gt; Heroic and erotic daydreams or [[preconscious]] phantasies in both men and women were seen by Freud as providing substitute satisfactions for everyday deprivations;&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and the same phantasies were in turn turned into shareable (public) artistic constructs by the creative writer, where they could serve as cultural surrogates for the universal instinctual renunciations inherent in civilization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic technique==
Freud saw the aesthetic principle as the ability to turn the private phantasy into a public artefact, using artistic pleasure to release a deeper pleasure founded on the release of forbidden (unconscious) material.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p.&amp;nbsp;308&lt;/ref&gt; The process allowed the writer him/herself to emerge from their introversion and return to the public world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; If the phantasies came too close to the unconscious repressed, however, the process would fail, leading either to creative inhibition or to a rejection of the artwork itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself epitomised his essay's argument a decade later in his ''Introductory Lectures'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 423-3&lt;/ref&gt; stating of the true artist that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"he understands how to work over his daydreams in such a way as to make them lose what is too personal in them and repels strangers, and to make it possible for others to share in the enjoyment of them. He understands, too, how to tone them down so that they do not easily betray their origin from proscribed sources....he has thus achieved ''through'' his phantasy what originally he had achieved only ''in'' his phantasy – honour, power and the love of women".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{buddhism}}

The '''desire realm''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''kāmadhātu'') is one of the [[trailokya]] or three realms (Sanskrit: ''dhātu'', Tibetan: ''khams'') in [[Buddhist cosmology]] into which a being wandering in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]'' may be [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]]. The other two are the [[Buddhist cosmology#Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)|form realm]], (Sanskrit ''rūpadhātu'') and the [[Formless Realm|formless realm]] (S. ''ārūpadhātu'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary_tibetan.html_80737389.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the desire realm are either five or six domains (Sanskrit: ''gati'', also sometimes translated as "realm").  In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], there are six domains ({{bo|w=rigs drug gi skye gnas}}) and in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] there are only five, because the domain of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]] is not regarded as separate from that of the [[Nāga]]s. 
The five realms are also found in [[Taoism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/www/xsxx/txt.asp?id=1272 道教生死观及其与佛教的关系]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:s:太上說轉輪五道宿命因緣經]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/zibu/dao/yun7/yj7_012.htm 老君太上虚无自然本起经]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ez-dao.com/god/(62)%20-godlist.html 62 四月十七日十殿轉輪王]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' in Mahayana Buddhism regarded the 10 kinds of [[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]] as separate immortal realms between the Deva and human realms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cttbusa.org/shurangama/shurangama_contents.asp The Shurangama Sutra text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoistic.org/wdb/wdbread.php?forumid=16&amp;filename=f_95 辨《楞严经》十种仙] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081715/http://www.taoistic.org/wdb/wdbread.php?forumid=16&amp;filename=f_95 |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six domains of the desire realm are also known as the "six paths of suffering", the "six planes", and the "six lower realms". In schools of thought that use the [[ten realms]] system, these six domains are often contrasted negatively with the "four higher realms" of [[Śrāvaka]], [[Pratyekabuddha]], [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]], which are considered to be the spiritual goals of the different Buddhist traditions.

A being's [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] (previous actions and thoughts) determines which of the six domains it will be reborn into.  A sentient being may also ascend to one of the higher realms beyond the six domains of the desire realm by practicing various types of [[meditation]], specifically the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Eight Dhyānas]].

The 8th century Buddhist monument [[Borobudur]] in [[Central Java]] incorporated the trailokya into the architectural design with the plan of [[mandala]] that took the form of a stepped stone pyramid crowned with [[stupa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tartakov, Gary Michael|work=Lecture notes for Asian Art and Architecture: Art &amp; Design 382/582|publisher=Iowa State University|title=Lecture 17: Sherman Lee's History of Far Eastern Art (Indonesia and Cambodja)|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~tart/arth382/lecture17.html|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Six Domains==
{{See also|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)#Realms of rebirth}}
The six domains of the desire realm are as follows:

*the [[Deity|god]] / [[angel]] (Sanskrit, Pali: ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]'') domain
*the jealous god / [[Titan (mythology) |titan]]  (S., P.: ''[[Asura (Buddhism)|asura]]'') domain
*the [[human]] (S. ''[[Human beings in Buddhism|manuṣya]],'' P. ''manussa'') domain
*the [[animal]] (S. ''[[Animals in Buddhism|tiryagyoni]],'' P. ''tiracchānayoni'') domain
*the [[hungry ghost]] (S. ''[[preta]],'' P. ''petta'') domain
*the [[hell]] (S: ''[[Naraka (Buddhism)|naraka]],'' P. ''niraya'') domain

===Deva Domain===
{{Main|Deva (Buddhism)}}
The ''Deva domain'' (also known as the ''God domain'' or ''Blissful State'') is the domain of bliss. The disadvantage of this domain is that things are so very comfortable there, that these beings completely neglect to work towards enlightenment. Instead they gradually use up the good karma they had previously accumulated, and so they subsequently fall to a lower rebirth.

The Deva domain is sometimes also referred to as the ''gods' domain'', because its inhabitants are so powerful within their own domain, that compared to humans, they resemble the [[deity|gods]] of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology]].  However, while the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s may be referred to as gods, they are not immortal, omniscient, nor omnipotent, and they do not act as creators or judges at death, so they are notably very distinct from the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Western concept of [[God]], although they are very similar to the gods of most European polytheism.

===Asura Domain===
{{Main|Asura (Buddhism)}}
The ''Asura domain'' (also known as ''the Jealous God domain'') is the domain of the Asuras (demigods).  They are here because of actions in past lives based on egotistic jealousy, envy, insincerity, struggle, combat or rationalization of the world.  They may be here because in human form they had good intentions but committed bad actions such as harming others.  The Asuras of some other domains, however, are fully malevolent (such as the corruptor Mara) and can be more closely related to the translation of demon that is sometimes ascribed to them. These evil Asuras can be alternatively referred to as Rakshasas.

The Asuras are said to experience a much more pleasurable life than humans, but they are plagued by envy for the Devas, whom they can see just as animals can see humans.

===Manussa Domain===
{{Main|Human beings in Buddhism}}
The ''{{IAST|Manuṣya}} domain'' (also known as the ''Human domain'') is based on [[passion (emotion)|passion]], [[Interpersonal attraction|desire]], [[doubt]], and [[pride]].

[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] see this domain as the realm of human existence.  Although it may not be the most pleasurable domain to live in, a human rebirth is in fact considered to be by far the most advantageous of all possible rebirths in [[samsara]], because a human rebirth is the only samsaric domain from which one can directly attain [[Bodhi]] (enlightenment), either in the present rebirth (for [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Arhat]]s) or in a future rebirth in a Deva domain (for [[Anagami]]s).  This is because of the unique possibilities that a human rebirth offers: beings in higher domains just choose to enjoy the pleasures of their realms and neglect working towards enlightenment, while beings in lower domains are too busy trying to avoid the suffering and pain of their worlds to give a second thought to liberation.  Humans have just the right balance: enough suffering to motivate them to achieve liberation, but not too much that every moment of their lives is consumed by it.

A human rebirth is considered to have tremendous potential when used correctly, however in most cases humans waste their lifetimes in materialistic pursuits rather than working towards enlightment, and so end up reinforcing their unhelpful emotions, thoughts, and actions, rather than letting go of them. Because of this, it is almost always the case that one descends to a lower domain of rebirth after a human life, rather than immediately going on to another human birth, or going up to a higher domain.

In the lower domains, such as the animal domain, it is a very slow and difficult process to accumulate enough merit to achieve a human rebirth once again, so it may be countless lifetimes before one has another chance.  This means that we should not choose to delay attaining enlightment for a future life, since that may be thousands or even millions of years in the future, but should instead embrace the teachings of the Buddha in our present life, so that we can attain enlightenment here and now.

===Tiryagyoni Domain===
{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}
The ''Tiryagyoni domain'' (alternately spelled ''Tiryag-yoni'' or ''tiracchānayoni'') (also known as the ''Animal domain'') is based on strong mental states of stupidity and prejudice cultivated in a previous life or lives.

[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] believe that this domain is the domain of existence of the nonhuman [[animal]]s on the [[Earth]]. Although humans and animals live in separate domains of existence, they can still see each other because their domains are so close to each other in the vertical cosmology, just like how the Devas and Asuras can see each other despite being in separate domains.

===Preta Domain===
{{Main|Preta}}
The ''Preta domain'' (also known as the ''Hungry Ghost domain'') is a rebirth based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives.

The [[Sentience|sentient]] beings in this domain are known as "[[Preta|hungry ghosts]]". They are constantly extremely hungry and thirsty, but they cannot satisfy these needs. In [[Tibet]]an versions of the [[Bhavacakra]] these beings are drawn with narrow necks and large bellies. This represents the fact that their desires torment them, but they are completely unable to satisfy themselves.

===Naraka Domain===
{{Main|Naraka (Buddhism)}}
The ''Naraka domain'' (also known as the  ''Niraya domain'' or the ''Hell domain'') is a rebirth based on strong states of hatred cultivated in a previous life or lives.

The Buddhist view of Naraka differs significantly from the concept of Hell in most [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions in that those being punished in Naraka are not trapped permanently, but will eventually be released, in contrast to most monotheistic religions which say that Hell is permanent. Exceptions include Judaism and Catholicism, which have a temporary hell domain called [[purgatory]], in which souls are punished and purified of their sins by fire and then continue on their journey to paradise. In Buddhism souls remain in Naraka until their negative [[Karma]] is used up, at which point they are reborn into another domain.

==The Wheel of Life==

The [[Bhavachakra]] or "Wheel of Life" is a popular teaching tool often used in the Indo-Tibetan tradition. It is a kind of diagram which portrays these realms and the mechanism that causes these samsaric rebirths. In this depiction, the realm of the [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] is shown at the top, followed clockwise by the realms of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]], the [[Animals in Buddhism|Animals]], [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]], the [[Preta]]s, and the [[Human beings in Buddhism|Humans]]. Close examination will show that the Buddha is shown as being present in every one of these realms.

==Characteristics==
In [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, there are some sayings reflecting a tradition that the manner of a sentient being's death indicates the world in which it will be reborn.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lianhua33.com/sys6.htm 《生与死——佛教轮回说》]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an018_07.htm#n28 器官捐贈與佛教的生命關懷]&lt;/ref&gt; A common one is in the ''Verses on the Structure of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]]'' (八識規矩補註),&lt;ref&gt;[[Taisho Tripitaka]] no 1865&lt;/ref&gt; reads: "to birth in saints the last body temperature in top of head, to deva in eyes, to human in heart, to hungry ghosts in belly, to animals in knee cap, to the hells-realm in sole of feet." The Tibetan Buddhist text [[Bardo Thodol]] describes further on the experiences to these realms.

[[Taisen Deshimaru]] in his book ''Vrai Zen, Introduction au Shōbōgenzō'' (True Zen, Introduction to [[Shōbōgenzō]]) explains: 
:"In Buddhism, both [[Naraka (Buddhism)|naraka]] (infernal states) and [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] state (angelic states) have not the same sense as in other religions. In [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]s which preceded Buddhism, for example, these states had the same meaning as in Catholicism. Still retains this meaning to some unenlightened Buddhists and can be seen even today buddhic images that resemble the gruesome descriptions of hell and paradise. But a true understanding of Buddhism gives to these states a mood status. Especially in [[Zen]], these states [along with the other four realms and the states of [[Śrāvaka]], [[Pratyekabuddha]], [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] - the [[ten spiritual realms]]] are explained as different stages that are unfolded during the practice of [[zazen]]."

==In yogic practice==
Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Chögyal Namkai Norbu Rinpoche have published literature teaching a "Practice of the Six Lokas" designed to "purify the karmic traces that lead to rebirth in the different realms,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] (2002). ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}} pgs 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the six lokas are also cognate with the principal six chakra system of [[Vajrayana]].

[[File:Substance.JPG|thumb|Classification of the six eternal substances]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Dravya''' ({{lang-hi|द्रव्य}}) is a term used to refer to a substance. According to the [[Jain philosophy]], the universe is made up of six eternal substances: sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]''), space (''[[Ākāśa (Jainism)|ākāśa]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of  Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grimes&gt;Grimes, John (1996). Pp.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The latter five are united as the ''ajiva'' (the non-living). As per the [[Sanskrit]] etymology, ''dravya'' means substances or entity, but it may also mean real or fundamental categories.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt;

Jain philosophers distinguish a substance from a body, or thing, by declaring the former as a simple element or reality while the latter as a compound of one or more substances or atoms. They claim that there can be a partial or total destruction of a body or thing, but no substance can ever be destroyed. {{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=15}}

==Jīva (living entity)==
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
According to [[Jain philosophy]], this universe consists of infinite ''[[jiva]]s'' or souls that are uncreated and always existing. There are two main categories of souls: un-liberated mundane embodied souls that are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this '' [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]] '' due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmic bondage]] and the [[Siddha|liberated souls]] that are free from birth and death. All souls are intrinsically pure but are found in bondage with karma since beginning-less time. A soul has to make efforts to eradicate the karmas attain its true and pure form.

10th-century [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Nemichandra]] describes the soul in ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The sentient substance (soul) is characterized by the function of understanding, is incorporeal, performs [[Karma in Jainism|actions]] (doer), is co-extensive with its own body. It is the enjoyer (of its actions), located in the world of rebirth ([[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]) (or) emancipated '' ([[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]) '' (and) has the intrinsic movement upwards.|''Dravyasaṃgraha'' (2)}}

The qualities of the soul are ''chetana'' (consciousness) and ''upyoga'' (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state and appearing of another state and these are merely the modes of the soul. Thus Jiva with its attributes and modes, roaming in ''samsara'' (universe), may lose its particular form and assume a new one. Again this form may be lost and the original acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar, Prof. A. Chakravarti (2005). verses 16–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ajiva (five non-living entities)==
{{Main|Ajiva}}

=== Pudgala (Matter)===
{{Main|Pudgala}}
Matter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter i.e. ultimate particles. ''Paramāṇu'' or ultimate particle (atoms or sub-atomic particles) is the basic building block of all matter. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the ''paramāṇu'' and ''pudgala'' is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996). p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be created nor destroyed and the total amount of matter in the universe remains the same.

=== Dharma ===
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
''Dharma'' means the principles of Motion that pervade the entire universe. Dharma and Adharma are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without ''Dharma'' motion is not possible. The medium of motion helps matter and the sentient that are prone to motion to move, like water (helps) fish. However, it does not set in motion those that do not move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adharma ===
Without ''adharma'', rest and stability is not possible in the universe. The principle of rest helps matter and the sentient that are liable to stay without moving, like the shade helps travellers. It does not stabilize those that move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Champat Rai Jain]]:{{quote|The necessity of Adharma as the accompanying cause of rest, that is, of cessation of motion will be clearly perceived by any one who will put to himself the question, how jīvas and bodies of matter support themselves when coming to rest from a state of motion. Obviously gravitation will not do, for that is concerned with the determination of the direction which a moving body may take...&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;}}

=== Ākāśa (space) ===
Space is a substance that accommodates the living souls, the matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kāla (time)===
{{Main|Kāla (time)}}
''Kāla'' is a real entity according to Jainism and is said to be the cause of continuity and succession. Champat Rai Jain in his book "''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref name = "key"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=520–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...As a substance which assists other things in performing their ‘temporal’ gyrations, Time can be conceived only in the form of whirling posts. That these whirling posts, as we have called the units of Time, cannot, in any manner, be conceived as parts of the substances that revolve around them, is obvious from the fact that they are necessary for the continuance of all other substances, including souls and atoms of matter which are simple ultimate units, and cannot be imagined as carrying a pin each to revolve upon. Time must, therefore, be considered as a separate substance which assists other substances and things in their movements of continuity.|[[Champat Rai Jain]]}} Jaina philosophers call the substance of Time as ''Niścay'' Time to distinguish it from ''vyavhāra'' (practical) Time which is a measure of duration- hours, days and the like.&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;

==Astikaya==
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|270px|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
Out of the six ''dravyas'', five except time have been described as ''astikayas'', that is, extensions or conglomerates. Since like conglomerates, they have numerous space points, they are described as ''astikaya''. There are innumerable space points in the sentient substance and in the media of motion and rest, and infinite ones in space; in matter they are threefold (i.e. numerable, innumerable and infinite). Time has only one; therefore it is not a conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the corresponding conglomerates or extensions are called—''jivastikaya'' (soul extension or conglomerate), ''pudgalastikaya'' (matter conglomerate), ''dharmastikaya'' (motion conglomerate), ''adharmastikaya'' (rest conglomerate) and ''akastikaya'' (space conglomerates). Together they are called ''pancastikaya'' or the five ''astikayas''.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Sikdar (2001) p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes of Dravya==
These substances have some common attributes or gunas such as:&lt;ref name=nemi&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; J. L. Jaini (1927) p. 4 (of introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Astitva'' (existence): indestructibility; permanence; the capacity by which a substance cannot be destroyed.
*''Vastutva'' (functionality): capacity by which a substance has function.
*''Dravyatva'' (changeability): capacity by which it is always changing in modifications.
*''Prameyatva'' (knowability): capacity by which it is known by someone, or of being the subject-matter of knowledge.
*''Agurulaghutva'' (individuality): capacity by which one attribute or substance does not become another and the substance does not lose the attributes whose grouping forms the substance itself.
*''Pradeshatva'' (spatiality): capacity of having some kind of location in space.

There are some specific attributes that distinguish the dravyas from each other:&lt;ref name="nemi"/&gt;
*''Chetanatva'' (consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common attributes of the class of substances soul or jiva.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''murtatva'' (materiality) are attributes of matter.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common to Motion, Rest, Time and Space.

{{Descartes}}

The '''evil demon''', also known as '''malicious demon'''&lt;ref name="Cottingham 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cottingham | first=John | title=René Descartes: Meditations on First Philosophy with Selections from the Objections and Replies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1996 | isbn=0-521-55818-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''evil genius''',&lt;ref name="Ariew et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ariew | first=Roger | last2=Cress | first2=Donald | title=René Descartes: Meditations, Objections, and Replies | publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. | location=Indianapolis/Cambridge | year=2006 | isbn=0-87220-798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[philosophy]]. In the [[first Meditation|first]] of his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] imagines that an evil [[demon]], of "utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me." This evil demon is imagined to present a complete illusion of an external world, so that Descartes can say, "I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to ensnare my judgement. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things."

Some Cartesian scholars opine that the demon is also [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and thus capable of altering mathematics and the fundamentals of logic, though omnipotence of the evil demon would be contrary to Descartes' hypothesis, as he rebuked accusations of the evil demon having omnipotence.&lt;ref name=Musgrave&gt;{{cite book|title=Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge|author=Alan E. Musgrave|pages=202|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43625-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Janowski&gt;{{cite book|title=Cartesian Theodicy: Descartes' Quest for Certitude|author=Zbigniew Janowski|pages=62–68|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-6127-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of several methods of [[Cartesian doubt|systematic doubt]] that Descartes employs in the ''Meditations.''&lt;ref name=Musgrave /&gt;

==In context==
Prior to the Meditations proper, Descartes gives a synopsis of each Meditation and says of Meditation One that "reasons are provided which give us possible grounds for doubt about all things, especially material things" and that whilst the usefulness of such extensive doubt may not be immediately apparent, "its greatest benefit lies in 
*freeing us from all our preconceived opinions, and 
*providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses. 
The eventual result of this doubt is to 
*make it impossible for us to have any further doubts about what we subsequently discover to be true."

Descartes offers some standard reasons for doubting the reliability of the senses culminating in the dream argument and then extends this with the deceiving God argument. Descartes refers to "the long-standing opinion that there is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am" and suggests that this God may have "brought it about that there is no earth, no sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the same time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as they do now?" Furthermore, this God may have "brought it about that I too go wrong every time I add two and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is imaginable".

After the deceiving God argument Descartes concludes that he is "compelled to admit that there is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not properly be raised". {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It is only after arriving at this conclusion that Descartes introduces the evil demon.

Although Descartes has provided arguments for doubting all his former beliefs he notes that "my habitual opinions keep coming back". It is to deal with this problem that Descartes decides he must do more than just acknowledge that the beliefs are open to doubt and must deceive himself, "by pretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly false and imaginary" and that he shall do this "until the weight of preconceived opinion is counter-balanced and the distorting influence of habit no longer prevents my judgement from perceiving things correctly".

It is to achieve this state of denial that Descartes says he will suppose that "some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me".

The evil demon is also mentioned at the beginning of Meditation Two. Descartes says that if there is "a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me" then he himself must undoubtedly exist for the deceiver can "never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something". A little later he says, "But what shall I now say that I am, when I am supposing that there is some supremely powerful and, if it is permissible to say so, malicious deceiver, who is deliberately trying to trick me in every way he can?"

==The deceiving god==
Some writers, e.g. Williams&lt;ref name="Williams 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Williams | first=Bernard | title=Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry (Routledge Classics | publisher=Routledge | location=Cambridge | year=1996 | isbn=1-138-01918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Musgrave,&lt;ref name="Musgrave 1993"&gt;{{cite book | last=Musgrave | first=Alan | title=Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=0-521-43625-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; make no distinction between the deceiving God and evil demon arguments and regard anything said about the deceiving God as being equivalent to saying something about the evil demon.

Other writers acknowledge that Descartes makes mention of both but then claim they are 'epistemologically equivalent'. Kenny&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kenny | first=Anthony | title=Descartes A Study of his Philosophy | publisher=Random House | location=New York | year=1968 | isbn=0-394-30665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} says, "the two hypotheses do not differ in any respect of epistemological importance... The content of the two hypotheses is the same..." Newman &lt;ref name="Newman 2016"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Newman |first=Lex |editor-last= Zalta|editor-first= Edward|encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Descartes' Epistemology|url= https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|accessdate= 10 July 2017|edition= Winter 2016 |year= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, "Descartes' official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is merely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more general hyperbolic doubt... Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the evil genius... as a kind of mnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature."

If they are epistemologically equivalent then the question arises as to why Descartes temporarily shifted from the deceiving God to the evil demon. It is tempting to think it is because there is a relevant theological difference. In Meditation Three Descartes is going to establish not only that there is a God but that God is not a deceiver. When Descartes first introduces the evil demon he says, "I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon." Kenny says, "The hypothesis of the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} However, at least in Meditation One, Descartes doesn't have a problem in postulating a deceiving God and he rejects the objection that such deception is inconsistent with God's supreme goodness. He says, "if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion cannot be made." This is consistent with what he writes in the ''Principles'' where he says, "we have been told that God who created us can do all that he desires, and we do not yet know whether he may not have willed to create us in such a way that we shall always be deceived even in the things that we think ourselves to know best."

Other writers insist that it is important to maintain the distinction between the deceiving God and the evil demon. Gouhier (quoted by Kenny) argues that the deceiving God is an intellectual scruple that will disappear when metaphysics demonstrates its falsity whilst the evil demon is a methodological procedure designed to make a certain experiment and it ceases with that experiment. He says, "Neither the purpose nor the content of the two hypotheses allow us to regard the one as a variant of the other."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

Vendler argues that literary form of the Meditations is heavily influenced by  St. Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises to which Descartes will have been exposed during his training at the Jesuit college of La Fleche. As such, "The demon in the First Meditation is not evoked to serve as an epistomological menace, but as a psychological device: following Loyola's advice ''age contra!'' (go against!), it provides a counterweight to our inordinate inclination to trust the senses."&lt;ref name="Vendler 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zeno |last=Vendler |title=Descartes' Exercises |journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy |volume=19 |issue=2| date=June 1989 |pages=193–224 |jstor=40231645}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} He adds, "the 'demon-argument' is not an argument at all. Descartes does not need another argument at this stage: the dream argument has already shown the unreliability of the senses and the deceiver-God argument the uncertainty of mathematics. For one thing, the demon does not even touch mathematics or geometry. Why should he? He is evoked by Descartes to cure his inordinate attachment to the senses; he does not complain (and would not) of a similar attachment to mathematics or geometry."&lt;ref name="Vendler 1989" /&gt;{{rp|204}} Hatfield takes a similar line saying, "Descartes adopts a common practice from the spiritual exercises upon which his metaphysical meditations are modelled, devising a program for training the will to keep the old beliefs at bay"&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hatfield | first=Gary | title=Descartes and the Meditations | publisher=Routledge | location=London | year=2003 | isbn=0-415-11193-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} adding, "It seems likely that he chose to call his hypothetical deceiver a "malicious demon" in order to avoid having the meditator concentrate extensively on the thought that God could be a deceiver, a proposition he considered false and one he intended to refute later."&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003" /&gt;{{rp|88}}

==Omnipotence==
{{further|Theodicy|Dystheism}}
Among the accusations of [[blasphemy]] made against Descartes by [[Protestant]]s was that he was positing an omnipotent [[malevolent God]]. [[Voetius]] accused Descartes of blasphemy in 1643.  [[Jacques Triglandius]] and [[Jacobus Revius]], theologians at [[Leiden University]], made similar accusations in 1647, accusing Descartes of "hold[ing] God to be a deceiver", a position that they stated to be "contrary to the glory of God".  Descartes was threatened with having his views condemned by a [[synod]], but this was prevented by the intercession of the [[Prince of Orange]] (at the request of the French Ambassador [[Abel Servien|Servien]]).&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

The accusations referenced a passage in the ''First Meditation'' where Descartes stated that he supposed not an optimal God but rather an evil demon "[[wikt:summe|summe]] [[wikt:potens|potens]] &amp; [[wikt:callidus|callidus]]" (translated as "most highly powerful and cunning").  The accusers identified Descartes' concept of a ''deus deceptor'' with his concept of an evil demon, stating that only an omnipotent God is "summe potens" and that describing the evil demon as such thus demonstrated the identity. Descartes' response to the accusations was that in that passage he had been expressly distinguishing between "the supremely good God, the source of truth, on the one hand, and the malicious demon on the other".  He did not directly rebut the charge of implying that the evil demon was omnipotent, but asserted that simply describing something with "some attribute that in reality belongs only to God" does not mean that that something is being held to actually ''be'' a supreme God.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

According to Janowski, "The alleged distinction between the respective powers of God and the evil genius that escaped the attention of the two theologians also escaped the attention of a host of distinguished Cartesian scholars ([[Ferdinand Alquié|Alquié]], Beck, [[Émile Bréhier|Brehier]], Chevalier, Frankfurt, [[Étienne Gilson|Gilson]], [[Anthony Kenny|Kenny]], Laporte, Kemp-Smith, Wilson), who, only seldom interested in interpreting Descartes' philosophy through the prism of doctrinal orthodoxy, also insist on the omnipotence of the evil genius." &lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|65}} He further claims that the reason for this is that there is progression through the ''First Meditation'', leading to the introduction of the concept of the evil genius "which crowns the process begun at the outset of the Meditations."&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|65}}

However, it is not quite so straightforward. For example, Wilson notes that "Gouhier has shown, the hypothesis of the malign spirit takes  over from that of the Deceiving God from the end of the First Meditation to the beginning of the Third—where the latter figure is resubstituted without comment or explanation. As Gouhier has also noted, the summary of 'doubts' in the concluding passage ... does not include mention of mathematical propositions—which are not again brought into discussion until the Third Meditation."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1960"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Margaret | title=Descartes | publisher=Popular Prakashan Private Ltd | location=Bombay | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} She adds in the accompanying footnote that, even if one has to concede that the text doesn't reveal any sharp distinction between the power hypothetically ascribed to the 'malignant spirit' and that genuinely attributable to God, "Gouhier's observation is essentially accurate, and useful in understanding the rhetoric and organization of the first three Meditations. It may also have some deeper significance, because of the association ... of the possibility of deception in mathematics with the doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1960" /&gt;{{rp|226}}

Similarly, Kenny who does say the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God "simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent. The content of the two hypotheses is the same, namely that an omnipotent deceiver is trying to deceive."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} goes on to note that, "If the two hypostheses differ at all, it is the first that is more skeptical than the second. God...may have made him go wrong in mathematics...the evil genius merely reinforces the doubt that the external world may be a dream."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|36}} When Kenny says the evil genius is simply a substitute for the deceitful God he is not trying to establish that, therefore, the evil genius was omnipotent, instead he is challenging the view that evil genius somehow progressed on from God and is rejecting the view that "the evil genius is to serve a more radically skeptical purpose than the hypothesis of the deceitful God."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

According to Janowski, the fact that the demon is not said to challenge mathematics, implies either that the evil demon is not omnipotent or that Descartes retracted Universal Doubt.  Janowski notes that in the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (I, 15) Descartes states that [[Cartesian doubt|Universal Doubt]] applies even to "the demonstration of mathematics", and so concludes that either Descartes' ''Meditation'' is flawed, lacking a reason for doubting mathematics, or that the charges of blasphemy were well placed, and Descartes ''was'' supposing an omnipotent evil demon.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|67}}

However, this is only a problem if one assumes that Descartes was withdrawing the notion of a deceitful God and replacing it with the evil demon. More recent commentators take the argument to have reached its conclusion with the deceitful God. When Descartes says, "I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon ..."&lt;ref name="Cottingham 1996" /&gt;{{rp|15}} he is not rejecting the notion of a deceitful God on the grounds that God is not a deceiver for this is something he is not entitled to rely on because, as he says at the beginning of Meditation three, he doesn't "yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all". Instead, he is introducing an aid to the meditator who finds that, despite the arguments presented, "habitual opinions keep coming back". Kenny says, "The purpose of taking seriously the hypothesis of the evil genius is to counterbalance natural credulity and keep in mind the doubts raised by the supposition of the deceitful God."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} When the role of the demon is understood this way the issue of the demon's omnipotence becomes unimportant.

==The brain in a vat==
{{Main|Brain in a vat}}
In 1968 James Cornman and Keith Lehrer suggested something they called the braino machine that "operates by influencing the brain of a subject who wears a special cap, called a "braino cap." When the braino cap is placed on a subject's head, the operator of the braino can affect his brain so as to produce any hallucination in the subject that the operator wishes. The braino is a hallucination-producing machine. The hallucinations produced by it may be as complete, systematic, and coherent as the operator of the braino desires to make them."&lt;ref name="Cornman et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornman | first=James | last2=Lehrer | first2=Keith | title=Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction | publisher=The Macmillan Company | location=New York and London | year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} The braino argument was intended to show that, even if it is sometimes possible to tell when we are hallucinating, it is not possible to know that we are not hallucinating. If the braino is operated by an evil being (whom Cornman and Lehrer call Dr. O) then it would be possible for Dr. O to create in me experiences that are identical to the ones I am having now. If that were the case then the experiences so created would not constitute knowledge for the source of those experiences would be the machine and not the world. However, since they are indistinguishable from my current experiences it follows that my current experiences are also insufficient to generate knowledge.

In 1973 in the introduction to his book ''Thought'', Gilbert Harman said, "it might be suggested that you have not the slightest reason to believe that you are in the surroundings you suppose you are in ... various hypotheses could explain how things look and feel. You might be sound asleep and dreaming or a playful brain surgeon might be giving you these experiences by stimulating your cortex in a special way. You might really be stretched out on a table in his laboratory with wires running into your head from a large computer. Perhaps you have always been on that table. Perhaps you are quite a different person from what you seem..."&lt;ref name="Harman 1973"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harman | first=Gilbert | title=Thought | publisher=Princeton University Press | location=Princeton and London | year=1973 | isbn=0-69101-986-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Such scenarios had been used many times in science fiction but in philosophy it is now routine to refer to being like a 'brain in a vat' after Hilary Putnam produced an argument which, ironically, purported to show that "the supposition that we are actually brains in a vat, although it violates no physical law, and is perfectly consistent with everything we have experienced, cannot possibly be true. ''It cannot possibly be true'', because it is, in a certain way, self-refuting."&lt;ref name="Putnam 1981"&gt;{{cite book | last=Putnam | first=Hilary | title=Reason, Truth, and History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1981 | isbn=0-52129-776-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

Putnam's argument notwithstanding, the brain in a vat scenario is usually presented as a sceptical argument and in many ways equivalent to Descartes' deceiving God and evil demon.

One crucial difference that prevents such scenarios being a direct substitute for the deceiving God and evil demon is that they generally presuppose that we have heads or bodies whereas it is important for Descartes to argue that he can doubt the existence of his body and that he can only be sure he is a 'thinking thing'.&lt;ref name="Musgrave 1993" /&gt;{{rp|205}}&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003" /&gt;{{rp|81}} Harman's version of the story does, however, add the final thought that having a brain "might be just part of the myth you are being given".&lt;ref name="Harman 1973" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

'''''Femme nue couchée''''' ({{lang-fr|Nude Reclining Woman}}) is an 1862 painting by French [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877). It depicts a young dark-haired woman reclining on a couch, wearing only a pair of shoes and [[stocking]]s. Behind her, partly drawn red curtains reveal an overcast sky seen through a closed window.  The work is likely influenced by [[Goya]]'s ''[[La maja desnuda]]''.

The painting was initially owned by [[Alexandre Louis Philippe Marie Berthier, 4th Prince de Wagram|Alexandre Berthier]] and later by [[Marcell Nemes]]. In 1913, it was bought by the Hungarian collector [[Ferenc Hatvany]]. At one time, he painted a copy of the painting and, as a practical joke, sent it to be exhibited as the original at a [[Belgrade]] exhibition.&lt;ref name=Akinsha&gt;Akinsha (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the rest of Hatvany's collection, the painting was [[looted art|looted]] from a [[Budapest]] bank vault during the 1945 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] conquest of the city in [[World War II]]. After it was briefly seen attached to the tarpaulin of a Soviet military vehicle on [[Buda Castle]] Hill,&lt;ref name=Akinsha/&gt; the painting appeared to have vanished without a trace.

It surfaced again in 2000 and 2003, when it was offered for sale first to the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and then to the [[Commission for Art Recovery]] (CAR) by a Slovak man claiming to be an antiques dealer, but who appeared to his interlocutors to be involved with the Slovak organised crime scene.&lt;ref name=Akinsha/&gt; The dealer produced an [[affidavit]], judged reliable by the CAR, stating that the painting was given by Soviet soldiers to a doctor from a village near [[Bratislava]] in return for his medical treatment of a wounded soldier.&lt;ref name=Akinsha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichfield (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection of the picture's [[craquelure]] determined that the painting was indeed the original and not Hatvany's copy.

After five years of negotiations, [[Interpol]] involvement and diplomatic wrangling between the US and Slovakian government, the CAR managed to acquire the painting for Hatvany's heirs in exchange for a USD 300,000 reward.&lt;ref name=Akinsha/&gt; It was shown to the public for the first time since the 1930s in a 2007 Courbet exposition at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris. The painting was sold at auction on 9 November 2015 for 15.3 million U.S. dollars, four times the previous auction record for a Courbet painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese billionaire buys Modigliani painting 'Nu Couche' for world record US$170.4 million|author=AFP|publisher=[[The South China Morning Post]]|date=10 November 2015|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1877375/chinese-collector-pays-world-record-us1704-million-modigliani-painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal Information ==

=== Life ===
Gardner LaClede Bishop was a barber and activist remembered for his contributions to the school integration movement in the [[District of Columbia]] in the 1940s and 1950s. He was born on January 20, 1909 in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;  He learned how to express his opinions early on, winning prizes as a high school debater in his home state.  Although he attended a year of college at [[Shaw University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], he did not graduate.  In 1930 he moved to Washington, D.C.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;  He lived east of the [[Anacostia River]] and, like his father, began working as a barber.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;  After challenging the comments of racist customers on multiple occasions, he was fired. Not cowed, he opened B&amp;D Barber Shop at 1515 U Street NW in 1940, which he owned and operated through his retirement in 1985.  His black clientele could get both “a haircut and an earful” from the “barber of U Street.”&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;  He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and was married for 58 years to Thelma Crutchfield Bishop, who died in 1989.  They had three children: Judine Bishop Johnson, Anita Harley, and Gardner L. Bishop Jr.  He died of kidney failure on November 25, 1992 at age 82.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== More Than Just Black and White ===
Bishop focused not only on the inequalities between black schools and white schools, but also on the differences between upper and lower class black schools and attitudes.  He was appalled by the snobbishness of the elite black Washingtonians.  Part of his motivation for organizing a strike at Browne Junior High School came from his rebuffed requests to transfer his daughter to [[Benjamin Banneker Academic High School|Banneker Junior High]].  Middle class black officials informed him that because he was only a barber, his daughter could not go to Banneker, a school meant for the middle class.  This rebuke infuriated Bishop, and fueled his mistrust of some of the activist organizations he saw as furthering the agendas of the upper classes of society, including the [[NAACP]].  Bishop verbalized his sense of frustration and oppression, saying, “We were on the bottom shelf.  I’m black and I’m poor, so I’m segregated twice.”&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

== The Fight Against Segregated Schools ==

=== Overcrowded Schools ===
When Bishop came to the nation’s capital, the public school system was segregated, and the facilities for black children and white children were far from equal.  As the population of the city expanded in the post World War II years, the schools, particularly the black schools, became overcrowded.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;  Between 1930 and 1950 the African American population alone doubled to 280,000 people, about 35% of D.C.’s total population.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;  The shifting demographics of the city, with whites fleeing to the suburbs and the proportion of the black population steadily increasing, led to an unequal distribution of students amongst the available facilities.  Taxes were allocated to fund black schools and white schools based on population statistics collected in the decennial census, so by the end of the 1940s the black schools were receiving far less than their fair share of tax dollars based on the numbers of black children enrolled because of the outdated census data.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

	The situation at Browne Junior High School exemplified the failure of the school system to educate its constituents.  By the late 1940s, Browne was operating at double its intended capacity.  To accommodate the inflated student body, the school adopted a schedule of shifts that resulted in students receiving only 4 and a half hours of schooling per day.  Because the law required that students attend school for a minimum of six hours per day, this restriction was particularly galling to parents.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;   In an attempt to remedy the situation, which many people objected to, the school implemented the use of two abandoned white elementary schools, Blow and Webb. With this plan 1146 students would move between Browne, Blow and Webb to receive a full day of instruction, and the other 680 students would continue with the shortened school day.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;  To make matters worse, nearby white schools were operating under capacity and had plenty of room to accommodate more students.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Consolidated Parents Group ===

Gardner Bishop was unwilling to accept a substandard education for his children.  His oldest daughter, Judine, attended Browne in 1947.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;  He was outraged by the use of schools that whites had abandoned, not to mention the long walks that students had to take in the middle of their school day to move to a different building. Bishop did not see this shifting schedule as an acceptable solution to the overcrowding.  He and other disgruntled parents began holding meetings at Jones Memorial Church to discuss how to present their grievances to the school board.  They eventually became known as the Consolidated Parents Group.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Bishop took charge as the most visible and vocal member of the group, but came to rely on a set of leaders within the group that grew to have hundreds of members. With Bishop as president, there were two vice presidents, Marie W. Smith and Burma Whitted, a secretary, Unity T. Macklin, and a treasurer, James Haley Sr. At one of their first meetings they voted to stage a student “sit-out” to boycott the situation at Browne Junior High School.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;

	The boycott started on December 3, 1947.  For two months, parents of Browne students refused to send their children to school.  They picketed outside the school and the Board of Education offices at the Franklin Administration Building, protesting the insufficient resources being provided for their students.  Eventually, due to pressure from the conservative black community and dwindling support, the boycott partially ended. The students returned to Browne but the boycott of Blow and Webb continued. When the boycott did come to an end on February 3, 1948 the Board of Education began using five school buildings so students would not have to switch buildings and could attend a full day of school.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Bolling v. Sharpe ==
Bishop’s organizational efforts did not stop at Browne.  In 1949, he took a group of black students to the newly opened [[John Philip Sousa Junior High School|Sousa Junior High School]], a school for whites with many amenities.  The students were given a tour, but they were not allowed to enroll.  This incident resulted in a lawsuit, with Spotswood Bolling, one of the students on the tour, as a plaintiff.  The case was later argued in front of the Supreme Court with four other cases as part of the historic [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision.  [[Bolling v. Sharpe]] was unique because it introduced the argument that segregation itself was unconstitutional.  Additionally, the NAACP was not involved in the Bolling case because of Bishop’s continued suspicion of middle class black organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Legacy ==
Bishop’s activism made an impact because his efforts were broad yet focused.  He targeted specific injustices in the school system on a variety of fronts.  The strike made a social statement and allowed people to see the problem up close.  The court case attacked segregation from a legal standpoint, aimed at changing the laws themselves.  In addition, Bishop wrote Letters to the Editor of the Washington Post, on topics including school buildings and high school capacity, putting his arguments into print.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; He was determined to ensure that whites did not become complacent because of the concessions allowed for middle class blacks in the school system.  He worked for the lowest members of society, those whose voices and rights were consistently ignored by the established powers. Although Gardner Bishop was not the most prominent civil rights activist of his time, he serves as a reminder that no matter what background people come from, if they speak their minds and fight for what they believe in they can leave a lasting impact.

'''Grand Comoro day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis''''' &lt;small&gt;[[Harald Meier|Meier]], 1986&lt;/small&gt;) is a small [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[subspecies]] of [[gecko]]s. It lives in the [[Comoros]] and typically inhabits trees and bushes. The Grand Comoro day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm. The body colour is bright green, which may have a blue hue. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout and two red bars between the eyes. On the back there often are a large number of small red-brick coloured dots which may form a faint mid dorsal stripe. The flanks are grey. There is a v-shaped marking on the throat. The ventral side is yellowish white. This lizard also does not have eyelids like all day geckos.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits the island Grand Comoro in the Comoros.

== Habitat ==
''Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis'' inhabits moist forests, palm trees and human dwellings.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar.

== Reproduction ==
At a temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C, the young will hatch after approximately 45 days. The juveniles measure 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between 28 and 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 24 and 26&amp;nbsp;°C at night. The humidity should be around 75&amp;ndash;90%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

'''Gross National Wellness or Well-being''' ('''GNW''') is a socioeconomic development and measurement framework. The GNW / GNH Index consists of 7 dimensions: economic, environmental, physical, mental, work, social, and political. Most wellness areas include both subjective results (via survey) and objective data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/grossnationalhappiness/ "Global GNW / GNH Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192803/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf "National Indicators for a New Era (page 81), Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[https://dugi-doc.udg.edu/bitstream/handle/10256/15117/ortuzar-fernandez.pdf?sequence=1 "Empirical Study of Healthcare and Life Satisfaction in Spain at University De Girona"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
The GNW Index is also known as the first GNH Index or [[Gross National Happiness]] Index, not to be confused with Bhutan's GNH Index. Both econometric frameworks are different in authorship, creation dates, and geographic scope. The GNW / GNH index is a global development measurement framework published in 2005 by the International Institute of Management in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;H A Hellyer, [http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter "UAE National Newspaper on Happiness Ministry Background"].&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=20R9_6rC-LoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=GNH "Ecological Economics Book - page 274"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gross National Happiness]] phrase was coined in 1972 by [[Sicco Mansholt]], one of the founders of the [[European Union]] and the fourth President of the [[European Commission]], and was later popularized by [[Bhutan]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-gnh-origin.htm "The Origin of Gross National Happiness - The European GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no GNH Index existed until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness "The History of Gross National Happiness, Professor Monica Correa, Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNH philosophy suggested that the ideal purpose of governments is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness and the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/papers/mcdonald.pdf "McDonald, Ross (2005). "Rethinking Development. Local Pathways to Global Wellbeing". St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. p. 3."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of economic policies on the subjective well-being of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/bitstream/10071/13633/1/HappinessSeekingThesis_AnaRodrigues.pdf  Selling Happiness - Lisbon University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index paper proposed the first GNH Index as a solution to help with the implementation of the GHN philosophy and was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political mission statement into a second generation implementation holistic (objective and subjective) concept and by treating happiness as a socioeconomic development metric that word provide an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrates subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-research-library/happiness-economics-history-milestones-timeline.htm "Happiness Economics Timeline and Milestones - GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316091499_A_Modern_History_of_Happiness_as_Economic_Policy "A Modern History of Happiness as Economic Policy Dr Deidre Rose, University of Guelph"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index is a secular econometric model that tracks 7 subjective and objective development areas with no religious measurement components. On the other hand, Bhutan's GNH Index is a local development framework and measurement index, published by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH Research|Centre for Bhutan Studies]] in 2012 based on 2011 Index function designed by Alkire-Foster at [[Oxford University]]. The Bhutan's GNH Index is customized to the country's Buddhist cultural and spiritual values, it tracks 9 subjective happiness areas including spiritual measurement such as prayers recitation and other Karma indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|author1=Karma Ura|author2=Sabina Alkire|author3=Tshoki Zangmo|author4=Karma Wangdi|title=A Short Summary of Bhutan GNH Index|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|year=2012|isbn=978-99936-14-66-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and issues at the heart of Bhutanese approach are similar to the secular GNH Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSy7Ubd-PX8C&amp;pg=PA31|author=Alastair Campbell|title=The Happy Depressive: In Pursuit of Personal and Political Happiness|publisher=Arrow Books|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a policy white paper providing recommendations for implementing the GNW Index metric was published by the International Institute of Management. The paper is widely referenced by academic and policy maker citing the GNW / GNH index as a potential model for local socioeconomic development and measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medjones.com/happiness-economics-gross-national-wellbeing-happiness-index.htm "Happiness Economics - GNH Index Research Citations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==GNW survey components==
The subjective survey part of the GNW measurement system is structured into seven areas or dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/polls/GrossNationalHappinessSurvey.htm "The Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey - Global GNH Index Survey"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Each area or dimension satisfaction rating is scaled from 0–10: 0 being very dissatisfied, 5 being neutral, and 10 is very satisfied.

#Mental &amp; Emotional Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Frequency and levels of positive vs. negative thoughts and feelings over the past year
#Physical &amp; Health Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Physical safety and health, including risk to life, body and property and the cost and quality of healthcare, if one gets sick
#Work &amp; Income Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Job and income to support essential living expenses, including shelter, food, transportation, and education. If a head of household, the expenses to support household/family is included
#Social Relations Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Relations with the significant other, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and community
#Economic &amp; Retirement Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Disposable (extra) income, which is the remaining money after paying for essential living expenses. This money can be used for leisure activities, retirement savings, investments, or charity.
#Political &amp; Government Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Political rights, privacy and personal freedom as well the performance of the government (including socioeconomic development policies effectiveness and efficiency) 
#Living Environment Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;City/urban planning, utilities, infrastructure, traffic, architecture, landscaping and nature's pollution (including noise, air, water, and soil)

The survey also asks four qualitative questions to identify key causes of happiness and unhappiness:

#What are the top positive things in your life that make you happy?
#What are the top challenges and causes of stress in your life?
#What would you advise your government to increase your well-being and happiness?
#What are the most influential city, state, federal or international projects? How are they impacting your well-being and happiness (positively or negatively)?

==Criticism==
One major criticism is that the use of subjective surveys can lead to unreliable conclusions{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">'''Hypostasis''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὑπόστασις) is the underlying state or underlying substance and is the fundamental [[reality]] that supports all else. In [[Neoplatonism]] the hypostasis of the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]'') and "[[Monad (philosophy)|the one]]" was addressed by [[Plotinus]].

In [[Christian theology]], a ''hypostasis'' is one of the three ''hypostases'' (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=ERwin543&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Jan Milic Lochman and John Mbiti (February 1, 2008) {{ISBN|080282417X}} page 543&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
[[Pseudo-Aristotle]] used ''hypostasis'' in the sense of [[Matter|material substance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Aristotle]], ''[[De mundo]]'', 4.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles, or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For [[Plotinus]], these are: [[wikt:psyche#English|the Soul]], [[Nous|the Intellect]], and [[Henology|the One]]  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Plotinus?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3237626.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Paula&gt;''Neoplatonism (Ancient Philosophies)'' by Pauliina Remes (2008), University of California Press {{ISBN|0520258347}}, pages 48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian theology==
{{see also|Trinity|Hypostatic union}}
In [[early Christian]] writings, hypostasis is used to denote "being" or "substantive reality" and is not always distinguished in meaning from ''[[ousia]]'' ('essence' or 'substance'). It was used in this way by [[Tatian]] and [[Origen]], and also in the [[anathema]]s appended to the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.

===Trinitarian definitions===
{{one source|section|date=July 2015}}
It was mainly under the influence of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] that the terminology was clarified and standardized so that the formula "three hypostases in one ousia" came to be accepted as an epitome of the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;ref name="González 1987 307"&gt;{{cite book|last=González|first=Justo L.|title=A History of Christian Thought: From the Beginnings to the Council of Chalcedon|date=1987|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville, TN|isbn=0-687-17182-2|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Basil of Caesarea]] argues that the two terms are not synonymous and that they, therefore, are not to be used indiscriminately in referring to the godhead. He writes:
{{quote|The distinction between ''ousia'' and ''hypostases'' is the same as that between the general and the particular; as, for instance, between the animal and the particular man. Wherefore, in the case of the Godhead, we confess one essence or substance so as not to give variant definition of existence, but we confess a particular hypostasis, in order that our conception of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit may be without confusion and clear.&lt;ref name="González 1987 307"/&gt;}}

This consensus, however, was not achieved without some confusion at first in the minds of Western theologians since in the West the vocabulary was different. Many Latin-speaking theologians understood ''hypo-stasis'' as "sub-stantia" (substance); thus when speaking of three "hypostases" in the [[Godhead in Christianity|godhead]], they might suspect three "substances" or [[tritheism]]. However, from the middle of the fifth century onwards, marked by [[Council of Chalcedon]], the word came to be contrasted with ''ousia'' and used to mean "individual reality," especially in the trinitarian and [[Christological]] contexts. The Christian concept of the Trinity is often described as being [[monotheism|one god]] existing in three distinct ''hypostases/personae/persons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=González|first=Justo L|authorlink=Justo L.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
In [[computer science]], '''information hiding''' is the principle of segregation of the ''design decisions'' in a [[computer program]] that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed. The protection involves providing a stable [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] which protects the remainder of the program from the implementation (the details that are most likely to change).

Written another way, information hiding is the ability to prevent certain aspects of a [[Class (computer science)|class]] or [[software component]] from being accessible to its [[Client (computing)|client]]s, using either programming language features (like private variables) or an explicit exporting policy.

== Overview ==

The term ''encapsulation'' is often used interchangeably with information hiding. Not all agree on the distinctions between the two though; one may think of information hiding as being the principle and encapsulation being the technique.  A software module hides information by encapsulating the information into a module or other construct which presents an interface.&lt;ref name="not_encaps"&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2001/jw-0518-encapsulation.html
| title = Encapsulation is not information hiding 
| publisher=[[JavaWorld]]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A common use of information hiding is to hide the physical storage layout for data so that if it is changed, the change is restricted to a small subset of the total program.  For example, if a three-dimensional point (''x'',''y'',''z'') is represented in a program with three [[floating point]] [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] variables and later, the representation is changed to a single [[Array data structure|array]] variable of size three, a module designed with information hiding in mind would protect the remainder of the program from such a change.

In [[object-oriented programming]], information hiding (by way of [[Nesting (computing)|nesting]] of types) reduces software development risk by shifting the code's [[Dependency (computer science)|dependency]] on an uncertain implementation (design decision) onto a well-defined [[Interface (computer science)|interface]].  Clients of the interface perform operations purely through it so if the implementation changes, the clients do not have to change.

== Encapsulation ==
{{see also|Encapsulation (computer programming)}}

In his book on [[object-oriented design]], [[Grady Booch]] defined encapsulation as "the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and its implementation."&lt;ref name=Booch&gt;Grady Booch, ''Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications'', . Addison-Wesley, 2007, {{ISBN|0-201-89551-X}}, p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose is to achieve potential for change: the internal mechanisms of the component can be improved without impact on other components, or the component can be replaced with a different one that supports the same public interface. Encapsulation also protects the integrity of the component, by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state. Another benefit of encapsulation is that it reduces system complexity and thus increases robustness, by limiting the interdependencies between software components.&lt;ref name=Booch/&gt;

In this sense, the idea of encapsulation is more general than how it is applied in OOP: for example, a relational database is encapsulated in the sense that its only public interface is a [[Query language]] ([[SQL]] for example), which hides all the internal machinery and data structures of the database management system. As such, encapsulation is a core principle of good software architecture, at every level of granularity.

Encapsulating software behind an interface allows the construction of objects that mimic the behavior and interactions of objects in the real world. For example, a simple digital alarm clock is a real-world object that a [[lay person]] can use and understand.  They can understand what the alarm clock does, and how to use it through the provided interface (buttons and screen), without having to understand every part inside of the clock.  Similarly, if the clock were replaced by a different model, the lay person could continue to use it in the same way, provided that the interface works the same.

In the more concrete setting of an object-oriented programming language, the notion is used to mean either an information hiding mechanism, a bundling mechanism, or the combination of the two. (See [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)]] for details.)

The concept of information hiding was first described by [[David Parnas]] in {{harvtxt|Parnas|1972}}.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=173}} Before then, modularity was discussed by Richard Gauthier and Stephen Pont in their 1970 book ''Designing Systems Programs'' although [[modular programming]] itself had been used at many commercial sites for many years previously – especially in [[I/O]] [[sub-system]]s and [[software library|software libraries]] – without acquiring the 'information hiding' tag – but for similar reasons, as well as the more obvious [[code reuse]] reason.

== Example of information hiding ==
Information hiding serves as an effective criterion for dividing any piece of equipment, software or hardware, into modules of functionality.  For instance, a car is a complex piece of equipment.  In order to make the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of a car reasonable, the complex piece of equipment is divided into [[module (programming)|modules]] with particular interfaces hiding design decisions.  By designing a car in this fashion, a car manufacturer can also offer various options while still having a vehicle which is economical to manufacture.

For instance, a car manufacturer may have a luxury version of the car as well as a standard version.  The luxury version comes with a more powerful engine than the standard version.  The [[engineer]]s designing the two different car engines, one for the luxury version and one for the standard version, provide the same interface for both engines.  Both engines fit into the engine bay of the car which is the same between both versions.  Both engines fit the same transmission, the same engine mounts, and the same controls.  The differences in the engines are that the more powerful luxury version has a larger displacement with a fuel injection system that is programmed to provide the fuel air mixture that the larger displacement engine requires.

In addition to the more powerful engine, the luxury version may also offer other options such as a better radio with CD player, more comfortable seats, a better suspension system with wider tires, and different paint colors.  With all of these changes, most of the car is the same between the standard version and the luxury version.  The radio with CD player is a module which replaces the standard radio, also a module, in the luxury model.  The more comfortable seats are installed into the same seat mounts as the standard types of seats.  Whether the seats are leather or plastic, or offer lumbar support or not, doesn't matter.

The engineers design the car by dividing the task up into pieces of work which are assigned to teams.  Each team then designs their [[software componentry|component]] to a particular standard or interface which allows the team flexibility in the design of the component while at the same time ensuring that all of the components will fit together.

Motor vehicle manufacturers frequently use the same core structure for several different models, in part as a cost-control measure. Such a "[[automobile platform|platform]]" also provides an example of information hiding, since the floorplan can be built without knowing whether it is to be used in a sedan or a hatchback.

As can be seen by this example, information hiding provides flexibility. This flexibility allows a programmer to modify the functionality of a computer program during normal evolution as the computer program is changed to better fit the needs of users.  When a computer program is well designed decomposing the source code solution into modules using the principle of information hiding, evolutionary changes are much easier because the changes typically are local rather than global changes.

Cars provide another example of this in how they interface with drivers. They present a standard interface (pedals, wheel, shifter, signals, gauges, etc.) on which people are trained and licensed. Thus, people only have to learn to drive a car; they don't need to learn a completely different way of driving every time they drive a new model. (Granted, there are manual and automatic transmissions and other such differences, but on the whole, cars maintain a unified interface.)

[[File:1984 Social Classes alt.svg|thumb|The Inner Party makes up just 2% of the population.]]

In the world of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] is split into three "classes": the '''Inner Party''', the [[Outer Party]] and the [[proles]]. The Inner Party generally regulates [[Ingsoc]] and the Thought Police, and keeps all Outer Party members under close supervision through technologies like telescreen, while the proles live in extremely depressed, but unmonitored conditions.

==Living conditions==

The Inner Party represents the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] political class in Oceania. It is generally represented by [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. Inner Party members enjoy a quality of life that is much better than that of the Outer Party members and the proles. The [[telescreen]]s in their homes can ostensibly be turned off indefinitely (although O'Brien tells Winston and Julia it is unwise to turn it off more than 30 minutes at a time); however, this revelation may be a lie to Winston and Julia, as conversations they had after [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] turned off his telescreen were later played back to them anyway. 

Inner Party members also have access to spacious living quarters, personal servants, private motor vehicles (motor vehicles are highly restricted and not allowed to Outer Party or Proles), and high quality food, drink and consumer goods in contrast to the low quality [[gin]], synthetic coffee and improperly manufactured cigarettes consumed by the Outer Party and the Proles. Inner Party members have access to wine, as well as real coffee, tea, sugar, milk and well-made cigarettes. Inner Party neighbourhoods are kept clean and presentable, compared to [[Outer Party]] and [[Proles|Prole]] neighbourhoods.

Prospective members of the Inner Party are selected at a young age according to a series of tests; racial origin and family heritage are of no importance in this process as long as their loyalty is proven. Goldstein's book states that a child born to Inner Party parents is not automatically born into the Inner Party and that all racial groups in Oceania, including "[[Jews]], [[negro]]es and South Americans of pure [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] blood" are represented in the ranks. Visually, Inner Party members are always identifiable in public by their black jumpsuits. No Outer Party member or Prole may venture into Inner Party neighbourhoods without permission from an Inner Party member. 

In the novel, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] is the only character Winston meets who is a member of the Inner Party.

[[Goldstein's book]] explains the rationale behind the class divisions in Oceania, but the book is found to be made by an Inner Party committee that O'Brien was a part of.

{{quantum field theory}}
A '''gauge theory''' is a type of [[Scientific theory|theory]] in [[physics]]. The word '''gauge''' means a [[Measurement|measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance, (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of "color" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.

For example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' ("voltage") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.&lt;ref&gt;For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, '''The Feynman Lectures''', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.

With the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].

==History and importance==

The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864–65, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  ("[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in year 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or "gauge" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), "Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativitíatstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriyasu1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Moriyasu|title=An Elementary Primer for Gauge Theory|year=1983|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9971-950-83-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5, 12}}  Although Weyl's choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name "gauge" stuck to the approach.  After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, "Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments," ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1–22, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang–Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.

The importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.

==In classical physics==

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Gauge fixing}}
Historically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.

Generalizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.

Gauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and destroying it released ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V+C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]

===General relativity===
As discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"&gt;[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.

====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====
Some global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.

Suppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.

Recalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.

In other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====
In Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only "relative" in the global sense of translations like &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+C&lt;/math&gt;, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.

Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.

==In quantum mechanics==

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.

===Aharonov–Bohm experiment===
[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]

{{Main|Aharonov–Bohm effect}}
In quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.

But now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −''eV'' added to it, where −''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]

====Explanation with potentials====
It is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.

====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====
Note that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

===Summary===
In summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.

===Types of gauge symmetries===
The description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0≤θ&lt;360°, we force it to "wrap around" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5° is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365°. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the "wrap-around" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.

In mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). "Abelian" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that θ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;θ. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely "0". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.

[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]
As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.

In 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.

===Gauge bosons===
Surprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(''x''), where an angle θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.

Again there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(''x''). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.

Although the function θ(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term "boson" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4911">{{other uses|Judgment (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''judgment''' (or '''judgement''') or '''assertion''' is a statement or enunciation in the [[metalanguage]]. For example, typical judgments in [[first-order logic]] would be ''that a string is a [[well-formed formula]]'', or ''that a proposition is true''. Similarly, a judgment may assert the occurrence of a [[free variable]] in an expression of the object language, or the provability of a [[proposition]]. In general, a judgment may be any inductively definable assertion in the [[metatheory]].

Judgments are used in formalizing [[Formal system|deduction systems]]: a [[logical axiom]] expresses a judgment, premises of a [[rule of inference]] are formed as a [[sequence]] of judgments, and their conclusion is a judgment as well (thus, hypotheses and conclusions of proofs are judgments). A characteristic feature of the variants of [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s is that the ''context'' is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]] contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the [[Logical consequence|derivability]] of [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]], not hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert-style deduction system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form. The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems: as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences, they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided—not even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies.

This basic diversity among the various calculi allows such difference, that the same basic thought (e.g. [[deduction theorem]]) must be proven as a [[metatheorem]] in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]], while it can be declared explicitly as a [[rule of inference]] in [[natural deduction]].

In [[type theory]], some analogous notions are used as in [[mathematical logic]] (giving rise to connections between the two fields, e.g. [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]). The abstraction in the notion of ''judgment'' in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well.

==Logical assertion==
In [[logic]], '''logical assertion''' is a statement that [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|asserts]] that a certain [[premise]] is true, and is useful for statements in proof. It is equivalent to a [[sequent]] with an empty [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]].

For example, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"''x''&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;even", the implication
:&lt;math&gt; (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0)&lt;/math&gt;
is thus true. We can also write this using the logical [[Turnstile (symbol)|assertion symbol]], as
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash \left( (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In computer programming and [[Semantics (computer science)|programming language semantics]], these are used in the form of [[assertion (computing)|assertions]]; one example is a [[loop invariant]].

'''Knowledge of human nature''' is the ability to correctly assess the [[behavior]] or [[Moral character|character]] of people based on a [[first impression (psychology)|first impression]], and to gauge how they think and predict how they will act.

[[Experience|Life experience]], [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[intelligence]], and [[wisdom]] are the decisive factors which contribute to this ability. Knowledge of [[human nature]]  is not innate, but is acquired through frequent contact with people and experience with many different people.

Knowledge of human nature can be used to judge people correctly, to motivate them, to give other people good advice, to deepen relationships, etc. However, it can also be used to exploit people to one's own advantage, for example, if one wants to persuade people, to seduce them, or to sell them something.

There are numerous models for the theoretical acquisition of knowledge of human nature, such as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] or the [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]].

{{main|Equity (law)}}
'''Maxims of equity''' are [[legal maxim]]s that serve as a set of general [[principles of law|principles]] or rules which are said to govern the way in which [[Equity (law)|equity]] operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of [[Equity (law)|equity]], in contrast to the [[common law]], as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the [[Party (law)|parties’]] conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English [[Court of Chancery]] and other courts that administer [[Equity (law)|equity]] jurisdiction, including the [[English trusts law|law of trusts]]. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity' or 'the equitable maxims', it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trusts and Equity|first1=Richard|last1= Edwards|first2= Nigel|last2= Stockwell|year= 2005|publisher=Pearson Education|edition=7|pages=34|isbn=1-4058-1227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/assets/hip/gb/uploads/M02_EDWA3458_10_SE_C02.pdf. - The maxims of equity&lt;/ref&gt; Like other kinds of [[legal maxim]]s or [[principles of law|principles]], they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.

==Role of maxims==
Maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules, but are, rather, general principles which can be deviated from in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;See J Martin, ''Hanbury and Martin's Modern Equity'' (19th edn Sweet and Maxwell 2012) 1-024&lt;/ref&gt; Snell's ''Equity'', an English treatise, takes the view that the "Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: '[[#Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy|Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy]]' and '[[#Equity acts in personam   or persons|Equity acts on the person]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  25 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= Megarry|first2=R.E.|last3=Baker|first3= P.V. |year= 1960|publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London|ol=21567635M |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of maxims==
===Equity sees that as done what ought to be done===
Sometimes phrased as "equity regards as done what should have been done", this maxim means that when individuals are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of [[equitable conversion]].

The consequences of this maxim, and of equitable conversion, are significant in their bearing on the [[risk of loss]] in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of [[Realty|real property]], the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed.

Due to his [[equitable interest]] in the outcome of the transaction, the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the [[equitable remedy]] of [[specific performance]] (although not always, see below).  If he is successful in seeking a remedy at law, he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated.

The fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in [[escrow]].

Problems may sometimes arise because, through some lapse or omission, insurance coverage is not in force at the time a claim is made. If the policyholder has clearly been at fault in this connection, because, for example, he has not paid premiums when he should have, then it will normally be quite reasonable for an insurer to decline to meet the claim. However, it gets more difficult if the policyholder is no more at fault than the insurer. The fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done. In other words, what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done?

Thus, we know in one case, premiums on a [[life insurance]] policy were overdue. The insurer's letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder, who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed. It was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder, he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force, because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future. Since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage, regardless of his physical condition, the insurer (with some persuasion from the Bureau) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so. In other words, his widow was entitled to the sum assured less the outstanding premium. In other similar cases, however, it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed.

Another illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with [[motor vehicle insurance]]. A policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a "no claims" discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at what would have happened if the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.

===Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy===
When seeking an equitable relief, the one that has been wronged has the stronger hand. The stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a [[legal remedy]] (judicial relief). In equity, this form of remedy is usually one of [[specific performance]] or an [[injunction]] (injunctive relief). These are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as [[damages]]. The [[Latin]] [[legal maxim]] is ''ubi jus ibi remedium'' ("where there is a wrong, there must be a remedy"), sometimes cited as '''''ubi jus ibi remediam'''''.

The maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and cannot be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a [[jurisdiction]] hitherto unknown, and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force.

[[Case law]] dealing with the principle of this maxim at law include ''[[Ashby v White]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ashby v White]]'' (1703) 92 ER 126&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'', {{ussc|403|388|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this principle at law was key in the decision of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was necessary to establish that [[William Marbury|Marbury]] had a right to his commission in the first place in order for [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] to make his more wide-ranging decision.

===Equity delights in equality/Equality is equity (''Aequalitus est quasi equitas'')===


Where two persons have an equal right, the property will be divided equally. 

This maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of Equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines. The maxim is of very wide application. The rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other. But, the court of equity where it can, put the litigating parties on a footing of equality. Equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible, be equalized among all interested.
In the Simple Word's then Two parties have equal Rights in any of property so the same was distributed equal as per their concerned Law.

===One who seeks equity must do equity===
To receive [[equitable relief]], the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well. The applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant. This maxim may also overlap with the [[#One who comes into equity must come with clean hands|clean hands maxim]] (see below).

===Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent===
''Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit''.

A person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights. Otherwise, they are guilty of [[Laches (equity)|laches]], an untoward delay in litigation with the presumed intent of denying claims.  This differs from a [[statute of limitations]], in that a delay is particularized to individual situations, rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time.  In addition, even where a limitation period has not yet run, laches may still occur.  The equitable rule of laches and acquiescence was first introduced in ''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]'' (1910) 1 N.L.R 130 at 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives:
*Delay defeats equity
*Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights

===Equity imputes an intent to fulfill an obligation===
Generally speaking, near performance of a general [[obligation]] will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance, such as in the exercise of an option. Text writers give an example of a [[debtor]] leaving a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to his [[creditor]] equal to or greater than his obligation. Equity regards such a [[gift]] as performance of the obligation so the creditor cannot claim both the legacy and payment of the [[debt]].
  
Where a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another, his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act. A claimant who has undertaken an obligation, will, through his later conduct be interpreted as fulfilment of that obligation.

===Equity acts ''in personam'' (i.e. on persons rather than on objects)===
In England, there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court. Courts of law had jurisdiction over [[in rem|property]] as well as [[in personam|persons]] and their coercive power arose out of their ability to adjust ownership rights. Courts of equity had power over [[in personam|persons]]. Their coercive power arose from the ability, on authority of the crown, to hold a violator in [[Contempt of court|contempt]], and take away his or her freedom (or money) until he or she purged himself or herself of his or her contumacious behavior. This distinction helped preserve a separation of powers between the two courts.

Nevertheless, courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a "property interest". This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This does not mean that the courts of equity had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.

===Equity abhors a forfeiture===
Today, a mortgagor refers to his interest in the property as his "equity". The origin of the concept, however, was actually a mirror-image of the current practice.

At [[common law]], a [[mortgage]] was a [[conveyancing|conveyance]] of the [[property]], with a [[condition subsequent]], that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the "law" day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors would be unable to pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the [[secured debt]] with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of [[laches (equity)|laches]], saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including [[equitable estoppel]], were used to bar redemption as well.

This unsettling system had a negative impact on the willingness of lenders to accept real estate as collateral security for loans. Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of real estate collateral was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, [[Title (property)|title]] and [[equity of redemption]] in and to the mortgaged premises.

To complete the circle, one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due, and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage, requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness, the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment(s) and have the mortgage reinstated. In ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'', 254 NY 1 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New York Court of Appeals]] observed that in such a case, there was no forfeiture, only the operation of a clause fair on its face, to which the mortgagor had freely assented. In the latter 20th Century, New York's lower courts eroded the ''Graf'' doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law, and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so. Of course, now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie...and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'' have been accompanied by the rise of [[arbitration]] as a means for enforcing mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne, ''Real Estate Finance Law'' (West, 1979), Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity does not require an idle gesture===
Also: Equity will not compel a court to do a vain and useless thing. It would be an idle gesture for the court to grant [[reformation of a contract]] and then to deny to the prevailing party an opportunity to perform it as modified.

===He who comes into equity must come with clean hands===
It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with [[Unclean hands|clean hands]] (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII| |court=UKHL |year=1993 |num=3 |litigants=Tinsley v Milligan |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.

However, the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a "bad person" cannot obtain the aid of equity. "Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loughran v. Loughran]]'', {{ussc|292|216|1934|pin=229}}, ([[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis, J.]])&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of unclean hands only applies if there is a nexus between the applicant's wrongful act and the rights he wishes to enforce.

In ''[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]] |year=1965 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a small building firm did some work on the house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300.&lt;ref&gt; Mrs Rees: "My husband will pay you £300. It is all you'll get. It is to be in satisfaction".&lt;/ref&gt;  As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 "in completion of the account". The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of [[equitable estoppel|promissory estoppel]],&lt;ref&gt;Promissory estoppel was established by Denning J in ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 130.&lt;/ref&gt; which can make promises binding even when unsupported by consideration. However, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] refused to apply the doctrine, on the grounds that the Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders' financial difficulties, and therefore had not come "with clean hands".

===Equity delights to do justice and not by halves===
When a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the plaintiff ''also'' sustained monetary damages, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages. Hence equity does not stop at granting equitable relief, but goes on to render a full and complete collection of remedies.

===Equity will take jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of suits===
Thus, "where a court of equity has all the parties before it, it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burnworth v. Hughes]]'', {{West|P|670|2|917|Kan.|1983|922}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basis for the procedures of [[interpleader]], [[class action]], and the more rarely used [[Bill of Peace]].

===Equity follows the law===
This maxim, also expressed as ''Aequitas sequitur legem'', means more fully that "equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law."

The [[Court of Chancery]] never claimed to override the courts of common law. [[Joseph Story|Story]] states "where a rule, either of the common or the statute law is direct, and governs the case with all its circumstances, or the particular point, a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law, and can as little justify a departure from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Story|first1=Joseph|last2=Randell|first2=Alfred Edward
|title=Story on Equity''|edition= third English|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year= 1920 |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmund Henry Turner Snell]],  “It is only when there is some important circumstance disregarded by the common law rules that equity interferes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  20 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= |first2= |last3=|first3=|year=1929 |publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London
|ol= |page=24}} quoted in Williams, James (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Yc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 ''The Statute of Frauds''], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo]] wrote in his dissent in ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corporation]]'', 254 N.Y 1 at 9 (1930), "Equity works as a supplement for law and does not supersede the prevailing law."

[[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] says, “We ought not to think of common law and equity as of two rival systems."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland, Frederic William (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 ''Equity; Also the Forms of Action at Common Law: Two Courses of Lectures''], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; "Equity [[Matthew 5:17|had come not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it]]. [[Matthew 5:18|Every jot and every title]] of law was to be obeyed, but when all this had been done yet something might be needful, something that equity would require."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland (1932), p. 17. {{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path.  Equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective, in those cases, equity provides equitable right and remedies.

In the Province of Ontario, Canada, instead of equity following the law, the law follows equity – as per the Ontario Courts of Justice Act:

(2) ''Where a rule of equity conflicts with a rule of the common law, the rule of equity prevails.'' R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 96 (2); 1993, c. 27, Sched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c43#BK132|title=Law Document English View|date=2014-07-24|newspaper=Ontario.ca|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity will not assist a volunteer ===
A volunteer is defined in equity as one who has not offered [[consideration]] for a benefit they have received or expect to receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary 2nd ed|last=Mann|first=Trischa|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780195518511|location=Australia|pages=756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person A expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person B, but person B dies before writing this into their will, person A, having not made any contribution to person B, will not be able to seek equity's aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1990|litigants=Corin v Patton |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 540 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This maxim is very important in restitution. [[Restitution]] developed as a series of writs called special [[assumpsit]], which were later additions in the courts of law, and were more flexible tools of recovery, based on equity. Restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another (such as giving money or providing services) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable.

However, pursuant to the equitable maxim, restitution does not allow a volunteer or "officious intermeddler" to recover. 

Those successfully pleading benefit from an [[estoppel]] (promise relied on to their detriment) will not be considered volunteers for the purpose of this maxim.

===Where equities are equal, the law will prevail===
Equity will provide no specific remedies where the parties' causes are to be seen to be equal, or where neither has been wronged.

The significance of this maxim is that applicants to the [[chancellor]]s often did so because of the formal [[pleading]] of the law courts, and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants. Law courts and legislature, as lawmakers, through the limits of the substantive law they had created, thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct, and private ordering of disputes. Equity could alter that status quo, ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief, or legal defences. But courts applying equity are reluctant to do so. This maxim reflects this. If the law firmly denied a [[cause of action]] or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal, equity would provide no relief; if the law did provide relief, then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal, rather than equitable action. This maxim overlaps with the previously mentioned "[[#Equity follows the law|equity follows the law]]."

===Between equal equities the first in order of time shall prevail===
This maxim operates where there are two or more competing equitable interests; when two equities are equal the original interest (i.e., the first in time) will succeed.

===Equity will not complete an imperfect gift===
If a donor has made an imperfect [[gift]], i.e. lacking the formalities required at [[common law]], equity will not assist the intended [[donee]]. This maxim is a subset of [[#Equity will not aid a volunteer|equity will not assist a volunteer]] .

Note the exception in ''[[Strong v Bird]]'' (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the imperfect gift.

===Equity will not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud===
Equity prevents a party from relying upon an absence of a [[statutory]] formality if to do so would be [[unconscionable]] and unfair. This can occur in [[secret trust]]s, [[constructive trust]]s etc.

===Equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee===
If there is no [[trustee]], whoever has legal [[title (property)|title]] to the [[trust (law)|trust]] [[property]] will be considered the trustee. Otherwise, a court may appoint a trustee.  In Ireland, the trustee may be any administrator of a [[charitable organization|charity]] to which the trust is related.

===Equity regards the beneficiary as the true owner===
Due to limits in old [[Common Law]], no remedy was had for beneficiaries if, for example, a [[trustee]] ran off with the trust [[property]]. To remedy this and protect intended recipients of trust property, Equity regarded the beneficiary as the true (eventual) owners of the [[trust (law)|trust]] property.

[[File:Mit Borrás. Mother Machine. Installation view at Exgirlfriend Gallery. Berlin 2018.jpg|thumb|Mit Borrás. Mother Machine. Installation view at Exgirlfriend Gallery. Belrin 2018 © Mit Borrás]]
'''Mit Borrás''' ([[Madrid]] *[[1982]]) is a Spanish artist. 

He received his BFA in Madrid, Spain and specialization in Art and Cultural Studies in Berlin, ([[Germany]]). He developed his research on Media Art at the Twente University in [[Enschede]], (the [[Netherlands]]) (2006) where he participated intensely in the Dutch contemporary art scene. He relocated back to [[Madrid]]  where he oversees the production of video art festivals while also carrying out projects as an independent curator. In 2010 he moved to [[Berlin]]  to participate in the Glogauair Residency&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glogauair.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and co-directed Fünf Galerie together with Rachel Lamot&lt;ref&gt;http://rachellamot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. He has worked as a coordinator of several cultural projects regarding media art and was working as a [[curator]] for the [[Instituto Cervantes]]  in [[Berlin]]. He also currently combines his artistic practice with his work as an art critic in Neo2 Magazine&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neo2.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.

His work is exhibited internationally in selected exhibitions such as in the Hara Museum, Tokyo (2010), Kreuzberg Pavillon, Germany (2013) and Norway (2016), Fonoteca Nacional, Mexico DF (2010), Palacio Fernandini, Lima (2016), Aleph Projects, Tel Aviv (2017), and the Museum of Fine Arts in Chile (2017). He has also been represented by Inés Barrenechea Gallery (2010-14). He continues to lecture within England, Colombia, Peru, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. His work has been selected and awarded by Transmediale, (2011), United Creators Awards (2009), Loop Barcelona (2010, 2015-17), Art Lima (2016) and The Media Art Biennale in Chile (2017). He currently lives and works in Madrid and is a member of the international agency of artists and theorists Front Views&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontviews.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin. Mit Borrás is represented by Exgirlfriend Gallery&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exgirlfriendberlin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Critic about the Work ==
[[File:Club. Installation View. Mit Borrás, 2016.jpg|thumb|Club. Installation View. Mit Borrás, 2016]]
Mit Borrás addresses [[technology]] and [[progress]] as new cult paradigms, often through the visual language of health and sport. He toys with the idea of [[ergonomics]] and softness in the development of new industrial forms, present in the works carried out since 2014 such as: Control Pool, Orthopedics, Youth Cloud, Techno Light, Devices, Artificial Rocks, Drone State of Mind or Ergonomic Technology. These works praise the idea of technology and well-being as a structure model of our time. Borrás emphasizes the objects that surround us as the objects that eventually define us as individuals and as a society; drones, gadgets, prosthetics, immobilizers, textile trends and their microperforated elastic fabrics, synthetic materials, medical and biomechanical engineering, and the design of products for leisure and relax. 

The artist uses intersecting lenses of the contemporary body and technology to interpret the homo consumericus behavior and diagnose the crusade a Western individual of the XXI Century. Inworks such as Ergonomic Shape (2016) in which a block of granite is supported on a medicine ball, or the Stones series (2015) in which the artist disables tactile screens by tying them to large pieces of quartz, it is common to find disconnect between technology and nature. This confrontation between digital system and cosmos is presented by the artist as a reinterpreation of Sagan’s idea that everything that is, what has been or what will be. For the artist, this implies a confrontation between a gullible society in a consumerist system and the innate course of nature. Works such as the palm trees of Palm Deformation (2016) or Club (2016) in which a gallery equipped with a strobe light and techno music is flooded with smoke, make allusion to all those current elements that are part of our life of evasion, fun and lightness, a lightness understood in the manner of [[Gilles Lipovetsky]]: like a ghost that frivolizes and makes provisional everything that was previously designed to be eternal.

''IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews'', 41(2):145-160, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to the methodologies that address challenges in robotics inspired by biological [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;I.

==Background==
=== Differences to epigenetic ===
Morphogenetic robotics is related to, but differs from, [[epigenetic robotics]]. The main difference between morphogenetic robotics and epigenetic robotics is that the former focuses on [[self-organization]], self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-adaptive control of robots using genetic and cellular mechanisms inspired from biological early morphogenesis (''activity-independent development''), during which the body and controller of the organisms are developed simultaneously, whereas the latter emphasizes the development of robots' cognitive capabilities, such as language, emotion and social skills, through experience during the lifetime (''activity-dependent development''). Morphogenetic robotics is closely connected to [[developmental biology]] and [[systems biology]], whilst epigenetic robotics is related to [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]] emerged from [[cognitive science]], [[developmental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].

Morphogenetic robotics includes, but is not limited to the following main topics:

A '''Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram (NSD)''' in computer programming is a [[Visual modeling|graphical design]] representation for [[structured programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Fill (2009). ''Visualisation for Semantic Information Systems''. p.32&lt;/ref&gt; This type of [[diagram]] was developed in 1972 by [[Isaac Nassi]] and [[Ben Shneiderman]] who were both graduate students at SUNY-Stony Brook.&lt;ref&gt;''A short history of structured flowcharts (Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams)''. Webdoc draft: May 27, 2003. ([http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/bshneiderman/nsd/ Source])&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams are also called '''structograms''',&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Isermann (1988). ''Automatic Control: Selected papers from the triennial world congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control : Munich, Federal Republic of Germany, 27–31 July 1987, Volume 10;Volume 14''. p.89&lt;/ref&gt; as they show a program's structures.

== Overview ==
Following a [[top-down design]], the problem at hand is reduced into smaller and smaller subproblems, until only simple statements and [[control flow]] constructs remain. Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams reflect this top-down decomposition in a straightforward way, using nested boxes to represent subproblems. Consistent with the philosophy of structured programming, Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams have no representation for a [[GOTO]] statement.

Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams are only rarely used for formal programming. Their abstraction level is close to structured program code and modifications require the whole diagram to be redrawn. Nonetheless, they can be useful for sketching processes and high-level designs.

Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams are almost [[isomorphic]] with [[flowchart]]s.  Everything that can be represented with a Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram can also be represented with a flowchart.  For flowcharts of programs, almost everything that can be represent with a flowchart can also be represented with a Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram.  The exceptions are constructs like [[goto]] and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] ''break'' and ''continue'' statements for loops.

In Germany, Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams were standardised in 1985 as DIN 66261.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Institut für Normung e. V. (DIN): [http://www.nia.din.de/cmd?artid=1255956&amp;bcrumblevel=1&amp;contextid=nia&amp;subcommitteeid=54755362&amp;level=tpl-art-detailansicht&amp;committeeid=54738935&amp;languageid=de DIN 66261: Informationsverarbeitung; Sinnbilder für Struktogramme nach Nassi-Shneiderman].&lt;/ref&gt; They are still used in German introductions to programming, for example Böttcher and Kneißl's introduction to C,&lt;ref&gt;Böttcher, Axel; Kneißl, Franz: ''Informatik für Ingenieure: Grundlagen und Programmierung in C''. 3rd edition. München: Oldenbourg, 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-486-70527-0}}. See especially Chapter 10: "Kontrollstrukturen" (control flow).&lt;/ref&gt; Baeumle-Courth and Schmidt's introduction to C&lt;ref&gt;Baeumle-Courth, Peter; Schmidt, Torsten: ''Praktische Einführung in C''. München: Oldenbourg, 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-486-70799-1}}. See especially Chapter 6: "Kontrollstrukturen" (control flow).&lt;/ref&gt; and Kirch's introduction to C#.&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Ulla: ''C# lernen und professionell anwenden''. Heidelberg: mitp, 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-8266-5915-7}}. See especially Chapter 5: "Schleifen und Verzweigungen" (loops and branches).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams can also be used in [[technical writing]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Edmond H.: "Visualizing a Procedure with Nassi-Schneiderman Charts", ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication'', Vol. 20, Nr. 3 (1990): 237-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process blocks:''' the process block represents the simplest of steps and requires no analysis. When a process block is encountered the action inside the block is performed and we move onto the next block.

[[Image:Process Block2.jpg|thumb|center|Process blocks]]

'''Branching blocks:''' there are two types of branching blocks. First is the simple True/False or Yes/No branching block which offers the program two paths to take depending on whether or not a condition has been fulfilled. These blocks can be used as a looping procedure stopping the program from continuing until a condition has been fulfilled.

[[Image:Two-Way Branch.jpg|thumb|centre|True/False branching blocks]]

The second type of branching block is a multiple branching block. This block is used when a select case is needed in a program. The block usually contains a question or select case. The block provides the program with an array of choices and is often used in conjunction with sub process blocks to save space.

[[Image:Multiple Branching.jpg|thumb|centre|Multiple branching blocks]]

'''Testing loops:''' this block allows the program to loop one or a set of processes until a particular condition is fulfilled. The process blocks covered by each loop are subset with a side-bar extending out from the condition.

There are two main types of testing loops, test first and test last blocks. The only difference between the two is the order in which the steps involved are completed.
In the test first situation, when the program encounters the block it tests to see if the condition is fulfilled, then, if it is not completes the process blocks and then loops back. The test is performed again and, if the condition is still unfulfilled, it processes again. If at any stage the condition is fulfilled the program skips the process blocks and continues onto the next block.

[[Image:Test First.jpg|thumb|centre|Test first loop block]]

The test last block is simply reversed, the process blocks are completed before the test is performed. The test last loop allows for the process blocks to be performed at least once before the first test.

[[Image:Test Last.jpg|thumb|centre|Test last loop block]]

'''Concurrent''' execution can be drawn like this:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7322">The '''Nebraska Innocence Project''' is a member organization [[Nebraska]]-based chapter of a U.S non-profit organization called the [[Innocence Project]], located in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=InnocenceNetwork-AlphabeticalListing&gt;{{cite web|title=Alphabetical listing of all Innocence Network member organizations|url=http://innocencenetwork.org/members/#alpha|website=The Innocence Network|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to use DNA testing to investigate, litigate and exonerate those in prison who were wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/nebraska-innocence-project-to-hire-staff-attorney/article_e3cd8116-528e-59e8-a9e8-79cd24a82c52.html|title=Nebraska Innocence Project to hire staff attorney|date=October 1, 2015|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|last1=Pilger|first1=Lori|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter was founded in 2005 by a group of volunteers who were inspired by the work of [[Barry Scheck]] and [[Peter Neufeld]], founders of the Innocence Project in 1992.

== Founding ==
A group of volunteers including an Iowa attorney formed the Iowa/Nebraska Innocence Project in 2005 after meeting the founders of the [[Innocence Project]], Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and several exonerated people at a national conference. Their goal was to form a local version of the project. By 2007 the Iowa/Nebraska Innocent Project became the Nebraska Innocence Project. The organization is part of the Innocence Network, which is a group of 40 innocence projects across the nation, all working to provide accessible information, consultation on cases, and media resources [[Pro bono|pro-bono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nebraskainnocenceproject.org/about-2/|title=Innocence Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=Nebraska Innocence Project|access-date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
The Nebraska Innocence Project works primarily with cases involving [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]].

== Notable Cases ==

=== Beatrice 6 ===
Commonly referred to the [[Beatrice 6]], a 1985 case in [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]] involved the rape and murder of 68-year-old woman, Helen Wilson, in her apartment. Six people, three men and three women were found guilty of committing the crime.&lt;ref name=LincolnJournalStar-Beatrice6-2014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/judge-grants-mistrial-in-beatrice-case/article_867ef362-d50f-5a69-a773-e24775cc6163.html|title=Judge grants mistrial in Beatrice 6 case|last=Pilger|first=Lori|date=January 30, 2014|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surfacing evidence that their conviction was based on coerced confessions and the malpractice of forensics, DNA testing of the original evidence proved their innocence.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/972218/beatrice-6-damage-claim-case-returns-federal-court|title=Beatrice 6 Damage Claim Case Returns to Federal Court|last=Kelly|first=Bill|date=May 8, 2015|work=[[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NET)]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA evidence was the first to be used as means to exonerate someone in the state of Nebraska.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015 /&gt; The six were awarded between $35,000-$500,00 by the state of Nebraska for their wrongful conviction under the Wrongful Conviction Act.

=== Juneal Pratt ===
In 1975 Juneal Pratt was convicted of rape, sexual assault and robbery of two sisters from Iowa in an Omaha motel. At 19 he was arrested and was picked from a lineup by the two sisters months later despite witnesses who claimed he was at home at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to 32 to 90 years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt has since maintained his innocence and requested DNA testing after a 2001 Nebraska law was passed that  allows convicted felons to request DNA testing of preserved evidence if such technology was unavailable during their trial.

'''Negligence''' (Lat. ''negligentia'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/negligence|website=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a failure to exercise appropriate and or ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/negligence|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of [[tort]] law known as ''negligence'' involves harm caused by failing to act as a form of ''carelessness'' possibly with extenuating circumstances. The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people or property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feinman|first=Jay|title=Law 101|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539513-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone who suffers loss caused by another's negligence may be able to sue for [[damages]] to compensate for their harm. Such loss may include physical injury, harm to property, psychiatric illness, or economic loss. The law on negligence may be assessed in general terms according to a five-part model which includes the assessment of duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref&gt;Deakin, Tort Law, 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of negligence claims==
Some things must be established by anyone who wants to sue in negligence. These are what are called the [[Element (criminal law)|"elements"]] of negligence.

Most jurisdictions say that there are four elements to a negligence action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Theodore R.|title=A Tangled Webb - Reexamining the Role of Duty in Indiana Negligence Actions|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indilr37&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#duty: the [[defendant]] has a duty to others, including the [[plaintiff]], to exercise reasonable care,
#breach: the defendant breaches that duty through an act or culpable omission,
#damages: as a result of that act or omission, the plaintiff suffers an injury, and
#causation: the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's act or omission.

Some jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=David G.|title=The Five Elements of Negligence|journal=Hofstra Law Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=35|issue=4|page=1671|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2282&amp;context=hlr|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt; However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar.

===Duty of care===
{{Main|Duty of care}}
[[Image:Grapevinesnail 01.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A decomposed snail in Scotland was the humble beginning of the modern English law of negligence]]

The legal liability of a defendant to a plaintiff is based on the defendant's failure to fulfil a responsibility, recognised by law, of which the plaintiff is the intended beneficiary. The first step in determining the existence of a legally recognised responsibility is the concept of an obligation or duty. In the tort of negligence the term used is duty of care &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torts In Ireland|last=Quill|first=Eoin|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=|location=Dublin 12|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532&lt;/ref&gt; [1932] established the modern law of negligence, laying the foundations of the duty of care and the [[fault (legal)|fault]] principle which, (through the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]), have been adopted throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. May Donoghue and her friend were in a café in Paisley. The friend bought Mrs Donoghue a [[Ice cream float|ginger beer float]].  She drank some of the beer and later poured the remainder over her ice-cream and was horrified to see the decomposed remains of a snail exit the bottle. Donoghue suffered nervous shock and gastro-enteritis, but did not sue the cafe owner, instead suing the manufacturer, Stevenson. (As Mrs Donoghue had not herself bought the ginger beer, the doctrine of [[privity]] precluded a [[law of contract|contractual]] action against Stevenson).

The Scottish judge, Lord MacMillan, considered the case to fall within a new category of delict (the Scots law nearest equivalent of tort). The case proceeded to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], where [[Lord Atkin]] interpreted the biblical ordinance to 'love thy neighbour' as a legal requirement to 'not harm thy neighbour.' He then went on to define neighbour as "persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions that are called in question."

In England the more recent case of ''[[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman]]'' [1990] introduced a 'threefold test' for a duty of care. Harm must be (1) reasonably foreseeable (2) there must be a relationship of proximity between the plaintiff and defendant and (3) it must be 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose liability. However, these act as guidelines for the courts in establishing a duty of care; much of the principle is still at the discretion of judges.

In Australia, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' was used as a persuasive precedent in the case of ''[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]]'' (AKR) (1936).&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{Cite Bailii|litigants=[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]] |year=1935 |court=UKPC |num=62 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1936] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 85}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1935|parallelcite= (1935) 54 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 49 |date=21 October 1935 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a landmark case in the development of negligence law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1838186/Example_Development-of-law-negligence.pdf |title=Example of the Development of the Law of Negligence |website=law.uwa.edu.au}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a duty of care is owed for psychiatric, as opposed to physical, harm was discussed in the Australian case of ''Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|2002|litigants=Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) 211 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 317 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|52|1984|litigants=[[Jaensch v Coffey]] |parallelcite=(1984) 155 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 549 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a duty for mental harm has now been subsumed into the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of Part 3 of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW) was demonstrated in ''Wicks v SRA (NSW); Sheehan v SRA (NSW)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|2010|litigants=Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales; Sheehan v State Rail Authority of New South Wales |parallelcite=(2010) 241 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 60 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;br&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2005|litigants=Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd |parallelcite=(2005) 222 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 44 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breach of duty===
{{See also|Breach of duty in English law}}
[[Image:Cricket Scene Sarhad..jpg|thumb|150px|right|In ''Bolton v Stone'', the English [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] were sympathetic to cricket players]]
Once it is established that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff/claimant, the matter of whether or not that duty was breached must be settled.  The test is both subjective and objective.  The defendant who knowingly (subjective,Which is totally based on observation and personal prejudice or view) exposes the plaintiff/claimant to a substantial risk of loss, breaches that duty.  The defendant who fails to realize the substantial risk of loss to the plaintiff/claimant, which any [[reasonable person]] [objective,Which is totally based on ground facts and reality without any personal prejudice or point of view.] in the same situation would clearly have realized, also breaches that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1980|litigants=Wyong Shire Council v Shirt |parallelcite=(1980) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 40 |courtname=auto |date=1 May 1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|151|2005|litigants=Doubleday v Kelly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{cite AustLII|NSWCA|222|2006|litigants=Drinkwater v Howart |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether the test is objective or subjective may depend upon the particular case involved.

There is a reduced threshold for the standard of care owed by children. In the Australian case of McHale v Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|13|1966|litigants=McHale  v Watson |date=7 March 1966 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; McHale, a 9-year-old girl was blinded in one eye after being hit by the ricochet of a sharp metal rod thrown by a 12-year-old boy, Watson. The defendant child was held not to have the level of care to the standard of an adult, but of a  12-year-old child with similar experience and intelligence. Kitto J explained that a child's lack of foresight is a characteristic they share with others at that stage of development.

Certain jurisdictions, also provide for breaches where professionals, such as doctors, fail to warn of risks associated with medical treatments or procedures. Doctors owe both objective and subjective duties to warn; and breach of either is sufficient to satisfy this element in a court of law. For example, the Civil Liability Act in Queensland outlines a statutory test incorporating both objective and subjective elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|cla2003161|Civil Liability Act 2003|21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an obstetrician who fails to warn a mother of complications arising from childbirth may be held to have breached their professional duty of care.

In ''Donoghue v Stevenson'', Lord Atkin declared that "the categories of negligence are never closed"; and in ''[[Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office|Dorset Yacht v Home Office]]'' it was held that the government had no immunity from suit when they negligently failed to prevent the escape of juvenile offenders who subsequently vandalise a boatyard.  In other words, all members of society have a duty to exercise reasonable care toward others and their property.  In ''[[Bolton v. Stone]]'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bolton v. Stone]],'' [1951] A.C. 850 see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|42|2007|litigants=Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that a defendant was not negligent if the damage to the plaintiff were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his conduct. In the case, a Miss Stone was struck on the head by a cricket ball while standing outside a cricket ground. Finding that no batsman would normally be able hit a cricket ball far enough to reach a person standing as far away as was Miss Stone, the court held her claim would fail because the danger was not reasonably or sufficiently foreseeable. As stated in the opinion, 'reasonable risk' cannot be judged with the benefit of hindsight.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  In ''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'' (1954) 2 AER 131; see also ''Glasgow Corporation v Muir'' (1943) 2 AER 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Denning said the past should not be viewed through rose coloured spectacles, finding no negligence on the part of medical professionals accused of using contaminated medical jars, since contemporary standards would have indicated only a low possibility of medical jar contamination.

===Causation===
{{Main|Causation (law)}}

In order for liability to result from a negligent act or omission, it is necessary to prove not only that the injury was caused by that negligence, but also that there is a legally sufficient connection between the act and the negligence.

====Factual causation (actual cause)====
{{See also|Causation in English law|Breaking the chain}}

For a defendant to be held [[Legal liability|liable]], it must be shown that the particular acts or omissions were the cause of the loss or damage sustained.&lt;ref name="Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez"&gt;''Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez'' (1976) 10 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 303; (1976) 50 [[Australian Law Journal Reports|ALJR]] 720 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=10+alr+303 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the notion sounds simple, the causation between one's breach of duty and the harm that results to another can at times be very complicated. The basic test is to ask whether the injury would have occurred 'but for', or without, the accused party's breach of the duty owed to the injured party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|5|2012|litigants=Strong v Woolworths |parallelcite=(2012) 246 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 182 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd |link=March v Stramare |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace v Kam"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|19|2013|litigants=Wallace v Kam |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the High Court has held that the 'but for' test is not the exclusive test of causation because it cannot address a situation where there is more than one cause of damage.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; When 'but for' test is not satisfied and the case is an exceptional one, a commonsense test ('Whether and Why' test) will be applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2005|5d}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
Even more precisely, if a breaching party materially increases the risk of harm to another, then the breaching party can be sued to the value of harm that he caused.

Asbestos litigations which have been ongoing for decades revolve around the issue of causation. Interwoven with the simple idea of a party causing harm to another are issues on [[insurance]] bills and compensations, which sometimes drove compensating companies out of business.

====Legal causation (proximate cause)====
[[Image:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|150px|Negligence can lead to [[Montparnasse derailment|this sort of collision]]: a train wreck at [[Gare Montparnasse]] in 1895.]]
Sometimes factual causation is distinguished from 'legal causation' to avert the danger of defendants being exposed to, in the words of [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo, J.]], "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''Ultramares Corp. v. Touche''(1931) 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441&lt;/ref&gt; It is said a new question arises of how remote a consequence a person's harm is from another's negligence. We say that one's negligence is 'too remote' (in England) or not a '[[proximate cause]]' (in the U.S.) of another's harm if one would 'never' reasonably foresee it happening. Note that a 'proximate cause' in U.S. terminology (to do with the chain of events between the action and the injury) should not be confused with the 'proximity test' under the English duty of care (to do with closeness of relationship). The idea of legal causation is that if no one can foresee something bad happening, and therefore take care to avoid it, how could anyone be responsible? For instance, in ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.'' (1928) 162 N.E. 99&lt;/ref&gt; the judge decided that the defendant, a [[railway]], was not liable for an injury suffered by a distant bystander.  The plaintiff, Palsgraf, was hit by coin-operated scale which toppled because of fireworks explosion that fell on her as she waited on a train platform. The scales fell because of a far-away commotion but it was not clear that what type of commotion caused the scale to fall,either it was the explosion's effect or the confused movement of the terrified people. A train [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] had run to help a man into a departing train. The man was carrying a package as he jogged to jump in the train door. The package had fireworks in it. The conductor mishandled the passenger or his package, causing the package to fall. The fireworks slipped and exploded on the ground causing shockwaves to travel through the platform.Which became the cause of commotion on platform &amp; As a consequence, the scales fell.&lt;ref&gt;The plaintiff's physical injuries were minor and more likely caused by a stampede of travelers on the platform rather than the concussion of the exploding fireworks.  These details have not, however, stopped the case from becoming the source of extensive debate in [[United States|American]] tort law.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Palsgraf was hurt by the falling scales, she sued the [[train]] company who employed the conductor for negligence.&lt;ref&gt;She could have sued the man or the conductor himself, but they did not have as much money as the company. Often, in litigation, where two defendants are equally liable but one is more able to satisfy a judgment, he will be the preferred defendant and is referred to as the "deep pocket."&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendant train company argued it should not be liable as a matter of law, because despite the fact that they employed the employee, who was negligent, his negligence was too remote from the plaintiff's injury. On appeal, the majority of the court agreed, with four judges adopting the reasons, written by Judge Cardozo, that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, because a duty was owed only to foreseeable plaintiffs. Three judges dissented, arguing, as written by Judge Andrews, that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, regardless of foreseeability, because all men owe one another a duty not to act negligently.

Such disparity of views on the element of remoteness continues to trouble the judiciary. Courts that follow Cardozo's view have greater control in negligence cases. If the court can find that, as a matter of law, the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, the plaintiff will lose his case for negligence before having a chance to present to the jury. Cardozo's view is the majority view. However, some courts follow the position put forth by Judge Andrews. In jurisdictions following the minority rule, defendants must phrase their remoteness arguments in terms of proximate cause if they wish the court to take the case away from the jury.

Remoteness takes another form, seen in ''[[The Wagon Mound (No. 2)]]''.&lt;ref name= "Wagon Mound #2 PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co]] (Wagon Mound No. 2) |year=1966 |court=UKPC |num=10 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1967] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 617; [1967] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 709 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=25 May 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wagon Mound was a ship in [[Sydney]] harbour. The ship leaked oil creating a slick in part of the harbour.  The wharf owner asked the ship owner about the danger and was told he could continue his work because the slick would not burn.  The wharf owner allowed work to continue on the wharf, which sent sparks onto a rag in the water which ignited and created a fire which burnt down the wharf. The Privy Council determined that the wharf owner 'intervened' in the causal chain, creating a responsibility for the fire which canceled out the liability of the ship owner.

In Australia the concept of remoteness, or proximity, was tested with the case of ''Jaensch v Coffey''.&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"/&gt; The wife of a policeman, Mrs Coffey suffered a nervous shock injury from the aftermath of a motor vehicle collision although she was not actually at the scene at the time of the collision. The court upheld that, in addition to it being reasonably foreseeable that his wife might suffer such an injury, it required that there be sufficient proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant who caused the collision. Here there was sufficient causal proximity. See also ''Kavanagh v Akhtar'',&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Imbree v McNeilly'',&lt;ref name="Imbree v McNeilly"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|2008|litigants=Imbree v McNeilly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tame v NSW''.&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"/&gt;

===Injury===
Even though there is breach of duty, and the cause of some injury to the defendant, a plaintiff may not recover unless he can prove that the defendant's breach caused a pecuniary injury. This should not be mistaken with the requirements that a plaintiff prove harm to recover. As a general rule, a plaintiff can only rely on a legal remedy to the point that he proves that he suffered a loss; it was reasonably foreseeable. It means something more than pecuniary loss is a necessary element of the plaintiff's case in negligence. When damages are not a necessary element, a plaintiff can win his case without showing that he suffered any loss; he would be entitled to [[nominal damages]] and any other damages according to proof. (See ''[[Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd]]'' [1944] KB]).

Negligence is different in that the plaintiff must prove his loss, and a particular kind of loss, to recover. In some cases, a defendant may not dispute the loss, but the requirement is significant in cases where a defendant cannot deny his negligence, but the plaintiff suffered no pecuniary loss as a result even though he had suffered emotional injury or damage but he cannot be compensated for these kind of losses.The plaintiff can be compensated for emotional or non-pecuniary losses on the condition that If the plaintiff can prove pecuniary loss, then he can also obtain damages for non-pecuniary injuries, such as emotional distress.

The requirement of pecuniary loss can be shown in a number of ways. A plaintiff who is physically injured by allegedly negligent conduct may show that he had to pay a medical bill. If his property is damaged, he could show the income lost because he could not use it, the cost to repair it, although he could only recover for one of these things.

The damage may be physical, purely economic, both physical and economic (loss of earnings following a personal injury,&lt;ref&gt;See, eg, {{cite AustLII|HCA|8|1977|litigants=Sharman v Evans |parallelcite=(1977) 138 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) or reputational (in a [[defamation]] case).

In English law, the right to claim for purely [[economic loss]] is limited to a number of 'special' and clearly defined circumstances, often related to the nature of the duty to the plaintiff as between clients and lawyers, financial advisers, and other professions where money is central to the consultative services.

[[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|Emotional distress]] has been recognized as an actionable tort. Generally, emotional distress damages had to be parasitic. That is, the plaintiff could recover for emotional distress caused by injury, but only if it accompanied a physical or pecuniary injury.

A claimant who has suffered only emotional distress and no pecuniary loss would not recover for negligence. However, courts have recently allowed recovery for a plaintiff to recover for purely emotional distress under certain circumstances. The state courts of [[California]] allowed recovery for emotional distress alone{{spaced ndash}}even in the absence of any physical injury, when the defendant physically injures a relative of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff witnesses it.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968) and ''[[Molien]] v. [[Kaiser Foundation|Kaiser Foundation Hospitals]]'', 27 Cal. 3d 916 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggshell skull rule is a legal doctrine upheld in some tort law systems, which holds that a tortfeasor is liable for the full extent of damage caused, even where the extent of the damage is due to the unforeseen frailty of the claimant. The eggshell skull rule was recently maintained in Australia in the case of ''Kavanagh v Akhtar''.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"/&gt;

==Damages==
{{Main|Damages}}
Damages place a monetary value on the harm done, following the principle of ''[[restitutio in integrum]]'' ([[Latin]] for "restoration to the original condition"). Thus, for most purposes connected with the quantification of damages, the degree of [[culpability]] in the breach of the duty of care is irrelevant. Once the breach of the duty is established, the only requirement is to compensate the victim.

One of the main tests that is posed when deliberating whether a claimant is entitled to compensation for a tort, is the "[[reasonable person]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co'' (1856) Ex Ch 781&lt;/ref&gt; The test is self-explanatory: would a reasonable person (as determined by a judge or jury), under the given circumstances, have done what the defendant did to cause the injury in question; or, in other words, would a reasonable person, acting reasonably, have engaged in similar conduct when compared to the one whose actions caused the injury in question? Simple as the "reasonable person" test sounds, it is very complicated. It is a risky test because it involves the opinion of either the judge or the jury that can be based on limited facts. However, as vague as the "reasonable person" test seems, it is extremely important in deciding whether or not a plaintiff is entitled to compensation for a negligence tort.

Damages are compensatory in nature.  Compensatory damages addresses a plaintiff/claimant's losses (in cases involving physical or mental injury the amount awarded also compensates for pain and suffering). The award should make the plaintiff whole, sufficient to put the plaintiff back in the position he or she was before Defendant's negligent act.  Anything more would unlawfully permit a plaintiff to profit from the tort.

There are also two other general principles relating to damages. Firstly, the award of damages should take place in the form of a single lump sum payment. Therefore, a defendant should not be required to make periodic payments (however some statutes give exceptions for this). Secondly, the Court is not concerned with how the plaintiff uses the award of damages. For example, if a plaintiff is awarded $100,000 for physical harm, the plaintiff is not required to spend this money on medical bills to restore them to their original position - they can spend this money any way they want.&lt;ref name="'Todorovic v Waller"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|72|1981|litigants=Todorovic v Waller |parallelcite=(1981) 150 [[COmmonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 402 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Types of damage
* [[Special damages]] - quantifiable dollar losses suffered from the date of defendant's negligent act (the tort) up to a specified time (proven at trial).  Special damage examples include lost wages, medical bills, and damage to property such as one's car.
* [[General damages]] - these are damages that are not quantified in monetary terms (e.g., there's no invoice or receipt as there would be to prove special damages).  A general damage example is an amount for the pain and suffering one experiences from a car collision. Lastly, where the plaintiff proves only minimal loss or damage, or the court or jury is unable to quantify the losses, the court or jury may award [[nominal damages]].
* [[Punitive damages]] - Punitive damages are to punish a defendant, rather than to compensate plaintiffs, in negligence cases. In most jurisdictions punitive damages are recoverable in a negligence action, but only if the plaintiff shows that the defendant’s conduct was more than ordinary negligence (i.e., wanton and willful or reckless).
* Aggravated damages - In contrast to exemplary damages, compensation are given to the plaintiff when the harm is aggravated by the defendant's conduct. For example, the manner of this wrongful act increased the injury by subjecting the plaintiff to humiliation, insult.&lt;ref name="NSW v Riley"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|208|2003|litigants=State of NSW v Riley |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure in the United States==
The United States generally recognizes four elements to a negligence action: duty, breach, proximate causation and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[plaintiff]] who makes a negligence claim must prove all four elements of negligence in order to win his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Paul D.|title=Chicken Little at the Reference Desk: The Myth of Librarian Liability|journal=Law Library Journal|date=1995|volume=87|page=515|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/llj87&amp;div=38&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff can prove one of the elements, the defendant may request judicial resolution early on, to prevent the case from going to a jury. This can be by way of a [[demurrer]], motion to dismiss, or motion for [[summary judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Currie|first1=David P.|title=Thoughts on Directed Verdicts and Summary Judgments|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Autumn 1977|volume=45|issue=1|pages=72–79|jstor=1599201|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements allow a defendant to test a plaintiff's accusations before trial, as well as providing a guide to the [[finder of fact]] at trial (the judge in a bench trial, or jury in a jury trial) to decide whether the defendant is or is not liable. Whether the case is resolved with or without trial again depends heavily on the particular facts of the case, and the ability of the parties to frame the issues to the court. The duty and causation elements in particular give the court the greatest opportunity to take the case from the jury, because they directly involve questions of policy.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLauchlan|first1=William P.|title=An Empirical Study of the Federal Summary Judgment Rule|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 1977|volume=6|issue=2|pages=427–459|doi=10.1086/467581}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can find that regardless of any disputed facts, the case may be resolved as a matter of law from undisputed facts because as a matter of law the defendant cannot be legally responsible for the plaintiff's injury under a theory of negligence.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"/&gt;

On appeal, depending on the disposition of the case and the question on appeal, the court reviewing a trial court's determination that the defendant was negligent will analyze at least one of the elements of the cause of action to determine if it is properly supported by the facts and law. For example, in an appeal from a final judgment after a jury verdict, the appellate court will review the record to verify that the jury was properly instructed on each contested element, and that the record shows sufficient evidence for the jury's findings. On an appeal from a dismissal or judgment against the plaintiff without trial, the court will review ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'' whether the court below properly found that the plaintiff could not prove any or all of his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Ronald R.|title=Standards of Review - Looking beyond the Labels|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=1990|volume=74|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/marqlr74&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''object diagram''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), is a [[diagram]] that shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled [[system]] at a specific time.

== Overview ==
{{UML diagram types}}
In the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), an object diagram focuses on some particular set of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] and [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]], and the links between these instances. A correlated set of object diagrams provides insight into how an arbitrary view of a system is expected to evolve over time. In early UML specifications the object diagram is described as:

: "''An object diagram is a graph of instances, including objects and data values. A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time. The use of object diagrams is fairly limited, namely to show examples of data structure''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Object Management Group]] (2001) 	[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/1.4 UML specification 1.4], September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Banks Pidduck, [[John Mylopoulos]], Carson C. Woo (2002) ''Advanced Information Systems Engineering''. p.776.&lt;/ref&gt;   
The latest UML 2.5 specification does not explicitly define object diagrams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html Classification of UML 2.5 Diagrams] on uml-diagrams.org. Retrieved Dec 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but provides a notation for instances of classifiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Object Management Group]] (2015)[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5 UML specification 2.5], Section 9.8.4 on notation of InstanceSpecification, March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Object diagrams and class diagrams are closely related&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Fontoura, Wolfgang Pree &amp; [[Bernhard Rumpe]] (2002) ''The UML profile for framework architectures''. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and use almost identical notation.&lt;ref&gt;Kassem A. Saleh (2009) ''Software Engineering''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Both diagrams are meant to visualize static structure of a system. While class diagrams show [[Class (computer programming)|classes]], object diagrams display instances of classes ([[Object (computer science)|objects]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bianca Scholten (2007) ''The Road to Integration: A Guide to Applying the ISA-95 Standard in Manufacturing''. p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Object diagrams are more concrete than [[class diagram]]s. They are often used to provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams. Only aspects of current interest in a model are typically shown on an object diagram.

==Object diagram topics==

===Instance specifications===
Each object and link on an object diagram is represented by an ''InstanceSpecification''. This can show an object's classifier (e.g. an abstract or concrete [[Class (computer science)|class]]) and instance name, as well as attributes and other structural features using ''slots''. Each ''slot'' corresponds to a single attribute or feature, and may include a value for that entity.

The name on an instance specification optionally shows an instance name, a ':' separator, and optionally one or more classifier names separated by commas. The contents of slots, if any, are included below the names, in a separate attribute compartment.
A link is shown as a solid line, and represents an instance of an [[Association (object-oriented programming)|association]].

===Object diagram example===
[[Image:Object Diagram Initial.png|thumb|right|400px|Initially, when n=2, and f(n-2) = 0, and f(n-1) = 1, then f(n) = 0 + 1 = 1.]]

Consider one possible way of modeling production of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].

In the first UML object diagram on the right, the instance in the leftmost instance specification is named ''v1'', has ''IndependentVariable'' as its classifier, plays the ''NMinus2'' role within the ''FibonacciSystem'', and has a slot for the ''val'' attribute with a value of ''0''. The second object is named ''v2'', is of class ''IndependentVariable'', plays the ''NMinus1'' role, and has ''val = 1''. The ''DependentVariable'' object is named ''v3'', and plays the ''N'' role. The topmost instance, an anonymous instance specification, has ''FibonacciFunction'' as its classifier, and may have an instance name, a role, and slots, but these are not shown here. The diagram also includes three named links, shown as lines. Links are instances of an association.

[[Image:Object Diagram 2.png|thumb|right|300px|After the first iteration, when n = 3, and f(n-2) = 1, and f(n-1) = 1, then f(n) = 1 + 1 = 2.]]

In the second diagram, at a slightly later point in time, the ''IndependentVariable'' and ''DependentVariable'' objects are the same, but the slots for the ''val'' attribute have different values. The role names are not shown here.

[[Image:Object Diagram 1.png|thumb|right|280px|After several more iterations, when n = 7, and f(n-2) = 5, and f(n-1) = 8, then f(n) = 5 + 8 = 13.]]

In the last object diagram, a still later snapshot, the same three objects are involved. Their slots have different values. The instance and role names are not shown here.

===Usage===
If you are using a [[UML tool|UML modeling tool]], you will typically draw object diagrams using some other diagram type, such as on a [[class diagram]]. An object instance may be called an ''instance specification'' or just an ''instance''. A link between instances is generally referred to as a ''link''. Other UML entities, such as an [[Aggregation (object-oriented programming)|aggregation]] or [[Object composition|composition]] symbol (a diamond) may also appear on an object diagram.

'''Otis Taylor''' (born August 11, 1942) is a former American [[college football|college]] and professional [[American football]] player, for [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]] and the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 215 pounds, Taylor possessed sure hands during his career and served as a devastating downfield blocker, springing Chiefs running backs for many long runs.

==Professional career==
Taylor was selected in the [[1965 American Football League draft|1965 AFL draft]] (Chiefs) and the [[1965 NFL draft|NFL draft]], by the [[1965 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].  After a famous "baby-sitting" incident, in which Taylor "escaped" from NFL scouts, he was signed for the Chiefs by their legendary scout [[Lloyd C.A. Wells|Lloyd Wells]].&lt;ref name=mkbthot&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BeshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7181%2C3825005 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |agency=NEA |last=Olderman |first=Murray |title=Mama knows best, thinks Otis Taylor |date=December 18, 1966 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bdwrstep&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nZscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0mUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6489%2C5963371 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title='Back door' was right step for Chiefs' Otis Taylor |date=November 24, 1966 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor caught five touchdown passes during his rookie year, and followed that up in [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]] by leading the [[American Football League|AFL]] with a 22.4 yd/catch average and finishing second in receiving yards (1,297).  At season's end, he was voted First-team All-AFL and was selected for the [[1966 AFL season|1966]] [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] team.  Taylor led the AFL in receiving touchdowns in 1967 with 11 and led the NFL in receiving yards in 1971 with 1,110. He made the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl twice and in 1971 was named Consensus [[1971 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] (PFWA) and [[Pro Football Weekly]]. The PFWA also named him First-team [[1972 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] for the 1972 season. Taylor ranks second on the  Chiefs' all-time list in receptions (410), receiving yards (7,306), receiving touchdowns (57) and 100-yard games (20).

Taylor combined with running back [[Robert Holmes (American football player)|Robert Holmes]] for what was at the time the longest reception in Chiefs history in [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]] when he caught a pass from quarterback Mike Livingston for 79 yards, then lateraled to Holmes, who carried it another 14 yards for a touchdown. However, Taylor's most memorable highlight from that season came in the fourth and final [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]] on January 11, 1970, when he caught a short pass, turned downfield and stiff-armed his way to a 46-yard touchdown in the Chiefs 23-7 upset victory over the NFL's  champion, the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], who, before [[Super Bowl IV]], had been dubbed by some as "the greatest team in pro football history".

"Otis made my job easy," former Chiefs quarterback and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Len Dawson]] said. "If you got the pass to Otis, you knew he'd catch it."

On November 1, [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]], the Chiefs led the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Raiders' cheap-shot artist defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Taylor to attack Davidson.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1gyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7172%2C97394 |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |location=Kansas |agency=Associated Press |title=Raiders knot KC in bizarre ending |date=November 2, 1970 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GQBYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3409%2C5652917 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Blanda boots field goal to give Raiders tie with Chiefs |date=November 2, 1970 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg/&gt; Davidson's hit against Dawson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but helped Oakland win the [[AFC West]]  with a season record of 8–4–2, while defending world champion Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the [[1970–71 NFL playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very next season, the rule for offsetting personal foul penalties was changed to separate penalties during the play, and penalties after the play. The rule change was largely due to this play.

===Jack Del Rio incident===
After his time as a player had come to a close, Taylor became a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. During the 1987 NFL Player's strike, Taylor was arriving at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] and was assaulted by [[Jack Del Rio]], who was a new player to the organization in 1987 and was striking with his teammates. Del Rio mistook Taylor for a replacement player and was told Taylor was actually a Chief's legend and retired player by fans who had come upon the assault. He later pressed charges against Del Rio and the two settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL=http://fox4kc.com/2017/09/27/30-years-ago-this-week-kansas-city-chiefs-players-were-center-stage-for-nfl-drama/| accessdate=November 15, 2017| website=fox4kc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Pazend [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpə'zend/]]''' or '''Pazand''' Middle Persian: 𐭯𐭠𐭰𐭭𐭣 Avestan: ''𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬙𐬌‎'' is one of the [[writing system]]s used for the [[Middle Persian]] language. It was based on the [[Avestan alphabet]], a phonetic alphabet originally used to write [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the language of the [[Avesta]], the primary sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].

Pazend's principal use was for writing the commentaries (''Zend'') on and/or translations of the Avesta. The word "Pazend" ultimately derives from the Avestan words ''paiti zainti'', &lt;!-- Dhalla. ''Zend'' is middle Persian for ''âzainti'' in Avestan --&gt;which can be translated as either "for commentary purposes" or "according to understanding" (phonetically).

Pazend had the following characteristics, both of which are to be contrasted with [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]], which is one of the other systems used to write Middle Persian:
*Pazend was a variant of the [[Avestan alphabet]] (''Din dabireh''), which was a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet. In contrast, Pahlavi script was only an [[abjad]]. 
*Pazend did not have [[ideograms]]. In contrast, ideograms were an identifying feature of the Pahlavi system, and these ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig|huzvarishn]]'' were words borrowed from [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Aramaic]] that continued to be spelled as in Aramaic (in Pahlavi script) but were pronounced as the corresponding word in Persian.

[[Image:Avestan-LE.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A Pazend title (for a published [[Avesta]]) that reads ''pargart auual'' (as transliterated in the Hoffmann system) and demonstrates the use of the ''el'' grapheme (leftmost symbol here, resembling a Latin 'p'). This letter was added to the alphabet specifically for use in Pazend script; it is not needed for writing the [[Avestan language]].]]

In combination with its religious purpose, these features constituted a "sanctification" of written Middle Persian. The use of the Avestan alphabet to write Middle Persian required the addition of one symbol to the Avestan alphabet: This character, to support Middle Persian's {{IPA|/l/}}, phoneme had not previously been needed.

Following the fall of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]], after which Zoroastrianism came to be gradually supplanted by [[Islam]], Pazend lost its purpose and soon ceased to be used for original composition. In the late 11th or early 12th century, Indian Zoroastrians (the [[Parsi]]s) began translating Avestan or Middle Persian texts into Sanskrit and Gujarati. Some Middle Persian texts were also ''transcribed'' into the Avestan alphabet. The latter process, being a form of interpretation, was known as 'pa-zand'. "Pazand texts, transcribed phonetically, represent a late and often corrupt Middle Persian pronunciation, and so present their own problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Sanskrit, Old Gujarati and Pazand writings|title=Textual sources for the study of Zoroastrianism|year=1984|publisher=Manchester UP|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The corruptions during this process are sometimes considerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Middle Persian literature: The later religious writings|p=47&lt;!--32-66--&gt;|title=Iranistik II: Literatur|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik, vol 4|year=1968|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the transcribed texts are the prefaces (''dibacheh'') to prayers in Avestan. These prefatory prayers are invariably written in Pazend because of the need for "accurate" pronunciation. This practice has led to the misconception that "Pazend" is the name of a language.

Following [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]]'s translation of some of the texts of the Avesta in the late 18th century, the term "Zend-Avesta" was mistakenly used to refer to the sacred texts themselves (as opposed to commentaries on them). This usage subsequently led to the equally mistaken use of "Pazend" for the Avestan script as such and  "Zend" for the Avestan language.&lt;!-- cf Ethnologue report for Avestan (SIL: avs)--&gt;

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement – Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

“It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.”&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict management—preventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers — [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense — shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, “contracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international market”.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventive—and business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, “achievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calm”.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">The '''Samaritan's dilemma''' is a dilemma in the act of [[charity (practice)|charity]]. It hinges on the idea that when presented with charity, in some location such as a [[soup kitchen]], a person will act in one of two ways: using the charity to improve their situation, or coming to rely on charity as a means of survival. The term ''Samaritan's dilemma'' was coined by economist [[James M. Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwoWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Samaritan%27s+dilemma%22&amp;dq=%22Samaritan%27s+dilemma%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BqiUT5rlN6jG6AHFi_GPBA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg Roger E. Meiners, "Victim Compensation", Lexington Books, 1978 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument against charity frequently cites the Samaritan's dilemma as reason to forgo charitable contributions. It is also a common argument against [[communism]] and [[socialism]], claiming that state [[aid]] is equivalent to charity, and that the beneficiaries of such aid will become [[Sloth (deadly sin)|slothful]] or otherwise negligent members of [[society]]. The more aid that is received the less likely the recipient will seek out a permanent solution for their condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-samaritans-dilemma-and-the-welfare-state/|title=The Samaritans Dilemma and the Welfare State {{!}} E.C. Pasour|date=1991-06-01|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dilemma's name is a reference to the biblical [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].

== Samaritan's dilemma in disaster preparedness ==
A study published in 2016 looked at 5089 major [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]] in 81 [[Developing country|developing countries]] over a 33 year period. Results showed that among the countries that received natural disaster relief had less incentives to provide their own natural disaster protections. This effect is exacerbated the poorer and less-developed the country is that receives the aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raschky|first=Paul A.|last2=Schwindt|first2=Manijeh|title=Aid, Catastrophes and the Samaritan's Dilemma|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uky.edu/10.1111/ecca.12194|journal=Economica|volume=83|issue=332|pages=624–645|doi=10.1111/ecca.12194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Avoiding the Samaritan's dilemma ==
Much foreign aid comes in the form of monetary compensation for damages or direct relief such as food or water. This type of direct aid does not provide any incentive for the recipient to become independent. By introducing incentives that developing countries can meet by building up natural disaster protection the effects of the Samaritan's dilemma can be effectively mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60856158|title=The samaritan's dilemma : the political economy of development aid|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Gibson, Clark C., 1961-|isbn=9780199278848|location=Oxford|oclc=60856158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Self in Jungian psychology''' is one of the [[Jungian archetypes]], signifying the unification of consciousness and unconsciousness in a person, and representing the psyche as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Josepf L. Henderson, "Ancient Myths and Modern Man" in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Self, according to [[Carl Jung]], is realized as the product of [[individuation]], which in his view is the process of integrating one's personality. For Jung, the Self is symbolized by the [[circled dot|circle]] (especially when divided in four quadrants), the [[square (geometry)|square]], or the [[mandala]].

==Twin centers==

What distinguishes Jungian psychology is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] is the center of consciousness, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality, which includes consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego.  The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little center of the circle contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zweig | first = Connie | title = Meeting the Shadow | publisher = J.P. Tarcher | location = Los Angeles | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-87477-618-X }} p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence from the Self==

Jung considered that from birth every individual has an original sense of wholeness - of the Self - but that with development a separate ego-consciousness crystallizes out of the original feeling of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, "Myths" p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  This process of ego-differentiation provides the task of the first half of one's life-course, though Jungians also saw psychic health as depending on a periodic return to the sense of Self, something facilitated by the use of myths, initiation ceremonies, and [[rites of passage]].
&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, "Myths" p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the Self: individuation==

Once ego-differentiation had been successfully achieved and the individual is securely anchored in the external world, Jung considered that a new task then arose for the second half of life - a return to, and conscious rediscovery of, the Self: individuation. [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] states that "The actual processes of individuation - the conscious coming-to-term with one's own inner center (psychic nucleus) or Self - generally begins with a wounding of the personality".&lt;ref&gt;M-L von Franz, "The Process of Individuation" in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The ego reaches an impasse of one sort or another; and has to turn for help to what she termed "a sort of hidden regulating or directing tendency...[an] organizing center" in the personality: "Jung called this center the 'Self' and described it as the totality of the whole psyche, in order to distinguish it from the 'ego', which constitutes only a small part of the psyche".&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, "Process" p. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Self's guidance, a succession of archetypal images emerges,&lt;ref&gt;Jolandi Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung'' (London 1968) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; gradually bringing their fragmentary aspects of the Self increasingly closer to its totality.  The first to appear, and the closest to the ego, would be the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] or personal unconscious - something which is at the same time the first representative of the total personality,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and which may indeed be at times conflated with the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz "Process" p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; Next to appear would be the [[Anima and Animus]], the soul-image, which again, by a kind of psychological short-cut, may be taken as identical to the whole Self.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally however, the animus or anima comes to play a mediatory role between the ego and the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz "Process" p. 193 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The third main archetype to emerge is the [[Mana]] figure of the wise old man/woman&lt;ref&gt;J. Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung'' (London 1946) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; - a representative of the collective unconscious still closer to the Self.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter comes the archetype of the Self itself - the last point on the route to self-realization of individuation.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1946) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's words, "the Self...embraces ego-consciousness, shadow, anima, and collective unconscious in indeterminable extension. As a totality, the self is a ''coincidentia oppositorum''; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he stated that "the Self is the total, timeless man...who stands for the mutual integration of conscious and unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;C. G .Jung, "Psychology of the Transference", ''Collected Works'' Vol. 16 (London 1954) p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Jung recognized many dream images as representing the self, including a stone, the [[world tree]], an elephant, and the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;On this last, see "Christ, a Symbol of the Self" in ''Collected Works'' Vol. 9ii, p. 36ff. He explicitly says, "''Christ exemplifies the archetype of the self.''" [italics his]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perils of the Self==

Von Franz considered that "the dark side of the Self is the most dangerous thing of all, precisely because the Self is the greatest power in the psyche. It can cause people to 'spin' [[megalomania|megalomanic]] or other delusionary fantasies that catch them up", so that the victim "thinks with mounting excitement that he has grasped the great cosmic riddles; he therefore loses all touch with human reality. &lt;ref&gt;von Franz, ''Process'', p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In everyday life, the Self may be projected onto such powerful figures as the state, God, the universe or fate.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens, ''On Jung'' (London 1990) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; When such projections are withdrawn, there can be a destructive inflation of the personality - one potential counterbalance to this being however the social or collective aspects of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, ''Process'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Jungian concept of Self==

[[Fritz Perls]] may have had the Jungians in mind when he objected that 'many psychologists like to write the self with a capital S, as if the self would be something precious, something extraordinarily valuable. They go at the discovery of the self like a treasure-digging. The self means nothing but this thing as it is defined by ''otherness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (Bantam) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Young-Eisendrath and Hall write that 'in Jung's work, self can refer to the notion of inherent subjective individuality, the idea of an abstract center or central ordering principle, and the account of a process developing over time'.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self-Psychology'' (1991) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensus divinitatis''''' ("sense of divinity"), also referred to as ''sensus deitatis'' ("sense of deity") or ''semen religionis'' ("seed of religion"), is a term first used by French Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]] to describe a hypothetical human sense. Instead of knowledge of the environment (as with, for example, smell or sight), the ''sensus divinitatis'' is alleged to give humans a knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Helm | first=Paul | year=1998 | title=John Calvin, the Sensus Divinitatis, and the noetic effects of sin | journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=87–107 | doi=10.1023/A:1003174629151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Calvin's view, there is no reasonable non-belief. [[Neo-Calvinism|Neo-Calvinists]] who adhere to the [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalist]] school of [[Christian apologetics]] sometimes appeal to a ''sensus divinitatis'' to argue that there are no genuine [[atheism|atheists]]:

{{quote|That there exists in the human mind and indeed by natural instinct, some sense of Deity [''sensus divinitatis''], we hold to be beyond dispute, since God himself, to prevent any man from pretending ignorance, has endued all men with some idea of his Godhead…. …this is not a doctrine which is first learned at school, but one as to which every man is, from the womb, his own master; one which nature herself allows no individual to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion|last=Calvin|first=Jean|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press,U.S.|ISBN=0-664-22028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]] of the [[University of Notre Dame]] posits a modified form of the ''sensus divinitatis'' whereby all have the sense, only it does not work properly in some humans, due to sin's [[nous|noetic]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alvin|last=Plantinga|title=Warranted Christian Belief|ISBN=0-19-513192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Reformed epistemology]])

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the 18th-century American Calvinist preacher and theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of "true benevolence".

==Criticism==

Philosopher Steven Maitzen claimed in 2006 that the [[demographics]] of religious belief make the existence of the ''sensus divinitatis'' unlikely, as this sense appears so unevenly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| last = Maitzen| first = Steven | title = Divine hiddenness and the demographics of theism| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 42| pages = 177–191| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006| url = http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf| doi = 10.1017/S0034412506008274| accessdate =2012-01-26 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Maitzen may{{according to whom|date=October 2013}} have confused [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]'s ''sensus dei''{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} with ''sensus divinitatis''—''sensus divinitatis'' (a religious sense) only necessitates a core religious/faith component to one's beliefs, whereas the ''sensus dei'' aims at a natural knowledge of God—compare ''In the Twilight of Western Thought'' by [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] (1894–1977).&lt;ref&gt;

'''[[Sexual assault]] of [[LGBT]] persons''' is a form of violence that occurs within the LGBT community. While sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence can occur in all forms of relationships, it is found that sexual minorities experience it at rates that are equal to or higher than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research on this specific problem for the LGBT population as a whole, but there does exist a substantial amount of research on college LGBT students who have experienced sexual assault. 

== Definition ==
There are varying definitions as to what sexual assault is defined as. According to the [[United States Department of Justice]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term 'sexual assault' means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|title=Sexual Assault {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Definitions and laws of sexual assault vary from state to state. The website [https://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/sexual-assault.html FindLaw] allows users to click on their corresponding to state to read about how their state defines what sexual assault is, as well as what laws and limitations exist. Sexual assault of LGBT individuals refers to the act of sexual violence against persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender amongst other sexualities and sexual minorities. 

== Statistics ==
The [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]], also known as RAINN, puts out general statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence|title=Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics {{!}} RAINN|website=www.rainn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sexual assault, including:

* Every 98 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted.
* 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming) college students have been sexually assaulted.

According to a 2010 findings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey], put out by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], it concluded that:

* For Lesbian women: 
** 44% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** Approximately 1 in 8 (13%) have been raped in their lifetime.
* For Gay men:
** 26% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 4 in 10 (40%) have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Women:
** 61% experienced rap, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime.
** 1 in 5 (22%) have been raped by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 46% have been raped in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Men:
** 37% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 47% have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.

In a paper done by Emily Rothman, Deinera Exner, and Allyson Baughman, it was found that, in regard to lifetime sexual assault victimization, the estimated prevalence for lesbian and bisexual women was approximately 12.6 - 85%. For gay and bisexual men, it was 11.8-54.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Emily F.|last2=Exner|first2=Deinera|last3=Baughman|first3=Allyson | date = April 2011 |title=The prevalence of sexual assault against people who identify as Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual in the United States: A systematic review |journal=Trauma, violence &amp; abuse|volume=12|issue=2|pages=55–66|doi=10.1177/1524838010390707 |pmc=3118668|pmid=21247983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues, myths, and misconceptions ==
{{or-section|date=May 2018}}
The underlying issues of sexual assault against LGBT persons includes homophobia and transphobia among other forms of prejudice against sexual minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcar.org/about-sexual-violence/lgbtq|title=LGBTQ {{!}} Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR)|website=www.pcar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of prejudice end up creating unsafe spaces for LGBT persons where they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves or do not feel safe living as their authentic self. 

According to the [https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/ Pride Resource Center] at Colorado State University, homophobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Homophobia is a pervasive, irrational fear of homosexuality. Homophobia includes the fear heterosexuals have of any homosexual feelings within themselves, any overt mannerisms or actions that would suggest homosexuality, and the resulting desire to suppress or stamp out homosexuality. And it also includes the self-hatred and self-denial of homosexuals who know what they are but have been taught all their lives by a heterosexual society that people like themselves are sick, sinful and criminal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/resources/homophobia/|title=Homophobia {{!}} Pride Resource Center|website=prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Planned Parenthood]], transphobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Transphobia is the fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t conform to traditional gender roles. Transphobia can prevent transgender and gender nonconforming people from living full lives free from harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-identities/whats-transphobia|title=What's Transphobia? {{!}} Facts About Transphobic Discrimination|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These phobias, as well as myths centered around LGBT individuals, influence a culture that holds back persons from identifying how they choose and places them into a binary that doesn't encompass all possible ways of identifying. One of the main myths that can harm LGBT individuals is the idea that they have not met the right guy/girl yet. This perpetuates heterosexism and denies the possibility of one having attraction to the same gender. 

One of the biggest misconceptions that comes out of transphobia centers around the use of bathrooms. Made popular by North Carolina's "[[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|Bathroom Bill]]", it brought up the concern that by allowing individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender they identify as, predators could easily enter bathrooms and take advantage of individuals claiming that they identify as the gender the bathroom is. Legislation, such as House Bill 2, only perpetuate the discrimination of transgender individuals, rather than give them support to live their lives as the gender by which they identify. Laws have always existed that prohibit individuals from entering bathrooms with the purpose of harming others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glaad.org/sites/default/files/Debunking_the_Bathroom_Bill_Myth_2017.pdf|title=Debunking the "Bathroom Bill" Myth|last=|first=|date=|work=GLAAD Transgender Media Program|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12823">A '''social panic''' is a state where a [[Social group|social]] or [[community group]] reacts negatively and in an extreme or irrational manner to unexpected or unforeseen changes in their expected social [[status quo]]. According to ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'' by [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]],  the definition can be broken down to many different sections. The sections, which were identified by [[Erich Goode]] and [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]] in 1994, include concern, hostility, consensus, disproportionality, and volatility. Concern, which is not to be mistaken with fear, is about the possible or potential threat. Hostility occurs when an outrage occurs toward the people who were a part of the problem and agencies who are accountable.&lt;ref name="Critcher Chas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Critcher|first1=Chas|title=Moral Panic Analysis: Past, Present and Future|journal=Sociology Compass|date=July 2008|volume=2|issue=4|pages=1127–1144|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2008.00122.x|url=http://www.penelopeironstone.com/Critcher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people are seen as the enemy since their behavior is viewed as a danger to society. Consensus includes a distributed agreement that an actual threat is going to take place. This is where the media and other sources come in to aid in spreading of the panic. Disproportionality compares how people react and the actual seriousness of the condition. Volatility is when there is no longer any more panic.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Stanley|title=Folk devils and moral panics the creation of the mods and the rockers|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0203828259|edition=3rd|url=https://infodocks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/stanley_cohen_folk_devils_and_moral_panics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

==Causes==
* '''Grass Root Model''' describes that social panic commonly occurs first through the people in society. The feeling that something meaningful is threatened is dispersed throughout everyone in society. This sense of panic not only displays itself through the people but also through areas such as the media and political groups. The media serves as a way to present the [[public opinion]] about the reality of the situation. This theory states that the media can't report concern where none originally exists. The media and politicians are merely an outlet for displaying what people are expressing. Furthermore, the media can affect the way the public sees situations. An example of this theory is how people cause social panics due to nuclear power. After the [[Three Mile Island accident]], where there was a [[nuclear meltdown]],  people evacuated their homes even though no workers or residents living in that area were injured or killed. The only reason people in that area were aware of what was going on was due to the social panic that people caused when they reacted to the situation. This panic was caused by the general public, not by elites or interest group as in the models explained below.&lt;ref name="Goode Erich" /&gt;
* '''The Elite-Engineered Model''' explains that social panics are exaggerated or invented problems created by elites or people who are considered higher among others in society. These type of people produce fear among the other classes over an issue that is not considered dangerous to the society. The reason for these actions is to redirect the attention away from the problems that impact the elite or those in power. The people who are considered elite could be someone who runs a company or is very rich, as they may have connections with the media and are familiar with politicians that can make proposals in their favor. An example that illustrates this theory can be seen in the Russians, specifically the Czars, who turned the focus away from the anger of poverty by spreading a Jewish conspiracy. This caused mobs to form and kill Jewish communities. This capacity of the elites to control direction allows them to accomplish their own goals. They want to continue to benefit from the economic and political inequality.&lt;ref name="Victor Jeffrey S."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victor|first1=Jeffrey S.|title=Moral Panics and the Social Construction of Deviant Behavior: A Theory and Application to the Case of Ritual Child Abuse|journal=Sociological Perspectives|date=January 1998|volume=41|issue=3|pages=541–565|doi=10.2307/1389563|url=http://pascalfroissart.free.fr/3-cache/1998-victor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Interest-Group Model''' are made by people in [[interest group]]s who direct the public's focus on actions that are intended to be morally negative and be a danger to society. They want them to recognize a problem that affects them directly. Unlike in the Elite-Engineered model, the interest groups are the ones who create social panic. Interest groups believe they are providing a [[public service]] because they will benefit from what they are doing. They do this by using the media to influence public opinion. If they are successful in doing this, it will call attention to their particular interest group, gain the trust of society and wealth, and be more advanced than opposing interest groups. An example that demonstrates this theory is when politicians, in order to get reelected, used the issue of drug abuse in the United States to cause social panic. However, even though they wanted to remain in office they still believed that drug use was a problem they wanted to address to the public.&lt;ref name="Goode Erich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goode|first1=Erich|last2=Ben-Yehuda|first2=Nachman|title=Moral panics : the social construction of deviance|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4051-8934-7|pages=52–72|edition=2nd|url=http://www.penelopeironstone.com/GOODE3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The media==
The [[News media|media]] plays a crucial part in delivering social reaction. According to [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]], there are three processes that the media expresses: Exaggeration and distortion, prediction, and symbolization.

===Exaggeration and distortion===

In this process, the media can "over-report" with their choice of words. For example, the word "disturbance" can be used to mean having a noise complaint due to loud music next door and a group of people acting violently by throwing rocks and setting vehicles on fire. The wording of the stories can make a minor problem seem more serious than it really is. This can make people overreact in response to relatively minor problems and may lead them to believe that disturbances, acts of terrorism, riots, and instances have the same meaning.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

Furthermore, the headlines used by the media might cause society to act irrationally to a story about minor issues. They can be misleading and can report information that has nothing to do with the actual story. Negative words such as "violence" can be used when there was no violence involved. The media can also point to specific characteristics that are the reason for the crime that was committed. For example, a story can discuss a murder, but the headline might focus on the hoodie the culprit was wearing. Emphasizing the hoodie will draw attention to what the person was wearing instead of the murder that took place. This causes people to become paranoid and overreact when they see someone wearing clothing that looks suspicious.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Prediction===

This is where the media speculates that an incident might occur again. The media can report that an event will occur in the future, which is not always the case. People involved describe what should be done the next time it happens and what precautions should be taken. Predicting the future can cause people to constantly think about what could go wrong and lead to catastrophe. This can cause major stress and cause people to have social panics more often.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, there are certain situations where making predictions is necessary for security, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and other [[natural disaster]]s.

===Symbolization===

This involves stereotypes, words and images that possess symbolic powers that can cause different emotions. Symbolization can be described in three processes.  It includes words such as "deviant" and, as Cohen would say, "it becomes symbolic of a certain status."&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} By this he means that the word represents something meaningful. Then the object, which can include clothing, represents the word. Therefore, the object can also symbolize the status. Neutral words can symbolize an event or emotion. For example, people can have specific feelings connected to the word "[[Hiroshima]]" that remind them of the bombing that occurred there. Furthermore, the use of labels given to a person or word puts them in a certain group in society. Those individuals that are in that group are viewed and interpreted based on their label.

Symbolization, exaggeration and distortion are similar in the sense that they both use misleading headlines that creates negative symbols. For example, images can be posed to seem more dramatic or intense than they really are. Through both of these procedures, it is easy to cause people to come to conclusions that the news and photographs always display reality.&lt;ref name="Cohen Stanley" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

==Reaction==

After the events of [[9/11]], people were left in fear of crisis occurring again. According to [[Robert Wuthnow]] in his book ''Be Very Afraid'', people have responded aggressively, spending large amounts of money in fighting [[terrorism]]. The United States has spent that billions and trillions on [[national security|defense]] and [[homeland security]] respectively. However, the problem lies in how we react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wuthnow, Robert|year=2010|title=Be very afraid: the cultural response to terror, pandemics, environmental devastation, nuclear annihilation, and other threats|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=9780199730872}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

Since people have become more defensive, the focus needs to be on the correct way to act instead of an improper response. As mentioned earlier, predicting about the endless possibilities about what can happen can be just dangerous as the threat itself. People don't believe they can defend themselves from future terrorist's attacks. Individuals were constantly reminded of the concern and fear they should be experiencing by the tremendous amount of media coverage and books being published after the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name="Rothe Dawn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothe|first1=Dawn|last2=Muzzatti|first2=Stephen L.|title=Enemies Everywhere: Terrorism, Moral Panic, and US Civil Society|journal=Critical Criminology|date=November 2004|volume=12|issue=3|pages=327–350|doi=10.1007/s10612-004-3879-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event caused "personal engagement" throughout the country. In Boston, people questioned others about ties they had with [[Osama bin Laden]]. These attacks were unlike any other attacks since people experienced them firsthand whether on the news or in person. The natural response of Americans during this time was to take action—facing the fear of terrorism, whether by taking revenge or through urging caution.

==Criticism==
[[Angela McRobbie]] and [[Sarah Thornton]] claim that Stanley Cohen's work on moral panic is outdated and argue that more modern information is required. McRobbie suggests that idea of moral panic has become so common that the media knowingly and mindfully uses it. Thornton argues that the media originally caused moral panics inadvertently; however, the media now manipulates it on its own.&lt;ref name="North Wales"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deall Trosedd :: Understanding Crime: Moral Panics|url=http://www.14-19nw.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=8651|website=www.14-19nw.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yvonne Jewkes acknowledged problems and formed concepts about moral panic. To begin with, she described the term as vague and the failure to clarify the position of the public "as media audiences or a body of opinion".&lt;ref name="Critcher Chas" /&gt; She goes on to explain that the social panics are not gladly received by the government. There is also no proof that society has an extensive social anxiety surrounding them. Jewkew, as also mentioned by McRobbie, believes that moral panic is widely used by the media. She concluded that in order for this to become a "sound conceptual basis" it needs to be revised and carefully improved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4750">The '''Soviet Jewry movement''' was an international human rights campaign that advocated for the right of Jews in the Soviet Union to emigrate.

The earliest organized effort was the Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism, a grassroots organization that brought attention to the plight of Soviet Jews from 1963 until 1983.  It began as a study group led by three of the founding members of Beth Israel - The West Temple in 1963: Louis Rosenblum, Herbert Caron, and Abe Silverstein.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thewesttemple.com/about-us/our-history3 Our History]," section "The Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism." Beth Israel – The West Temple, Cleveland, Ohio. Retrieved 2015-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the council included prominent rabbis, pastors, priests, and city officials, many initial council members were fellow congregants.  As the first such group in the world, this organization spawned other local councils and a national organization. Between 1964-69, the Cleveland council developed educational tools, such as organizational handbooks for other communities, the newsletter Spotlight, and media presentations. They also devised protest strategies that became integral to the movement to free Soviet Jewry.  One of the council's most successful activities was the People-to-People program of the late 1960s, which represented 50,000 members.

Although not officially sponsored by Beth Israel – The West Temple, the temple provided office space to the council from 1964–78, and the council periodically reported to the congregation's Social Action Committee. Although the Cleveland council was still active in 1985, by the late 1970s the Jewish Community Federation had taken over the major local organizing effort for Soviet Jewry. By 1993, the Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism no longer needed to exist, as it had accomplished its mission, and the Soviet Union had also ceased to exist.

Later, [[Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry]], founded by [[Yaakov (Jacob) Birnbaum|Jacob Birnbaum]] at [[Yeshiva University]] in 1964. In 1969, the [[Jewish Defense League]] began a series of protests and vigils while employing militant activism in order to publicize the persecution of [[Soviet Jewry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "Silent No More" Saving the Jews of Russia, The American Jewish Effort, 1967-1989|last = Feingold|first = Henry L.|publisher = Syracuse University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0-8156-3101-4|location = Syracuse, New York|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union of Councils for Soviet Jews]] was formed in 1970 as an umbrella organization of all groups working to win the right to emigrate for oppressed Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union.

The movement was represented in Israel by [[Nativ]], a clandestine agency that sought to publicize the cause of Soviet Jewry and encourage their emigration to Israel.

==Tensions between wings of movement==
Throughout the timeline of the movement to free Jews from the USSR -- 1964 - 1991 -- tensions existed between the Jewish Establishment groups, represented by the umbrella organization the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry and its successor the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. Differences revolved around policy and action.  Behind the scenes, the clandestine Israeli Soviet Jewry office, Nativ (known as the Lishka), supported the ACSJ and NCSJ, which it had helped create.  Such conflicts between Establishment and nascent, independent groups -- such as between the NAACP and SNCC in the civil rights movement -- are not new.&lt;ref&gt; Beckerman, Gal.

Populations can be diverse topics such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;
See [[glossary of probability and statistics]].

When [[census]] data cannot be collected, [[statistician]]s collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey [[sample (statistics)|samples]]. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An [[experimental study]] involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an [[observational study]] does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: [[descriptive statistics]], which summarize data from a sample using [[Index (statistics)|indexes]] such as the [[mean]] or [[standard deviation]], and [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]], which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).&lt;ref name=LundResearchLtd&gt;{{cite web|last=Lund Research Ltd. |url=https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |title=Descriptive and Inferential Statistics |publisher=statistics.laerd.com |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a ''distribution'' (sample or population): ''[[central tendency]]'' (or ''location'') seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' (or ''variability'') characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of [[probability theory]], which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the [[statistical hypothesis testing|test of the relationship]] between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: [[Type I error]]s (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and [[Type II error]]s (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Hypothesis Testing Errors?|url = http://statistics.about.com/od/Inferential-Statistics/a/Type-I-And-Type-II-Errors.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ([[Bias (statistics)|bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from [[calculus]] and [[probability theory]]. In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce tests such as descriptive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.answers.org.za/index.php/tutorials|title= How to Calculate Descriptive Statistics|publisher=Answers Consulting|date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical statistics is the application of [[mathematics]] to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear algebra]], [[stochastic analysis]], [[differential equations]], and [[measure-theoretic probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakshmikantham,|first=ed. by D.

Dekker|location=New York|isbn=0824706609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schervish|first=Mark J.|title=Theory of statistics|date=1995|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0387945466|edition=Corr. 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In applying statistics to a problem, it is common practice to start with a [[statistical population|population]] or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal".

Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation called [[census]]). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. ''[[Descriptive statistics]]'' can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like race).

When a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, ''[[inferential statistics]]'' is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of [[time series]] or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].

== Data collection ==

===Sampling===
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through [[statistical model]]s. The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1082|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in [[statistical theory|mathematical statistics]] to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method.
The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction—[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

===Experimental and observational studies===
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables on dependent variables]]. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[Experiment|experimental studies]] and [[Observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.
An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve [[Scientific control|experimental manipulation]]. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.
While the tools of data analysis work best on data from [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized studies]], they are also applied to other kinds of data—like [[natural experiment]]s and [[Observational study|observational studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman (statistician)|Freedman, D.A.]] (2005) ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-67105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;—for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., [[Difference in differences|Difference in differences estimation]] and [[instrumental variable]]s, among many others) that produce [[consistent estimator]]s.

====Experiments====
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:
# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.
# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and  [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.
# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.
# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.
# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.&lt;ref name="pmid17608932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observational study====
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[cohort study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=Kenneth J|editor2-last=Greenland|editor2-first=Sander|editor3-last=Lash|editor3-first=Timothy|title=Modern Epidemiology|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=100|edition=3rd|language=English|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[case-control study]] is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

== Types of data ==
{{main|Statistical data type||Levels of measurement}}

Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with [[data type]] in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the [[Boolean data type]], polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned [[integer]]s in the [[integer (computer science)|integral data type]], and continuous variables with the [[real data type]] involving [[floating point]] computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Mosteller, F., &amp; Tukey, J.W. (1977). ''Data analysis and regression''. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J.A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chrisman | first1 = Nicholas R | year = 1998 | title = Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography | url = | journal = Cartography and Geographic Information Science | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 231–242 | doi=10.1559/152304098782383043}}&lt;/ref&gt; van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. "The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer" (Hand, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;82).&lt;ref&gt;Hand, D.J. (2004).

== Terminology and theory of inferential statistics ==

===Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities===
Consider [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (IID) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these IID variables.&lt;ref name=Piazza&gt;Piazza Elio, Probabilità e Statistica, Esculapio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A [[statistic]] is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but ''not a function of unknown parameters''. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.

Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[Sample mean#Sample mean|sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[Sample covariance#Sample covariance|sample covariance]].

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if its [[expected value]] is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]] estimators which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].

===Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis===
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/|title=Cohen (1994) The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05) |publisher=YourStatsGuru.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (status quo) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is maintained unless H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is supported by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but ''fails to reject'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. While one can not "prove" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for type II errors.

What [[statisticians]] call an [[alternative hypothesis]] is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the [[null hypothesis]].

===Error===
Working from a [[null hypothesis]], two basic forms of error are recognized:
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive".
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative".

[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], a [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.

[[File:Linear least squares(2).svg|thumb|right|A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.]]

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called "[[least squares|methods of least squares]]" in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in [[polynomial least squares]], which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J.A., Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interval estimation===
{{main|Interval estimation}}

[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|right|[[Confidence intervals]]: the red line is true value for the mean in this example, the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.]]

Most studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by "probability"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

===Significance===
{{main|Statistical significance}}

Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).

[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|right|In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the [[test statistic]], the [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values to the right of the observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the [[p-value]] is represented by the green area.]]

The standard approach&lt;ref name="Piazza"/&gt; is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true ([[statistical significance]]) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The [[statistical power]] of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of [[statistical significance]] may be subject to debate, the [[p-value]] is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the [[test statistic]]. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]]):
* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the [[effect size|size]] or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka [[prosecutor's fallacy]]: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by [[Bayesian inference]], although it requires establishing a [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name=Ioannidis2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J.P.A. | authorlink1 = John P.A.

* Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis.
* As everything in [[inferential statistics]] it relies on sample size, and therefore under [[fat tails]] p-values may be seriously mis-computed.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

== Misuse ==
{{main|Misuse of statistics}}

[[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc. New York.  {{isbn|0-393-31072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, "[[Lies, damned lies, and statistics|There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics]]". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]''&lt;ref name=Huff/&gt; outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warne | first1 = R. Lazo | last2 = Ramos | first2 = T. | last3 = Ritter | first3 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Statistical Methods Used in Gifted Education Journals, 2006–2010 | url = | journal = Gifted Child Quarterly | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 134–149 | doi = 10.1177/0016986212444122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Statistics in archaeology | pages = 2093–2100 | first1 = Robert D. | last1 = Drennan | title =  Encyclopedia of Archaeology | year = 2008 | publisher = Elsevier Inc. | editor-first = Deborah M. | editor-last = Pearsall | isbn = 978-0-12-373962-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse can occur when conclusions are [[Hasty generalization|overgeneralized]] and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jerome B. |title=Misuse of Statistics |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |date=December 1938 |volume=33 |issue=204 |pages=657–674 |location=JSTOR |doi=10.1080/01621459.1938.10502344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology" /&gt; Unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well [[Sampling (statistics)|represented]].&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics" /&gt; To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.&lt;ref name="Modern Elementary Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freund|first=J.E.|authorlink = John E.

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:&lt;ref name="How to Lie with Statistics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Darrell |title=How to Lie with Statistics |year=1954 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |author2=Irving Geis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simple Confounding Case.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|The [[confounding variable]] problem: ''X'' and ''Y'' may be correlated, not because there is causal relationship between them, but because both depend on a third variable ''Z''. ''Z'' is called a confounding factor.]]

===Misinterpretation: correlation===
The concept of [[correlation]] is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See [[Correlation does not imply causation]].)

== History of statistical science ==

[[File:Jerôme Cardan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Gerolamo Cardano]], the earliest pioneer on the mathematics of probability.]]

{{main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}

Some scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1663, with the publication of ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality'' by [[John Graunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) "The Founder of Statistics". ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4): 321–328. {{jstor|1400906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Mathematical [[probability theory]] arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in [[Medieval Roman law|medieval law]] and by philosophers such as [[Juan Caramuel]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal, Johns Hopkins Univ Pr 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[method of least squares]] was first described by  [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805.

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Karl Pearson]], a founder of mathematical statistics.]]

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYFRAAAAMAAJ|title=Studies in the history of statistical method|author=Helen Mary Walker|year=1975|publisher=Arno Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well.

[[Ronald Fisher]] coined the term [[null hypothesis]] during the [[Lady tasting tea]] experiment, which "is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher|1971|loc=Chapter II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment, Section 8. The Null Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;OED quote: '''1935''' R.A. Fisher, ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' ii. 19, "We may speak of this hypothesis as the 'null hypothesis', and the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by [[William Gosset]], and reached its culmination in the insights of [[Ronald Fisher]], who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper ''[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]'', which was the first to use the statistical term, [[variance]], his classic 1925 work ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' and his 1935 ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/00028312003003223 | title = The Influence of Fisher's "The Design of Experiments" on Educational Research Thirty Years Later | year = 1966 | author = Stanley, J.C. | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 3 | pages = 223 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Box, JF | title = R.A.

Comptes Rendus Biologies (333) 134:144&lt;/ref&gt; a concept in [[sexual selection]] about a positive feedback runaway affect found in [[evolution]].

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between [[Egon Pearson]] and [[Jerzy Neyman]] in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of "[[Type I and type II errors|Type II]]" error, power of a test and [[confidence interval]]s. [[Jerzy Neyman]] in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J | year = 1934 | title = On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection | url = | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 557–625 | jstor=2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze [[Big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/|title=Science in a Complex World – Big Data: Opportunity or Threat?|work=Santa Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Applied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics===
''Applied statistics'' comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoletseas, M.M. (2014) "Statistics: Concepts and Examples." {{isbn|978-1500815684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A. (1994) ''Introduction to Statistics: Concepts and Applications'', pp. 5–9. West Group. {{isbn|978-0-314-03309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theoretical statistics'' concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to [[statistical inference]], as well as encompassing ''mathematical statistics''. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of [[probability distribution]]s necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of [[computational statistics]] and the [[design of experiments]].

===Machine learning and data mining===
There are two applications for [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]: data management and data analysis.  Statistics tools are necessary for the data analysis.

===Statistics in society===
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of [[academic discipline]]s, including [[natural]] and [[social science]]s, government, and business. [[Statistical consultant]]s can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.

===Statistical computing===

[[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[gretl]], an example of an [[List of open source statistical packages|open source statistical package]]]]

{{main|Computational statistics}}

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as permutation tests and the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as [[Mathematica]],  [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and  [[R (programming language)|R]].

===Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts===
Traditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardized methodology that was "required learning" in most sciences.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This tradition has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.{{according to whom|date=April 2014}} Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.
* In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.
* Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.
* Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.

== Specialized disciplines ==
{{main|List of fields of application of statistics}}

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]],  [[computational biology]],  [[computational sociology]],  [[network biology]],  [[social science]],  [[sociology]] and  [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)
* [[Applied information economics]]
* [[Astrostatistics]] (statistical evaluation of astronomical data)
* [[Biostatistics]]
* [[Business statistics]]
* [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]])
* [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data)
* [[Data science]]
* [[Demography]] (statistical study of populations)
* [[Econometrics]] (statistical analysis of economic data)
* [[E-statistics|Energy statistics]]
* [[Engineering statistics]]
* [[Epidemiology]] (statistical analysis of disease)
* [[Geography]] and [[geographic information system]]s, specifically in [[spatial analysis]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Medical statistics]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Psychological statistics]]
* [[Reliability engineering]]
* [[Social statistics]]
* [[Statistical mechanics]]
}}

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]]{{\}}[[Resampling (statistics)|Jackknife resampling]]
* [[Multivariate statistics]]
* [[Statistical classification]]
* [[Structured data analysis (statistics)]]
* [[Structural equation modelling]]
* [[Survey methodology]]
* [[Survival analysis]]
* Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] – known as  [[Sabermetrics]] – and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]]
}}

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.

A '''student fee''' is a [[fee]] charged to students at a school, college, university or other place of learning that is in addition to any [[matriculation]] and/or [[Tuition payments|tuition fee]]s. It may be charged to support [[student organization]]s and [[student activities]] (for which it can be called an '''activity fee''') or for [[:wikt:intercollegiate|intercollegiate]] programs such as [[intramural sports]] or [[Visiting scholar|visiting academic]]s; or, at a [[public university]] or college, as a means to remedy shortfalls in [[Subsidy|state funding]] (in which case it can often be called a '''technology fee'''). Further fees may then be charged for features and facilities such as insurance, health and parking provision.

== United States ==

===Constitutionality of activity fees===
In the United States, the [[constitutionality]] of [[:wikt:mandatory|mandatory]] student activity fees has been adjudicated several times by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Most recently, the Court has ruled that public universities may subsidize {{clarify span|campus speech|date=February 2015}} by means of a mandatory student activity fees so long as such fees {{clarify span|are allocated to groups with viewpoint neutrality|date=February 2015}} (see ''[[Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth]]'' {{ussc|529|217|2000}}).

'''Tadesse Meskela''' is the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]] of Ethiopia and was featured in the documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]''. He is a proponent of [[Fair trade|fair-trade]], and speaks publicly in support of it around the world. 

He grew up in the countryside outside Addis Ababa, Bishoftu. Tadesse Meskela studied his way out of poverty and eventually made it to university. By the early 1990s he was working for the state Agricultural Bureau. He attended a two-month co-operative training placement in Japan and was inspired to develop a cooperative union system to help Ethiopian coffee farmers attain a fairer recompense for their produce. The Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union was established in 1999. In the year 2004, the union has facilitated the constructed of four new schools, seventeen additional classrooms, four health centres, two clean water supply stations, and in terms of dividends, $2 million has been given back to the farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13697">'''The Open Theater''' was an [[experimental theatre]] group active from 1963 to 1973.

==Foundation==
It was founded in [[New York City]] by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by [[Theatre director|director]] [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman.  [[Megan Terry]] (often left out of the list of the founders of the Open Theatre due to her being a woman and pioneering in feminist drama, but nonetheless a co-founder of the group), [[Sam Shepard]], Peter Feldman, and Joseph Chaikin collectively founded the Open Theater; Chaikin joined after leaving the Living Theater following the arrest of [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] for tax evasion.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/nyregion/joseph-chaikin-67-actor-and-innovative-director.html|title=Joseph Chaikin 67; Actor and Innovative Director|last=Blumenthal|first=Ralph|date=2003-06-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He felt that the Living Theater had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism.  He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG01/mincks/brief.html|title=tableofcontents|website=xroads.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group's intent was to continue Chilton's exploration of a "post-method", post-absurd acting technique, by way of a collaborative and  wide-ranging process that included exploration of political, artistic, and social issues, which were felt to be critical to the success of avant-garde theatre. The company, developing work through an [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as "sound and movement" and "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with  [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s "poor theater" in Poland.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=Eileen|title=Joseph Chaikin: Exploring at the Boundaries of Theater|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521285895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22the+open+theater%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PE6A_ljUbZ&amp;sig=UxCAImzHryU0uyzFhrge2GmjIYc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p74JUOWzMYm4rQH3ivXICg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to playwright [[Megan Terry]] the notion of a minimalist aesthetic was fueled by the company's quest to achieve narrative insight and political accountability through the body of the actor:

{{quote|During the sixties we were concerned with stripping away. Chaikin and the Open Theater actors worked to reveal the actor's imagination as projected by the actor's presence. We showed that full, exciting theatrical productions could be done with nothing but actors and two benches or four chairs or only a bare stage. It was not only a matter of economics, it was essential to demonstrate the profound power of the actor's imagination and the actor's ability to create place; i.e. scenery through the power of belief via total technique and through the use of transformation not only of character but of time and place.&lt;ref name=PAJ&gt;{{cite journal |last=Terry |first=Megan |author2=Sam Shepard |author3=Stanley Kauffmann |author4=Robert Patrick |author5=Lawrence Kornfeld |author6=Crystal Field |author7=Richard Kostelanetz |author8=Carl Weber |author9=Wynn Handman |author10=Rochelle Owens |author11=Carolee Schneemann |author12=Michael Feingold|title=American Experimental Theatre: Then and Now|journal=Performing Arts Journal|date=Autumn 1977|volume=2|issue=2|pages=13–24 |jstor=3245333}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The Open Theater formed as an offshoot of the Living Theater.  The Living Theater initially divided because actor Joseph Chaikin felt that the troupe had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism.  He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG01/mincks/brief.html|title=tableofcontents|website=xroads.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatrical Explorations ==
Chaikin’s theatrical exploration came from within; he was interested in the personal experience of the actor, and of the actor’s relationship to the rest of the community.  He developed improvisational exercises designed to help the actor become freer.  The technique was initially inspired by method acting, in which the actor draws on his or her own experiences and emotions, but the goal of Chaikin’s work was to free the actor from the natural restraints of method acting.  He called his technique the “sound and movement” technique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In his book entitled ''The Presence of the Actor'', Chaikin wrote  “Traditional acting in America has become a blend of that same kind of synthetic ‘feeling’ and sentimentality which characterizes the Fourth of July parade, Muzak, church services, and political campaigns.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  This further explains the purpose for the Open Theater and the reasoning behind opening such a space.

== Ensemble Work ==
Chaikin used ensemble casts as a way to explore the relationship between the actor and the outside world.  He relied on the performers to interact not as characters in fictional settings, but as real people in real situations.  While the Living Theater’s ensemble was very external and audience oriented, Chaikin’s was internal and oriented within the troupe itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1963, Chaikin said “Working together, we teach ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/nyregion/joseph-chaikin-67-actor-and-innovative-director.html|title=Joseph Chaikin 67; Actor and Innovative Director|last=Blumenthal|first=Ralph|date=2003-06-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ensemble worked in the "poor theater" style.  There was no need for sets, costumes, props, or any of the other theatrical elements.  There were no moving lights, only enough stationary light to be able tosee.  There was no music, instead, the actors would use their voices to create the sound effects.  There were hardly any aspects of "rich" theater involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/genres/poor-theatre-iid-21665|title=Poor Theatre - Drama Online|website=www.dramaonlinelibrary.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his reasons for using ensembles instead of a traditional cast and show, Chaikin said:

“I felt a terrific longing for a kind of ensemble.  I wanted to play with actors, actors who felt a sensitivity for one another… In order to come to a vocabulary, we had to teach each other: we had no ambitions other than to meet and play around… Off-off Broadway’s impulse was a terrific dissatisfaction with what is possible on Broadway… Off-off broadway is really an attack on the fourth wall.  I want to destroy the fourth-wall business.  I have difficulty believing most of what happens on Broadway.  Mary Martin’s like a character in a television commercial: nobody’s like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.kent.edu/special-collections-and-archives/joseph-chaikin-papers|title=Joseph Chaikin papers {{!}} Kent State University Libraries|website=www.library.kent.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The ensemble met on Spring Street in New York, in a warehouse.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

== Disbanding and further works ==
Chaikin disbanded the Open Theater in 1973, amid fears that it was becoming too institutionalized.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  He later went to work for the Public Theater.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  Chaikin continued to create workshops, but he was increasingly working on mainstream projects.&lt;ref name="bombmagazine.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2252/joseph-chaikin|title=BOMB Magazine — Joseph Chaikin by Liz Diamond|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
During the first two years of its existence, there were no productions performed by the Open Theater.  Instead, there were occasional open rehearsals or workshops.&lt;ref name="bombmagazine.org"/&gt;

The first major production was ''The Serpent,'' and it toured both nationally and internationally.''The Serpent'' typifies what is extraordinary about the Open Theater. The production is a perfect example of experimental theatre at the time and how willing the company was to employ unconventional theatre techniques that were based on improvisation in order to created a very pointed piece. According to the playwright Jean Claude Van Itallie, a member of the company, the piece was conceived with the idea that the actors would act as priests and that there would be a sense of one-ness amongst the congregation that they are questioning the same things in which the priest is questioning. Questions such as where does evil come from? What provokes people to commit murder? Is maintaining innocence a possibility within the contaminated world that which we walk upon? Though most of the piece is done in choreographed movement, mime, human sound-effects, hand-held instruments, there is text as well coming directly from the Bible along with a number of speeches written exclusively for the show.

The plot of ''The Serpent'' takes an extremely non-direct route in order to answer these questions. The play opens with a group of actors onstage where one recites a graphic description of an autopsy while the other members of the group are creating different sound effects and movements that match the text. Then the remaining members of the ensemble join the stage to partake in a stylized reenactment of the John F Kennedy assassination. One actor counts slowly to twelve while the other actors partake in the reenactment in slow motion, moving to a new position and new sound effect per count. This scene is run forward, backwards, and out of order to the point that it becomes so ritualized that there is now an element of comedy in play within this depiction of someone’s untimely death. There is a sense of realization of how the horror of the murder rushes over the ensemble as they break free from their rigid formation and become instead a group of individuals fleeing from the evil that has just occurred. The ensemble then moves to the retelling of the banishment of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Four actors take the shape of the serpent that convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and are present as Eve then moves to convince Adam to partake of it. After being banished by God from the Garden, the actors then partake in a ritual enactment of the first true discovery of sexual love which takes place alongside a recitation of how the descendants of Adam begat the rest of Mankind. This passionate celebration of sexuality is very much embraced onstage. The ensemble eventually collapses slowly to the floor when, at first, a hum falls over the group which soon turns into song. They eventually rise to their feet and travel down the aisles embracing audience members and smiling until the song is complete.

''The Serpent'' aims to remind the audience of the idea that we are all caught in a neverending battle between the fact that we are neither as innocent nor as guilty as we may think we might be, having fallen victim to the at times foul planet that we reside on. The goal of the play was not to find answers the specific questions which were asked, but rather to visualize these inquiries through improvisation and to help the actors, as well as the audience members, to find their own personal truths.

Some of the company's best known works include Terry's ''[[Viet Rock]]'' (1966) with musical compositions by [[Marianne de Pury]],  [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]]'s ''[[America Hurrah]]'' (1966) and ''The Serpent'' (1969).

Other works included ''Endgame, American Hurrah, The Mutation Show, Nightwalk, and Terminal.''

Members of the theatre simulated an [[orgy]] in Death Valley in a scene in the 1970 movie ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.&lt;ref name=Canby&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=Screen: Antonioni's 'Zabriskie Point'|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=10 Feb 1970|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04E2DB1F3FE034BC4852DFB466838B669EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Justice Department later investigated the film questioning whether the orgy violated the [[Mann Act]] which criminalized the interstate transport of females for "immoral purposes".  However, the movie producers pointed out that no actual sex had taken place and that the actors had not crossed a state line since the town of  [[Zabriskie Point]] is in California.&lt;ref name=Flatley&gt;{{cite news|last=Flatley|first=Guy|title=Antonioni Defends 'Zabriskie Point': 'I Love this country'; Antonioni: 'I love America'|accessdate=20 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 Feb 1970|pages=D15|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/119016835|publisher=ProQuest Historical Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the company's dissolution, its members formed The Talking Band, and Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble and [[Spiderwoman Theater]].   Chaikin went on to have a celebrated career as a theatre director until his death in 2003.

'''Theodor Wolff''' (2 August 1868 – 23 September 1943) was a [[Germany|German]] writer who was influential as a journalist, critic and newspaper editor.&lt;ref name=Kühn&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108–109|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and died in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdw-berlin.de/vertiefung/biografien/personenverzeichnis/biografie/view-bio/theodor-wolff/?no_cache=1|title=Short biography of Theodor Wolff|publisher= [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]]|access-date= 27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1933 he was the chief editor of the politically liberal newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''.

His talent as a writer won praise from an unlikely quarter: In 1939 [[Joseph Goebbels]] recommended his [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] staff to study Wolff's contributions in back numbers of the newspaper that he had edited. According to Goebbels, despite his being Jewish, the quality of Wolff's writing was matched by only very few in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108|date=30 September 2014|quote=Das Lob kam von höchster Stelle, doch es war verlogen und zynisch. Sie sollten mal in den alten Bänden des ''Berliner Tageblatts'' nachlesen, empfahl Propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels 1939 seinen Parteischreibern,  bei einem 'gewissen Theodor Wolff', der 'zwar Jude' sei, 'aber schreiben konnte wie nur ganz wenige in Deutschland'.}} What Goebels did not mention was that as a younger man he had himself on at least one occasion applied to work for the newspaper in question.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
Theodor Wolff was born in [[Berlin]], second of the four recorded children of a fabric wholesaler from [[Silesia]] called Adam Wolff by his marriage to Recha, née Davidsohn. Recha was a doctor's daughter from [[Danzig]]. Wolff grew up in a [[Grand Burgher|prosperous]] Jewish family. He rapidly achieved good results at the prestigious [[:de:Königliches Wilhelms-Gymnasium (Berlin)|King William I Grammar school]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Goldmann&gt;Christel Goldmann: ''Distanzierte Beobachtung: Theodor Wolff und das Judentum. "…&amp;nbsp;es sind zwar nicht meine Kerzen, aber ihr Licht ist warm"''. Oldenburg 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married in 1902, in Paris, the actress Marie Louise Charlotte Anna Hickethier (known as Änne), coming from a Protestant [[Prussia]]n family. The couple had three children: Richard Wolff (born in [[Paris]], 14 June 1906), Rudolf Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 9 July 1907) and Lilly Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 7 August 1909). The children were baptised as Protestants.

===Journalism mostly===
In 1887 Wolff's cousin [[Rudolf Mosse]] recruited him to his successful publishing conglomerate. Mosse was 25&amp;nbsp;years older than Wolff, to whom he provided a thorough commercial and journalistic training across all the departments of his publishing business, the "Mosse-Verlag".&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn&gt;Peter de Mendelssohn: ''Zeitungsstadt Berlin. Menschen und Mächte in der Geschichte der deutschen Presse''. Frankfurt am Main 1982, page 180 et seq&lt;/ref&gt; During these years Wolff also found time to write some early novels, inspired by [[Theodor Fontane]] whom he greatly admired, and several plays which were staged in Berlin,&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; though in his memoirs he would later describe these as "not particularly distinguished". In 1889 he was one of the ten co-founders of the Berlin theatre company, [[:de:Freie Bühne (Verein)|''Freie Bühne'']] ("Free stage").

Wollf's written contributions to the ''Tageblatt'' focused initially on cultural matters and literature, but he soon switched his focus towards political journalism.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; An early journalistic success at the newspaper was a daily bulletin on the health of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|the emperor]] (who was dying of throat cancer). Emperor Frederick died in June 1888 and Wolff embarked on an itinerant career, writing pieces and sending them in to Berlin by telegraph from, successively, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Italy. In 1894 the paper sent him to Paris, where he would live for the next twelve years.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

As the [[Paris]] correspondent of the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' Wolff, identified in print only as "our Paris correspondent", produced numerous contributions covering public life in France. During 1896 he became known for his coverage of the [[Dreyfus affair]], one of the most high-profile news stories of the decade in western Europe.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; His early ambitions to become a novelist were now being overtaken by his success as a journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Editor-in-chief to the ''Berliner Tageblatt''===
====1906–1918====
In autumn 1906, Rudolf Mosse offered Theodor Wolff the top job at the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''. Between 1906 and 1933 Wolff served the ''Tageblatt'' as editor-in-chief, developing it into one of Germany's most influential newspapers. Circulation under his stewardship rose from 100,000 to more than 300,000.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His powerful prose was notably on display in the Monday editions of the paper for which he wrote the [[Editorial|lead article]], frequently exhorting fellow citizens to political participation. In respect of foreign policy, he quickly positioned the ''Tageblatt'' in opposition to "great power politics", imperial and military assertiveness and the risk of international isolation to which these were leading Germany. On domestic issues the paper's attitude under Wolff favoured [[civil rights]] and a liberal-democratic approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Henning Zabel: "Rudolf Mosse". In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie''. Vol. 18. Berlin 1997, pp. 213–217.&lt;/ref&gt; advocating a "parliamentarisation" ("Parlamentarisierung") of the [[Constitution of the German Empire|constitution]] and vigorously opposing the [[Prussian three-class franchise|"Dreiklassenwahlrecht"]]&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; which had been introduced in 1849 and which was, by the beginning of the twentieth century, widely perceived as a badly flawed application of the democratic ideal.

At this time Wolff promoted numerous writers including [[Victor Auburtin]] whose individualistic approach he valued and who played an important part in defining the newspaper's liberal profile.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmar Klute: "Der Kulturkonservative. Die deutsch-französische Geschichte des [[Victor Auburtin]]"  (SZ-Serie über große Journalisten, IX). In: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 3 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Germany's traditionalist [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Bernhard von Bülow]], refused any interviews or statements to the ''Tageblatt'' while his successor, [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]], instructed all government departments to steer well clear of the newspaper's reports and opinions.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

In July 1916, the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' was temporarily banned. Wolff reacted by refusing to publish anything for several months, which was picked up and used abroad in the savage [[British propaganda during World War I|propaganda battle]] that was a major element in the increasingly desperate conduct of the [[First World War]]. Wolff refused to compromise his editorial line, and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' continued to promote the politically toxic view that the only route to a lasting peace was for Germany to come to an understanding with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]] (Ed.): ''Theodor Wolff. Tagebücher 1914–1919. Der Erste Weltkrieg und die Entstehung der Weimarer Republik in Tagebüchern, Leitartikeln und Briefen des Chefredakteurs am "Berliner Tageblatt" und Mitbegründers der "Deutschen Demokratischen Partei"''. München 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1918–1933====
In November 1918 Theodor Wolff was one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP),&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP/&gt; committed to individual freedom and social responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He had himself played a central role in the party's defining manifesto, but he took no leadership position within the DDP preferring, not for the last time, the role of a powerful newspaper editor. It was in this role that he called on the government to reject the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]]: ''Theodor Wolff. Ein Leben mit der Zeitung''. Econ Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], who in the early summer was briefly the German Chancellor, invited Wolff to take on the position of German Ambassador to [[Paris]] but, again, Wolff opted to remain a Berlin-based journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

On 4 December 1926 Wolff resigned his [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] membership. The resignation came in response to the acceptance by a large number of the party's [[:de:Liste der Reichstagsabgeordneten der Weimarer Republik|Reichstag Members]] of tightened censorship laws against so-called dirty and trashy literature.&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP&gt;Horst Wagner: [http://luise-berlin.de/BMS/bmstext/9811gesa.htm „Die Gründung der DDP 1918“.]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} In: ''[[Berlinische Monatsschrift]]'', 11/1998 beim [[:de:Luisenstädtischer Bildungsverein|Luisenstädtischen Bildungsverein]].&lt;/ref&gt;   ([[Kurt Tucholsky]], one of the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most high-profile contributors, had also, on the world stage, sharply condemned DDP support for these measures.) Wolff nevertheless remained powerfully influential, a leading advocate for democracy and moderation, welcomed as a dinner guest by various government ministers.&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt; Wolff was also continuing to attract important writers as contributors for the ''Tageblatt''. In 1926 he persuaded the pugnaciously liberal journalist-lawyer [[Rudolf Olden]]&lt;ref&gt;"He was a German Liberal of the best sort, rather more pugnacious than the average British Liberal, because he had more to fight against." – [[Gilbert Murray]] on Rudolf Olden: Foreword to ''The History of Liberty in Germany'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; to move his base from [[Vienna]] to [[Berlin]].

Germany's military defeat and the catastrophic economic aftermath did much to discredit democratic politics during the 1920s, which saw a corresponding growth in support for right wing politics, which in their turn favoured somewhat 'tribal' definitions of the political sphere. Theodor Wolff and his ''Berliner Tageblatt'' (the "Jewish news-sheet", ''das Judenblatt'') were increasingly targeted by [[:de:Deutschnationale Bewegung|nationalists]] and during the 1920s nationalists were increasingly setting the country's political agenda. His name started to appear on the death lists of various radical-right and populist groups, causing Wolff to become anxious that he might share the fate of [[Walther Rathenau]], the generally popular Jewish [[Foreign Minister]] and fellow [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] member who had been shot dead by a gang of [[Ernst Werner Techow|three extremists]] in June 1922. Anxiety that he might be murdered by racist extremists remained with him for the rest of his life. His counterpart at the right wing [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg media group]], editor in chief [[:de:Friedrich Hussong|Friedrich Hussong]], stirred up popular hatred of Wolff, whom he identified as a representing the liberal metropolitan press.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn/&gt;

The [[German federal election, 1930|Reichstag election of September 1930]] transformed the country's political landscape, with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist party]] increasing its share of the popular vote from 2.6% to 18.3%, which under the country's multi-party system left it as the second largest party in the Reichstag. Right wing extremism was suddenly mainstream and at the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' the publisher's proprietor, [[Hans Lachmann-Mosse]], who had taken over from [[Rudolf Mosse|his father-in-law]], mandated a turn towards the right for the newspaper. The business was also in financial trouble thanks to poorly timed investment decisions and intensified competition from the by now openly anti-Semitic [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg Group]].&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Exile===
The night of 27 to 28 February 1933 was the night of the [[Reichstag fire]]. It was also the night on which Theodor Wolff, whose hostility to a Nazi future was undiminished and who had been warned by colleagues that his name was on the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] death list, fled Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His initial destination, traveling via [[Munich]], was the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]].  From there he moved on to Switzerland. However, the Swiss refused to issue him with a residence permit and by the end of 1933 Theodor Wolff and his wife had ended up in [[Nice]], which since 1860 had been part of France.

Theodor Wolff's last [[Editorial|lead article]] in the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' appeared on 5 March 1933, the day of the last multi-party [[German federal election, March 1933|German election]] until 1949. In March 1933 the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s proprietor (who himself, being Jewish, was effectively deprived of control over his business later in the month), removed Wolff from his editorship responding to political pressure&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; following the flight from Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; In May 1933 Wolff's books were among those listed by the government for the public [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]].  Wolff celebrated his 65th&amp;nbsp;birthday in 1933 and played very little part in the political struggles of the many German Jewish exiles who were gravitating to Nice at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff fought vainly against the rise of National Socialism, but as an exile he turned away from political issues: After his former newspaper, the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', reported on the so-called [[Night of the Long Knives|"Röhm-Putsch"]] of 30&amp;nbsp;June 1934 under the headline "Crackdown!" ("Durchgegriffen!") he cancelled his subscription.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions nevertheless remained clear enough, and on 26 October 1937 he was deprived of his German citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the legal consequences of this expatriation, cf. the introduction (p. xii-xiii) to Michael Hepp (Ed.): ''Die Ausbürgerung deutscher Staatsangehöriger 1933–45 nach den im Reichsanzeiger veröffentlichten Listen''. Vol. 1. Munich 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In exile Wolff reverted to writing books, while still contributing occasional pieces of journalism to (non-German) newspapers.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; Two historical-political works met with little success.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He dedicated his last novel, ''Die Schwimmerin'' ("The [female] Swimmer") to his secretary from the Berlin days, [[Ilse Stöbe]] (1911–1942). His project to have a film produced on the basis of this novel, with [[Greta Garbo]] in the starring role, could not be realised.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Ulrich Sahm (Botschafter)|Ulrich Sahm]]: ''Ilse Stöbe''. In: Hans Coppi, Jürgen Danyel, Johannes Tuchel (Ed.): ''Die Rote Kapelle im Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus.'' Schriften der [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]], Berlin 1994, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff continued to distance himself from [[Zionism|Zionist separatism]], believing throughout his life in a "German-Jewish symbiosis" ("deutsch-jüdische Symbiose").&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

===Arrest and death===
After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] on 22 June 1940 Theodor Wolff applied, unsuccessfully, for permission to emigrate to United States:  he remained in Nice. The coastal strip along the south-eastern part of France including, from late 1942, [[Nice]] was in the process of being [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|annexed by Italy]], and on 23 May 1943 Theodor Wolff was arrested by the Italian civil authorities. He was handed over to the [[Gestapo]] and interned in a [[Marseilles]] jail before being transferred to the [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy detention centre]] near Paris. Drancy was used as a collection point for Jewish internees scheduled for deportation to internment camps and death camps in Germany, and Wolff now found himself transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] to the east of Berlin. Now aged 75, and ill with [[Phlegmon]], his fellow internees pleaded successfully for him to be sent to the [[:de:Jüdisches Krankenhaus Berlin|Jewish Hospital]] in Berlin. Here he was admitted on 20 September 1943: he died three days later.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt;

Theodor Wolff's body is buried in the "row of honour" at Berlin's [[Weißensee Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

==Posthumous honour==
In 1961 the [[Theodor Wolff Prize]] for newspaper journalism was founded, and it has since 1962 been awarded annually. Since 1973 the prize has been awarded by the [[:de:Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger|German Newspaper Publishers' Association (BDZV / ''Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger'')]].

The concept of '''universalizability''' was set out by the 18th-century [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] as part of his work ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It is part of the first formulation of his [[categorical imperative]], which states that the only morally acceptable [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}{{Request quotation|date=January 2017}} 

The precise meaning of universalizability is contentious, but the most common interpretation is that the categorical imperative asks whether the maxim of your action could become one that everyone could act upon in similar circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} An action is morally acceptable if it can be universalized (i.e., everyone could do it).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} 

For instance, one can determine whether a maxim of lying to secure a loan is moral by attempting to universalize it and applying reason to the results. If everyone lied to secure loans, the very practices of promising and lending would fall apart, and the maxim would then become impossible.

Kant calls such acts examples of a contradiction in conception, which is much like a [[performative contradiction]], because they undermine the very basis for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47008768|title=Kant: Groundwork of the metaphysics of morals|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521626958|editor-last=Gregor|editor-first=Mary|location=|pages=53|oclc=47008768|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's notion of universalizability has a clear antecedent in [[Rousseau]]'s idea of a [[general will]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Both notions provide for a radical separation of will and nature, leading to the idea that true freedom lies substantially in self-legislation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Raphael - Cardinal and Theological Virtues.jpg|thumb|400px|''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' by [[Raphael]], 1511]]

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]]. 

The four classic cardinal  virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by up to ten virtues,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
[[File:Maat.svg|thumb|upright|[[Maat]], to [[ancient Egypt]]ians, personified the virtue of [[truth]] and [[justice]]. Her feather represents truth.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, M. (2004), Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During Egyptian civilization, [[Maat]] or Ma'at (thought to have been pronounced *[muʔ.ʕat]), also spelled māt or mayet, was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], [[balance (metaphysics)|balance]], [[Natural order (philosophy)|order]], [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. Maat was also personified as a goddess regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], who symbolized [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]], lies, and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Norman Rufus Colin Cohn| title = Cosmos, Caos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-300-05598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Assmann]], Translated by Rodney Livingstone, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8047-4523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Personification]] of virtue ([[Greek Language|Greek]] ''Ἀρετή'') in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesos]], [[Turkey]]]]

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in [[Meno]], when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, without being miserly.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* [[justice|Iustitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius| Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chivalric virtues==
In the 8th Century, upon the occasion of his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] published a list of knightly virtues:

Love God
Love your neighbour
Give alms to the poor
Entertain strangers
Visit the sick
Be merciful to prisoners
Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
Redeem the captive
Help the oppressed
Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
Render righteous judgement
Do not consent to any wrong
Persevere not in wrath
Shun excess in eating and drinking
Be humble and kind
Serve your liege lord faithfully
Do not steal
Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious traditions ==

===Judaism===
{{main article|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31). Wisdom is also celebrated in the [[Book of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/7#27007022|title=Wisdom, Chapter 7, Verse 22|last=|first=|date=|website=USCCB Bible|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main article|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Islam===
{{main article|Islamic views on virtue}}
In Islam, the [[Qur'an]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue. [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The [[hadiths]], his reported sayings, are central to the Islamic understanding of virtue.

Virtue is defined in [[hadith]]. It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Piety/virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about Piety/virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety/virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

For Muslims fulfilling the human rights are valued as an important building block of Islam, According to Muslim beliefs Allah will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of humans and injustice with others will only be pardoned by the humans and not by Allah.
===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], attainment of [[enlightenment]] is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All [[Jains]] are supposed to take up the five vows of [[ahimsa]] (non violence), [[satya]] (truthfulness), [[asteya]] (non stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non attachment and [[brahmacharya]] (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the [[Tirthankaras]]. Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint and straightforwardness. These vows assists the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/bliss-of-wisdom/जैन-धर्म-के-पाँच-मूलभूत-सिद्धांत-bfc9b756d509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main article|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K.

The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

While [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and their descendants opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of
the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main article|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.
