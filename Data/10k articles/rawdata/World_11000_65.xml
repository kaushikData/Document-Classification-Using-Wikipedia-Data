''Abora'' was a Bolivian-made reed boat, designed in 2002, to travel more than {{convert|450|nmi|mi km|0}} between Egypt, Lebanon and Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/sailing/06/19/ancient.ppl/ The Abora project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921142716/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/sailing/06/19/ancient.ppl/ |date=21 September 2008 }} CNN&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to prove a theory that there were no boundaries to the travels of ancient sailors, defying modern estimations of limited exploration by prehistoric man.  The idea was inspired by Norwegian explorer [[Thor Heyerdahl]], who sailed from South America to [[Polynesia]] on the [[Kon-Tiki]] balsa raft in 1947.

==''Abora III''==

A similar boat, the Abora III, was launched in 2007 for a [[transatlantic crossing]].  Due to damage from several storms, the expedition was abandoned {{convert|550|mi|nmi km|0}} away from the [[Azores]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abora3.com/english/diary.html ''Abora III'' Diary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707074713/http://abora3.com/english/diary.html |date=7 July 2011 }} Abora III Diary&lt;/ref&gt;

The attested Greek is Auarpoi. Avarpi is a scholarly transliteration into Latin, with some using Avarni on the assumption that the name refers to the [[Varni tribe|Varni]] of [[Mecklenburg]]. However, Ptolemy uses Farodeinoi for Varini and clearly says that the Auarpoi are next to the Teutonikai and between the Sueboi and the Farodeinoi. This location is not precise, but is somewhere in the Pommern/Propommern region.

'''The Battle of Sig''' took place from 26 to 27 June 1835 in the forest of Moulay Ismael near [[Sig, Algeria|Wadi Sig]] and opposed French forces, assisted by the Douair and Smela tribes, to Algerian resistors led by [[Emir Abdelkader]].

==The battle June 26==


The fighting lasted two days. Unable to resist the Algerian assaults, the men of General [[Camille Alphonse Trézel]] retreated. A further withdrawal was also initiated at [[Arzew]], but Trézel's forces were swiftly overtaken. The Algerian cavalry, faster, more mobile and above all more numerous, blocked the French at the [[Macta]]. The [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] succeeded in containing their attackers and repelling them, but the Algerians continued their attacks.

==The ambush June 27 ==


The next day, they ambushed the French at the Macta marshes, formed by the confluence of the [[Sig River|Sig]] and the Habra, between the river and the forest. The heavy wagons of the convoy were destroyed and the wounded from the previous night's battle slaughtered, while the troops of the escort were annihilated. The Foreign Legion again stepped in; they freed the way toward Arzew, but the attack by the Algerian horsemen cost the French forces  52 men killed and 189 wounded.

'''Chabelley Airport''' {{airport codes||HDCH}}, also known as the '''Chabelley Airfield''', is an isolated airstrip in [[Chabelley]], located some 6 miles to the southwest of [[Djibouti City]], the capital of [[Djibouti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GCM|HDCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church of St. Stephen''' ({{lang-sr|Црква Светог Стефана}} / ''Crkva Svetog Stefana'') was a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox church]] located in [[Donje Nerodimlje]], in the municipality of [[Uroševac]], [[Kosovo and Metohija]]. It belonged to the [[Diocese of Raška and Prizren]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and it was destroyed by [[Albanians|Albanian]] extremists in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svetosavlje.org/biblioteka/Zitija/OdKosovaDoJadovna/OdKosovaDoJadovna28.htm Svetosavlje/ Destroyed, burned and looted churches, no.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comoros–North Korea relations''' ({{lang-ko|코모로-조선민주주의인민공화국 관계}}) refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between the [[Comoros]] and the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea. Neither nation maintains an embassy in their respective capitals. Formerly the DPRK had an ambassador stationed in [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]].&lt;ref name="Ambassador"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=North Korea Quarterly |volume=10-13 |publisher=Institute of Asian Affairs |page=5 |date=1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Diplomatic relations with North Korea were established soon after the Comoros gained its independence from [[France]] on 6 July 1975, on 13 November later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_DPRK_Diplomatic_Relations.pdf |title=DPRK Diplomatic Relations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=www.ncnk.org |publisher=National Committee on North Korea |access-date=29 July 2015 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was during the rule of Prince [[Said Mohamed Jaffar]], who had replaced President [[Ahmed Abdallah]] in a coup only months before. He himself was replaced in January 1976 by  [[Ali Soilih]], a revolutionary [[Islamic socialism|Islamic socialist]] and anti-colonialist. Soilih, in addition to implementing radical reforms, established close connections with many of the [[Cold War]] states in the habit of aiding revolutionary movements. Among these were North Korea, which established an embassy in the Comoros within a year. On 18 January 1977, the first ambassador So Jinyong presented his credentials to Vice President Mohamed Hassan Ali, and made a visit to President Soilih.&lt;ref name="Ambassador"/&gt;

The [[Maoism|Maoist]]-inspired leader, whose [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]]-esque militia and other armed forces received training from the left-wing [[Tanzania]]n regime of [[Julius Nyerere]], also received some degree of aid from the North Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bunge |editor-first=Frederica M.|date=1982 |title=Indian Ocean, five island countries |publisher=[[United States Department of the Army]] |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1978, the North Korean ambassador presented a gift from [[Kim Il-sung]] to President Soilih, in response to which the Comoros expressed its "full support and firm solidarity with the Korean people's struggle" to achieve an independent and peaceful [[Korean reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Summary of World Broadcasts: Far East, Part 3  |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two months after this event Soilih was ousted and killed in a coup by French mercenaries, which reinstalled the former President Ahmed Abdallah. Abdallah's rule was strictly anti-communist, and on 3 December 1983 the Comoros became the only African state to break off diplomatic relations with the DPRK following the [[Rangoon bombing]], when on 9 October that year the North Koreans attempted to assassinate the [[South Korea]]n military ruler [[Chun Doo-hwan]] during a visit to [[Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Drachkovitch |first1=Milorad M. |last2=Gann |first2=Lewis H. |title=[[Yearbook on International Communist Affairs]] |publisher=[[Hoover Institution]] |page=242 |date=1984 |isbn=0817980318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of his time in office, Abdallah maintained close relations with South Korea, visiting [[Seoul]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |volume=16, 1-26 |title=Korea News Review |location=[[Seoul]] |publisher=''[[The Korea Herald]]'' |page=104 |date=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations resumed in the 1990s, with the end of Abdallah's government in 1989, replaced by a long series of likewise unstable regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Daily Report: East Asia |publisher=[[NewsBank]] |page=81 |date=1996 |volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Czech News Agency''' ({{lang-cs|Česká tisková kancelář}}), abbreviated to '''ČTK''', is a national [[public service]] [[news agency]] in the [[Czech Republic]].  It publishes in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and English.

Founded on 28 October 1918, on the same day as [[Czechoslovakia]]'s formation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Czech Republic |last=Edmondson |first=Vlaďka |author2=Short, David |year=1999 |publisher=Clio Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85109-304-5 |page=342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the company has been owned by the government and used by the various regimes in the [[Czech lands]] since then. Following the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the government ceased interfering in editorial decisions. In 1993 the government relinquished control of the agency, which has since been governed by a board of seven people elected by the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|lower house of Parliament]]. Members of the board are not allowed to be politically active.&lt;ref name="www.ctk.eu"&gt;[http://www.ctk.eu/&amp;refer=us www.ctk.eu]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's state [[subsidy]] was discontinued in 1996.&lt;ref name="www.ctk.eu"/&gt;

It was renamed from Czechoslovak to Czech News Agency on 1 January 1993 when Czechoslovakia split.&lt;ref name="www.ctk.eu"/&gt; CTK, however, stayed active in the Slovak market. Its former Slovak part is a separate company under a different set-up called TASR [[News Agency of the Slovak Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasr.sk/30.axd?lang=1033&amp;refer=us www.tasr.sk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220951/http://www.tasr.sk/30.axd?lang=1033&amp;refer=us |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
===Present===
Dates are usually written in "day month year" (DMY) order. This order is used in both the all-numeric date (for example "{{lang|ru|28.08.17}}") and the expanded form (for example "{{lang|ru|28 августа 2017 г.}}"). Single-digit numbers for day or month may have a preceding nought (for example "{{lang|ru|28.08.2017}}"), but omitting it (for example "{{lang|ru|28.8.2017}}") is more usual.

When saying the date, it is usually pronounced using the ordinal number of the day first, then the month (for example "{{lang|ru|Двадцать восьмое августа}}").

===Historical===

Russia used the [[Byzantine calendar]] up to 1700, the [[Julian calendar]] between 1700 and 1918, and the [[Gregorian calendar]] since 1918.  Until the final years of [[Peter the Great]] in the early 1720s, Russia used [[Cyrillic numerals]] to denote dates on coins.  Thus, for example, СИ (208) denoted 7208 [[Anno Domini|AM]] (September 1, 1699 through August 31, 1700 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]) and ҂АѰ (1700) denoted [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1700 OS.

==Time==
The [[12-hour clock|12-hour notation]] is often used in the spoken language. The [[24-hour clock|24-hour notation]] is used in writing, with a colon as the standardised and recommended separator (e.g. “{{lang|ru|9:07}}”).

'''"Dieser Traum darf niemals sterben"''' ("This dream must never die") was the [[Germany|German]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[German language|German]] by [[Atlantis 2000]]. The song was selected to represent Germany by [[televoting]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://knockknockeurosongs.blogspot.se/2010/09/germany-1991.html Germany 1991]", Knock Knock Eurosongs, 8 September 2010. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011|reason=Better source needed}}

The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following [[Finland]]'s [[Kaija]] with "[[Hullu yö]]" and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Clouseau (band)|Clouseau]] with "[[Geef het op]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 10 points, placing 18th in a field of 22.

The song is a dramatic ballad, with the band singing that humanity must learn to overcome its propensity towards hate in order to achieve unity. "This dream", they sing, "must never die". Atlantis 2000 also recorded an English version of the song, entitled "Never Ending Dream".

It was succeeded as [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|German representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Contest]] by [[Wind (band)|Wind]] with "[[Träume sind für alle da]]".

The '''Ezana Stone''' is a [[stele]] from the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. The [[Aksumite architecture|stone monument]] documents the conversion of [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]] to [[Christianity]] and his conquest of various neighboring areas, including [[Meroë]].

From AD 330 to 356, King Ezana ruled the ancient Kingdom of Aksum centered in the [[Horn of Africa]]. He fought against the [[Nubians]], and commemorated his victories on stone tablets in praise of [[God]]. These liturgical epigraphs were written in various ancient languages, including the Ethiopian Semitic [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], the South Arabian [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]], and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. The king's [[engraving]]s in stone provided a trilingual monument in different languages, similar to the [[Rosetta stone]].

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] had its beginnings during this period. [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History'' narrates that [[Saint Frumentius]], a slave and tutor for the very young King, converted him to [[Christianity]]. Towards the end of his reign, King Ezana launched a campaign against the [[Cush (Bible)|Kushites]] around 350 which brought down the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. Various stone inscriptions written in Ge'ez (using the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez script]]) have been found at Meroë, the central city of the Kushites.

'''Fibre satellite distribution''' is a technology that enables [[satellite TV]] signals from an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] to be distributed using an [[optical fibre]] cable infrastructure and then converted to electrical signals for use with conventional [[set-top box]] receivers.

Particularly applicable to satellite TV distribution systems in a [[Multi-family residential|multi-dwelling unit]], such as a block of flats (but useful in smaller domestic distribution systems too), such a hybrid fibre/electrical system reduces the cabling required, reduces signal noise and interference, and provides for an easy upgrade to increase the number of [[Tuner (television)|tuners]] connected at each dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.yateley.net/SatByF/contents/en-uk/SatPro.pdf Giving co-ax the axe]" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' (April, 2009) p130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional systems that distribute the electrical satellite [[Intermediate frequency|IF]] signal via a star network of [[coaxial cable]] require one relatively short cable run from the central distribution equipment to each tuner connected to the system, whereas in a fibre system, cables can be very long, and split at successive locations, in a tree structure without detriment to the reception.

==Advantages==
The primary benefit of using optical fibre for a satellite TV IF distribution system is that the fibre can carry the entire received spectrum on one cable, which can then be split to provide for multiple tuners, without requiring a separate feed from the antenna to each tuner. Additional outlets can be added to increase the number of receivers within one home without accessing the central antenna or main infrastructure.

Fibre cable is cheap in long runs, retailing at about twice the price of equivalent copper coaxial cable, but replacing four runs of coaxial cable with a single fibre cable.
It is also much smaller than the coaxial signal cable used for electrical IF distribution, but robust and flexible. The losses in a fibre system are almost negligible so very long cable runs of hundreds of metres are possible without any signal reinforcement.

Because the signal is carried as a beam of light, it is impervious to the electrical interference that even the best coaxial satellite cable may suffer, and cables can be safely and conveniently run alongside mains power cables. Power consumption is also lower than an equivalent electrical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Development==
[[Image:fibreSplitter.jpg|thumb|right |An eight-way optical signal splitter to feed eight virtual LNBs or further splitters from a single optical feed]]
While optical fibre has been used for telephone and Internet backbone data, and even for television and multimedia carriage for terrestrial cable, for many years, use for satellite IF distribution has been held back by considerations of cost and installation convenience.

However, since about 2007, UK company, Global Invacom (which also markets domestic and communal satellite reception and distribution equipment, including SCR [[single cable distribution]] equipment) has developed a low cost standardised system of optical fibre distribution suitable for domestic installations and small or medium commercial communal dish systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalinvacom.com/products/fibremdu-virtual-converters.php |title=Fibre optic distribution products information |publisher= Global Invacom | accessdate=January 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development was assisted by [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellite operator [[SES S.A.|SES]] both with advice and financial support in the form of the prize for the Astra Innovation Contest run by Astra in 2007, which Global Invacom won for the proposal and initial development of optical fibre distribution systems for satellite TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=September 28, 2007 |url=http://nl.ses.com/4233325/news/2007/4434481|title= Global Communications, Invacom, And Era Technology Winners of the SES ASTRA Innovation Contest |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
[[Image:fibreConverter.jpg|thumb|right |A virtual LNB with four electrical outputs for four tuners]]
The complete spectrum of Ku-band satellite reception stretches from 10.70&amp;nbsp;GHz-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz across two signal [[Polarization (waves)|polarisations]], or a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of about 4000&amp;nbsp;MHz. This cannot be carried on a single coaxial cable and so in a conventional satellite reception system, just one of four sub-bands (received in vertical and horizontal polarization, and high and low frequency,) is sent from the antenna to the indoor receiver as 0.95&amp;nbsp;GHz-2.15&amp;nbsp;GHz IF. Which sub-band is required is signalled from the receiver to the antenna’s LNB by a 13/18V and 0/22&amp;nbsp;kHz tone on the LNB supply sent up the same coaxial cable. In a single antenna distribution system, special quattro LNB supplies all four sub-bands at once, from four outputs and these are supplied as required to each of the multiple outlets connected to an IF [[multiswitch]].&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff. "Installing Home IF Distribution" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' (June, 2007) p47-51&lt;/ref&gt;

In an optical fibre system at the LNB the four sub-bands are "stacked" in frequency, one above the other, at 0.95&amp;nbsp;GHz-3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz (the whole frequency range received in vertical polarisation) and 3.4&amp;nbsp;GHz-5.45&amp;nbsp;GHz (horizontal polarisation) and transmitted together as a modulated optical signal down the fibre cable using a 1310&amp;nbsp;nm [[semiconductor laser]].

The losses in the cable are extremely small (in the region of 0.3dB/km) and the Global Invacom optical LNB output can be split up to 32 ways with a cable length of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km between the LNB and the receiver.

At, or near, the receiver, the optical signal is converted back to the traditional electrical signal with a virtual multiswitch, providing one or more outputs that “appear” to the receiver as a conventional LNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalinvacom.com/products/fibreopticlnb2.php

==Practical considerations==
[[Image:fibreCable.jpg|thumb|right |A 1m optical fibre cable with fitted connectors for other fibre distribution equipment]]
Although the hybrid optical fibre/electrical system provides many advantages over electrical IF distribution to widespread or complex systems, it also requires a new approach by installers familiar only with electrical installations.

The single mode fibre cables use an 8μm fibre armoured with a steel wrap and Kevlar strands inside a plastic jacket. Fibre cable cannot be easily joined (an expensive [[fusion splicer]] is required for reliable joints) but pre-made cables with FC type screw-on [[Optical fibre connector|connectors]] (mechanically similar in use, but smaller, to the F-connectors used for electrical satellite IF) are available in lengths from 1m to 100m. The same connectors are used on all the optical components of a system, including the optical LNB, splitters, cable joiners, virtual LNB units, etc.

The cables must be properly prepared (the end of the fibre itself cleaned) before connections are made and provision must be made to attenuate the LNB signal, to avoid overloading the receiver, if it is not split between receivers as there is so little attenuation inherent in the cable.

The optical LNB requires two cables connected – the fibre signal cable and a separate F-connector cable to supply the 12V supply to power the LNB electronics. If the installation is a conversion from an electrical system to fibre, an existing redundant coaxial signal cable can be used for the power supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''Fjernsynsteatret''' was a department of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) which produced plays for television broadcasting. It opened in 1960 (after about a year of experimental operation), and operated until 1990, when a major reorganisation of NRK took place.&lt;ref name=snl-ft&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Fjernsynsteatret |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |first=Svend Erik Løken |last=Larsen |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo  |url=http://www.snl.no/Fjernsynsteatret |language=Norwegian | accessdate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first leader was [[Arild Brinchmann]], who headed the theatre from its start until 1967.&lt;ref name=snl-ft/&gt;&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Arild Brinchmann |encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Arild_Brinchmann |language=Norwegian | accessdate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later directors were [[Tore Breda Thoresen]] from 1967 to 1980,&lt;ref name=tbt&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Tore Breda Thoresen |encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Tore_Breda_Thoresen |language=Norwegian | accessdate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Magne Bleness]] from 1980 to 1990.&lt;ref name=snl-ft/&gt;&lt;ref name=mb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Magne Bleness |encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Magne_Bleness |language=Norwegian | accessdate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fjernsynsteatret's first production was a play by [[Peter Brook]], shown 8 April 1959. The first years the theatre developed between twenty and twenty-five productions annually, and the performances were broadcast directly. Later developments saw a merge between theatre and film, the productions became more expensive, and the number of productions decreased significantly.&lt;ref name=snl-ft/&gt;

The theatre was replaced by ''NRK Drama'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=snl-ft/&gt;

'''Gibraltar: Britain in the Sun''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] documentary broadcast on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom. It first broadcast on 11 June 2013 and series one ended on 16 July 2013. The programme experienced higher than average and expected ratings, peaking just below 1.90 million viewers on most episodes. It returned for a second series which began on 7 January 2014, and the series finished 11 February 2014. The third series began on 5 November 2014.

==Summary==
The programme follows the lives of many British [[expatriate]]s who now reside in the territory and some Gibraltarians. Filming took place in June 2012, when [[Gibraltar Airport]]'s new terminal was officially opened by [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex]]. The opening was seen on the programme however the Royal visit was not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">'''Grinlandia''' ({{lang-ru|Гринландия}}) is the [[fantasy world]] where most of the novels and short stories of [[Alexander Grin]] take place. The name of the country is never mentioned by the author himself, and the name Grinlandia was suggested in 1934 by literary critic [[Korneliy Zelinsky]] &lt;ref&gt;Зелинский К. Жизнь и творчество А. С. Грина. // Грин А. С. Фантастические новеллы. — М., 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://22-91.ru/etot-den-v-istorii-sssr/737/strana-grinlandija Страна Гринландия] (retrieved Feb. 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted by Grin's fans since then.

The [[Alexander Grin museum (Theodosia)|Alexander Grin museum]] in [[Feodosia|Theodosia]] contains the reconstructed map of the land.&lt;ref name="kimmeria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kimmeria.com/kimmeria/feodosiya/museum_grin_land.htm|title=Страна ГринЛандия - музей Александра Грина|publisher=kimmeria.com|accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grinlandia.narod.ru/map/map.htm |title=Карта Гринландии &amp;#124; Map of Grinlandia |publisher=grinlandia.narod.ru|accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a land by the ocean, apparently far from Europe (as some characters speak about "sailing to Europe") but populated by people with vaguely Western European names and appearance.

The language spoken in Grinlandia is also never identified (though the novels themselves are written in Russian). There are several cities ([[Liss (Grinlandia)|Liss]], [[Zurbagan]], [[San Riole]], etc.) mentioned in several of the novels, but none of them are identified as a capital.

{{Politics of Hungary}}

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Hungary]] between 10 November and 11 December 1865. The [[Deák Party]] won a majority of the seats, and successfully made the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], and founded [[Austria-Hungary]]. Hungary got more freedom and autonomy from the Crown, but still in a mutual state with Austria and [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] was crowned as the King of Hungary.
After the elections that was the constitution of the Parliament.

'''Intelsat 707''' (also known as '''IS-707''' and '''Intelsat 7-F7''') is a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] that was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]] ('''SSL'''). It is located in the orbital position of 53 degrees west longitude and it is currently in an [[inclined orbit]]. The same is owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the LS-1300 platform and its estimated useful life was 15 years.&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-7a.htm|title=Intelsat-7A (706, 707, 708)|first=Krebs|last=Gunter|work=Gunters Space Page|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite was successfully launched into space on March 14, 1996,&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; at 07:11, using an [[Ariane 4]] vehicle from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; It had a launch mass of 4,180&amp;nbsp;kg. The Intelsat 707 carried 26 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 14 [[Ku band]] transponders to provide Europe and the Americas with 3 television channels and 22,500 telephone circuits after parking over the eastern coast of [[Brazil]].

The year 1994 was proclaimed the '''International Year of the Family''' by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES4482_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-44-82 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=44 |resolution_number=82 |highlight=rect_490,743_883,768 |page=1 |accessdate=2009-10-29|date=8 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its objectives are promoted by the [[United Nations Programme on the Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/family/index.html|title=United Nations Programme on the Family - Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was one of many [[International observances]] declared for specific days, months and years.  

In October 1994, the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] opened the three-day International Conference on Families, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-49-PV.35 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=49 |meeting=35 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk01 |date=18 October 1994 |speakername=The Secretary-General |accessdate=2009-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Five years ago, the General Assembly decided that 1994 was to be the International Year of the Family.

At the time, there was no consensus. Some did not see the point of an International Year of the Family. Opinions were divided as to what the Year was about. Some people argued that support for the family discriminates against those who prefer to live outside family units. There were also disagreements over the activities which should be organized to mark the year...

The International Year of the Family has stimulated a worldwide debate. Many political notions have been clarified. Out of the process of debate and reflection have come new insights.

Instead of confusion and hesitation, there is now consensus about the role of the family in human society. Today, a new realism prevails. It is accepted that the family is a fundamental institution of human society. Indeed, it is established that society is a structure made up of families and individuals related to society, in the first instance, through families.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1355">'''Kadimah''' ('''{{lang-he|קדימה}}''', lit. ''Onward'') (German: '''A.V. Kadima Wien''') was the first [[Jew]]ish [[student association]] in [[Vienna]], founded many years before [[Theodor Herzl]] became the leading spokesman of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]]. 
==History==
The national Jewish and Zionist ''Kadimah'' was founded by [[Nathan Birnbaum]] together with Moses Schnirer, [[Ruben Bierer]] and [[Peretz Smolenskin]] in Vienna on 25 October 1882. 

Well-known members of ''Kadimah'' include [[Sigmund Freud]], Isidor Schalit and [[Fritz Löhner-Beda]].

Members of the Kadimah founded the Jewish [[studentenverbindung]] ''Hasmonaea Czernowitz'' in 1891, ''Moriah Vienna'' in 1893 and ''Barissia Radautz'' in 1912.

''Kadimah'' itself was liquidated by then [[Nazism|Nazi]]-ruled official authorities in August 1938.

Dozens of newspapers are published in [[Sierra Leone]] with 15 daily newspapers operational. Most of the newspapers are privately run and are mostly distributed around the capital of Freeport due to the low levels of illiteracy within the small South-Western African nation.

The '''Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda'''  ({{lang-pt|Movimento para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda}}; {{lang-fr|Mouvement de Libération de l'Enclave du Cabinda}}; '''MLEC''') is a defunct, separatist organization that campaigned for the independence of [[Cabinda province]] from [[Portugal]]. MLEC merged with the [[Action Committee of the Cabinda National Union]] and the [[Mayombe National Alliance]] in 1963 to form the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]. Cabinda is now a province and an [[exclave]] of [[Angola]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=J. Atticus Ryan|author2=Christopher A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1628">The '''mudbrick stamp''' or '''brick seal''' of [[Mesopotamia]] are [[impression seal|impression]] or [[stamp seal]]s made upon bricks or [[mudbrick]]. The inscribed seal is in [[mirror]] reverse on the 'mold', mostly with [[cuneiform]] inscriptions, and the foundation mudbricks are often part of the memorializing of temples, or other structures, as part of a "[[foundation deposit]]", a common honoring or invocation to a specific god or protector.

==Example mudbrick seal==
[[File:Stamp Lasha Louvre AO27586.jpg|290px|thumb|Brick "stamp mold" for the King of [[Larsa]], [[Sin-Iddinam]]. (for Sun God, Utu, [[foundation deposit]] of temple) ]]
The brick stamping mold for [[Sin-Iddinam]] of [[Larsa]] is housed in the Louvre. It is a nearly complete mold, with an inscription in cuneiform to the Sun God, [[Utu]], as a [[foundation deposit]] for the god's temple, the Ebbabar.

'''Institute for Environment Geochemistry of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ('''KINR''')  ({{lang-ua|Інститут геохімії навколишнього середовища НАН України}}) located in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. 

==History==
Decision on creation of the institute with dual subordination to the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] and the [[Ministry of Emergencies (Ukraine)|Ministry of Emergencies]] was adopted on 29 December 1995.

'''Pantāga''' is a traditional [[Latvian people|Latvian]] dish, containing eggs and spices. It symbolically represents the [[sun]],  often prepared at [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liepajniekiem.lv/lat/zinas/novados/2008/03/19/vrgal-ceps-lieldienu-pantgu/|title=Vērgalē ceps Lieldienu pantāgu|publisher=Liepajniekiem.lv|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often baked on an open flame outdoor fireplace or fire, usually in a round [[cast iron]] long stem pan. The egg whites and yolks are beaten in a pan with spices, producing a form of [[scrambled egg]]. However, it is also common to place it in a [[microwave]].

'''Radio Slovakia International''' ('''RSI''') is [[Slovakia]]'s official [[international broadcasting|internet-based international broadcaster]].

The station was created almost simultaneously with the [[Slovak National Council's Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Nation|emergence]] of independent [[Slovakia]] and began broadcasting on 4 January 1993. Its duties were laid down as providing listeners in other countries with information about the new state and maintaining contact with the numerous expatriate [[Slovaks|Slovak]] communities around the world. Organizationally, it is a part of the [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] nationwide [[public broadcasting]] organization [[Rozhlas a televízia Slovenska]] ''(Radio and Television Slovakia)''. 

RSI's programmes are broadcast in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and, for expatriates, [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. Its daily 30-minute magazine programmes contain news from [[Slovakia]], features on the Slovak economy, sciences, culture, geography, environment, sports, examples of the spoken, written, and musical arts, and portraits of important personalities. 

Radio Slovakia International broadcasts worldwide via internet and via the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt-shortwave.blogspot.com/2010/12/rsi-will-continue-daily-programs-on-wrn.html ''Monday, December 27, 2010: RSI will continue daily programs on WRN'', Markmonitor.com, Mountain View, CA, quoting a posting by Radio Slovakia International at Radio Netherlands Media Network's blog].Accessed: 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published in 1946 by Invincible Press (Australia) and subsequently in the UK in 1952 and in paperback in 1961. Flynn draws on his experiences working in and around [[New Guinea]] when young to provide the background. Accounts of his sailing in New Guinea waters appear in his autobiographies, ''Beam Ends'' (1937) and ''[[My Wicked, Wicked Ways]]'' (1959).
The novel is dedicated to German-American artist [[John Decker (artist)|John Decker]], who painted Flynn's [[portrait]], translated in the same year to Spanish as ''Un drama en los Mares del Sur'' (Renacimiento, 1946).

'''The Gambia Scout Association''', the national [[scouting]] organization of [[the Gambia]], was founded in 1921, and became a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] in 1984.

== Activities ==
[[File:US and Gambian Scouts (5998122274).jpg|thumb|left]]

The coeducational Gambia Scout Association has 18,448 members as of 2008.&lt;ref name="WOSM-TR_05-08"&gt;{{cite web |title=Triennial Report 2005-2008 |url=http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909204757/http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special activities include community service projects such as tree planting. Scouts regularly participate in camping and hiking. [[Music]] is also a very important part of Scouting in the Gambia, but because there is little money for instruments and [[sheet music]], there is a waiting list to get into the Scout band, and they learn all their music by ear. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== Presidents ==

The '''[[Argentine Civil Wars]]''' were a series of [[internecine war]]s that took place in [[Argentina]] from 1814 to 1876. These conflicts were separate from the [[Argentine War of Independence]] (1810 — 1820), though they first arose during this period.

The main antagonists were, on a geographical level, [[Buenos Aires Province]] against the other provinces of modern Argentina, and on a political level, the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federal Party]] against the [[Unitarian Party]]. The central cause of the conflict was the excessive [[Centralized government|centralism]] advanced by Buenos Aires leaders and, for a long period, the monopoly on the use of the [[Port of Buenos Aires]] as the sole means for international commerce. Other participants at specific times included [[Banda Oriental|Uruguay]], and the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Second French Empire|French]] empires, notably in the [[French blockade of the Río de la Plata]] of 1838 and in the [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata]] that ended in 1850.

The company was founded in 1906 by [[Edward Miles|Edward T. Miles]] as the "Tongkah Harbour Tin Dredging Company N.L." It began offshore tin mining in [[Phuket|Phuket Bay]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

==Tungkum accused of judicial harassment==
The Khon Rak Ban Kerd Group (KRBKG) is a community-based group committed to defend the local environment from the negative impacts of the open-pit copper-gold mine operated by the Tungkum Company in [[Loei Province]]. On 30 March 2016, the Loei Provincial Court dismissed a civil defamation lawsuit brought by six KRBKG members who live in communities near the open-pit copper-gold mine, for erecting signs in 2015 at the Na Nong Bong village entrance gate and along the main road in the village, calling for the closure of the controversial mine and rehabilitation of the local environment. Tungkum sought 50 million baht in compensation from the six KRBKG members for alleged damage to the company’s reputation. Tungkum has brought at least 19 criminal and civil lawsuits against 33 members of the KRBKG and other villagers in the past seven years, including the case dismissed yesterday. Using lawsuits, the company has sought a total of 320 million baht from villagers who oppose the mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: Judicial harassment against members of the Khon Rak Ban Kerd Group for opposing gold mine|url=http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/urgent-interventions/thailand/2016/03/d23694/|website=World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)|location=Geneva|date=2016-03-31|accessdate=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a three-year investigation, the [[NGO]] [[Fortify Rights]] found that the company and the Thai government had "...targeted environmental defenders...journalists, and others with costly lawsuits that infringe on basic rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wannasiri |first1=Sutharee |last2=Smith |first2=Amy |title=Score gold by protecting rights, not mine operations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1550378/score-gold-by-protecting-activists-not-mine-operators |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |publisher=Fortify Rights |date=2 October 2018 |format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings are documented in a 90-page report issued in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='We Fight to Protect our Home'; Reprisals  Against Environmental Defenders in Loei Province, Thailand |date=October 2018 |publisher=Fortify Rights |url=https://www.fortifyrights.org/downloads/We_Fight_to_Protect_Our_Home-Fortify_Rights_Report-EN.pdf |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand: Protect Environmental Defenders, Ensure Remedies |url=https://www.fortifyrights.org/publication-20181002.html |accessdate=2 October 2018 |publisher=Fortify Rights |date=2018-10-02 |format=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">'''Ukodo''' is a yam and unripe [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] dish of the [[Urhobo people]] of Nigeria. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cookingncleaning.blogspot.com/2013/05/ukodo-pepper-soup-porridge-urhobo.html Nigerian Urhobo Ukodo (pepper soup Yam pottage)] 18 May 2013 Sapele Honey&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itsekiri people]] of the Niger Delta also make a similar dish called Epuru. It is essentially a pottage, a stew of meat and vegetable with its base as the Nigerian pepper soup.

It is sometimes cooked with lemon grass and potash.&lt;ref name="Ekeh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Palmer Ekeh|title=Studies in Urhobo Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjeNIESBArkC&amp;pg=PA496|date=January 2005|publisher=Urhobo Historical Society|isbn=978-978-067-769-5|pages=496–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is usually used for marriage and bural ceremonies or as breakfast, particularly during the cold season. &lt;ref name="Lim2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. K.

A poem by the Nigerian Chovwe Inisiagho-Ogbe describes both the ingredients and the process of cooking Ukodo in a light-hearted way.&lt;ref name="Ekeh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Palmer Ekeh|title=Studies in Urhobo Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjeNIESBArkC&amp;pg=PA496|date=January 2005|publisher=Urhobo Historical Society|isbn=978-978-067-769-5|pages=496–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
