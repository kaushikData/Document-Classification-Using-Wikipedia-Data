'''African immigrants to Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|afrikiečiai}}) form a tiny minority of [[Lithuania]]'s population. According to estimates by the migration department of Lithuania, there are 238 men and 26 women from [[Africa]] living in the country, 91 of whom are from [[Nigeria]].

Historically, Lithuania had few non-European residents, with only a small minority of Asians (predominantly [[Tatars]]) known to inhabit the territory prior to independence.

One of the most well-known Lithuanians with ancestors from African nations is the singer [[Viktoras Diawara]], whose father is from [[Mali]].

'''Anu-Hkongso''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken between the Kaladan and Michaung rivers in [[Paletwa Township]], [[Chin State]], Burma. It is closely related to [[Mru language|Mru]], forming the [[Mruic languages|Mruic language branch]], whose position with Sino-Tibetan is unclear. It consists of two dialects, Anu (''Añú'') and Hkongso (Khongso, Khaungtso).

Anu and Hkongso speakers self-identify as ethnic [[Chin people]], although the Anu-Hkongso language does not classify as a [[Kuki-Chin language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://iso639-3.sil.org/request/2011-031 ISO 639-3 Change Request Number: 2011-031]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Anu and Hkongso speakers can also speak [[Khumi language|Khumi]].&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;

==Varieties==
'''Hkongso''' and '''Anu''' are closely related languages. The ''Kasang'' claim to be Hkongso, and live in a small area just to the south of the main Hkongso area, in the villages of Lamoitong and Tuirong. The ''Anu'' live in scattered areas to the west of the main Hkongso area.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt; Anu villages include Bedinwa, Onphuwa, Payung Chaung, Yeelawa, Daletsa Wa, Ohrangwa, Tuikin Along, and Khayu Chaung (Wright 2009:6).

The Anu people consider themselves to consist of 4 subgroups, namely ''Hkum'', ''Hkong'' (Hkongso), ''Som'', and ''Kla''. However, the Hkongso maintain that they are an ethnic group equal to the Anu, but are not a subgroup of the Anu.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;

The '''Kasang''' (also known as Khenlak, Ta-aw, Hkongsa-Asang, Hkongso-Asang, Asang, and Sangta) consider themselves as ethnic Hkongso, but their language is intelligible with [[Khumi language|Khumi]] rather than Anu.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt; Kasang villages include Lamoitong and Tuirong.

The [[Mru language]] is also closely related to Anu and Hkongso. The Mru had migrated to the [[Chittagong Hills]] from the [[Arakan Hills]].&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;

==Distribution==
Hkongso is spoken in the following villages of Paletwa Township.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Bahungtong
*Halawa
*Kanan
*Kanlawa
*Lakinwa
*Likkung
*Pahang
*Paletwa
*Pawa
*Phongphai
*Ringrong
*Sami
*Singkangkung
*Tengwa
*Tuikinwa
*Vadengkung
*Youngwa
{{div col end}}

Hkongso subgroups (clans) are Kamu, Ngan, Gwa, Hteih, Hteikloeh, Ngai, Rahnam, Kapu, Kasah, Namte, Krawktu, and Namluek.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;

Leimi, Asang, and Likkheng are other languages spoken in the Paletwa Township area.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Hkongso has minor syllables (also known [[sesquisyllable]]s), which are typical of Mon-Khmer languages (Wright 2009:12-14).

==Grammar==
Unlike the [[Kuki-Chin languages]], Hkongso (kʰɔŋ˥˩sʰo˦˨) has no verb stem alternation and has SVO word order (Wright 2009).&lt;ref name="Wright2009"&gt;Wright, Jonathan Michael. 2009. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131116213526/http://www.gial.edu/images/theses/Wright_Jonathan-thesis.pdf Hkongso Grammar Sketch]''. MA thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike Mru and the Kuki-Chin languages, Hkongso has Neg-V word order (pre-verbal negation) instead of the V-Neg order (post-verbal negation) found in surrounding languages.

The '''Basque–Icelandic pidgin''' was a [[pidgin]] spoken in [[Iceland]] in the 17th century. It is preserved in Icelandic manuscripts from the same and the following century. The pidgin consisted of [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages|Romance]] words. It might have developed in [[Westfjords]], where the manuscripts were written, but since it had influences from many other [[Europe]]an languages, it is more likely that it was created elsewhere and brought to Iceland by Basque sailors.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manuscript AM 987 4to, kept at the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] in [[Reykjavík]], there are two Basque–Icelandic glossaries called ''Vocabula Gallica'' ('French words') and ''Vocabula Biscaica'' ('[[Basque language|Biscaya]]n words'). Towards the end of ''Vocabula Biscaica'', which contains a total of 278 words and short sentences, there are a few phrases where the Basque entries are mixed with words from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The Basque–Icelandic pidgin is thereby not a mixture between Basque and Icelandic, but between Basque and other languages. It was named from the fact that it was written down in Iceland and translated into Icelandic.&lt;ref name="Bakker et al"&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Blason de Guéthary.svg|thumb|right|150px|It was for [[fishing]] that the Basques sailed to Iceland. [[Whaling]] was, for a long period of time, an important industry in the Basque Country, which is illustrated by the [[shield]] of the village of [[Guéthary|Getaria]] in [[Lapurdi]]]]
[[File:Escudo de Ondarroa 2000.svg|thumb|right|150px|Also, the shield of [[Ondarroa]] in [[Bizkaia]] shows the importance of whaling in the Basque coastal communities]]
The word numbers are the same as in AM 987 4to. The manuscript's Basque and Icelandic phrases are from Deen (1937:102-105). The modern Basque entries are from [[:eu:Euskara-islandiera pidgina|Basque Wikipedia]] and [[:fr:Basco-islandais|French Wikipedia]]. The English translations are based on the Icelandic text, which differs in some places from the Basque equivalents in the glossaries. For example, ''sagarduna'' 'cider' is not synonymous with ''Syrdryck'' 'sour drink'.

===Words of Basque origin===
*'''atorra''', ''atorra'' 'shirt'
*'''balia''', ''balea'' 'baleen whale'
*'''berria''', ''berria'' 'new'
*'''berrua''', ''beroa'' 'warm'
*'''biskusa''', ([[Lapurdian]]) loan word ''bizkoxa'' 'biscuit', nowadays meaning [[gâteau Basque]] (cf. Spanish ''[[:es:wikt:bizcocho|bizcocho]]'', ultimately from Old French ''[[:wikt:biscuit#fr etym|bescuit]]'')
*'''bocata'''&lt;ref&gt;Deen (1937:102) suggests that ''bocata'' is ''bokhetatu'' with the Spanish translation ''colar'' 'sieve', 'percolate' or 'pass'. The Icelandic equivalent is ''þvodu'' 'wash!'.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''bustana''', ''buztana'' 'tail'
*'''eta''', ''eta'' 'and'
*'''galsardia''', ''galtzerdia'' 'the sock'
*'''gissuna''', ''gizona'' 'the man'
*'''locaria''', ''lokarria'' 'the tie/lace(s)'
*'''sagarduna''', ''sagardoa'' 'the cider'
*'''ser''', ''zer'' 'what'
*'''sumbatt''', ''zenbat'' 'how many'
*'''travala''', old Basque ''trabaillatu'', related to French ''travailler'' and Spanish ''trabajar'' 'to work'
*'''usnia''', ''esnea'' 'the milk'
*'''bura''', 'butter', from Basque [[Lapurdian]] loan word ''burra''&lt;ref&gt;The loan word ''burra'' is documented in the Northern Basque Country Basque-language written tradition since the mid-17th century.

*'''for''' in the sentence ''sumbatt galsardia for'' could be derived from many different Germanic languages&lt;ref&gt;Deen (1937:104).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''for mi''', English 'for me' (used both as subject and object; 'I' and 'me')
*'''for ju''', English 'for you' (used both as subject and object)

===Words of Romance origin===
*'''cammisola''', Spanish ''camisola'' 'shirt'
*'''fenicha''', Spanish ''fornicar'' 'to fornicate'
*'''mala''', French or Spanish ''mal'' 'bad' or 'evil'
*'''trucka''', Spanish ''trocar'' 'to exchange'&lt;ref&gt;Deen (1937:103). Could also be derived from Basque ''trukea'' 'the exchange'&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many other French and Spanish words in the rest of ''Vocabula Biscaica'' and the other Basque-Icelandic glossaries. For example, Basque ''eliza'' 'church' in the beginning of the glossary is related to French ''église'' and Spanish ''iglesia''. However, this is no sign of the pidgin language, but rather a result of French and Spanish influence on the Basque language throughout the ages, since Basque has taken many loan words from its neighbouring languages.&lt;ref name="Hualde"/&gt; Furthermore, many of the people in the Basque crews that came to Iceland might have been multilingual, speaking French and/or Spanish as well. That would explain for example why the Icelandic ''ja'' 'yes' is translated with both Basque ''bai'' and French ''vÿ'' (modern spelling ''oui'') at the end of ''Vocabula Biscaica''.&lt;ref&gt;(Deen 1937:101) and Miglio (2006:200).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the glossaries==
The copy of ''Vocabula Biscaica'' which is preserved was written by [[Jón Ólafsson of Grunnavík|Jón Ólafsson]] from [[Grunnavík]], who copied an older but now lost original. This copy was found, together with ''Vocabula Gallica'', in the mid-1920s by the Icelandic [[philologist]] [[Jón Helgason (poet)|Jón Helgason]] in the [[Arnamagnæan Collection]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He copied the glossaries, translated the Icelandic words into German and sent the copies to professor [[Christianus Cornelius Uhlenbeck]] at [[Leiden University]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Uhlenbeck had expertise in Basque, but since he retired from the university in 1926, he gave the glossaries to his post-graduate student [[Nicolaas Gerard Hendrik Deen]]. Deen consulted with the Basque scholar [[Julio Urquijo Ibarra|Julio de Urquijo]], and in 1937, he published his [[doctoral thesis]] on the Basque-Icelandic glossaries. It was called ''Glossaria duo vasco-islandica'' and written in [[Latin]], though most of the phrases of the glossaries were also translated into German and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson"/&gt; In 1986 the original manuscript was brought back from [[Denmark]] to [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Knörr"&gt;{{Cite web

There is also evidence of a third contemporary Basque-Icelandic glossary. In a letter, the Icelandic linguist [[Sveinbjörn Egilsson]] mentioned a document with two pages containing "funny words and glosses"&lt;ref name="Miglio"/&gt; and he copied eleven examples of them. The glossary itself has been lost, but the letter is still preserved at the [[National Library of Iceland]]. However, there is no pidgin element in this glossary&lt;ref name="Guðmundsson"/&gt;

A fourth Basque-Icelandic glossary was found at the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Belluzzo"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Bikya''' (also known as '''Furu''') is a potentially extinct [[Southern Bantoid languages|Southern Bantoid]] language spoken in [[Cameroon]]. It is one of the three, or four, [[Furu languages]]. In 1986 four surviving speakers were identified, although only one (a man in his seventies) spoke the language fluently.

Bikya is probably best known for the work of English linguist Dr. David Dalby who filmed an 87-year-old [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] woman who spoke Bikya as her native tongue. It was thought that she was the last speaker, but Kiessling (2007) reports that Bikya has the largest number of remaining speakers of the Furu languages.

It, and presumably all of Furu, is perhaps a [[Beboid language]] (Blench 2011).

It provides 1.5 million triennial observations of more than 260,000 residents from 698 communities. The population mainly consists of immigrants from North China who settled in rural Liaoning during the early eighteenth century, and their descendants. The data provide socioeconomic, [[demographic]], and other characteristics for individuals, households, and communities, and record demographic outcomes such as marriage, fertility, and mortality. The data also record specific disabilities for a subset of adult males. This dataset is unique among publicly available population databases because of its time span, volume, detail, and completeness of recording, and because it provides longitudinal data not just on individuals, but on their households, descent groups, and communities.

==History==
The term "cli-fi" came into use in the late 2000s to describe novels and movies that deal with man-made [[climate change]], and historically, there have been any number of literary works that dealt with climate change in earlier times as well.

[[Jules Verne]]'s 1889 novel ''[[The Purchase of the North Pole]]'' imagines climate change due to tilting of Earth's axis. In his posthumous ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'', written in 1883 and set during the 1960s, the titular city experiences a sudden drop in temperature, which lasts for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur B. Evans, "The 'New' Jules Verne". Science–fiction Studies, XXII:1 no. 65 (March 1995), pp. 35-46.[http://jv.gilead.org.il/evans/thenewjv.html] and Brian Taves, "Jules Verne's Paris in the Twentieth Century". ''Science Fiction Studie'' no. 71, Volume 24, Part 1, March 1997. [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/taves71.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Several well-known dystopian works by British author [[J. G. Ballard]] deal with climate-related natural disasters: In  ''[[The Wind from Nowhere]]'' (1961), civilization is reduced by persistent hurricane-force winds, and ''[[The Drowned World]]'' (1962) describes a future of melted ice-caps and rising sea-levels caused by solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/22/1000-novels-jg-ballard|title=The best of JG Ballard|first=Toby|last=Litt|date=21 January 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Burning World (novel)|The Burning World]]'' (1964, later called ''The Drought'') his climate catastrophe is human-made, a drought due to disruption of the precipitation cycle by industrial pollution.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.jgballard.ca/criticism/milicia_drought1985.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As scientific knowledge of the effects of fossil fuel consumption and resulting increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations entered the public and political arena as "[[History of climate change science|global warming]]",&lt;ref name=aiphistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm |title=The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2003 |author=Spencer Weart}}&lt;/ref&gt; fiction about the problems of human-induced global warming began to appear. [[Susan M. Gaines]]'s ''[[Carbon Dreams]]'' was an early example of a literary novel that "tells a story about the devastatingly serious issue of human-induced climate change," set in the 1980s and published before the term "cli-fi" was coined&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Elizabeth K. "Novelist Combines CO2 and Romance", Chemical and Engineering News, June 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[State of Fear]]'' (2004), a [[techno-thriller]] portrays climate change as "a vast pseudo-scientific hoax" and is critical of [[scientific opinion on climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, Scott. "Science, Eloquence, and the Asymmetry of Trust: What’s at Stake in Climate Change Fiction" Green Theory &amp; Praxis: The Journal of Ecopedagogy Volume 4, No. 1 (2008) ISSN 1941-0948 doi: 10.3903/gtp.2008.1.6 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Atwood]] explored the subject in her [[dystopian]] trilogy ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' (2003), ''[[The Year of the Flood]]'' (2009) and ''[[MaddAddam]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/12/margaret-atwood-interview_n_6141840.html|title=Margaret Atwood: 'I Don't Call It Climate Change. I Call It The Everything Change'|first1=Maddie |last1=Crum|date=12 November 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' Attwood presents a world where "social inequality, genetic technology and catastrophic climate change, has finally culminated in some apocalyptic event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-50385-3|title=Fiction Book Review: Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's protagonist, Jimmy, lives in a "world split between corporate compounds", [[gated communities]] that have grown into [[city-states]] and pleeblands, which are "unsafe, populous and polluted" urban areas where the working classes live.&lt;ref&gt;''Publishers Weekly''/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent examples==

The popular science-fiction novelist [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] focused on the theme in his ''Science in the Capital'' trilogy, which is set in the near future and includes ''[[Forty Signs of Rain]]'' (2004), ''[[Fifty Degrees Below]]'' (2005), and ''[[Sixty Days and Counting]]'' (2007). Robert K. J. Killheffer in his review for [[Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]] said "''Forty Signs of Rain'' is a fascinating depiction of the workings of science and politics, and an urgent call to readers to confront the threat of climate change."&lt;ref name="Killheffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Killheffer|first=Robert K. J.|date=October 2004|title=White Devils/The Zenith Angle/Forty Signs of Rain (Book)|journal=Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction |volume= 107|issue= 4/5|pages=39–46|issn=1095-8258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's latest climate-themed novel, titled ''[[New York 2140]],'' was published in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/utopia-in-the-time-of-trump/ |title=Utopia in the Time of Trump|last=Canavan|first=Gerry|date=11 March 2017 |work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives a complex portrait of a coastal city that is partly underwater and yet has successfully adapted to climate change in its culture and ecology. 

The novels ''Not A Drop To Drink'' (2013) and its sequel, ''In A Handful Of Dust'' (2014), by Mindy McGinnis feature a small group of survivors living in the aftermath of an extreme shortage of fresh water following a severe, prolonged drought on a national scale. 

[[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Solar (novel)|Solar]]'' (2010) follows the story of a physicist who discovers a way to fight climate change after managing to derive power from artificial photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/04/ianmcewan-fiction|title=McEwan's new novel will feature media hate figure|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=4 August 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Stone Gods (novel)|''The Stone Gods'']] (2007) by [[Jeanette Winterson]] is set on the fictional planet Orbus, a world very like Earth, running out of resources and suffering from the severe effects of climate change.  Inhabitants of Orbus hope to take advantage of possibilities offered by a newly discovered planet, Planet Blue, which appears perfect for human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=471|title=The Stone Gods - Jeanette Winterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Kingsolver's novel,  ''[[Flight Behavior]]'' (2012), employs environmental themes and highlights the potential [[effects of global warming]] on the [[monarch butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Bryan|title=Barbara Kingsolver on Flight Behavior and Why Climate Change Is Part of Her Story|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/11/08/barbara-kingsolver-on-flight-behavior-climate-change-and-the-end-of-doubt/|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=TIME|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JL Morin's ''[https://harvardsquareeditions.org/portfolio-items/natures-confession/ Nature's Confession]'' (2015) portrays two teens in a fight to save a warming planet, the universe, and their love, as they try to stop humans from exporting their polluting culture to other habitable planets.

''Devolution of a Species'' by M.E. Ellington focuses on the [[Gaia hypothesis]], and describes the Earth as a single living organism fighting back against humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.martynellington.com/books|title=Martyn Ellington|website=Martyn Ellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Belgium]]''' is a federal state comprising three '''communities''', three '''regions''', and four '''language areas'''. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap.

The language areas were established by the [[History of Belgium#The rise of the federal state|Second Gilson Act]], which entered into force on August 2, 1963. The division into language areas was included in the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/ned/sites/taalwetgeving/taalgrens_en_taalgebieden.html

== Schematic overview ==
This is a schematic overview of the basic federal structure of Belgium as defined by Title I of the Belgian Constitution.

Each of the entities either have their own parliament and government (for the federal state, the communities and the regions) or their own council and executive college (for provinces and municipalities). The entities in ''italics'' do not have their own institutions — arrondissements because they are purely administrative; language areas because they merely define the linguistic regime of a municipality; and the Flemish Region because its powers are exercised by the Flemish Community.

== Country subdivisions ==
{{Politics of Belgium}}

The three communities are:
* the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Flemish Community]] ({{lang|nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschap}})
* the [[French language|French-speaking]] [[French Community of Belgium|Community]] ({{lang|fr|Communauté française}})
* the [[German language|German-speaking]] [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Community]] ({{lang|de|Deutschsprachige Gemeinschaft}}, DG)

The three regions are:
* the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] (Brussels; {{lang-fr|Région de Bruxelles-Capitale|links=no}}, {{lang-nl|Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest|links=no}})
* the [[Flemish Region]] (Flanders; {{lang|nl|Vlaams Gewest}})
* the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] (Wallonia, {{lang|fr|Région wallonne}}, {{lang|de|Wallonische Region}})

The four language areas (as {{lang|nl|taalgebieden}} in Dutch and {{lang|de|Sprachgebiete}} in German), occasionally referred to as linguistic regions (from French {{lang|fr|régions linguistiques}}), are:
* the Dutch language area 
* the French language area 
* the German language area 
* the Bilingual Brussels-Capital area

All these entities have geographical boundaries. The language areas have no offices or powers and exist [[de facto]] as geographical circumscriptions, serving only to delineate the empowered subdivisions. The institutional communities are thus equally geographically determined. Belgian Communities do '''not''' officially refer directly to groups of people but rather to specific political, linguistic and cultural competencies of the country.

All Communities thus have a precise and legally established area where they can exercise their competencies: the Flemish Community has legal authority (for its Community competencies) only within the Dutch language area (which coincides with the Flemish Region) and bilingual Brussels-Capital language area (which coincides with the Region by that name); the French-speaking Community analogously has powers only within the French language area of the Walloon Region and in the Brussels-Capital Region, and the German Community in the German language area, which is a small part of the province of Liège in the Walloon region, and borders Germany.

The constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the institutions empowered for specific matters:

Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to officially merge the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community, with one parliament, one government and one administration, exercising both regional and community competencies, although [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish parliamentarians]] from the Brussels-Capital Region cannot vote on competencies of the Flemish Region; thus in the Dutch language area a single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.&lt;ref name="StateStructure" /&gt;{{efn|name="OneFlemishBody"}} While the Walloon Region and the French Community have separate parliaments and governments, the Parliament of the French Community draws its members from the French-speaking members of the Walloon Parliament and the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and ministers of the Walloon Government often serve as ministers in the Government of the French Community as well.

===Subordinate divisions===
The Flemish Region and the Walloon Region each comprise five '''[[provinces of regions in Belgium|provinces]]'''.  The Brussels-Capital Region is not a province, nor does it contain any. The three regions are further subdivided into 589 '''[[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]]''', which in general consist of several [[deelgemeente|sub-municipalities]]. These sub-municipalities were independent municipalities in the past, but no longer serve an official purpose.

Lesser subnational entities include the intra-municipal districts (which currently only exist in the city of [[Antwerp]]), the administrative, the electoral and the judicial [[arrondissements of Belgium|arrondissements]], police districts, as well as the new inter-municipal police zones (lower level than the police districts).

== Competences ==
The Federal State retains a considerable "common heritage". This includes justice, defence ([[Belgian Army]]), [[federal Police (Belgium)|federal police]], social security, public debt and other aspects of public finances, [[nuclear energy in Belgium|nuclear energy]], and state-owned companies (such as the [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian Railways]] which is in fact an exception on [[transport in Belgium|regionalized transport]]; the [[Bpost|Post Office]] was federal as well, but is being privatised). The State is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="fedgov1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Federal Government's Powers |work=.be Portal |publisher=Belgian Federal Government |url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=6188 |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities exercise competences only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education, the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly attributed to the language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)&lt;ref name="fedgov2"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Communities |work=.be Portal |publisher=Belgian Federal Government |url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2686 |accessdate=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184122/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2686 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions have authority in fields connected with their territory in the widest meaning of the term, thus relating to the economy, employment, agriculture, [[water policy]], housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.&lt;ref name="fedgov3"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Regions |work=.be Portal |publisher=Belgian Federal Government |url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2690 |accessdate=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184618/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2690 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specificities. On education for instance, the autonomy of the communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor sets minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters.&lt;ref name=fedgov1 /&gt; Each level can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers.&lt;ref name=fedgov2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fedgov3 /&gt;

Communities were created in 1970 as "cultural communities" with limited power. In 1980, more power was transferred from the federal state to these entities and they became simply "communities".

Both the Flemish and French Community have jurisdiction over the area of the Brussels-Capital Region. Consequently, they do not have a defined number of inhabitants. The German-speaking Community is the only community with an area over which they have sole jurisdiction as a community. It is located within the Walloon Region, which has even transferred some regional powers to the German-speaking Community with regards to its area.

=== Flemish Region ===
{{Main|Flemish Region}}

The '''Flemish Region''' or '''Flanders''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaams Gewest|link=no}} or {{lang|nl|Vlaanderen}}) occupies the northern part of Belgium. It has a surface area of {{convert|13,522|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 44.29% of Belgium, and is divided into 5 provinces which contain a total of 308 municipalities.

The official language is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. French can be used for certain administrative purposes in a dozen particular "[[municipalities with language facilities]]" around the Brussels-Capital Region and at the border with the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]].

The Flemish Region has no institutions on its own. Upon the creation of the provisional regions in 1974, a provisional Flemish Regional Council was installed with [[Mechelen]] as seat. However, with the definitive regions in 1980, its competencies were transferred to the [[Flemish Community]] in order to have unified [[Flanders|Flemish]] institutions that combine both regional and community competencies, namely the [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government]] and its administration. Regional laws (called decrees) do however need to mention whether they are applicable to the community, the region or both.

Since the capital of the Flemish Community is Brussels and its institutions have their seats there, it also indirectly serves as seat of government of the Flemish Region, even though the city is not part of it. Additionally, the city of [[Mechelen]] still has a relation to the Flemish Region as seat; it serves as the location for head office during European (and formerly Senate) elections.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12 of the law of 23 March 1989 concerning the election of the European Parliament designates Mechelen as [[Dutch-speaking electoral college|electoral college]] headquarters&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanders contains five provinces: [[West Flanders]], [[East Flanders]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]].

=== Brussels-Capital Region ===
{{Main|Brussels-Capital Region}}

The '''Brussels-Capital Region''' ({{lang-nl|Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest|link=no}}, {{lang-fr|Région de Bruxelles-Capitale|link=no}}, {{lang-de|Die Region Brüssel-Hauptstadt|link=no}}) or '''Brussels Region''' is centrally located and completely surrounded by the province of [[Flemish Brabant]] and thus by the [[Flemish Region]]. With a surface area of {{convert|162|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 0.53% of Belgium, it is the smallest of the three regions. It contains the [[City of Brussels]], which acts both as federal and regional capital, and 18 other municipalities. Its official languages are both Dutch and French. In the region ±78% speak French at home and ±22% speak Dutch, although a significant number of people combine these two languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/onderzoeksprojecten/brio_taalbarometer_3_brussel_2013.pdf |title=BRIO-taalbarometer 3: diversiteit als norm |first=Rudi |last=Janssens |year=2013 |edition=Brussels Informatie-, Documentatie- en Onderzoekscentrum |accessdate=12 September 2015 |format=PDF |language=nl }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brussels Capital Region contains only one administrative arrondissement, the [[Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital]]. However, for juridical purposes, it forms an arrondissement with surrounding [[Flanders|Flemish]] areas, the arrondissement of Brussels (equivalent in area to the former electoral district of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]]).

Within Brussels, the two Communities have their own institutions that act as "intermediary levels" of government and public service, sitting below the Community institutions, and above the municipal institutions:
* [[Flemish Community Commission]] ({{lang|nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie}}, VGC) and its administration;
* [[French Community Commission]] ({{lang|fr|Commission communautaire française}}, COCOF) and its executive commission and its administration.
In addition to these two, a [[Common Community Commission]] exists which is the entity when the Brussels-Capital Region exercises community powers. In these cases, there are more requirements for the legislative process in order to safeguard the interests of both linguistic communities (de facto the Flemish community).

Since the splitting of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the provinces. Within the Region, most of the provincial competencies are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Additionally, there is a [[governor of Brussels-Capital]], analogously to provinces.

=== Walloon Region ===
{{Main|Wallonia}}

The '''Walloon Region''' or '''Wallonia''' ({{lang-fr|Région Wallonne}} or {{lang|fr|Wallonie}}) occupies the southern part of Belgium. It has a surface area of {{convert|16,844|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 55.18% of Belgium, and is also divided into 5 provinces which contain a total of 262 municipalities. Its capital is [[Namur (city)|Namur]].

The official languages are [[French language|French]] and, only in the nine eastern municipalities that form the German-speaking Community near the German border, [[German language|German]]. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] however, may be used for administrative purposes in the four ''[[municipalities with language facilities]]'' at the border with Flanders, and German in two such municipalities near the German-speaking Community.

The Walloon Region contains five provinces: [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Walloon Brabant]], [[Namur (province)|Namur]], [[Liège (province)|Liège]] and [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">'''Community Safety or Community Security''' (CS) is, according to the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP), a concept that seeks to operationalize human security, human development and state-building paradigms at the local level. The contemporary concept of community security, narrowly defined, includes both group and personal security. The approach focuses on ensuring that communities and their members are "free from fear". Yet, a broader contemporary definition also includes action on a wider range of social issues to ensure "freedom from want". Like community safety and citizen security, it promotes a multi-stakeholder approach that is driven by an analysis of local needs.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP Community safety and social cohesion.[http://www.securitytransformation.org/images/documentos/687_UNDP_BCPR_CSSC_Concept_Paper_Final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; By emphasizing the "community" aspect the concept seeks to embrace both cultures and contexts that are "individual-oriented", including many in Latin America, and cultures and contexts that are "group oriented", as are many in Africa and South Asia.

The customization of CS programs depends on the specific context, but a core characteristic of the approach is a bottom-up focus on security creation and stabilization. As an approach, CS is not dealing with security creation on a national level, for instance through top-down legislation or peace agreements on a government level. Instead it focuses on short- and long term solutions to security problems in specific communities. 

"Community" does not just refer to individual community members, but refers to all actors, groups and institutions within the specific geographic space. It therefore also includes civil society organizations, the police and the local authorities that are responsible for delivering security and other services in that area.

Examples of agencies working with a Community Safety approach are [[Saferworld]], [[Danish demining group|Danish Demining Group]] and the [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces]] (DCAF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4576">[[Image:Dorothypodber.jpg|thumb|Dorothy Podber in 2007]]

'''Dorothy Podber''' (September 15, 1932 – February 9, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] performance artist.

Born in [[the Bronx]] to a mother who had tried repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, to abort her, and to a father who worked for the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] mobster [[Dutch Schultz]], Podber was later remembered as a disruptive influence by classmates from West Walton High School.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/22/db2202.xml |title=Dorothy Podber obituary in '&amp;#39;The Telegraph'&amp;#39; |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wild child of the [[New York City]] art scene in the 1950s and 1960s, she helped to run the [[Nonagon Gallery]], which showed the work of a young [[Yoko Ono]] and was known for jazz concerts by such performers as [[Charles Mingus]]. However, her greatest fame&amp;mdash;and notoriety&amp;mdash;came from her work as a muse and collaborator with more prominent artists. On one occasion, she turned up at [[Andy Warhol]]'s studio and put a bullet through a stack of his silk-screen paintings of [[Marilyn Monroe]], after which she was banned from the studio. These four paintings, thereafter, were called ''[[Shot Marilyns|The Shot Marilyns]]''. Podber revelled in her bad-girl reputation. In an interview in 2006, she said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been bad all my life. Playing dirty tricks on people is my specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2008/02/26/dorothy_podber_wild_child_of_new_york_art_scene_at_75/ |title=Dorothy Podber obituary in '&amp;#39;The Boston Globe'&amp;#39; |publisher=Boston.com |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In the art world, she served mostly as a muse and a co-conspirator of more prominent artists like [[Ray Johnson]], with whom she staged impromptu happenings on Manhattan streets.

When funds were low, she found unorthodox ways of making money, engaging in businesses as diverse as dispatching maids to doctors' offices in an attempt to gain access to their drug cabinets, and running an illegal abortion referral service. She did paperwork for [[B'nai Brith]] long enough to pick their safe and use its contents on her own check-counterfeiting machine. Her attitude to these enterprises bordered on indifference. "I never worked much," she reputedly said.&lt;ref name="NY Times Advertisement"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/arts/19podber.html ''New York Times'' obit on Podber]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married three times, and had numerous casual liaisons. Her last husband was Lester Schwartz, a bisexual, who had a long-term relationship with actor/director [[Julian Beck]]. Schwartz died in 1986.&lt;ref name="NY Times Advertisement"/&gt;  Podber cited bisexuality as something she and Schwartz had in common.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; One boyfriend was a banker with whom she would have sexual intercourse only on the banknote-strewn floor of his firm's vault. She had no children by any of her partners. She died in her [[Manhattan]] apartment on February 9, 2008, from natural causes, aged 75.

{{Ethnic Singapore sidebar}}
'''Eurasians in Singapore''' are persons of mixed European and Asian descent.  They form one of the identifiable communities in Singapore.  Eurasians have been viewed with mixed fascination and disdain by the European and Asian communities.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs'' ,'Racial Categorization and Recognizing "Mixed Race" in Singapore', Z. Rocha (2011, Page 101)&lt;/ref&gt; Their European ancestry traces to emigrants of countries that span the length and breadth of Europe, although [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] [[Immigration|migrants]] to Singapore in the 19th century came largely from other European colonies in [[Asia]], such as [[British Malaya]] in particular [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]], India including [[Goa]], the former Portuguese colony in India, and [[Chittagong]] (today in Bangladesh), the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[French Indochina]].  When the European maritime powers colonised Asian countries, such as India, Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia and Indochina, from the 16th to 20th centuries, they brought into being a new race of people known historically and generally as the Eurasians.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian and Pacific Migration Journal'' 24 (2), 'The postcolonial ambiguities of Eurasian pan-ethnicity in Singapore', J. Lowe and M. Mac an Ghaill (2015, Page 234); ''Indonesia and the Malay World ''43 (126), 'Children of Decolonisation: Postcolonial (Indo) Eurasian Communities in Indonesia and the Netherlands', R. Hewett (2015, Page 192)&lt;/ref&gt; The early Western colonisers were not accompanied by their womenfolk on the perilous journey to Asia. Consequently, many married the local women of these lands, or formed liaisons with them. Initially the offspring of such a union were brought up as an appendage of the ruling class and enjoyed advantages not generally accorded the rest of the local Asian population.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lam Pin Foo blog 'Singapore Eurasians - The Inheritors of Western and Asian Cultures' 31 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, as colonial attitudes hardened due to the [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]] and growing independence movement, Eurasians were largely cast aside by the colonial masters and treated much like the rest of the local population.  Eurasians or [[Kristang people|Kristang]] Eurasians who generally have some [[Kristang language|Kristang]]-speaking ancestry form a sub-group distinct from those who are the offspring of more recent immigrants and expatriates of European and Asian origin and who are also commonly called "Eurasians" in Singapore.  The same or similar distinction exists between on the one hand those first- or second-generation Eurasians who typically would share the ethnic identity of one parent more closely, that parent typically not being of Kristang or Portuguese-origin, and on the other hand multi-generation(i.e. typically third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation, etc) Eurasians who typically might have at least some distant Kristang-speaking or Iberian-origin ancestry, and many of whom would associate with some Kristang or Portuguese-origin cultural practices (e.g. Kristang songs and Portuguese-origin dances like ''Jinkli Nona'') and dine on Kristang Eurasian dishes like [[Devil's curry]] or ''curry debal'' in Kristang.  As a general rule, first- or second-generation Eurasians typically do not have any Kristang-speaking ancestry, do not speak Kristang, generally do not adopt Kristang or Portuguese-origin cultural practices and cues, and are less familiar with Kristang Eurasian cuisine, language and history.  Simply put, first-generation Eurasians are people whose parents are not Eurasians.  Multi-generation (typically third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation, etc) Eurasians are people whose parents or forefathers are themselves Eurasians.&lt;ref name="Braga-Blake"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Braga-Blake|editor-first=Myrna|others=Co-researched by Ann Ebert-Oehlers.|title=Singapore Eurasians : Memories and Hopes|location=Singapore|publisher=Times Editions for the Eurasian Association, Singapore|year=1992|isbn=981-204-367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European ancestry==

===Of Portuguese and Spanish descent===
Before the arrival of the Dutch, terook and French in Asia, the first Europeans to land and seize territory in Asia were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], followed by the Spanish who claimed the Philippines. Portuguese spice-traders first sailed to Malacca in 1509, having already established settlements in Goa and other parts of India.  Portuguese explorers and conquerors were accompanied by the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests to South-east Asia via Goa in [[Portuguese India]]. [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], the viceroy of India, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquered Malacca]] (today just a few hours' drive from Singapore) in 1511, while Jesuit [[Francis Xavier]], (a [[Basques|Basque]] Spaniard serving the Portuguese Crown) arrived in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] in 1545. Descendants of Portuguese and Spanish colonialists who lived in Malacca and are of mixed Portuguese/Spanish and mostly Malay, but also Indian or Chinese descent, are collectively known as the [[Kristang people|Gente Kristang]]. This group is characterised by being Catholic, sporting Portuguese surnames and having its own distinctive Portuguese creole, the [[Kristang language]], although it is now only spoken by a few, older members of the community. Many are descended from individuals who lived in Malacca or other parts of Malaysia. Others have ancestors who lived in [[Java]] or other parts of [[Indonesia]] as a result of being expelled from Malacca after the Portuguese were forcibly ejected from Malacca by the Johore-Dutch alliance in 1641. A few [[Macanese people (Macanese-born Portuguese people)|Macanese people]] of Chinese-Portuguese ancestry from [[Macau]] are also living in Singapore.

===Of Dutch descent===
In 1602, a Dutch trading company called the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or VOC (literally "United [[East Indies]] Company" but better known in English as the [[Dutch East India Company]]) was created to conduct trade in the area east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and west of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. In establishing their numerous trade stations spanning across [[Asia]], the Dutch created independent settler societies in each of their colonies, where [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]) became the administrative centre and rendezvous point for the company's Asian shipping traffic.

Between 1602 and 1795, the VOC fitted out some 4,700 ships which carried almost a million Europeans to the Far East. Almost 70 percent of the one million of the passengers never actually returned to Europe, making Asia their new home.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dutchmalaysia.net - The Easternization of the West: Children of the VOC by Dennis De Witt (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  These early seafarers were not only made up of Dutch, but also included British, [[Germany|Germans]], [[Huguenot|French Huguenots]], [[Italy|Italians]], [[Scandinavia]]ns and other [[Demographics of Europe|Europeans]] who were employed by the VOC. In time, many were [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]] situated throughout Asia (though primarily in modern Indonesia) where they were stationed and became part of the respective communities.

[[Interracial marriage|Intermarriage]]s between VOC employees and locals were encouraged, which led to the creation of communities of Dutch descendants.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Today, there are only five surviving coherent and large communities who are descended from those early intermarriages. They are the [[Cape Coloured]]s ([[South Africa]]), [[Baster]]s and [[Oorlam people|Oorlam]] ([[Namibia]]), [[Burgher people|Burghers]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), and [[Indo people|Indos]] ([[Indonesia]]). Other Dutch groups have persisted as a [[strain (biology)|strain]] among the [[Anglo-Burmese]] and [[Kristang people|Kristang]]. The Dutch Eurasians of Malacca are of Dutch and largely Malay but also Indian or Chinese descent.  The Dutch transferred Malacca to the British in 1825 in exchange for territory in Sumatra. The British sought to depopulate Malacca and as a result many Eurasians and other people moved north to thriving Penang (where other Eurasians fleeing Phuket or moving from Kedah also settled) and later south to Singapore as it grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Dutch descendants in Malaysia and Singapore are primarily made up of Eurasians originating from Malacca, as well as others who emigrated from the East Indies, India and Sri Lanka.  Leo and Hilda Campbell were Dutch Burghers who arrived in Singapore from Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1910.  The couple planned to migrate to Australia like many Eurasians but due to Hilda suffering a stroke, they remained in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times 'Orphan who became a houseboy has lived his life in service - picking up skills along the way' - 9 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of British and Irish descent===

The British were the most important Europeans in colonial Singapore, as they were the colonial rulers of the island. A number of British settlers arrived after its colonial status changed in 1867.  Interracial marriage was very common in colonial days.  Even men who had European wives sometimes had 'a bit of curry on the side'. European women who moved to South-east Asia tended to die young.  British men took Asian partners and their offspring would be Eurasian.   Some who had [[British nationality]] preferred to settle in Britain or other parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], especially Australia.  Many British and other European men of retirement age, instead of going back to cold Europe, would settle in Australia with Asian women, with fewer staying on in Singapore.  Apart from being warmer than Europe, Australia was less judgemental than Europe or colonial Singapore to mixed marriages and mixed offspring.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Expat Living Singapore 'Guide to Katong: Our colourful tour of Singapore's East Coast neighbourhood' 13 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Independent Singapore's second [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Benjamin Sheares]], was a Eurasian of English lineage. [[E. W. Barker]], the former Law Minister, was of mixed- Portuguese, Irish, Japanese, Scottish, Malay and German descent. Author [[Rex Shelley]] was of mixed English, Portuguese, Malay and Buginese ancestry. National swimmer [[Joseph Schooling]] is a third-generation Singaporean, and is of Eurasian ethnicity.  His parents are Colin and May Schooling. May is a Chinese Malaysian and a Singapore permanent resident; while Colin, a businessman, was born in Singapore. Colin's grandfather was a British military officer who married a local Portuguese-Eurasian in Singapore. The last name Schooling is believed to be an anglicised surname that originated in Germany.&lt;ref name="todayonline.com"/&gt;

===Of other European descent===
Other Eurasians in Singapore have parents or are descended from individuals who originated from various parts of Western Europe and its former colonies such as in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or elsewhere.  Former Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen's father is of Swedish and Portuguese descent. His grandfather married a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] woman in [[Shanghai]] and brought her to Singapore. Geraldene Lowe's mother’s family was called Luth and came from [[Schleswig-Holstein]], then part of [[Denmark]]. During [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]’s unification of [[Germany]], they headed to Asia and Australia and married people from various nationalities.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Asian ancestry==

===Of Chinese descent===
Olympic gold medallist swimmer [[Joseph Schooling]] is a Eurasian, as is his father Colin Schooling. His mother May Schooling is a Chinese-Malaysian
while his father is of British, Swedish, Kristang and Portuguese descent.

===Of Malay and Indonesian descent===
Author [[Rex Shelley]] was of mixed English, Portuguese, Malay and Buginese ancestry.

===Of Indian descent===
Singer, [[Tabitha Nauser]] is a Eurasian of paternal Swiss and maternal Indian-Singaporean descent.

===Of Japanese and Korean descent===

Other Eurasians in Singapore have parents or are descended from individuals who originated from [[Japan]], [[Korea]] or other parts of [[East Asia]]. An example is TV personality and presenter Stephanie Carrington, who is half [[White American]] and half Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.asiaone.com/women/beauty/stephanie-carringtons-beauty-secrets|title=Stephanie Carrington's beauty secrets|date=6 July 2014|website=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double-barrelled race classification in official documents==

Since January 2010, the Government in Singapore has allowed the double-barrelling of race classification by parents of different races when they register their children. The first of the two races should be the child's dominant race. So a European father and Chinese mother might register their son as "European-Chinese" instead of "Eurasian".  A Malay father and European mother might register their daughter as "Malay-European" instead of "Eurasian".  If these two children grow up and as adults marry each other and have a child of their own, that child (the grandchild of the two couples) could be registered by its parents as "European-Malay" taking the dominant race of the classifications of both parents "'''European'''-Chinese" and "'''Malay'''-European".  As another example, a child with an Indian father and Eurasian mother would previously have been registered as "Indian". With the new system, the child can be identified officially as "Indian-Eurasian" or "Eurasian-Indian" depending on what the parents choose. The new form of race classification will be reflected in National Registration Identity Cards. The double-barrelling of race will give parents in mixed-race marriages even more flexibility when deciding their child's race, said Assistant Professor Ho Peng Kee, the junior minister who announced the change in Parliament.  He explained the need for flexibility stemmed from the increasing diversity of Singapore's demographics, with the inflow of immigrants and more locals marrying foreigners.  On the need to identify a dominant race, Ho said: "Societal trends suggest that a child of mixed parentage tends to identify more closely with one of the two races."&lt;ref&gt;MyPaper 'Mixed-race S'poreans can have double barrelled IC category' by Dawn Tay 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and traditions==

===Languages and Kristang patois===
[[File:ShepherdsPie-closeup.jpg|thumb|150px|Shepherd's pie, a common Eurasian dish.]]

English is generally spoken as a first language by almost all Eurasians in Singapore. A number of Eurasians speak Asian languages like Malay, Chinese (Mandarin or dialect) or Tamil as a second or third language.  Like many Singaporeans, Eurasians will commonly speak [[Singlish]]. Some of the elder generation of Kristang Eurasians, typically those who have a Portuguese surname or are of [[Kristang language|Kristang]]-speaking descent, speak the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese Creole|creole]] known as ''Cristão'' or ''Papia Kristang'' (Speaking Kristang) – the [[Kristang language]] at home and within their small community.  Kristang is a dying [[patois]] and is only spoken by a small minority of Eurasians.

===Religion and education===
The Eurasian community in Singapore includes people that belong to different religions and to no religion, but most of them are [[Christianity in Singapore|Christians]], mostly Catholic, with religious celebrations like Christmas typically being an integral part of their lifestyle.  Many Eurasians in Singapore have been educated in Catholic mission schools like St Joseph's Institution.  Protestant Eurasians in Singapore include Anglicans (Episcopals), Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans and Evangelicals.  Eurasians looked upon an English education as a passport to a better life in colonial Singapore and so their children were among the first to enrol in the earliest English language schools when they were set up. They attained the highest literacy rate among the local groups here. This enabled them to secure comfortable employment, in both public and private sectors, following in the footsteps of their fathers and as a family tradition for the future generations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Eurasian cuisine===
Eurasian culinary traditions include [[wikibooks:Cookbook: Eurasian Smore|Eurasian smore]] (a beef stew), [[mulligatawny]] soup (''mulligatani'' in Kristang), [[shepherd's pie]] and [[vindaloo]] (''vin d'arlo'' in Kristang). &lt;!--Are vindaloo and vin d'arlo the same?--&gt; Sugee cake made with semolina is also associated with the Eurasians, but also with the Peranakan Chinese.

===Prominence in the media, entertainment and fashion industries===
Eurasians are prominent in the media, entertainment and fashion industry and are sought after because of their mixed look. In Singapore, Eurasian models are sometimes called 'Pan-Asians' for their mixed appearance. Apart from displaying certain Singaporean beauty standards, a common belief among those in the advertising industries of  both Singapore and Malaysia is that a Eurasian model can appeal to  different ethnic groups of Asian origin and thus there would be no need to create different advertisements to target different groups. For example, an advertisement featuring a Malaysian-Eurasian face could be used in places like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand or Singapore because non-Eurasian Malaysians with their diverse origins could pass off as a Sri Lankan, Nepalese, Thai or Singaporean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Buying+and+Believing:+Sri+Lankan+Advertising+and+Consumers+in+a+.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3Eamcy4gt&amp;sig=GPDW-L4JPavmkk9Z2ifZzvrokSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5usyCh-vNAhXLND4KHd1xBRIQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pan-Asian&amp;f=false|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=29 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In media and entertainment, father and son Brian and Mark Richmond, Vernetta Lopez and Jean Danker are well-known radio personalities.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Singapore Infopedia Eurasian community - Stephanie Ho 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurasians in Singapore have also made their mark in the artistic and cultural domains. Jeremy Monteiro is a renowned jazz musician and Cultural Medallion winner. Rex Shelly was an award-winning writer known for his novels that feature the Eurasian community in Singapore and Malaysia.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==='Eurasiana - A Musical Tribute'===
In June 2009, 'Eurasiana - A Musical Tribute' marking the 90th anniversary of the Eurasian Association was performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall.  It was a showcase of Eurasian music, dance and culture in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;The Neweurasian 'What a wonderful show' July–September 2009 Pg 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; Also performing was the 50-piece Singapore Pop Orchestra led by Maestro Iskandar Ismail.

==Places associated with Eurasians==
Soon after the founding of [[Singapore]] by [[Stamford Raffles]] in 1819, people from other trading centres in Asia including Eurasians came to Singapore.  Wealthy Eurasians set up home along [[Waterloo Street]] and [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]] in the area between Bras Basah Road and Middle Road, not far from today's [[Singapore Management University]]. The types of houses that they lived in included shophouses, two-storey houses, terrace houses and [[bungalows]].   These were typically owned by well-to-do merchants and traders. The houses on Queen Street also consisted of shophouses that were occupied by non-Eurasian [[coolies]]. The living conditions in these shophouses were poor but at least the coolies could live close to where they worked. These houses on Queen Street were owned by the more well-to-do Eurasians.  Nearby were Catholic schools like [[St Joseph's Institution]] and the [[Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus]] as well as other well-known schools that used to be located in the vicinity.  A number of buildings and churches of the period in the vicinity still stand today.  Today, few Eurasians can be found residing in the Waterloo Street and Queen Street area.

Eurasian families moved out from the enclaves to other locations such as the government quarters in [[Bukit Timah]], the countryside areas in [[Serangoon]] and Upper Serangoon, and the then coastal region of Tanjong Katong. There were even kampongs (Malay for “villages”) along Haig Road and Siglap Road that had a concentration of Eurasian families. Another Eurasian enclave known as Little England was located in the area bounded by [[Farrer Park]], Norfolk Road and Rangoon Road. The roads in the area were all named after English counties and towns.  Eurasians today can now be found spread thinly across the island in both private and public housing. In past times, many Eurasians lived in the [[Katong]] area, as did prominent tour guide Geraldene Lowe in her youth.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; [[Katong]] is commonly considered Singapore's main Eurasian enclave because of some history, modern Eurasian literature and the present location of the Eurasian Association, it is more of a [[Peranakan]] Chinese enclave.

The leading association for Eurasians in Singapore is the Eurasian Association at 139 Ceylon Road in Katong.  The Eurasian Association has played a major role in uniting the community and developing a stronger shared identity.  It also a self-help group which serves the Eurasian community in Singapore. It has expanded the definition of Eurasian to include any person of mixed European and Asian parentage. Previously, only persons whose fathers were of European origin or who had European surnames were considered Eurasian.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; As of the end of 2013, there were 2,128 members of the Eurasian Association of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times 'Some Eurasians frustrated for being mistaken as foreigners in Singapore', 5 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Singapore Recreation Club]] facing the [[Padang, Singapore]] near City Hall, founded by several Eurasian men, is considered to a social and sports club that is popular amongst the Eurasians in Singapore.  E.W. Barker played sports like cricket and hockey for the Singapore Recreation Club (SRC) between 1934 and 1941, when the SRC was almost the strongest team in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;History Blog - E.W Barker - historyof07.blogspot.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurasians during the Japanese Occupation==

During the Japanese Occupation, Europeans and Eurasian Singaporeans were generally spared the harsher treatments by the Japanese than other racial groups; however many of them became an increasing nuisance for their activist efforts, in particular the Catholic societies, who fostered strong community bonds with the local Chinese. From December 1943 to April 1944, a combination of a collapsing currency, rising food and continued social activism culminated in the reactionary and punitive land acquisition strategy which relocated about 400 Roman Catholic Chinese and 300 European/Eurasian families (of which most were land-owners and many Chinese households also ran small businesses or shop-keeps from their homes) that forcibly acquired land and fixed property from homeowners in exchange for an equal area of dry land two miles from the town of [[Bahau]] in [[Negeri Sembilan]] state in Malaya. Propagandised in the ironic manner of sending them off to live happier, better lives as a purely Catholic community where they could run their own affairs despite the reality that it was meant as a punishment. The responsibility for administering the affairs of the settlement was mockingly bestowed to prominent activist for Chinese welfare under occupation [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop]], Monseigneur Adrian Devals. On his own accord, Dr C. J. P. Paglar, President of the Eurasian Welfare Association visited the settlement frequently to bring much needed medical and other supplies as well as give the populace moral strength. Although many of the settlers were educated through missionary schools, and many of the landowners had practised limited subsistence farming on their properties in Singapore, the soil at the [[Bahau]] settlement was intentionally apportioned by the Japanese as it consisted of non-arable land where there was insufficient water for irrigation. While the Japanese kept to their policy of restraint against the Europeans and Catholics (mindful of their German and Italian allies), the measure was deliberately intended to result in hardship for the settlers. The entire process which resulted in the deaths of about 500 settlers was extensively concealed under propaganda which sought to portray the departure of Catholic families from Singapore as a willing venture. As many who were relocated were generally of higher social and economic status, the propaganda which depicted better lives, created a resentment in the local populace and misplaced sense of betrayal against those that had initially defended them against the Japanese. The perverse nature of the Japanese propaganda was highly effective and would have lasting ramifications of distrust between the local races and their former colonial protectors. &lt;ref&gt;Straits Times 'New book tells of hardship in Malayan jungles for 3,000 from Singapore during Japanese Occupation' - Benson Ang 12 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Many suffered from malnutrition, as their subsistence farming attempts could not provide self-sufficiency. In addition, they were plagued by malaria and other diseases. An estimated 500 settlers lost their lives, including Bishop Devals who helped many others to survive the ordeal. After the Japanese surrendered to the British in August 1945, the survivors were allowed to return to Singapore however were not compensated for their land or property.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Infopedia 'Bahau settlement' - Joshua Chua&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exxxotica''' is an annual three-day adult-themed event produced by 3XEvents. Billed as a "Celebration of Sexy", Exxxotica Expo shows are held in several US cities, which currently includes [[Edison, New Jersey]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]] and [[Denver]]. First held in 2006, Exxxotica has featured some of the most recognized names in the [[adult industry]], including [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Tera Patrick]] and [[Katie Morgan]].

== Miami Beach/Fort Lauderdale ==
The Exxxotica Expo had its first show in May 2006 at the [[Miami Beach Convention Center]]. The Exxxotica Expo would continue to be held each year at this venue through 2012. After the 2012 show, the event organizers announced that the expo would be moving to [[Fort Lauderdale]] in 2013. The event would go on to be held in Fort Lauderdale in 2013 and 2014, but did not return in 2015, thus ending a nine-year streak of Exxxotica shows in Florida. Exxxotica returned to Florida in July 2018, with a show at the Miami Airport Convention Center.

== New Jersey ==

In 2008, the event was expanded to the New York/New Jersey market. The 2008 and 2009 shows were billed as "Exxxotica NY", although both shows actually took place in [[New Jersey]]. The 2008 event was originally scheduled to be held in [[Secaucus]], New Jersey. Just days before the event, Secaucus officials filed a [[Lawsuit|suit]] to stop the event from taking place, alleging that the convention would violate state law prohibiting [[liquor license]] owners from presenting [[pornographic material]]. Exxxotica convention organizers voluntarily moved the convention to the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=mayor&gt;{{cite web|last=Burd|first=Josua|title=UPDATE: Despite criticism from mayor, porn convention moves to Edison after Secaucus opposition|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20080909/NEWS/80909029/UPDATE-Despite-criticism-from-mayor-porn-convention-moves-to-Edison-after-Secaucus-opposition:|work=MyCentralJersey.com|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edison show would go on to attract over 18,000 attendees that year, and this event continues to be held yearly at the Edison venue. In September 2010, a lawsuit against a former Secaucus mayor surfaced due to the cancelling/moving of the convention to a different area. In addition to the yearly show in Edison, Exxxotica held its first show in [[Atlantic City]] at the [[Trump Taj Mahal|Trump Taj Mahal Casino &amp; Resort]] in April 2013. Another show would be held at the same venue in Atlantic City in 2014, but Exxxotica would not return to Atlantic City in 2015. In November 2017, Exxxotica celebrated their tenth anniversary in Edison, NJ with record attendance of approximately 30,000 attendees over the three days of the expo.

== Los Angeles ==
The Exxxotica Expo held its first show in Los Angeles at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] on July 9–11, 2010, bringing in approximately 15,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exxxotica Show Debuts in Los Angeles|url=http://www.xbiznewswire.com/view.php?id=122665|work=XBizNewsWire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to hold a show in Los Angeles came in part due to the fact that [[Erotica LA]], a similar consumer adult entertainment event, made the decision not to hold a show in 2010. The Exxxotica LA shows drew in the lowest attendance of the three locations. 2011 was the final year that Exxxotica held a show in Los Angeles.

== Chicago ==
The Exxxotica Expo held its first show in the Chicago area in July 2011, taking place in July at the [[Donald E. Stephens Convention Center]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]]. The show attracted a record 26,500 attendees, eclipsing the previous record of 24,000 set in 2008 in Miami Beach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">A '''girl's court''' is an [[gender responsive approach for girls in the juvenile justice system]] that links young "at-risk" females to [[social service]] agencies, providing informal sessions on everything from [[body image]], education and counseling with a team of adults to provide trust and support.&lt;ref name=nyr1401&gt;{{cite news |title=A Court's All-Hands Approach Aids Girls Most at Risk | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/us/a-courts-all-hands-approach-aids-girls-most-at-risk.html?_r=0 |first=PATRICIA LEIGH |last=BROWN |date=January 28, 2014 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some half dozen such courts have emerged around the United States, each defining itself around the problems in the surrounding area. One common theme is to treat young [[sex worker]]s as the victims of [[sex trafficking]]. Identifying reasons for entry into these behaviors such as  [[childhood abuse]]&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt; and dysfunctional homes is important to understanding the nature of the crime and circumstances unique to girls.

== California ==

The [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] Girls court started in 2009. It focuses teenage girls in long-term [[foster care]], with preliminary studies suggesting better grades and fewer placements.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

The Alameda County Girls Court handles young women who have been recruited as [[child prostitute]]s or are considered at risk for involvement. It was founded in 2011 and carved out of the existing juvenile court. A 2013 survey of 113 sexually exploited youths by WestCoast Children's Clinic found that 75 percent of such youngsters here and in a neighboring county had experienced abuse and neglect. For example, one girl was found passed out on the street, having injected drugs she could not identify. Another, whose mother, a [[methamphetamine]] addict, "sold" her daughter to an uncle who sexually exploited her in exchange for drugs. The county's H.E.A.T. Watch unit, started by the district attorney in 2006, targets people who traffic in women: as of 2013, 111 exploiters of children under 18 had been convicted. Most girls attend [[residential treatment]] programs out of state. Many are re-exploited after returning.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

In [[Los Angeles County]], a sex trafficking court diverts girls to local foster care agencies and social service providers, while the probation department now has a dedicated unit to support young victims.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

== Florida ==

In [[Florida]],  Circuit 4 Girls Court is a specialized form of juvenile court that assists in linking young "at risk" females to community resources, social service agencies, mentors and offers a holistic team approach. The young ladies are provided tools to be successful in the community. Girls Court is a collaboration between Department of Juvenile Justice, Family Support Services, The Fourth Judicial Circuit, the Delores Barr Weaver Policy Center and many more valuable community providers.  Florida has two courts; one is in [[Jacksonville]] and the other in [[Pinellas County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rutland|first1=Meredith |title=Girls Court aims to support young women with services, not sentences|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=Sep 17, 2014|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-09-17/story/girls-court-aims-support-young-women-services-not-sentences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Michigan ==

[[Michigan]] has a girl's court in [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee]], which was started by Judge David Newblatt of the Genesee County 7th Circuit Court.  It applies to all girls under 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minbcnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=1072153#.VYmdm_lVhBc&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides girls with resources and counseling.&lt;ref&gt;http://burtonview.mihomepaper.com/news/2015-06-18/News/Local_advocates_for_women_and_girls_recognized.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hawaii ==

The court in [[Hawaii]] is a program where both parents and girls attend counseling for a year. It has led to a marked decrease in detentions, according to a 2011 evaluation.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

== Minnesota ==

In 2015, sexually exploited minors in Minnesota will be referred to one of six regional case managers who will direct them to a network of emergency shelters.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

== New York ==

[[New York State]] has a new network of 11 statewide Human Trafficking Intervention Courts for those 16 years and up. New York State's Safe Harbor law, the country's first, classifies trafficked minors through age 17 as needing supervision rather than probation.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

== Oregon ==

Oregon revised its child welfare practice so that a trafficked minor is considered a victim of abuse and the province of the [[child welfare]] system rather than the courts.&lt;ref name=nyr1401/&gt;

==Texas==

Texas Supreme Court rules in 2010 that minors younger than 14 involved with [[prostitution]] charges will be considered a victim. The court decided that they would provide services with out criminalization. The court created a half way house called Freedom House to provide a safe place for the young women to receive services such as school and counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foxhall|first1=Emily|title=A Shelter for Victims of Sex Trafficking offers counseling, School and Safety|publisher=New York Times|date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freedom House can house up to 30 girls, starting at 10 years old up to 18, and receive educational, medical and psychological care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Jennifer|title=Sex trafficking treatment center place to begin again|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=The Courier|date=Mar 31, 2012|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/news/sex-trafficking-treatment-center-place-to-begin-again/article_d31a2501-bfa0-5976-90ff-7e3143a8ecfe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wisconsin==

In Wisconsin a Milwaukee County Committee is considering a girl court that will be aimed at young women who are accused of [[sex trafficking]]. This will also include girls who experience trauma and are involved in status offense crimes. If they move forward with the court they plan to have one or more judges trained in handling these types of offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heisig|first1=Eric|title=Girl Court Under Consideration In Wisconsin|journal=Wisconsin Law Journal|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In Australia they have [[Juvenile court]] with gender specific services for young women charged with crimes. These specific services are away from male offenders. The services offered vary by location from health and wellbeing, relationships, education &amp; training and other programs like cooking and following the law. Australia recognizes the need to treat young women with gender specific services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Girls and Young Women in Juvenile Justice System|journal=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|date=October 2012|volume=Bulletin 107|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Courts are creating [[Gender responsive approach for girls in the juvenile justice system]]. These courts look to address gendered issues for girls but do not yet have their own formal girls courts. They practice a variety of programs aimed at addressing gendered issues for girls in juvenile court

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

==History==
[[Islam]] was introduced to the [[Horn of Africa]] around 16 century from the [[Arabian peninsula]].

'''John Sutton Nettlefold''', [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (2 May 1866 &amp;ndash; 3 November 1930)&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; was an English social reformer.

He was the fourth son of Edward John Nettlefold (the son of [[John Sutton Nettlefold]], 1792–1866) and was born in London in 1866. In 1878, he came to Birmingham and after leaving school entered the [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]] offices of Messrs. Nettlefold and Co. (later [[GKN]]). Subsequently he resigned his post and became managing director of [[Kynoch|Kynoch Ltd]], a position he retained for many years. He was also chairman of Thomas Smith's Stampings Ltd, and a director of [[Henry Hope &amp; Sons Ltd|Henry Hope and Sons Ltd]] for a considerable period.  

[[File:Memorial plaque to John Sutton Nettlefold within Moorpool Hall, Harborne - geograph.org.uk - 972353.jpg|thumb|150px|Memorial plaque to John Sutton Nettlefold within [[Moorpool]] Hall]]
In 1898 he entered the [[Birmingham City Council|City Council]] as a representative of [[Edgbaston]] and [[Harborne]] Ward, and remained a Councillor until 1911. In addition to his work for social reform Nettlefold was interested in charitable and philanthropic movements. For several years he was honorary secretary, and afterwards chairman of the [[Birmingham Women's Hospital|Women’s Hospital]], and a liberal subscriber to its funds. He was also at one time honorary treasurer of the Graham Street Charity School, and took a keen interest in the work of the Fazeley Street Mission. Nettlefold was a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Worcestershire, and also a magistrate for the city of Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Birmingham Post 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Pioneer of Town Planning in Birmingham|newspaper=Birmingham Post|date=5 November 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whilst living in Birmingham, Nettlefold commissioned a home for his family from the architect [[Joseph Lancaster Ball]]. The resulting [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style house was called Winterbourne and it and its grounds are open to the public, the latter forming the [[University of Birmingham]]s' [[Winterbourne Botanic Garden]].&lt;ref name="WHG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winterbourne.org.uk/|title=Winterbourne House &amp; Garden|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettlefold's most notable contribution was to the improvement of public housing in Birmingham for the working classes. In 1901, as the chairman of Birmingham's new Housing Committee he extended the city's [[slum clearance]] works.&lt;ref name=suburbanbirmingham1&gt;{{cite web|title=www.suburbanbirmingham.org.uk: Councillor J.S. Nettlefold, J.P.|url=http://www.search.suburbanbirmingham.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?resource=1418|accessdate=13 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050649/http://www.search.suburbanbirmingham.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?resource=1418|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 when the majority of inner city housing was of a crowded back-to-back design, Nettlefold established the [[garden suburb]] [[Moor Pool]] in [[Harborne]] to provide low density affordable housing with many interspersed green spaces, centred around a community hall. His publications on urban planning included "Slum Reform and Town Planning",&lt;ref name=slumreform&gt;{{cite book|last=Nettlefold|first=John Sutton|title=Slum Reform and Town Planning|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Practical Housing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nettlefold|first=John Sutton|title=Practical Housing|year=1908|publisher=Garden City Press|location=Letchworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jùjú''' is a style of [[Nigeria]]n [[popular music]], derived from traditional [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[percussion instrument|percussion]]. The name comes from a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word "juju" or "jiju" meaning "throwing" or "something being thrown." Juju music did not derive its name from [[juju]], which "is a form of magic and the use of magic objects or [[witchcraft]] common in [[West Africa]], [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]] and other [[South American]] nations." It evolved in the 1920s in urban clubs across the countries, and was believed to have been created by AbdulRafiu Babatunde King, popularly known as [[Tunde King]]. The first jùjú recordings were by [[Tunde King]] and [[Ojoge Daniel]] from the same era of the 1920s when [[Tunde King]] pioneered it.  The lead and predominant instrument of Jùjú is the ''Iya Ilu,"' [[talking drum]].

Some Jùjú musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the "blind minstrel" [[Kokoro (musician)|Kokoro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Culture and customs of Nigeria

'''Afro-juju''' is a style of [[Music of Nigeria|Nigerian popular music]], a mixture of Jùjú music and [[Afrobeat]]. Its most famous exponent was [[Shina Peters]], who was so popular that the press called the phenomenon "Shinamania". Afro-juju's peak of popularity came in the early 1990s.

==History==
Following [[World War II]], electric instruments began to be included, and pioneering musicians like Earnest Olatunde Thomas ([[Tunde Nightingale]]), [[Fatai Rolling Dollar]], [[I. K. Dairo]], [[Dele Ojo]], [[Ayinde Bakare]], Adeolu Akinsanya, [[King Sunny Adé]], and [[Ebenezer Obey]] made the genre the most popular in [[Nigeria]], incorporating new influences like [[funk]], [[reggae]] and Afrobeat and creating new subgenres like [[yo-pop]]. Some new generation juju artistes include Oludare Olateju also known as  Ludare,  the  son  of Sabada juju music  creator; Emperor Wale Olateju and [[Bola Abimbola]]. Although Juju music, like [[apala]], [[sakara music|sakara]], [[Fuji music|fuji]], and [[Waka music|waka]] was created by [[Muslim]] [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], the music itself remains secular. [[King Sunny Adé]] was the first to include the [[pedal steel guitar]], which had previously been used only in [[Hawaiian music]] and American [[country music]].

==Performance==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}Jùjú music is performed primarily by artists from the southwestern region of [[Nigeria]], where the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are the most numerous ethnic group.  In performance, audience members commonly shower jùjú musicians with paper money; this tradition is known as "spraying".

One of the centers of the performance of jùjú music is in Ibadan. Most jùjú musicians are based in the zone of market forces, and most of these are in an area of immigrant neighborhoods. 
There are several contexts in which jùjú music is performed. One of these contexts is ‘the Hotels’. The Hotels are concentrated in the immigrant areas and they serve as taverns, dance halls and brothels. They range from very small wooden structures to clusters of two or three building with a stage in the middle. Most activity takes place after nine pm and the hotels are the center of Ibadan’s nocturnal economic structure. One of the economic activities associated with the hotels is the sale of drinks and food. The Hotels are seen as places of relaxation, where patrons, mainly men, come to escape every day life. They are places where people can come to do things that they might not want to be seen doing at home. The jùjú music performed is not the focus of the venue but most patrons prefer live music to records. The bands that perform do not have a guaranteed wage; instead they rely upon donations from patrons. Most bands will only perform during the weeknights, leaving the weekends free for more lucrative gigs.  
Another context in which jùjú music is played is at celebrations called àríyá. These celebrations are parties which celebrate the naming of a baby, weddings, birthdays, funerals, title-taking, ceremonies and the launching of new property or business enterprises. These events are sponsored so the musicians are guaranteed payment. The wealth of the hosts and the guests is shown through their reward to the entertainers. It is customary to press the contribution to the musician’s forehead so that everyone can see how wealthy they are. The musicians will often return good payment with praise songs to the donors.  Live music is crucial to the proper functioning of an àríyá.

'''''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life''''' (published 1985) is a book by [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]]. It examines the debate between [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] over Boyle's air-pump experiments in the 1660s. In 2005, Shapin and Schaffer were awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]] for this work.

On a theoretical level, the book explores the acceptable methods of knowledge production, and societal factors related to the different knowledge systems promoted by Boyle and Hobbes. The "Leviathan" in the title refers to Hobbes's book on the structure of society, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil]]'' and the "Air-Pump" refers to Robert Boyle's invention. The book also contains a translation by Schaffer of Hobbes's ''Dialogus physicus de natura aeris''. It attacked Boyle and others who founded the society for experimental research, soon known as the [[Royal Society]].

Shapin and Schaffer state, in their first chapter ''Understanding Experiment'', that they wish to answer the question, "Why does one do experiments in order to arrive at scientific truth?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Their aim is to use a historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his [[experimental method]], to discover the origins of the credibility that we give experimentally produced facts today.  The authors wish to avoid "'The self-evident'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of [[empiricism]]).  They wish to take a "stranger's"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"/&gt; viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic community&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's [[natural philosophy]] would not have been obvious to contemporaries.

They explain that, traditionally, Hobbes's position on natural philosophy has been dismissed by historians because historians perceived Hobbes as "misunderstanding"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle's work.  Thus, in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer aim to avoid bias and consider both sides' arguments with equal weight. In addition, they comment on the social instability of [[English Restoration|Restoration]] society post-1660.  They aim to show that the debate between these two contemporaries had political fallout beyond the intellectual sphere, and that accepting Hobbes or Boyle's method of knowledge production was also to accept a social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
== Chapter II: Seeing and Believing: The Experimental Production of Pneumatic Facts ==
Chapter two outlines Boyle's theory of knowledge production, which revolves around the creation of the "matter of fact".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to an experimentally generated piece of knowledge separate from a universal theory and that was based on probability.  This is in direct opposition to Hobbes (discussed in chapter 3), who required "absolute certainty" based on "logic and geometry" to consider a phenomenon a fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eyes of Boyle and his colleagues, the abandonment of absolute certainty was not "a regrettable retreat from more ambitious goals; it was celebrated as a wise rejection of a failed project".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, because "matters of fact" did not have to be absolute, universal assent was not necessary for the production of knowledge.  Boyle made use of three knowledge-producing technologies in order to produce knowledge: "a ''material technology'' embedded in the construction and operation of the air-pump; a ''literary technology'' by means of which the phenomena produced by the pump were made known to those who were not direct witnesses; and a ''social technology'' that incorporated the conventions that experimental philosophers should use in dealing with each other and considering knowledge-claims".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, Shapin and Schaffer give a description of the "material technology," the air-pump itself, essentially a [[suction pump]] attached to a replaceable glass bulb.  When the pump was set in motion, the air would be evacuated from the glass bulb thus creating what we now consider to be a vacuum, but what for contemporaries was a space of great debate (explained below).  However, the integrity of the pump was far from perfect and this leaking is central to the arguments both for and against experimentalism.  Shapin and Schaffer assert that three important points should be taken into account when considering the pump itself: "(1) that both the engine's integrity and its limited leakage were important resources for Boyle in validating his pneumatic finding and their proper interpretation; (2) that the physical integrity of the machine was vital to the perceived integrity of the knowledge the machine helped to produce; and (3) that the lack of its physical integrity was a strategy used by critics, particularly Hobbes, to deconstruct Boyle's claims and to substitute alternative accounts".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments about experimentally generated knowledge revolve around two of Boyle's experiments.  The first experiment is the [[Torricellian apparatus]] placed within the exhausted receiver (the bulb).  The result is that the liquid in the inverted tube of the Torricellian apparatus falls, but not to the level of the liquid in the dish at the base of the inverted tube.  For Boyle, the water level fell because the air was being evacuated from the bulb and thus its spring and weight were no longer acting on the liquid around the base of the tube holding the liquid in the inverted tube up.  The fact that the water did not fall completely to the bottom of the tube was explained (for Boyle) by the existence of air in the bulb that occurred due to leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  However Boyle was careful not to commit to saying that a vacuum existed in the bulb; he stated only that when air was sucked out of the bulb the level of the liquid in the inverted tube fell&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; - this was the nature of a matter of fact.  The second experiment was based on the theory of cohesion - that "two smooth bodies, such as marble or glass discs, can be made spontaneously to cohere when pressed against each other".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's idea was that if two cohered discs were placed in the receiver of the air-pump they would spontaneously separate without the air's pressure to keep them together.  However, when the receiver was evacuated, they did not separate - a result which Boyle blamed on leakage and the fact that he could not get enough air out of the receiver to reduce the air's pressure to an appropriate level.  It should be noted here that Boyle's definitions of "pressure" and "spring" were never clearly defined,&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt; which we shall see is one of Hobbes's major complaints.

The air-pump granted access to a whole new branch of "elaborate" experiments.  In order to witness the phenomena produced by the pump, one had to have access to a pump - which was vastly expensive and difficult to build.  However, the space in which the existing pumps did work was arguably a public space - albeit a restricted one.  "The laboratory was, therefore, a disciplined space, where experimental, discursive, and social practices were collectively controlled by competent members".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective viewing of the air-pump experiments avoided the problem of single eye-witness testimony (which was unreliable), and it offered a space for discourse.  This social space for discourse had two important restrictions: "dispute over matters of fact" was not allowed, and "the rules of the game by which maters of fact were experimentally produced" was not to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  "In Boyle's view the capacity of experiments to yield matters of fact depended not only upon their actual performance but essentially upon the assurance of the relevant community that they had been so performed".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to expand his audience (and credibility) Boyle recommended to the academic community that replication was crucial, though he admitted that others "[would] find it no easy task".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"/&gt;  As such, the literary technology was used to create "virtual witnessing"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"/&gt; - a technique in which description of the experimental scene is written so that the reader can envision the experiment.  "Stipulations about how to write proper scientific prose were dispersed throughout [Boyle's] experimental reports of the 1660s, but he also composed a special tract on the subject of 'experimental essays.'"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything about how Boyle instructed other experimentalists to write stressed honesty.  He wanted readers to read circumstantial accounts of failed experiments as well as successes, and he asserted that all physical causes should be stated as only "probable."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In summation, Boyle's theory of knowledge production revolves around assent.  All three technologies work towards allowing as many people as possible to come to an agreement about a "matter of fact."

== Chapter III: Seeing Double: Hobbes's Politics of Plenism before 1660 ==
The third chapter centers on Hobbes' side of the debate for the effective production of knowledge.  However, unlike Boyle, Hobbes denies that natural philosophy can be separated from politics and religion.  In the previous chapter, Boyle's "matter of fact" worked towards separation from church and state by remaining objective and probabilistic.  For Hobbes, however, "the boundaries Boyle proposed to erect and maintain were guarantees of continued disorder, not remedies to philosophical dissension".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes also argued for "proper metaphysical language", in contrast to Boyle's reluctance to address the issue of a vacuum and his vague concept of air "pressure."  Hobbes was motivated by three things in his attack on Boyle: (1) to save his own reputation as a natural philosopher, (2) to develop a system of knowledge production that secured order and maintained proper goals for natural philosophy (namely precision instead of probability) and (3) to be sensitive to the needs of Restoration society (discussed in more detail in chapter 7).&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes' denial of a vacuum stems in part from a need for political stability.  It follows logically that if there can be a space which is devoid of matter, then that is proof of "incorporeal substance"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"/&gt; - an idea that was adopted by priests to gain the allegiance of the people by promising the safety of this substance, the immortal soul.  This splits the allegiance of each person in a country between the Church and the Monarch, which creates social instability and ultimately, for Hobbes, the risk of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered incorporeal substance a priestly conspiracy to "usurp power" from the true and legitimate leader - the King.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict could be resolved "by collapsing the hierarchy [spiritual government and material government] in favour of matter".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was to that end that Leviathan proffered a materialist and monist natural philosophy.".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"/&gt;

''Leviathan'' also instructs that the way to produce good theories is through good definition of terms, the use of materialist and monist theory, and the equal importance of ontology and epistemology ("Show men what knowledge is and you will show them the grounds of assent and social order"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 100&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hobbes works from a model of geometry, and the aims of his natural philosophy share the same precision as geometry.  That is why, for Hobbes, good definition is extremely important.  Hobbes also rejects the idea that the senses were reliable enough to be able to provide factual knowledge&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102&lt;/ref&gt; because "the same impressions could be obtained dreaming or waking, by the motions of matter in real external object or by rubbing the eyes".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Instead, Hobbes posits that man's own agency is the place for natural philosophy, once again drawing on geometry: "'as we know, that, if the figure shown be a circle, then any straight line through the centre shall divide it into two equal parts.'  'And this,' Hobbes said, 'is the knowledge required in a philosopher.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Thus, belief played no part in Hobbes' concept of a fact, and this ran in opposition to Boyle because Boyle's "matters of fact" required the consensus of a group of witnesses who all believed the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  "Knowledge was constituted when all believed alike.  Likewise for Boyle's clerical allies, religion was a matter of belief and giving witness to that belief...[Hobbes] strategy was one of behavioural control, not one of internal moral control.  It was not that the control of belief was wrong; it was that such control was impractical and an inadequate surety for order."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Artfully, this chapter ends, "For Hobbes, the rejection of vacuum was the elimination of a space within which dissension could take place."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter IV: The Trouble with Experiment: Hobbes versus Boyle ==
As the chapter title suggests, this chapter focuses on how these two historical figures interacted.  It starts with a list of Hobbes' criticisms of Boyle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
- [Hobbes] was skeptical about the allegedly public and witnessed character of experimental performances, and, therefore, of the capacity to generate consensus, even within the experimental rules of the game.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He regarded the experimental programme as otiose.  It was pointless to perform a systematic series of experiments, for if one could, in fact, discern causes from natural effects, then a single experiment should suffice.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He denied the status of "philosophy" to the outcome of the experimental programme.  "Philosophy", for Hobbes, was the practice of demonstrating how effects followed from causes, or of inferring causes from effects.  The experimental programme failed to satisfy this definition.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He systematically refused to credit experimentalists' claims that one could establish a procedural boundary between observing the positive regularities produced by experiment (facts) and identifying the physical cause that accounts for them (theories).
&lt;br /&gt;
- He persistently treated experimentalists' "hypotheses" and "conjectures" as statements about real causes.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He contended that, whatever hypothetical cause or state of nature Boyle adduced to explain his experimentally produced phenomena, an alternative and superior explanation could be proffered and was, in fact, already available.  In particular, Hobbes stipulated that Boyle's explanations invoked vacuism.  Hobbes's alternatives proceed from plenism.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He asserted the inherently defeasible character of experimental systems and therefore the knowledge experimental practices produced.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes criticized Boyle's experimental space for being private (as it was exclusive to everyone but empiricists) and insisted that the space had a "master"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 113&lt;/ref&gt; - which undermined Boyle's concept of free discourse and consensus to generate matters of fact.  Also he criticized the fact that, since the whole experimental community must come into agreement before a "matter of fact" can be produced, the whole experimental community must view the same demonstration at the same time.  This was an obvious impossibility and was problematic for Boyle because "If they were not witnessed simultaneously and together, then in what ways was the evaluation of experimental testimony different from the evaluation of testimony generally?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes also criticized the air-pump itself, saying that "the physical integrity of the machine was massively violated."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted that "it was impossible to understand the air-pump experiments 'unless the nature of the air is known first.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  This was important for three reasons: (1) because Hobbes said the fluidity of the air ruled out the ability to produce an impermeable seal (2) because describing the air as mixture allowed Hobbes to explain the pumps actions (drawing out the course aspects of the air and leaving behind the more subtle fluid) and (3) because Hobbes said that, since Boyle could not offer a cause for the spring of the air, that made him an inadequate natural philosopher.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"/&gt;  Indeed, it was Boyle's recommendation to ignore causes that Hobbes found intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not an objection to the empirical method.  Hobbes only ever doubted the senses as a reliable source of information.  He makes an example of the motion of a person's blood, "for no one feels the motion of their blood unless it pours forth,"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; as proof of the unreliability of the senses.  Yet he did not object to Harvey's work to prove the motion of the blood - rather he even considered himself a "methodological ally" of Harvey's "both denying the foundational nature and of personal experience."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"/&gt;

"Thus for Hobbes, the task of the natural philosopher was to approach as near as he could to the products of the geometer and the civic philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt; while "Boyle's compulsion was only partial; there was room to differ and tolerance was essential to the maintenance of this partial and liberal compulsion.  Managed dissent within the moral community of experimentalists was safe.  Uncontrollable divisiveness and civil war followed from any other course."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter V: Boyle's Adversaries: Experiment Defended ==
While the previous chapter focuses on the attacks of Boyle's main opponent (Hobbes), this chapter focuses on Boyle's actions in the face of more general adversity.  The three main opponents to Boyle were Hobbes, Linus and More, and Boyle's response to each in turn reflects his opinion of their ideas and shows what parts of his own ideas he deemed essential and what parts he deemed less so.  The figures can be divided into two groups: Linus - who conformed to the model of the experimental programme but did not agree with Boyle's explanation of the air-pump experiments, and Hobbes and More - who attacked the experimental programme as an institution.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

"Linus said there was no vacuum in the Torricellian space.  This was apparent because one could see through that space; if there were a vacuum, 'no visible species could proceed either from it, or through it, unto the eye."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus offered a nonmechanical solution to the sustained height of the liquid in the Torricellian apparatus.  He suggested that "a certain internal thread (funiculus) whose upper extremity was attached to the finger [blocking the top of the inverted tube] and whose lower extremity was attached to the surface of the mercury."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"/&gt;  He also explained that, in the marble disc experiment, the fault was not with the air-pump but rather with Boyle's theory of the spring of the air.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as far as experimental procedure was concerned, Linus was following the rules. So how would Boyle respond?  While Boyle's response contained a restatement of the rules of experimentation, a restatement of the boundaries of experimental philosophy, a defense of his mechanical interpretation, and a particular defense of the spring of the air, Boyle took great pains to "make clear that he generally approved of Linus's manner of constructing and delivering his criticisms."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus was fully welcomed into the experimental community despite his difference of opinion.  Thus, "in his ''Defense'' Boyle would therefore demonstrate not merely that Linus was wrong, but also how experimental controversies ought to be conducted."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Defense'', Boyle restated that "he could not understand why Linus, like Hobbes, had attacked him as a vacuist when he had explicitly declared his nescience on the matter and had identified the question as metaphysical in character" and thus out of the range of experimental exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes on the other hand attacked the validity of the experimental programme itself.  "Boyle's response to Hobbes was fundamentally a defense of the integrity and value of experimental practices."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's reply included a technical response detailing the changes he had made to the pump (immersing it in water), a reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse, "an experimental programme devoted to clearing up the troubles which Hobbes had pointed to in his comments on New Experiments," and an ideological rejection of Hobbes's natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  In his reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse he defended his empirical method by asserting that the argument was over the interpretation of matters of fact and not the facts themselves, thus keeping the experimental way of life out of the line of fire.  In response to Hobbes's criticism that the air had a subtler part that permeated the pump, Boyle stated that "this aether must either be demonstrated by experiment to exist or it was to be regarded as a metaphysical entity",&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 181&lt;/ref&gt; which Boyle has excluded from the scope of the experimental method.

Henry More had three main arguments in relation to Boyle: "(1) that matter itself was passive, inert and stupid; (2) that its motion was guided by 'some Immaterial Being that exercises its directive Activity on the Matter of the World'; (3) that mechanism alone was an inadequate way of accounting for Boyle's phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  He insisted that natural philosophy could be used "as [a weapon] in theology"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 212&lt;/ref&gt; which we have seen is an area that Boyle wished to keep separate from the experimental method.  Thus, in response, Boyle "defended the autonomy and status of his [experimental] community" as separate from other social bodies (such as the Church)&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "of 'the doctor's grand and laudable design, wherein [he] heartily wish[ed] him much success of proving the existence of an incorporeal substance.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle argued that because More's spirit was not a physical principle it could not be part of the language of organized experimenters."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"/&gt;

Thus, from this chapter we see that above all Boyle wished to defend his experimental method, its separation from other bodies of knowledge, and lastly his personal claims about the spring of the air.

== Chapter VI: Replication and Its Troubles: Air-Pumps in the 1660s ==
Chapter 6 is an evaluation of the technologies stated in chapter 2 and their role in replication - namely replication of the material technology and the utility of virtual witnessing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter focuses on the propagation of the pump via the experimental community.

The air-pump was first developed in Oxford and London with the help of the Royal Society (and in response to Hobbes criticism) beginning in 1659.  It was during its development that Robert Moray wrote to Christiaan Huygens (Holland) detailing the changes Boyle would be making to the original design of his pump.  Huygens rejected Boyle's changes and set about making his own alterations.  "Christiaan Huygens was the only natural philosopher in the 1660s who built an air-pump that was outside the direct management of Boyle and Hooke."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of Huygens development, Huygens claimed that "my pneumatic pump was begun to work since yesterday, and all that night a bladder stayed inflated within it [which was a test for the goodness of a pump]...which Mr. Boyle was not able to effect."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, he discovered a phenomenon called anomalous suspension (the suspension of water in a Toricellian apparatus when the water was purged of air, but when a bubble was introduced the water fell) "whose outcome measured the excellence of any air-pump...[and] to interpret this calibration phenomenon, Huygens had summoned into existence a new fluid and challenged the sufficiency of the weight and spring of common air.  The effect of this fluid was only visible in good pumps."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "for more than eighteen months neither of Huygens' claims were granted the status of matters of fact" and it is in this time period that we see how the troubles of replication were dealt with by contemporaries.  The dispute resulted in a flurry of letters between Boyle and Huygens, each attacking the integrity of the other's machine (and by extension the theories of their makers).  "So in March and April 1663 it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 249&lt;/ref&gt; - full and complete breakdown of the technology of virtual witnessing.  Thus, Huygens travelled to London and became part of the Royal Society and replicated his matter of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with replication was that the pumps were constantly being rebuilt, and so results would vary with each reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shapin and Schaffer there were two main problems with replication in the 1660s.  (1) "The accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment.  One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved" and (2) "if replication is the technology which turn belief into knowledge, then knowledge-production depends not just on the abstract exchange of paper and ideas but on the practical social regulation of men and machines."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, "the effective solution to the problem of knowledge was predicated upon a solution to the problem of social order."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter VII: Natural Philosophy and the Restoration: Interests in Dispute ==
"Hobbes and Boyle used the work of the 1640s and 1650s to give rival accounts of the right way to conduct natural philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and, in chapter 7, Shapin and Schaffer show how those models were interpreted and supported by Restoration society.  "The experience of the War and the Republic showed that disputed knowledge produced civil strife...Boyle's technologies could only gain assent within a secure social space for experimental practice...[while] Hobbes assaulted the security of that space because it was yet one more case of divided power."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"/&gt;

In essence, Boyle's theory and Hobbes's theory are inspired by the same problem: what to do when people can't agree on the truth.  Boyle's supporters  "Wilkins and Ward were ejected from the universities...they argued against each other about the virtues of toleration or suppression of Dissent.  Wilkins attacked the Uniformity Act as too coercive: he would have preferred that the Church 'stand without whipping.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301&lt;/ref&gt;  "These exchanges give considerable point to the proposals that Boyle and his allies produced for the establishment of a social space in which dissent would be safe and tolerable."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  In addition, "Sprat's ''History of the Royal Society'' (1667) labeled Hobbesian dogmatism as tyranny, and uncontrolled private judgement as enthusiasm.  Such dangers were to be excluded from the community - otherwise debate would not be safe."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  "The works of Barlow, Pett, and Dury argued that the balance of disputing sects was better than a state that included a cowed and disaffected party coerced into silence."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 302&lt;/ref&gt;  "With Hobbes in view...[[Joseph Glanvill|Glanvill]] insisted that 'dogmatizing is the great disturber both of our selves, and the world with-out us: for while we wed an opinion, we resolvedly ingage against every one that opposeth it...hence grow Schisms, heresies, and anomalies beyond Arithmetick."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Adversaries of the experimental method took offense in two ways.  The first was to "satirize the low status of experimental labour" and label their discipline as little more than children playing with toys.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 307&lt;/ref&gt;  And the second, more social ingrained argument, was that the division between Church and the discovery of "matters of fact" "would weaken, rather than strengthen, the fortunes of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle portrayed the work of experiment as distinct from that of the Church.  Yet its work was also valuable for the churchmen.  If the rules of the experimental game were obeyed, then the game would work well for the godly.  These were the aspects of experimental philosophy that More and his allies found useful at the Restoration."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  As we have seen previously, this allied relationship between natural philosophy and the clergy was unacceptable to Hobbes because it undermined the political authority of the King and caused social instability by splitting the allegiances of the his subjects between his own temporal authority over their bodies and the spiritual authority harnessed by the clergy&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"/&gt;

== Chapter VIII: The Polity of Science: Conclusions ==
In the final chapter of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer condense their vastly complicated picture of Restoration society and how it interacted with the development of modern science to three points.  "First, scientific practitioners have created, selected, and maintained a [[polity]] within which they operate and make intellectual product; second, the intellectual product made within that polity has become an element in political activity and in the state; third, there is a conditional relationship between the nature of the polity occupied by scientific intellectual and the nature of the wider polity."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 332&lt;/ref&gt;  In proving those three points they say they had three things to connect: "(1) the polity of the intellectual community; (2) the solution to the practical problem of making and justifying knowledge; and (3) the polity of the wider society" and that they did so by connection three things: "(1) that the solution to the problem of knowledge is political...(2) that the knowledge thus produced and authenticated become an element in political action in the wider polity...[and] (3) that the contest among alternative forms of life and their characteristic forms of intellectual product depend on the political success of the various candidates in insinuating themselves into the activities of other institutions and other interest groups.  He who has the most, and the most powerful, allies wins."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a departure from the "self-evident" scholars who attribute the victory of the empirical method to its inherent "goodness" (discussed in chapter 1).

They end by relating their examination of Restoration society to their current social climate in the late twentieth century:  "As we come to recognize the conventional and artifactual status of our forms of knowing, we put ourselves in a position to realize that it is ourselves and not reality that is responsible for what we know.  Knowledge, as much as the state, is the product of human actions.  Hobbes was right."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 344&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

== Reception of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' ==
The work has been described as a classic example in the [[history of science]] of the posing of a basic question on [[scientific rationality]]. Can the rationality of two sides in a debate be described, from outside, when hindsight operates and the "road not taken" by science is known?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=austin harrington|author2=Barbara L. Marshall|author3=Hans-Peter Mèuller|title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWHoZJ8RzhoC&amp;pg=PA534|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-29046-3|pages=534–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret C. Jacob wrote that, for a time, it was the most influential book in the field of history of science, following the trend to [[relativism]] with its equation of "scientific discourses" with "strategies of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victoria E. Bonnell|author2=Lynn Avery Hunt|author3=Richard Biernacki|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn: New Directions in the Study of Society and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnZiiFs24MIC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21679-2|pages=101–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. L. Heilbron credits Shapin and Schaffer with picking important aspects of the development of experimental culture that are still relevant, citing specifically the problems with replication.  However, he casts doubt upon the strength of the relationship between politics of the greater society and the politics within the Royal Society.  In addition, Heilbron laments the absence of comparisons to the development of empiricism in the rest of Europe because it blinds the reader to what may have been peculiar to England's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1035825 | year = 1989 | author1 = Heilbron | first1 = J. L. | title = Leviathan and the air-pump. Hobbes, Boyle, and the experimental life | journal = Medical History | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–257 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300049292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Marie Roos, on the other hand, writes that Shapin and Schaffer do indeed draw a connection between the history of science and the history of political thought, and that their resolution to remain impartial when examining the argument between Hobbes and Boyle forces historians of science and politics alike to recognize the relationship between the two branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Roos http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=25967955484936&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence M. Principe, in ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest'', argues extensively that many of the conclusions reached by Shapin and Schaffer rest on inaccurate and at times presentist conceptions of Boyle's work.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Principe. ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest''. Princeton University Press, Princeton 1998. {{ISBN|0-691-01678-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst deny the political background of the Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and has nothing to do with his attack on [[incorporeal substances]], as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst call attention to the remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a [[vacuist]], and long before he became a [[plenist]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm: ''Aspects of Hobbes''. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-924714-5}}. pp. 187-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cees Leijenhorst: ''The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: the Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes’ Natural Philosophy''. Brill, Leiden 2002. {{ISBN|90-04-11729-6}}. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Horstmann, in ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe'', has criticized Shapin and Schaffer's use of the historical evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer have a lot of important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as ''not imaginable'';&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes: ''Thomas White’s De Mundo Examined''. Bradford University Press, London 1976. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Horstmann: ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe''. Mackensen, Berlin 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-926535-52-8}}. ''Leviathan und die Erpumper''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report provides life expectancy at birth for years 2002-06 and 2010-14. In 2002-6, Punjab had the second highest life expectancy. [[Kerala]] had the highest [[life expectancy]] among the [[States and territories of India|states]] in India, while [[Assam]] had the lowest.

This page lists [[wp:notable|notable]] '''bicycle brands and manufacturing companies''' past and present. This article relates to [[bicycle|pedal cycles]]. [[tricycle]]s  and power assisted cycles but does not include [[Motorcycles]]. For bicycle parts, see [[List of bicycle part manufacturing companies]].

Many bicycle brands do not manufacture their own product, but rather import and re-brand bikes manufactured by others (e.g., [[Nishiki (bicycle)|Nishiki]]), sometimes designing the bike, specifying the equipment, and providing quality control. There are also brands that have, at different times, been manufacturers as well as [[badge engineering|re-branders]]: a company with manufacturing capability may market models made by other (overseas) factories, while simultaneously manufacturing bicycles in-house, for example, high-end models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep on Bikin’: American-Made Bikes Making a Comeback|url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Keep-on-Biking-American-Made-Bikes-Making-Comeback.aspx|publisher=www.utne.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only brands or manufacturers that are notable as a bicycle brand should be included. If no page exists for the company or brand, then the page to be linked to should be created first or a reference provided as to its notability or the entry will probably be removed.

'''Margaret Ethel MacDonald''' (''née'' '''Gladstone'''; 20 July 1870 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1911) was a British [[feminist]], [[social reformer]], and wife of Labour politician [[Ramsay MacDonald]] from 1896 until her death from blood poisoning in 1911.

==History==
Margaret Gladstone was born in Kensington, London, to [[John Hall Gladstone]], later [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution]]. She was educated both [[governess|at home]] and at [[Doreck College]] in [[Bayswater]]. Early in adulthood she was involved in voluntary [[social work]], including visits for the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in [[Hoxton]].

By 1890 she was a keen socialist, influenced by the [[Christian Socialists]] and the [[Fabian Society]].

In 1894 she joined the [[Women's Industrial Council]], serving on several committees and organising the enquiry into home work in London, which was published in 1897. She met Ramsay MacDonald through this work in 1895 and they married in 1896. She was comfortably off, although not wealthy. This allowed them to indulge in foreign travel, visiting [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] in 1897, [[South Africa]] in 1902, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in 1906, and [[India]] several times.
 
After her marriage she was concerned about the need for skilled work and training for women and played a key part in establishing the first [[Vocational school|trade schools]] for girls in 1904. She continued this work until 1910.

She was a member of the [[National Union of Women Workers]]. She served on the executive of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]], although she was opposed to militant action. In 1906 she became involved in the formation of the [[Women's Labour League]], serving as chair until her death in 1911.&lt;ref name="hartley"&gt;Cathy Hartley, ''A Historical Dictionary of British Women'', p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage to Ramsay MacDonald was a very happy one, and they had six children, including [[Malcolm MacDonald]] (1901–81), who had a prominent career as a politician, colonial governor, and diplomat; and [[Ishbel MacDonald]] (1903–82), official hostess to her father. After Margaret MacDonald's death, Ramsay MacDonald became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] three times but did not remarry.

The ''Memorial to Margaret MacDonald'' was said to be designed by her husband, and sculpted by [[Richard Reginald Goulden]]. It was unveiled in 1914 in the garden of Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/goulden/5.html|title=Memorial Seat for Margaret MacDonald, Lincoln's Inn Fields, by Richard Goulden |website=www.victorianweb.org |access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">A '''micro-conference''' is a small scale [[:wikt:conference|conference]] that allows [[researcher]]s to present and [[discuss]] their work. They provide a channel for the exchange of nascent ideas and an opportunity for [[academic]] collaboration.

==Overview==
Micro-conferences draw upon a collaborative ‘workshop’ tradition of research &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Taylor, ‘History Workshop Journal’, ''Making History'' http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/HWJ.html.&lt;/ref&gt; and occupy the space between a [[seminar]] and an [[academic conference]]. 
Like seminars they bring together small groups to focus on a particular subject and encourage active participation. However, like academic conferences they are usually composed of various research-led [[presentation]]s and focus upon the informal dissemination of ideas rather than academic instruction. 
They are short and concise, with participants offering a brief overview or raising research-led questions. These are usually submitted as a short abstract and reviewed before the presentation is accepted.

The '''Monguor language''' ({{zh|s=土族语|p=Tǔzúyǔ}}; also written '''Mongour''' and '''Mongor''') is a [[Mongolic language]] of its Shirongolic branch and is part of the Gansu–Qinghai [[sprachbund]]. There are several dialects, mostly spoken by the [[Monguor]] people. A written script was devised for Huzhu Monguor (Mongghul) in the late 20th century, but has been little used. A division into two languages, namely Mongghul in [[Huzhu Tu Autonomous County]] and Mangghuer in [[Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County]], is considered necessary by some linguists. While Mongghul was under strong influence from [[Amdo Tibetan|Tibetan]], the same holds for Mangghuer and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and local dialects of Chinese such as [[Gangou dialect|Gangou]] were in turn influenced by Monguor.

== Phonology ==
Monguor has five vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/289_fulltext.pdf|title=Mongolic Phonology and the Qinghai-Gansu Languages|last=Hans|first=Nugteren|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''naming taboo''' is a cultural [[taboo]] against speaking or writing the given names of exalted persons in [[China]] and neighboring nations in the ancient [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. This taboo is important to keep in mind when studying ancient historical texts from the cultural sphere, as historical characters and/or locations may be renamed if they happen to share a name with the emperor in power (or previous emperors of the same dynasty) when the text was written.

==Kinds==
* The ''naming taboo of the state'' (国讳; 國諱) discouraged the use of the emperor's given name and those of his ancestors.  For example, during the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s given name Zheng (政) was avoided, and the first month of the year "Zheng Yue" (政月: the administrative month) was rewritten into "Zheng Yue" (正月: the upright month) and furthermore renamed as "Duan Yue" (端月: the proper/upright month). The strength of this taboo was reinforced by law; transgressors could expect serious punishment for writing an emperor's name without modifications. In 1777, [[Wang Xihou]] in his dictionary criticized the [[Kangxi dictionary]] and wrote the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s name without leaving out any stroke as required. This disrespect resulted in his and his [[Nine exterminations|family's executions]] and confiscation of their property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081119161631/http://project1.caryacademy.org/ChineseHistory/2004/HistorySarah/glory%20days.htm Cary Academy: The Qing Glory Days]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of naming taboo is no longer observed in modern China.
* The ''naming taboo of the clan'' (家讳; 家諱) discouraged the use of the names of one's own ancestors. Generally, ancestor names going back to seven generations were avoided. In diplomatic documents and letters between clans, each clan's naming taboos were observed.
* The ''naming taboo of the holinesses'' (圣人讳; 聖人諱) discouraged the use of the names of respected people.  For example, writing [[Confucius]]' name was taboo during the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]].

==Methods to avoid offence==
[[Image:Omitting a stroke.png|thumb|200px|Avoidance of naming taboo: Example of omitting a stroke. The last stroke of each character of Kangxi Emperor's given name "玄" (xuán) and "燁" (yè) is omitted.]]
There were three ways to avoid using a taboo character:
* Changing the character to another one, usually a [[synonym]] or which sounded similar to the character being avoided. For example, the Xuanwu Gate (玄武門: the [[Black Tortoise|Black Warrior]] Gate) of the [[Forbidden City]] was renamed as "Shenwu" (神武門: [[Gate of Divine Might]]) in order to avoid using a character from the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s name, Xuanye (玄燁).
* Leaving the character as a blank.
* Omitting a stroke in the character, usually the final stroke.

==In history==
Throughout Chinese history, there were emperors whose names contained common characters who would try to alleviate the burden of the populace in practicing name avoidance. For example, [[Emperor Xuan of Han]], whose given name Bingyi (病已) contained two very common characters, changed his name to Xun (詢), a far less common character, with the stated purpose of making it easier for his people to avoid using his name.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷025|vol. 25]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]], whose given name Shimin (世民) also contained two very common characters, ordered that name avoidance only required the avoidance of the characters ''Shi'' and ''Min'' in direct succession and that it did not require the avoidance of those characters in isolation.  However, his son [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] effectively made this edict of Emperor Taizong ineffective after his death by requiring the complete avoidance of the characters ''Shi'' and ''Min'', necessitating the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Li Shiji]] to change his name to Li Ji.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷199|vol. 199]].&lt;/ref&gt; In later dynasties, princes were frequently given names that contained uncommon characters to make it easier for the public to avoid them, should they become emperor later in life.

The custom of naming taboo had a built-in contradiction: without knowing what the emperors' names were one could hardly be expected to avoid them, so somehow the emperors' names had to be informally transmitted to the populace to allow them to learn them in order to avoid them.  In one famous incident in 435, during the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]], [[Goguryeo]] ambassadors made a formal request that the imperial government issue them a document containing the emperors' names so that they could avoid offending the emperor while submitting their king's petition.  [[Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei]] agreed and issued them such a document.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷122|vol. 122]].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the mechanism of how the regular populace would be able to learn the emperors' names remained generally unclear throughout Chinese history.

Since every reign of every dynasty had its own naming taboos, the study of naming taboos can help date an ancient text.

==In other countries==

In Vietnam, the family name [[Huang (surname)#Hoàng/Huỳnh|Hoàng]] (黄) was changed to [[Huang (surname)#Hoàng/Huỳnh|Huỳnh]] in the South due to the naming taboo of Lord [[Nguyễn Hoàng]]'s name.  Similarly, the family name "Vũ" is known as "Võ" in the South.

Japan was also heavily influenced by the naming taboo. In modern Japan, it concerns only the [[Emperor of Japan]], whom people only refer as Tennō Heika (天皇陛下, his Majesty the Emperor) or Kinjō Heika (今上陛下, his current Majesty). Ancient Japanese people had so much respect for this custom that historians forgot the actual names of many historical figures or even sometimes the correct pronunciation, as many [[Kanji|Han characters]] have multiple pronunciations. For example, the son of [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Oda Nobukatsu]], is often called Oda Nobuo; but it mainly concerns more ancient historical figures like [[Murasaki Shikibu]], whose actual name may forever remain a mystery.

Many Aboriginal Australian cultures avoid the names of deceased persons, both verbally and in written language. For this reason, the names of many notable Aboriginal people were only recorded by Westerners and may have been incorrectly transliterated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">The '''National Food Survey''' is a syndicated, multi-year study of food habits and consumption across urban [[India]], conducted bi-annually by [[IMRB International]]. The last round of the National Food Survey was conducted in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;IMRB page about NFS http://www.imrbint.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=139:national-food-survey&amp;catid=5:syndicated-offers&amp;Itemid=8&lt;/ref&gt;

NFS is one of the most comprehensive studies in terms of categories, and information coverage, providing baseline information on food [[consumer behaviour|purchase behavior]]. The Food survey collects information on 55 varied product categories ranging from [[breakfast]] cereals to ready-to-eat foods and provides a range of information on variables such as category penetration, frequency of purchase, trial and usage of brands and barriers to adoption of certain food categories. The study also captures information on [[News media|media]], [[demographic]], and kitchen related variables.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Surveyors www.indiamarkets.com/imo/industry/foodprocessing/foodftof11.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The Food Survey is not to be confused with a similarly named government social survey conducted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government. Unlike the British National Food Survey it does not provide information for [[economic planning]], and is primarily a research tool for food [[marketers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10586">In [[political science]], [[political economy|political economics]], and [[peace and conflict studies]], referring to the [[military–industrial complex]], the '''peace–industrial complex''' defines the industry and economy derived from [[international development|development]], [[peacemaking]], [[peacebuilding]], and [[conflict resolution]] at both the domestic and foreign levels. While some scholars (Seiberling 1972) argue that the peace–industrial complex must oppose the military-industrial complex, others (Aberkane 2012) argue it is destined to become its natural, peaceful evolution, and further call it the "military-industrial complex 2.0". The latter argue the peace-industrial complex more precisely consists of turning military [[research and development]] into civilian technology as systematically as possible. Although it has been discussed in more recent times the concept was introduced as early as in 1969 by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to the War Against War ==

=== Origin of the Peace-industrial complex ===
At least two approaches to the [[War Against War]] may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or [[Anti-war movement]] on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of [[William James]]' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the [[UNESCO]], that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech [[Martin Luther King]] further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane):

{{cquote| We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s. The Sirens had the ability to sing so sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer [[Orpheus]] whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens. When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-lecture.html Martin Luther King, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 11th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|200px| Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964]]

Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible [[war profiteering]], thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the military-industrial complex rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex.

[[File:John F. Seiberling 93rd Congress 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px| US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex]]

In 1986 [[Keith Suter|Keith D. Suter]] defended his Ph.D dissertation on ''Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex'',&lt;ref&gt;Suter, K. D.  Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex, Ph.D Thesis, Deakin University, Victoria, 1986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAcNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was further cited in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, R. Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Peace–industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ83AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: "It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex". It received further citation throughout the 1970s. The notion appeared in the '[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|United States Congress House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;National science policy and priorities act of 1972: Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, second session U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972 p.153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a congressional address by US [[John F. Seiberling|Rep. J.F. Seiberling]] (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Rep. J. F. Seiberling, "The case for economic conversion" Congressional record v.118, n°95, 13 June 1972, pp E6177-6179, cited in Science Policy Reviews, Volumes 4 à 5 Battelle Memorial Institute, 1972 p. 398 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK], see also Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress, Volume 118, Part 16 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972 p.20738 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G20Udh7ynykC&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter further defended that "each country create a national Ministry for Peace",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i4pinternational.org/files/202/7.+national+ministries+for+peace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was contemporary to the creation of the Ministry for Peace Australia (MFPA) initiative and the Global Alliance for Ministries &amp; Infrastructures for Peace (GAMIP). An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Transcendentist school ===
If Kofi J. Roberts&lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing of federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, [[Idriss Aberkane|Idriss J. Aberkane]] further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the "military-industrial complex 2.0" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace-industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls "weapons of mass construction" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and [[soft power]] than weapons of mass destruction.

{{cquote| every time a military technology makes it to civilian use it changes the world for good and what it brings you is love rather than hatred, for if you project destruction you're gonna be hated, if you project construction, you're gonna be loved. So what is power, truly, what is a [[superpower]]? Is it a nation that has [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]? No it is not! Many nations have weapons of mass destruction they are not all superpowers (...) when you're looking at [[The Pentagon]] you're looking at a [[Military budget of the United States|budget]] of 740 billion US dollars, that's the budget of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] plus de [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget#Discretionary spending|discretionary budget]] that is allocated to Research and Development for defense. I'm not saying we should take it away from the Pentagon, I say we should move to the Pentagon 2.0. For so far, what has America gained in projecting every bits of these dollars? Every time America uses these dollars is it more loved? Is it more respected? Is it safer? Is it more trusted? Does it have more leadership? (...) America could project this money to gain love, respect, leadership and political power. This, is the military-industrial complex 2.0. [It] will be interested in weapons of mass construction rather than weapons of mass destruction because these weapons are the future in terms of power. For what was the power of the 20th century? In the 20th century power was [[Nuclear winter|the ability to go from a beautiful blue planet to a red one]]. If you could turn a blue planet into a red one you were powerful. We have the technology to do that, these (sic) are called weapons of mass destruction. Do we have the technology to go the other way around? Can we [[Terraforming|turn a red planet - Mars in that case - into a beautiful green planet]]? We can't but when you're looking at a budget of seven hundred billions US dollars you can look into that. This is gonna be 21st century power, weapons of mass construction. Why? because if you project these weapons I guarantee you people are gonna love you&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLIzupsfiV8 Aberkane, Bring on the Peace-Industrial Complex, Wikistage Paris 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1991">The '''penny sit-up''' was a [[Victorian era]] term to describe one of the first [[homeless shelter]]s to be created for the people of [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], in central [[London]]. It was operated by the [[Salvation Army]] during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in order to provide comfort and support to its destitute clients. What made this shelter unique was that in exchange for a [[penny]], clients would be allowed to sit on a bench in a reasonably warm room all night long. Moreover, they were not allowed to lie down and sleep on the bench.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Pennysitup.jpg|right|thumb|Salvation Army homeless clients at Blackfriars circa 1900]] --&gt;
A penny sit-up was the cheapest [[homeless]] shelter at that time. There were more expensive homeless shelters available in London, such as a "[[four penny coffin]]".

By today's standards this shelter at Blackfriars would be considered inadequate and callous toward these individuals. However, at the time this was considered a well-meaning, inexpensive, and compassionate attempt to deal with the relatively new phenomenon of homelessness. The Salvation Army believed these shelters provided relief from the harsh London winters and provided new devoted followers to the [[Christian]] faith.  Others, such as Professor Howard Sercombe of the [[University of Strathclyde]] have argued that such institutions were more likely to have been designed in order to control the homeless, or at the very best - a compassionate response to the harsh "moving on" laws of the time, which made it illegal for people to remain vagrantly upon the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Youth studies journal of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Edouard Leopold Verger''', alias '''Fatumbi''' or '''Fátúmbí''' (4 November 1902, in [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; 11 February 1996, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Brazil) was a [[photography|photographer]], self-taught [[ethnography|ethnographer]], and ''[[babalawo]]'' ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] priest of Ifa) who devoted most of his life to the study of the [[Africa]]n diaspora &amp;mdash; the [[slave trade]], the African-based religions of the new world, and the resulting cultural and economical flows from and to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cusack, Alex Norman Handbook of New Religions and Cultural Production  2012- Page 480 "... were the french anthropologists Pierre Verger (1902–1996) and [[Roger Bastide]] (1898–1974), who both turned out to be a kind of 'culture hero' for both Candomblé and the afro-brazilian people."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
At the age of 30, after losing his family, Pierre Verger took up the career of journalistic photographer. Over the next 15 years, he traveled the four continents, documenting many civilizations that would soon be effaced by progress. His destinations included Tahiti (1933); United States, Japan, and China (1934 and 1937); [[Italy]], [[Spain]], Sudan (now [[Mali]]), [[Niger]], [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], [[Togo]] and [[Dahomey]] (now [[Benin]], 1935); the [[West Indies]] (1936); Mexico (1937, 1939, and 1957); the [[Philippines]] and [[Indochina]] (now [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]], 1938); [[Guatemala]] and [[Ecuador]] (1939); [[Senegal]] (as a conscript, 1940); [[Argentina]] (1941), [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] (1942 and 1946); and finally [[Brazil]] (1946).  His photographs were featured in magazines such as [[Paris-Soir]], [[Daily Mirror]] (under the pseudonym of ''Mr. Lensman''), ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'', and ''[[Paris Match]]'', and in 1955 his graphic composition of three women bearing vases of flowers on turbaned heads was selected by curator [[Edward Steichen]] for MoMA's 1955 world-touring ''[[The Family of Man]]'' exhibition, seen by 9 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Steichen, Edward|title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600|publication-date=1955|publisher=Published for the Museum of Modern Art by Simon and Schuster in collaboration with the Maco Magazine Corporation|author2=Steichen, Edward, 1879-1973, (organizer.)|author3=Sandburg, Carl, 1878-1967, (writer of foreword.)|author4=Norman, Dorothy, 1905-1997, (writer of added text.)|author5=Lionni, Leo, 1910-1999, (book designer.)|author6=Mason, Jerry, (editor.)|author7=Stoller, Ezra, (photographer.)|author8=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the city of Salvador, Brazil he fell in love with the place and people, and decided to stay for good. Having become interested in the local history and culture, he turned from errant photographer to a researcher of the African diaspora in the Americas. His subsequent voyages are focused on that goal: the west coast of Africa and [[Paramaribo]] (1948), [[Haiti]] (1949), and  Cuba (1957). After studying the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] culture and its influences in [[Brazil]], Verger became an initiate of the [[Candomblé]] religion, and officiated at its rituals.  During a visit to [[Benin]], he was initiated into [[Ifá]] ([[cowrie]]-shell divination), became a ''[[babalawo]]'' (priest) of [[Orunmila]], and was renamed ''Fátúmbí'' ("he who is reborn through the Ifá oracle").

Veger's contributions to ethnography are embodied in dozens of conference papers, journal articles and books,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and were recognized by [[Sorbonne University]], which conferred upon him a doctoral degree (''Docteur 3eme Cycle'') in 1966 &amp;mdash; quite a feat for someone who dropped out of high school at 17.

Verger  continued to study and document his chosen subject right until his death in Salvador, at the age of 93. During that time he became a professor at the [[Federal University of Bahia]] in 1973, where he was responsible for the establishment of the [[Afro-Brazilian Museum]] in Salvador; and served as visiting professor at the [[Obafemi Awolowo University|University of Ifé]] in [[Nigeria]]. The non-profit {{ill|Pierre Verger Foundation|pt|Fundação Pierre Verger}} in Salvador, which he established to continue his work, holds more than 63,000 photos and negatives taken until 1973, as well as his papers and correspondence.

His life has been documented in a book by Jérôme Souty&lt;ref&gt;

Polygamy is prohibited under Sierra Leone’s Penal Code. Polygamy is authorised in customary marriages, where a man can take as many wives as he wishes.&lt;ref&gt;[CEDAW (2007), Responses to the List of Issues And Questions with Regard to the Consideration of the Combined Initial, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports: Sierra Leone, CEDAW/C/SLE/Q/5/Add. 1, CEDAW, New York, NY, p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence of polygamy ==
37 percent of married women in Sierra Leone were in polygamous marriages in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR225/FR225.pdf  "Sierra Leone, Demographic and Health Survey 2008", Statistics Sierra Leone - Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Freetown, Sierra Leone, ICF Macro Calverton, Maryland USA, July 2009, p. 84.]&lt;/ref&gt; 29.7% of married girls aged 15-19 reported that their husband had more than one wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR225/FR225.pdf  "Sierra Leone, Demographic and Health Survey 2008", Statistics Sierra Leone - Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Freetown, Sierra Leone, ICF Macro Calverton, Maryland USA, July 2009, p. 85.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COA Dinasty Orleães-Bragança (blazon).svg|thumb|right|Blazon of the Princes of Brazil]]
'''Prince of Brazil''' (feminine: '''Princess of Brazil'''; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Príncipe do Brasil''; feminine: ''Princesa do Brasil'') was an imperial title of the [[Empire of Brazil]], granted to the sons or daughters of the Emperor and other [[dynast]]s of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family|imperial family]] who were not the [[heir apparent]] or [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. It was also used to denote a grandson or granddaughter in the male line of a reigning monarch, with some exceptions.

==Style of Address==
A Prince or Princess of Brazil was usually entitled to the style of ''[[Highness]]'', except for the [[Prince Imperial of Brazil|Prince/ss Imperial]] and [[Prince of Grão-Pará]], who were addressed as ''[[Imperial Highness]]''. Princes or Princesses who bore additional titles of higher standing would be addressed with the style linked with the highest title they possessed.&lt;ref&gt;Brazilian Constitution of 1824, article 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the agreement between the French [[House of Orléans]] and the Brazilian [[House of Orléans-Braganza]] in 1909, Brazilian princes in the line of succession to the former French throne bear the title of ''[[Prince of Orleans &amp; Bragança|Prince of Orléans-Braganza]]'' with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]''. Those Princes with higher Brazilian titles may be addressed with the style linked with those titles, in conjunction with their French royal titles and styles; for instance, ''[[His Imperial and Royal Highness]]'' [[Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza]].&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.monarquia.org.br/domluiz Casa Imperial do Brasil – Biografia de D. Luiz de Orleans e Bragança] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523164856/http://www.monarquia.org.br/domluiz |date=23 May 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privileges==
A Prince or Princess of Brazil would receive financial assistance from birth until death, unless they married a foreign-born spouse or moved out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Brazilian Constitution of 1824, article 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in East Timor}}
East Timor is a source and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Timorese women, girls, and occasionally young men and boys from rural areas are led to the capital with the promise of better employment or education prospects and are subjected to sex trafficking; there are reports of official complicity in these practices. Foreign women, including those from [[Cambodia]], China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and [[Vietnam]], are vulnerable to sex trafficking in East Timor. Transnational traffickers may be members of Indonesian or Chinese organised crime syndicates, and they appear to rotate foreign victims of sex trafficking in and out of the country for the length of a 90-day tourist visa in order to avoid raising suspicions or calling attention to the crime through visa overstay violations. Police accept bribes from establishments involved in trafficking or from traffickers attempting to cross borders illegally, and in prior years have been identified as clients of commercial sex venues investigated for suspected trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timor-Leste 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271298.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=22 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to immigration officials, police, and media sources, foreign women in prostitution, many of whom were possible victims of sex trafficking, were sometimes detained en masse during law enforcement raids and then deported without proper screening, or as a result of arresting officers’ inability to derive pertinent information from the women due to their having been coached to provide identical accounts. For this reason, [[National Police of East Timor|PNTL]] officers claimed they were not able to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the owners of a [[karaoke]] bar who may have subjected 67 foreign women to sex trafficking during the reporting period. The PNTL reported karaoke bar owners confiscated the passports of foreign workers and only surrendered them if the police ordered the foreign workers’ deportation.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks East Timor as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''''Rex v Zikalala'''''&lt;ref&gt;1953 (2) SA 568 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African criminal law, heard on February 27, 1953. Zikalala, the appellant, had been charged and convicted of the culpable homicide in causing the death of one Alpheus Tsele. On appeal to the Appellate Division, he successfully argued self-defence.

== Facts ==
Zikalala had been convicted of culpable homicide on a charge of murder. It appeared, however, that the trial court had found that the evidence for the defence might reasonably be substantially true.

== Judgment ==
The Appellate Division set the conviction. The trial court, it held, should have had, on the basis of finding that the evidence for the defence might reasonably be substantially true, and in the light of the circumstances and considerations reflected in the evidence, a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown had established that the appellant had not killed the deceased lawfully in private-defence.

The court endorsed the following propositions from Gardiner and Lansdown, based on authority:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where a man can save himself by flight, he should flee rather than kill his assailant [...].&lt;ref&gt;Matthaeus (48.5.3.7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moorman (2.2.12).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also van der Linden (2.5.9); ''R v Odgers (1843) 2 Mood. &amp; R. 479; ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1837) 8 C. &amp; P. 160. Damhouder (c. 72), "with his ideas of defence against dishonour, is of the
contrary opinion," the court noted (572A).&lt;/ref&gt; But no one can be expected to take to flight to avoid an attack, if flight does not afford him a safe way of escape. A man is not bound to expose himself to the risk of a stab in the back, when by killing his assailant he can secure his own safety [...].&lt;ref&gt;Moorman (2.2.12).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Quistorp, para. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; In considering the question of self-defence, a jury must endeavour to imagine itself in the position in which the accused was.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law and Procedure, Vol. 2, p. 1413.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the court ''a quo'', it was "difficult to understand why the accused didn't cry out for help and why the other people there did not overpower the deceased." This observation, held Van den Heever JA for the Appellate Division, was

&lt;blockquote&gt;based on general knowledge of human reactions and not on the evidence. One knows from experience in trial cases that natives are apt to take up the attitude "that is their business", and that the principal actors in such a scene are apt to resent the interference of outsiders. In any event, nobody is ambitious to overpower an aggressor armed with a lethal weapon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court ''a quo'' also said it had "great difficulty in this case in holding that the accused could not get away and that he did not have a reasonable chance to get away if he wanted to." Van den Heever JA, responding to this, noted that the hall in which the murder had occurred

&lt;blockquote&gt;was packed and that movement therein was difficult. But the observation places a risk upon the appellant that he was not obliged to bear. He was not called upon to stake his life upon "a reasonable chance to get away". If he had done so he may well have figured as the deceased at the trial, instead of as the accused person. Moreover, one must not impute to a person who suddenly becomes the object of a murderous attack that mental calm and ability to reason out ''ex post facto'' ways of avoiding the assault without having recourse to violence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relationship between [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]] and [[crime in the United States]] has been a topic of public controversy and scholarly debate for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:ix-x); Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005b:37).&lt;/ref&gt; The rate at which crime is committed varies greatly between racial groups.  While most homicides in the United States are intraracial—the perpetrator and victim are of the same race—the rates at which [[African Americans]] (blacks) both commit and are the victim of homicide is about six to eight times higher than that of [[white Americans]]. The incarceration rate of blacks is more than three times higher than their representation in the general population.&lt;ref name="prison2009"&gt;[http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=2200 Prison Inmates at Midyear 2009 - Statistical Tables] (NCJ 230113).

Rates per 100,000 were converted to percentages.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that the overrepresentation of some minorities in the criminal justice system can be explained by socioeconomic factors as well as racial discrimination by law enforcement and the judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005b:37); Bowling (2006:140). See also Sampson &amp; Wilson (2005:177-178); Myrdal (1988:88).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RpfrAQAAQBAJ |title=The Oxford Handbook of Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration |last=Engel |first=Robin S. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |editor-last=Bucerius |editor-first=Sandra |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Drakulich|first=Kevin|title=Intentional Inequalities and Compounding Effects|date=June 22, 2018|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119113799.ch1|work=The Handbook of Race, Ethnicity, Crime, and Justice|pages=17–38|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119113799.ch1|isbn=9781119113799|access-date=August 4, 2018|last2=Rodriguez-Whitney|first2=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime data sources==
In the United States, crime data are collected from three major sources:

* law enforcement agency crime reports, collected monthly by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and processed annually as [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) 
* victimization surveys, collected biannually by the [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics|Bureau of Justice Statistics]] and processed annually in the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS)
* [[Self report study|self-report surveys]]{{Elucidate|date=March 2011}}

The Uniform Crime Reports represent the primary source of data used in the calculation of official statistics regarding serious crimes such as murder and homicide, which is supplemented by the information provided through the NCVS and self-report studies, the latter being the best indicator of actual crime rates for minor offenses such as [[Drug abuse|illegal substance abuse]] and petty [[theft]]. These crime data collection programs provide most of the statistical information utilized by criminologists and sociologists in their analysis of crime and the extent of its relationship to race.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:42).&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of data is that regarding the prison population.

===Uniform Crime Reports (UCR)===
{{Further|Uniform Crime Reports}}
Established in 1927, the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) program is a summary-based reporting system that collects data on crime reported to local and state law enforcement agencies across the US. The UCR system indexes crimes under two headings: Part I and Part II offenses. Part I offenses include: [[murder]] and non-negligent [[homicide]]; non-lethal violent crimes comprising [[robbery]], forcible [[rape]] and [[Assault|aggravated assault]]; and property crimes comprising [[burglary]], [[larceny|larceny/theft]], [[motor vehicle theft]] and [[arson]]. Part II offenses include [[fraud]], [[forgery]]/[[counterfeit]]ing, [[embezzlement]], simple assault, sex offenses, offenses against the family, drug and liquor offenses, weapons offenses and other non-violent offenses excluding traffic violations.&lt;ref&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:35-36). See also Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:35-38). For more information on the UCR program, see: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20061010230823/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/guidelines/guidelines.htm UCR Data Quality Guidelines]" at www.fbi.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fundamental limitations of the UCR system, including:&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the UCR program, see Mosher, Miethe &amp; Phillips (2002).  Regardless of the limitations, one must consider that these are facts reported by law enforcement agencies and are typically more accurate than independent reporting.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inaccuracy: UCR statistics do not represent the actual amount of criminal activity occurring in the United States. As it relies upon local law enforcement agency crime reports, the UCR program can only measure crime known to police and cannot provide an accurate representation of actual crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:37). See also Myrdal (1988:88-89), Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:39), Free (2009:164).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Misrepresentation: The UCR program is focused upon street crime, and does not record information on many other types of crime, such as organized crime, corporate crime or federal crime. Further, law enforcement agencies can provide inadvertently misleading data as a result of local policing practices. These factors can lead to misrepresentations regarding the nature and extent of criminal activity in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:37). See also Mann (1993:27;34), Free (2009:164).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Manipulation: UCR data are capable of being manipulated by local law enforcement agencies. Information is supplied voluntarily to the UCR program, and manipulation of data can occur at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:37). See also Mann (1993:28-29).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Race and Ethnicity:  The UCR tracks crime for the racial category of "White" to include both Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnicities. According to the ACLU, with over 50 million Latinos residing in the United States, this hides the incarceration rates for Latinos vis-à-vis marijuana-related offenses, as they are considered "White" with respect to the UCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The War on Marijuana Has a Latino Data Problem|url = https://www.aclu.org/blog/war-marijuana-has-latino-data-problem?redirect=blog/criminal-law-reform-racial-justice/war-marijuana-has-latino-data-problem|website = American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate = December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to these and other limitations, a new system of crime data collection was established in 1988 as an outgrowth of the UCR system. The [[National Incident Based Reporting System]] (NIBRS) is an incident-based reporting system that will collect more comprehensive and detailed data on crime from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. As it is still under development, NIBRS coverage is not yet nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:37-39). See also Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:37-38).&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)===
{{Further|National Crime Victimization Survey}}
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) program, established in 1972, is a national survey of a representative sample of households in the United States which covers the frequency of crime victimization and the characteristics and consequences of victimization. The primary purpose behind the NCVS program is to gather information on crimes that were not reported to police, though information is also collected on reported crimes. The survey collects data on rape, assault, robbery, burglary, personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. The NCVS also includes supplemental questions which allow information to be gathered on tangentially relevant issues such as school violence, attitudes towards law enforcement or perceptions regarding crime.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:39-43). See also Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:38-39).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fundamental limitations to the NCVS program, including:&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the NCVS program, see Mosher, Miethe &amp; Phillips (2002). See also Mann (1993:30-32).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Reliability: NCVS statistics do not represent verified or evidenced instances of victimization. As it depends upon the recollection of the individuals surveyed, the NCVS cannot distinguish between true and fabricated claims of victimization, nor can it verify the truth of the severity of the reported incidents. Further, the NCVS cannot detect cases of victimization where the victim is too traumatized to report. These factors can contribute to deficits in the reliability of NCVS statistics.&lt;ref name="Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito 2007:43"&gt;Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:43).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Misrepresentation: The NCVS program is focused upon metropolitan and urban areas, and does not adequately cover suburban and rural regions. This can lead to misrepresentations regarding the nature and extent of victimization in the United States.&lt;ref name="Holms, Maahs &amp; Vito 2007:43"/&gt;

===Comparison of UCR and NCVS data===
According to the NCVS for 1992–2000, 43% of violent criminal acts, and 53% of serious violent crime (not verbal threats, or cuts and bruises) were reported to the police. Overall, black (49%) and Native Americans (48%) victims reported most often, higher than whites (42%) and Asians (40%). Serious violent crime and aggravated assault against blacks (58% and 61%) and Native Americans (55% and 59%) was reported more often than against whites (51% and 54%) or Asians (50% and 51%). Native Americans were unusually unlikely to report a robbery (45%), as with Asians and a simple assault (31%).&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Rennison (2003:3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the differences in the amount of crime reported, comparisons of the UCR and NCVS data sets show there to be a high degree of correspondence between the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Maahs &amp; Vito (2007:39), Rand (2009:1).&lt;/ref&gt; This correspondence extends to the racial demography of both perpetrators and victims of violent crime reported in both systems.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2004:29). For a survey of data from 1973–1992, see Zawitz et al. (1993:23); for 1993-1998, see Rennison (2001:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of Hispanics===
The UCR classifies most Hispanics into the "white" category. The NCVS classifies some Hispanic criminals as "white" and some as "other race". The victim categories for the NCVS are more distinct.

According to a report by the National Council of La Raza, research obstacles undermine the census of Latinos in prison, and "Latinos in the criminal justice system are seriously undercounted. The true extent of the overrepresentation of Latinos in the system probably is significantly greater than researchers have been able to document. Lack of empirical data on Latinos is partially due to prisons' failures to document race at intake, or recording practices that historically have classified Latinos as white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Mass Incarceration Underdevelops Latino Communities|ssrn = 2589112|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = April 2, 2015|location = Rochester, NY|last = SpearIt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall the FBI didn't include a 'Latino' or 'Hispanic' category until recently and 93% of Hispanics are classified as "white" by law enforcement officers (irrespective of their ancestry) often inflating actual white criminal statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demographics cloud optimism on black violent crime decrease|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State News]]|accessdate=March 28, 2011|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/159388/2011/03/28/demographics-cloud-optimism-black-violent-crime-decrease|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI To Track Latino Arrests For Uniform Crime Report|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=February 28, 2016|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/fbi-latino-arrests_n_3492521.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime rate statistics==
{{Further|Crime statistics}}
There is general agreement in the literature that blacks are more likely to commit violent crimes than are whites in the United States. Whether this is the case for less serious crimes is less clear.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Prison data===
{{Further|Incarceration in the United States#Ethnicity}}
[[File:USA 2009. Percent of adult males incarcerated by race and ethnicity.svg|frame|400px|Percent of adult males incarcerated by race and ethnicity in 2009.&lt;ref name="prison2009"/&gt;]]
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], blacks accounted for 39.4% of the prison and jail population in 2009, while non-Hispanic whites were 34.2%, and Hispanics (of any race) 20.6%. The incarceration rate of black males was over six times higher than that of white males, with a rate of 4,749 per 100,000 US residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Number of State Prisoners Declined By Almost 3,000 During 2009; Federal Prison Population Increased By 6,800 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/number-of-state-prisoners-declined-by-almost-3000-during-2009-federal-prison-population-increased-by-6800-97066069.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kouzmin |first=Alexander |title=State Crimes Against Democracy: Political Forensics in Public Affairs |year=2012 |isbn=1137286989 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prisoners2009&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=2200 Prison Inmates at Midyear 2009 - Statistical Tables] - [[US Bureau of Justice Statistics]], published June 2010.

According to the 2010 US Census, Hispanics constituted 16.3% of the US population.&lt;ref name=censusrace&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 Census Briefs].

According to a 2013 study conducted by the Pew Research Center, black men were six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/22/kings-dream-remains-an-elusive-goal-many-americans-see-racial-disparities/|title=King's Dream Remains an Elusive Goal; Many Americans See Racial Disparities|date=August 22, 2013|website=Pew Research Center's Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incarceration rates of each race varied from state to state. Oklahoma was shown to have the highest incarceration rates of black people with 2,625 black inmates per 100,000 residents. New Jersey also had high rates with 12.2 black people for every white person in its prison system. Hawaii had the lowest incarceration rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/mass-incarceration-black-americans-higher-rates-disparities-report|title=Black Americans incarcerated five times more than white people – report|last=Puglise|first=Nicole|date=June 18, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=English|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests and sentencing====
A 2011 study which examined violent crime trends between 1980 and 2008 found that racial imbalances between arrest and incarceration levels were both small and comparably sized across the study period.The authors argued that the prior studies had been [[confounder|confounded]] by not separating Hispanics from Whites.&lt;ref name="doi10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00222.x"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00222.x| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Steffensmeier | first1 = D. | last2 = Feldmeyer | first2 = B. | last3 = Harris | first3 = C.

A 2012 University of Michigan Law School study found that African Americans are given longer federal sentences even when factoring prior criminal records, and that African American jail sentences tend to be roughly 10% longer than white jail sentences for the same crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |ssrn=1985377 |title=Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Charging and Its Sentencing Consequences |work=U of Michigan Law &amp; Econ, Empirical Legal Studies Center |id=Paper No. 12-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that [[federal prosecutor]]s of African American and Hispanic [[defendant]]s are almost twice as likely to push for [[mandatory minimum sentences]], leading to longer sentences and disparities in incarceration rates for [[federal offense]]s.&lt;ref name=rehavi&gt;Rehavi and Starr (2012) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1985377 "Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Charging and Its Sentencing Consequences"] Working Paper Series, no. 12-002 (Univ. of Michigan Law &amp; Economics, Empirical Legal Studies Center)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US [[Census Bureau]] as of the year 2000, there were 2,224,181 blacks enrolled in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_P147B&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_P036&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_P147A&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-SubjectID=8343638|title=SEX BY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT BY LEVEL OF SCHOOL BY TYPE OF SCHOOL FOR THE POPULATION 3 YEARS AND OVER. (SF 3) - Sample Data|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, there were 610,300 black inmates in prison according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/p08.pdf|title=Prisoners in 2008. by William J. Sab ol, Ph.D., and Heather C. West, Ph.D., BJS Statisticians, Matthew Cooper, BJS Intern. Pg. 5 Table 5|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are highly correlated with education. 30 percent of those without college education and nearly 60 percent of high school dropouts had prison records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/000312240406900201| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Pettit | first1 = B. | last2 = Western | first2 = B. | title = Mass Imprisonment and the Life Course: Race and Class Inequality in U.S. Incarceration | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–169 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of arrest given the commission of a crime is higher for whites than it is for blacks for robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, whereas for rape the probability of arrest is approximately equal across offender race. The disparity in arrest rate between criminals who are white and black (and presumably other races) is an interesting fact. On the one hand, it suggests that the over-representation of blacks in the criminal justice system is not consistent with the interpretation that black criminals are more likely to be targeted for arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Alessio|first1=S.

In other words, statistics on race and crime may be difficult to interpret without controlling for correlations between poverty and race, and poverty and crime.

According to a 2001 study, Hispanics and blacks receive an average sentencing of 54.1 and 64.1 months, respectively, while whites receive an average of 32.1 months.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustard|first=David B.|date=April 2001|title="Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts,"|url=|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=44| issue =  1|pages=285–314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77,236 offenders, sentenced under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; were evaluated to control for extraneous variables other than race, but these findings remain relevant despite the fact that the offenders committed the same offense and received sentencing from the same district court.

Racial Disparity in Sentencing: A Review of the Literature. ''The Sentencing Project.''&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theorists who attempt to explain why these disparities exist.

Consequently, they resort to jail term as opposed to community corrections sentence.

A 2014 study revealed that judges subconsciously utilize the assumption that minorities are more likely to recidivate to issue a longer sentencing that will prevent the defendants from reengaging in criminal offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starr|first=S.B.|date=2014|title=Evidence-based sentencing and the scientific rationalization of discrimination|url=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=66|pages=803–872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, theorists advocate that minorities are stereotypically identified as more violent and guilty than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bridges|first=George S.|date=1988|title=Law, social standing, and racial disparities in punishment|url=|journal=Social Forces|volume=66|pages=699–724|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perception encourages judges to believe that they are preventing the onset of future crimes by imprisoning the defendants for a longer duration. This preconception that minorities are unable to economically support themselves warns the judicial system that they are more likely to resort to criminal activity in order to gain access to money or other objectives. Because these characteristics are less associated with white offenders, judges unintentionally treat the two differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albonettie|first=Celesta|date=2002|title=The joint conditioning effect of defendant's gender and ethnicity on length of imprisonment under the federal sentencing guidelines for drug trafficking-manufacturing offenders.|url=|journal=Journal of Gender, Race, and Justice|volume=6|pages=39–60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short amount of time that judges share with defendants in court is insufficient in establishing an objective understanding. As a result, judges may unconsciously utilize the factors that they are given, such as the color of the skin, to construct an impression. Prejudgments on the basis of race influence perception of responsibility and threat to the society.

===Crime trends===
Some studies have argued for smaller racial disparities in violent crime in recent times. However, a study of government data from 1980–2008 found that the reduction in Black violent crime relative to White violent crime was an artifact of those previous studies, which was due to Hispanic offenders being counted as White in the comparison. The Hispanic population has been increasing rapidly and Hispanics have violence rates higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks.&lt;ref name="doi10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00222.x"/&gt;

===Homicide===
According to the [[US Department of Justice]], African Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with European Americans 45.3% and "Other" 2.2%. The offending rate for African Americans was almost 8 times higher than European Americans, and the victim rate 6 times higher. Most homicides were intraracial, with 84% of European Americans victims killed by European Americans, and 93% of African Americans victims were killed by African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf|title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Alexia |title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008 |year=2012 |isbn=1249573246 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homicides-fall-to-lowest-rate-in-four-decades-133967273.html |title=Homicides Fall to Lowest Rate in Four Decades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, number and percentage of murder arrests by race were: 
::Black or African Americans 4,379 = 51.3% 
::White Americans (non-Hispanic Americans) 2,861 = 33.5%
::Hispanic Americans 1,096 = 12.8%
::American Indians or Alaska Natives 98 = 1.14%
::Asian Americans 101 = 1.18%&lt;ref name="Table 43"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43|title=Table 43|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2013.xls|title=Expanded Homicide Data Table 3|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inversely, the percentage of individuals in each racial demographic arrested for murder in 2013 (with 2016 population estimates) was:

::0.0102% of Black or African American population (4,379/42,975,959)
::0.0023% of American Indian or Alaska Native population (98/4,200,658)
::0.0019%  Hispanic American population (1,096/57,516,697)

::0.0010% of Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander population (6/646,255)
::0.0005% of Asian American population (101/18,418,268)&lt;ref name="Table 43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216|title=2016 US Population Estimates|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth crime===
The "National Youth Gang Survey Analysis" (2011) state that of gang members, 46% are Hispanic/Latino, 35% are black, 11.5% are white, and 7% are other race/ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;National Youth Gang Center (2009). National Youth Gang Survey Analysis. http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Survey-Analysis/Demographics&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in the year 2008 black youths, who make up 16% of the youth population, accounted for 52% of juvenile violent crime arrests, including 58.5% of youth arrests for homicide and 67% for robbery. Black youths were overrepresented in all offense categories except DUI, liquor laws and drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Unnever |first=James |title=A Theory of African American Offending: Race, Racism, and Crime |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=113680921X |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robbery===
According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] in 2002, the black arrest rate for robbery was 8.55 times higher than whites, and blacks were 16 times more likely to be incarcerated for robbery than non-Hispanic whites. Robberies with white victims and black offenders were more than 12 times more common than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flaherty |first=Brendan |last2=Sethi |first2=Rajiv |date=December 23, 2004 |title=Racial Stereotypes and Robbery |url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A112755 |journal= |publisher=Columbia University |pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/4447|title=National Crime Victimization Survey: Unbounded Data, 2002|author=United States Department of Justice.

===Victim surveys===
In 1978, [[Michael Hindelang]] compared data from the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (then known as the National Crime Survey, or NCS) to data from the [[Uniform Crime Reports]], both from 1974. He found that NCS data generally agreed with UCR data in regards to the percent of perpetrators of rape, robbery, and assault who were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2094764| title=Race and Involvement in Common Law Personal Crimes | author=Hindelang, Michael J. | journal=[[American Sociological Review]] | date=February 1978  | volume=43 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Hindelang's analysis found that both the NCS and UCR estimated that 62% of robbery offenders were black in the United States in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1147634 |title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Crime and Criminal Justice in the United States |author=Sampson, Robert J. |author2=Lauritsen, Janet L. |journal=[[Crime and Justice]] |year=1997 |volume=21 |pages=311–374 |doi=10.1086/449253}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|327}} A 2004 National Crime Victimization Survey report which analyzed [[carjacking]] over 10 years found that carjacking victims identified 56% of offenders as black, 21% as white, and 16% as Native American or Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Bonnie |title=Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention, Volume 1 |year=2010 |isbn=1412960479 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Wayne |title=Criminal Investigation |year=2006 |isbn=0495093408 |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/c02.pdf|title=Carjacking, 1993-2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hispanics===
{{Expand section|date=August 2016}}
According to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2007 Latinos "accounted for 40% of all sentenced federal offenders-more than triple their share (13%) of the total U.S. adult population". This was an increase from 24% in 1991. Between 1991 and 2007, enforcement of federal immigration laws became a growing priority in response to undocumented immigration. By 2007, among Hispanic offenders sentenced in federal courts, 48% were
immigration offenses, 37% drug offenses, and 15% for other offenses. One reason for the large increase in immigration offenses is that they exclusively fall under federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;A Rising Share: Hispanics and Federal Crime. Pew Hispanic Center. 2009.  Mark Hugo Lopez&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racially-motivated hate crime===
The federal government publishes a list annually of [[Hate crime laws in the United States|Hate Crime]] Statistics, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2009/incidents.html |title=Incidents and Offenses - Hate Crime Statistics, 2009 |publisher=.fbi.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also published by the federal government is the Known Offender's Race by Bias Motivation, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2009/data/table_05.html |title=Table 5 - Hate Crime Statistics 2009 |publisher=.fbi.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report database, in 2010 58.6% of reported hate crime offenders were white, 18.4% of offenders were black, 8.9% were of individuals of multiple races and 1% of offenders were Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-offenders |title=FBI — Offenders |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also reveals that 48% of all hate crime offenders were motivated by the victim's race, while 18% were based on the victim's religion, and another 18% were based on the victim's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="fbi.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |title=FBI — Victims |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that among hate crime offenses motivated by race, 70% were composed of anti-black bias, while 17.7% were of anti-white bias, and 5% were of anti-Asian or Pacific Islander bias.&lt;ref name="fbi.gov"/&gt;

===Racial composition of geographic areas===
Studies have examined that ethnic/racially heterogeneous areas, most often neighborhoods in large cities, have higher crime rates than more homogeneous areas. Most studies find that the more ethnically/racially heterogeneous an area is, the higher its crime rates tend to be.&lt;ref name=Ellis2009&gt;Handbook of Crime Correlates; Lee Ellis, Kevin M. Beaver, John Wright; 2009; Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies examining the relationship between percentages of different races in an area and crime rates have generally either found similar relationships as for nationwide crime rates or no significant relationships. Most often studied are correlations between black and Hispanic populations in a given area and crime. Such data may reveal a possible connection, but is functionally inconclusive due to a variety of other correlating factors which overlap with race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Ellis2009/&gt;

===Race and socioeconomic status===
While there is a correlation between blacks and Hispanics and crime, the data imply a much stronger tie between poverty and crime than crime and any racial group, when gender is taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Ellis2009/&gt; The direct correlation between crime and class, when factoring for race alone, is relatively weak. When gender, and familial history are factored, class correlates more strongly with crime than race or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="critcrim.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://critcrim.org/critpapers/barak.htm |title=critcrim.org |publisher=critcrim.org |date=October 20, 2000 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00900.x/abstract |title=  THE MYTH OF SOCIAL CLASS AND CRIME REVISITED: AN EXAMINATION OF CLASS AND ADULT CRIMINALITY*|date=March 7, 2006 |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00900.x |volume=38 |journal=Criminology |pages=589–632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that areas with low socioeconomic status may have the greatest correlation of crime with young and adult males, regardless of racial composition, though its effect on females is negligible.&lt;ref name="critcrim.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; A 1996 study looking at data from [[Columbus, Ohio]] found that differences in disadvantage in city neighborhoods explained the vast majority of the difference in crime rates between blacks and whites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krivo|first1=Lauren J.|last2=Peterson|first2=Ruth D.|title=Extremely Disadvantaged Neighborhoods and Urban Crime|journal=Social Forces|date=December 1, 1996|volume=75|issue=2|pages=619–648|doi=10.1093/sf/75.2.619}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two 2003 studies looking at violent offending among juveniles reached similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNULTY|first1=THOMAS L.|last2=BELLAIR|first2=PAUL E.|title=EXPLAINING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN SERIOUS ADOLESCENT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR*|journal=Criminology|date=August 2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=709–747|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2003.tb01002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNulty|first1=Thomas L.|last2=Bellair|first2=Paul E.|title=Explaining racial and ethnic differences in adolescent violence: Structural disadvantage, family well-being, and social capital|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=March 2003|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=10.1080/07418820300095441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report by the ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/sentencing/|title=Same background.

Another theory proposes that racial inequality in the American criminal justice system is mostly caused by a racial imbalance in decisions to charge criminal [[defendant]]s with crimes requiring a mandatory minimum prison sentence, leading to large racial disparities in incarceration.&lt;ref name="rehavi" /&gt;

=== Childhood exposure to violence ===

Research shows that childhood exposure to violence significantly increases the likelihood to engage in violent behavior. When studies control for childhood exposure to violence, black and white males are equally likely to engage in violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aliprantis|first=Dionissi|date=September 14, 2016|title=Human capital in the inner city|journal=Empirical Economics|language=en|pages=1–45|doi=10.1007/s00181-016-1160-y|issn=0377-7332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inability to post bail===

According to a 2017 study in the ''[[Journal of Law and Economics]]'', "Higher pretrial detention rates among minority defendants explain 40 percent of the black-white gap in rates of being sentenced to prison and 28 percent of the Hispanic-white gap."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Emily|last2=Pope|first2=Nolan G.|date=August 1, 2017|title=The Unintended Impact of Pretrial Detention on Case Outcomes: Evidence from New York City Arraignments|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695285|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=60|issue=3|pages=529–557|doi=10.1086/695285|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of individuals held in pretrial detention are being held because they cannot afford to post bail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The individuals in pretrial detention face higher incentives to plead guilty (even if they are innocent) for a number of reasons, which leads to a higher sentencing rates for these individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socioeconomic factors===

Evidence supporting the role of structural factors in high black crime rates comes from multiple studies. For example, [[Robert J. Sampson]] has reported that most of the reason violent crime rates are so high among blacks originates mainly from unemployment, economic deprivation, and family disorganization. Specifically, he found that "the scarcity of employed black men increases the prevalence of families headed by females in black communities" and that the increased prevalence of such families in turn results in family disruption that significantly increases black murder and robbery rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sampson, Robert J.|date=September 1987|title=Urban Black Violence: The Effect of Male Joblessness and Family Disruption|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=93|issue=2|pages=348–382|doi=10.1086/228748|jstor=2779588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampson et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sampson|first1=Robert J.|last2=Morenoff|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Raudenbush|first3=Stephen|date=February 2005|title=Social Anatomy of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Violence|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=95|issue=2|pages=224–232|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.037705|pmc=1449156|pmid=15671454}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Phillips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Julie A.|date=August 2002|title=White, Black, and Latino Homicide Rates: Why the Difference?|journal=Social Problems|volume=49|issue=3|pages=349–373|doi=10.1525/sp.2002.49.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported that at least half of the black-white homicide offending differential is attributable to structural neighborhood factors like parents' marital status and social context.

==Theories of causation==
Historically, crime statistics have played a central role in the discussion of the relationship between race and crime in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:31-53), Gabbidon (2007:4).&lt;/ref&gt; As they have been designed to record information not only on the kinds of crimes committed, but also on the individuals involved in crime, criminologists and sociologists have and continue to use crime rate statistics to make general statements regarding the racial demographics of crime-related phenomena such as [[victimization]], arrests, prosecutions, convictions, and incarceration. Regardless of their views regarding causation, scholars acknowledge that some racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:31-33); Walsh (2004:19-36); Wright (2009:143-144).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a great deal of debate regarding the causes of that disproportionality.

As noted above, scholars acknowledge that some racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States. The data from 2008 reveals that black Americans are over-represented in terms of arrests made in virtually all types of crime, with the exceptions of "driving under the influence", "liquor laws" and hate crime. Overall, black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-43/10tbl43a.xls |title=FBI — Table 43a |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/estimates_and_projections_by_age_sex_raceethnicity.html |title=Estimates and Projections by Age, Sex, Race/Ethnicity - The 2012 Statistical Abstract - U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of thought===
[[File:WEB DuBois 1918.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], one of the pioneers in the study of race and crime in the United States.]]
{{main|Criminology}}
The relationship between race and crime has been an area of study for criminologists since the emergence of [[anthropological criminology]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2009:xxvii-xxviii).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare Lombroso]], founder of the [[Italian school of criminology]], argued that criminal behavior was the product of biological factors, including race. He was among the first criminologists to claim a direct link between race and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling &amp; Phillips (2002:57).&lt;/ref&gt; This biological perspective, sometimes seen as racist and increasingly unpopular, was criticized by early 20th century scholars, including [[Frances Kellor]], [[Thorsten Sellin|Johan Thorsten Sellin]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois|William Du Bois]], who argued that other circumstances, such as social and economic conditions, were the central factors which led to criminal behavior, regardless of race. Du Bois traced the causes of the disproportional representation of Blacks in the criminal justice system back to the improperly handled [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of [[Slavery in the United States|Black slaves]] in general and the [[Convict lease|convict leasing]] program in particular. In 1901, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are no reliable statistics to which one can safely appeal to measure exactly the growth of crime among the emancipated slaves. About seventy per cent of all prisoners in the South are black; this, however, is in part explained by the fact that accused Negroes are still easily convicted and get long sentences, while whites still continue to escape the penalty of many crimes even among themselves. And yet allowing for all this, there can be no reasonable doubt but that there has arisen in the South since the [civil] war a class of black criminals, loafers, and ne'er-do-wells who are a menace to their fellows, both black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois (2005:5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The debate that ensued remained largely academic until the late 20th century, when the relationship between race and crime became a recognized field of specialized study in criminology. Helen T. Greene, professor of justice administration at [[Texas Southern University]], and [[Shaun L. Gabbidon]], professor of criminal justice at [[Pennsylvania State University]], note that many criminology and criminal justice programs now either require or offer elective courses on the topic of the relationship between race and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2009:xxvii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Orlando Patterson]] has explained these controversies as disputes between liberal and conservative criminologists in which each camp focuses on mutually exclusive aspects of the causal net, with liberals focusing on factors external to the groups in question and conservatives focusing on internal cultural and behavioral factors.&lt;ref&gt;O. Patterson, ''Rituals of Blood'' (1998:ix) as quoted in Walsh (2004:vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theories of causation===

====Conflict theory====
{{Further|Conflict theory|Conflict criminology|Marxist criminology}}
Conflict theory is considered "one of the most popular theoretical frameworks among race and crime scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon (2007:171). For an overview of conflict theory in race and crime studies, see Gabbidon (2007:141-177), Henderson (2009:174-175).&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than one monolithic theory, conflict theory represents a group of closely related theories which operate on a common set of fundamental assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Gabbidon (2007:141-177).&lt;/ref&gt; As a general theory of criminal behavior, conflict theory proposes that crime is an inevitable consequence of the conflict which arises between competing groups within society. Such groups can be defined through a number of factors, including class, economic status, religion, language, ethnicity, race or any combination thereof. Further, conflict theory proposes that crime could be largely eliminated if the structure of society were to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabbidon (2007:155;171).&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of conflict theory which emphasizes the role of economics, being heavily influenced by the work of [[Karl Marx]] and sometimes referred to as [[Marxist criminology]], views crime as a natural response to the inequality arising from the competition inherent in capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon (2007:141).&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists and criminologists emphasizing this aspect of social conflict argue that, in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime. Dutch criminologist [[Marxist criminology#Willem Adriaan Bonger|Willem Adriaan Bonger]], one of the first scholars to apply the principles of [[economic determinism]] to the issue of crime, argued that such inequality as found in capitalism was ultimately responsible for the manifestation of crime at all levels of society, particularly among the poor. Though this line of thinking has been criticized for requiring the establishment of a utopian socialist society,&lt;ref name="Gabbidon 2007:171"&gt;Gabbidon (2007:171).&lt;/ref&gt; the notion that the disproportionality observed in minority representation in crime rate statistics could be understood as the result of systematic economic disadvantage found its way into many of the theories developed in subsequent generations.

Culture conflict theory, derived from the pioneering work of sociologist [[Thorsten Sellin]], emphasizes the role of culturally accepted norms of conduct in the formation of cultural groups and the conflicts which arise through their interaction. Culture conflict theory argues that the group with the most power in any society ensures that their values, traditions and behaviors, which Sellin referred to as "conduct norms", are those to which all other members of society are forced to conform, and any actions which conflict with the interests of the dominant group are identified as deviant and/or criminal in nature. Sellin's original ideas continued to be developed throughout the 20th century, most notably by George Vold in the 1950s and Austin Turk in the 1960s, and continue to influence the contemporary debate.&lt;ref name="Gabbidon 2007:148-151"&gt;Gabbidon (2007:148-151).&lt;/ref&gt; The recent work of Gregory J. Howard, Joshua D. Freilich and Graeme R. Newman applies culture conflict theory to the issue of immigrant and minority crime around the world. According to their research, while culturally homogeneous groups experience little to no cultural conflict, as all the members share the same set of "conduct norms", culturally heterogeneous groups, such as modern industrial nations with large immigrant populations, display heightened competition between sets of cultural norms which, in turn, leads to an increase in violence and crime. Societies which have high levels of cultural diversity in their population, it is claimed, are more likely to have higher rates of violent crime.&lt;ref name="Gabbidon 2007:148-151"/&gt;

According to conflict theorists such as Marvin Wolfgang, Hubert Blalock and [[William Chambliss]], the disproportionate representation of racial minorities in crime statistics and in the prison population is the result of race- and class-motivated disparities in arrests, prosecutions and sentencing rather than differences in actual participation in criminal activity, an approach which has also been taken by proponents of [[critical race theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Delgado &amp; Stafancic (2001:113-114).&lt;/ref&gt; This line of argumentation is generally seen as part of a wider approach to race-related issues referred to as the Discrimination Thesis, which assumes that differences in the treatment received by people of minority racial background in a number of public institutions, including the criminal justice, education and health care systems, is the result of overt racial discrimination. Opposed to this view is the Non-Discrimination Thesis, which seeks to defend these institutions from such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview, see Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:83-84).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time it was first proposed, conflict theory was considered outside the mainstream of more established criminological theories, such as [[strain theory (sociology)|strain theory]], [[social disorganization theory]] and [[Differential association|differential association theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims (2009:142).&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara D. Warner, associate professor of criminal justice and police studies at Eastern Kentucky University, notes that conflict theory has been the subject of increasing criticism in recent years. Recent studies claim that, while there may have been real sentencing differences related to non-legal characteristics such as race in the 1960s, sentencing discrimination as described by the conflict theorists at that time no longer exists. Criticism has also pointed to the lack of [[testability]] of the general theory.&lt;ref name="Gabbidon 2007:171"/&gt; While much research has been done to correlate race, income level and crime ''frequency'', typically of less serious criminal behavior such as theft or larceny, research has shown there to be no significant correlation between race, income level and crime ''seriousness''. Thus, conflict theory encounters difficulties in attempting to account for the high levels of violent crime such as murder, homicide and rape, in minority populations.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1989:71-72).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strain (anomie) theory====
{{Further|Strain theory (sociology)|Anomie}}
Strain theory, which is largely derived from the work of [[Robert K. Merton]] in the 1930s and 1940s, argues that social structures within society which lead to inequality and deprivation in segments of its population indirectly encourage those segments to commit crime. According to strain theory, differences in crime rates between races are the result of real differences in behavior, but to be understood as an attempt to alleviate either absolute or relative deprivation and adapt to the existing opportunity structure.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (2000:283). See also Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi (1990:152).&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent approach to strain theory was proposed by [[Steven F. Messner]] and [[Richard Rosenfeld]] in the 1990s. In their version of the theory, which they refer to as institutional anomie theory, Messner and Rosenfeld argue that the dominance of materialistic concerns and measurements of success manifested in the [[American Dream]] weakens the effectiveness of informal social control mechanisms and support processes, which encourages economic gain by any means, legal or illegal. In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, therefore, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (2000:283).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of strain theory point to its weaknesses when compared with actual criminal behavior patterns. [[Michael R. Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] argue that strain theory "misconstrue(s) the nature of the criminal act, supplying it with virtues it does not possess." They further point out that, while strain theory suggests that criminals should tend to target people in a more advantageous economic situation than themselves, they more often victimize individuals who live in the same economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi (1990:152).&lt;/ref&gt;

====General strain theory====

====Social disorganization theory====
{{Further|Social disorganization theory}}
Social disorganization theory proposes that high rates of crime are largely the result of a heterogeneous and impoverished social ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero (2009:762).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the theory point to the process of [[urban decay]] as a major contributing factor to the breakdown of healthy urban communities which would normally curb the spread of many forms of criminal behavior. The diversity of minority cultures present in poverty-stricken neighborhoods prevents the formation of strong social bonds and leaves inhabitants uninterested in maintaining positive community relationships. This has been observed to increase the likelihood of crime in certain urban areas, which can lead to increased policing and a further breakdown of familial structures as a result of arrests, which, in turn, precipitates more crime. Social disorganization theory has been instrumental in establishing the notion that stable, culturally homogeneous communities have lower rates of delinquency and crime regardless of race.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero (2009:763).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macrostructural opportunity theory====
Phillippia Simmons reports that many of the studies which have investigated intra- and interracial crime seek to explain this through a theory of macrostructural opportunity which states that interracial violence is primarily a function of opportunity and access.&lt;ref name="Simmons 2009:398"&gt;Simmons (2009:398)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, intraracial crime rates remain relatively high due to the fact that [[residential segregation in the United States|much of the US remains residentially segregated]]. She notes that this theory predicts that, if residential areas were more racially integrated, intraracial crime would decrease and interracial crime would increase correspondingly. However, she also notes that not all researchers on the topic of intraracial crime agree with this result, with some pointing to other macrostructural factors, such as income and education, which may negate the effect of race on inter- and intraracial crime.&lt;ref name="Simmons 2009:398"/&gt;

[[Anthony Walsh (criminologist)|Anthony Walsh]] criticizes the attempt to use the macrostructural opportunity model to explain interracial rape as has been done in studies conducted in the past few decades, pointing out that such a defense is directly contradicted by the data related to homicide. Walsh argues that the macrostructural opportunity model helps explain why black murderers almost always choose black victims.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2004:24-25).&lt;/ref&gt; There are disparities in rates of reporting rape where victims of some races are statistically less likely or more likely to report their rape, especially depending on the race of the offender. Black women in America are more likely to report sexual assault that has been perpetrated by a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Furtado, C., Perceptions of Rape: Cultural, Gender, and Ethnic Differences.

====Social control theory====
{{Further|Social control theory}}
Social control theory, which is among the most popular theories in criminology,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins (2009:761), Gabbidon (2007:187).&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Higgins (2009:759-762).&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon [[Travis Hirschi]]'s ''Causes of Delinquency'' (1969), social bonding theory pioneered the notion that criminologists can gain useful insight into the motives behind criminal behavior by examining what normally motivates individuals to refrain from crime. From this it is argued that, in those segments of the population where such motivation is lacking, crime will be more prevalent. Hirschi was explicit in mentioning that he believed his theory held true across all racial boundaries, and subsequent research - both in the US and abroad - seems to confirm this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbidon 2007:187-192).&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea of social control theory is elaborated upon in several other theories of causation, particularly social disorganization theory.

====Subculture of violence theory====
{{Further|Subcultural theory}}
As a theory of criminal behavior, subculture of violence theory claims that certain groups or subcultures exist in society in which violence is viewed as an appropriate response to what, in the context of that subculture, are perceived as threatening situations. Building upon the work of cultural anthropologist [[Walter B. Miller]]'s [[focal concerns theory]], which focused on the social mechanisms behind delinquency in adolescents, sociologists [[Marvin Wolfgang]] and Franco Ferracuti proposed that the disproportionally high rate of crime among African Americans could be explained by their possessing a unique racial subculture in which violence is experienced and perceived in a manner different from that commonly observed in mainstream American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Covington (1995:182-183). The work referred to is ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bRb-AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Subculture of Violence: Towards an Integrated Theory in Criminology]'' by Wolfgang &amp; Ferracuti (1967). See also Hawkins (1983:247-248), Gabbidon &amp; Greene (2005a:75-78). For a general review, see Gabbidon (2007:91-100), Clevenger (2009:780-783).&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the origins of this subculture of violence among African Americans, sociologists promoting the theory have pointed towards their [[Southern United States|Southern]] heritage. As noted in several studies conducted throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there is a traditional North-South discrepancy in the distribution of homicide in the US, regardless of race, and this, it was argued, indicates that lower-class Southern Blacks and Whites share the same subculture of violence.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 1983:248"&gt;Hawkins (1983:248).&lt;/ref&gt;

The empirical basis for the subculture of violence theory, however, has been described as "extremely limited and unpersuasive".&lt;ref name="Hawkins 1983:248"/&gt; Very little has been done to attempt an adequate assessment of supposedly criminogenic subcultural values, and several studies conducted in the late 1970s claimed to falsify the assumptions upon which the subculture of violence theory depends.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 1983:248"/&gt; More recently, scholars have criticized the theory as potentially racist in nature in its implication of one given ethnicity or culture supposedly being less fit for or less worthy of being qualified as "civilized", the built-in implication of which in turn would denote stereotypically "white" behavior as an objective norm for all societies to follow.&lt;ref&gt;See Gabbidon (2007:99).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reddy dynasty''' (1325–1448 CE)&lt;ref name="Chopra1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pran Nath Chopra|title=Religions and communities of India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggtuAAAAMAAJ |date=1982|publisher=Vision Books|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in  [[South India|southern India]] by Prolaya Vema Reddy. The region that was ruled by the Reddy dynasty is now part of modern-day [[coastal Andhra|coastal]] and central [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Prolaya Vema Reddy was part of the confederation that started a movement against the invading [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] armies of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1323 and succeeded in repulsing them from [[Warangal]].

The modern castes of Andhra region did not originate until the late stages of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=86}}

The fall of the Kakatiya Kingdom in 1323, after being subject to seizes by the Tughlaq dynasty, led to a political vacuum in the Andhras.The Islamic conquerors failed to keep the region under effective control and constant infighting among themselves coupled with the martial abilities of the local Telugu warriors led to the loss of the entire region by 1347.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=176}}
 
Whilst, this led to the rise of the Musunuris and Recharlas in the Telegana regions, the coastal belt saw the rise of a third warrior lineage--the Reddi''s'' of the Panta clan.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=177}}

Established in about 1325 by Prolaya Vema Reddi,(also known as Komati Vema), his territory extended along the coast to Nellore in the south and Srisailam, in the west. He was succeeded by Anavota Reddi who consolidated the kingdom extensively and established it's capital at Kondavidu in Guntur District.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=177}}

By 1395, a second Reddi kingdom was established by a branch of the same lineage, with it's capital in Rajahmundry, East Godavari District.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=177}}

None of the Reddi lineages find any mention in Kakatiyan era sources and cannot be exactly traced as to their origins.But, their inscriptions and humble genealogies suggest that they were born out of the late Kakatiya ' military milieu ' and had a continuity with the local Telegu warrior culture.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=177}}

==Extent of rule==
[[File:Kondavid-drug. Signed 'W.R.'.jpg|thumb|260px|Water colour painting - Kondavidu fort, Reddy Kingdom.]]

The Reddy kings ruled [[coastal Andhra|coastal]] and central [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] for over a hundred years from 1325 to 1448.&lt;ref name="Chopra1982"/&gt;{{sfn|Rao &amp; Shulman, Srinatha|2012|p=16}} At its maximum extent, the Reddy kingdom stretched from [[Cuttack, Orissa]] to the north, [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]] to the south and [[Srisailam]] to the west.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=82}} The initial capital of the kingdom was [[Addanki]].{{sfn|Prasad|1988|p=173}} Later, it was moved to [[Kondavidu]] and a subsidiary branch was established at  [[Rajahmundry]].{{sfn|Prasad|1988|pp=174,&amp;nbsp;177}} The Reddys were known for their fortifications. Two major [[hill fort]]s, one at [[Kondapalli]], 20&amp;nbsp;km north west of [[Vijayawada]] and another at Kondavidu about 30&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Guntur]] stand testimony to the fort building skill of the Reddy kings.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=83}} The forts of [[Bellamkonda]], [[Vinukonda]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in the [[Palnadu]] region were also part of the Reddy kingdom.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=83}} The dynasty remained in power till the middle of the 15th century. In 1424, Kondavidu was annexed to the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and Rajahmundry was conquered by the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]] some twenty five years alter.{{sfn|Rao &amp; Shulman, Srinatha|2012|p=16}}  The [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]] eventually lost control of coastal Andhra after the defeat of Gajapati Prataprudra Deva by [[Krishna Deva Raya]] of Vijaynagara. The territories of the Reddy kingdom thus came under the control of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].&lt;ref name="KulkeRothermund2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Hermann Kulke]]|author2=[[Dietmar Rothermund]]|title=A history of India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Academic+Book+of+Colonial+History+of+India.#v=onepage&amp;q=Reddy&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 August 2011|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32919-4|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Srisailam-temple-entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple, Srisailam]]
[[File:Jwala Narasimha Ahobilam.JPG|thumb|right|Lord [[Narasimha]], Narasimha Swamy Temple, Ahobilam]]

The Reddy rulers played a prominent part in post-[[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiyas]] of [[Telangana]]. The Kakatiya empire came to an end in 1323 after the army of the [[Delhi sultanate]] invaded [[Warangal]] and captured Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra. Warangal fell to the invaders and Ulugh Khan commanded Warangal and Telangana. During this time of foreign invasion and chaos in Telugu country, seeds of revolt were sown by two princes, Annaya Mantri and Kolani Rudradeva. They united the Telugu nobles with the purpose of reclaiming the kingdom. Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka, Prolaya Vema Reddy, Recharla Singama Nayaka, Koppula Prolaya Nayaka and Manchikonda Ganapatinayaka were the prominent nobles. Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka was the chosen leader of this confederation of Telugu nobles who united and vowed to put an end to the Sultanate's rule. They succeeded in repulsing those forces from Warangal and then established independent Kingdoms of their own.&lt;ref name="DattaLal1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amaresh Datta|author2=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay-Zorgot|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hc5jAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=prolaya+vema+reddy&amp;dq=prolaya+vema+reddy|accessdate=5 August 2011|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=4637}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}}

It was during this chaotic period in Andhra history that Prolaya Vema Reddy established the Reddy kingdom in 1325. The Reddy rulers patronised and protected Hinduism and its institutions. The [[Brahmin]]s were given liberal grants by the Reddy kings and the agraharas of Brahmins were restored. Vedic studies were encouraged. The Hindu temples of [[Srisailam]] and [[Ahobilam]] were provided with more facilities. Prolaya Vema Reddy bestowed a number of [[agraharam|agraharas]] on the Brahmins. He was revered by the title of ''Apratima-Bhudana-Parasurama''.&lt;ref name="Chitnis2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishnaji Nageshrao Chitnis|title=Medieval Indian history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xMcIu7kL42MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Medieval+Indian+history+By+Krishnaji+Nageshrao+Chitnis#v=onepage&amp;q=prolaya%20vema%20&amp;f=true|accessdate=2 September 2011|year=2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-7156-062-2|pages=77, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commissioned major repairs to the Srisailam Mallikarjuna Swami temple, and had a flight of steps built from the [[Krishna River|Krishna river]] to the temple. The [[Narasimha]] Swamy temple at Ahobilam was built during his reign. He built 108 temples for [[Shiva]].{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=89}}

==Literature==

[[Telugu language|Telugu]] literature blossomed under the Reddy kings. The Reddy kings also patronized [[Sanskrit]]. Several of the Reddy kings themselves were distinguished scholars and authors. Kumaragiri Reddy, Kataya Vema Reddy and Pedakomati Vema Reddy were the most outstanding among them. [[Yerrapragada|Errapragada]] (Errana), [[Srinatha]] and [[Potana]] were the remarkable poets of this period. Errapragada, the last of the [[Kavitrayam|Kavitraya]] (Trinity of Poets) was the court poet of Prolaya Vema Reddy. He completed the Telugu translation of the [[Mahabharata]]. He completed the rendition of the [[Aranya Parva]] of Mahabharata left incomplete by [[Nannaya|Nannaya Bhattu]] (Aadi Kavi who started the translation of Mahabharata into Telugu). He wrote Hari Vamsa and Narasimha Purana. Errana's translation of the [[Ramayana]] in ''Chapu'' form (a style of poetry) has been lost.{{sfn|Rao|1994|p=83}}

==Administration==

The administration was carried according to the "Dharmasutras". One sixth of agriculture surplus was levied as tax. Under the reign of Anavota Reddy custom duties and taxes on trade were lifted. As a result, trade flourished. Sea trade was carried through the port Motupalli. Large number of merchants settled down near it. Celebrating 'Vasantotsavalu' was revived during the rule of Anavema Reddy. The Brahmins were given liberal grants by the Reddy kings. Caste system was observed. Heavy taxes by Racha Vema Reddy made him highly unpopular.{{sfn|Rao|1994|pp=87,88}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15967">In June 2014, a run on [[Bulgaria]]’s [[Corporate Commercial Bank]] (Corpbank) brought down the bank, the country’s fourth largest. It was closed down by the country’s central banking system, the [[Bulgarian National Bank]], and had ripple effects throughout Bulgaria’s economy. As a result, international investors are wary of making investments in the country. Corpbank’s owner, [[Tzvetan Vassilev]], fled the country after being charged with [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/05/bulgarias-failed-corpbank-the-former-owners-story/#720a0fd17e79|title=Bulgaria's Failed Corpbank: The Former Owner's Story|last=Coppola|first=Frances|date=2015-10-05|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==

=== Tzvetan Vassilev ===
In 2013 Forbes named Tzvetan Vassilev the "most influential Bulgarian." Vassilev owned 100% of the shares of a finance house called Bromak EOOD. Until the government takeover of Corpbank, he was the majority shareholder of Corpbank. The bank controlled other companies which employed over 16,000 people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2014/07/15/the-bulgarian-game-of-thrones/#4729416717f8|title=The Bulgarian Game Of Thrones|last=Coppola|first=Frances|date=2014-07-15|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014 this whole story turned into a nightmare for thousands depositors who had the bad luck to invest into Corpbank.  Following a bank run in June 2014, which some say that was artificially induced, but all the following probes and revisions showed that the bank was embezzled by its majority owner Tzvetan Vassilev [https://www.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-lawsuit/update-1-bulgaria-files-1-3-bln-lawsuit-against-corpbanks-main-shareholder-idUSL5N16P5MS Reuters reported], it requested special supervision by the Bulgarian National Bank. Its license was subsequently withdrawn in November 2014. The chairman of the bank's supervisory board and majority shareholder, Tsvetan Vasilev, fled the country and as of now is being sued in Bulgaria for syphoning off Corpbank and embezzling more than 2 bln leva. He is also being investigated in Serbia for deliberate bancruptcy of a glass factory financed by Corpbank. There are investigations against him in two more countries on allegations of money laundry - in Switzerland and in Luxemberg where the case is frozen till the proceedings in Bulgaria end. 

=== Delyan Peevski ===
Until 2014, Vassilev and [[Delyan Peevski]], the owner of a vast network of media entities, were friends. Corpbank financed some of his business activities. Peevski's business expansion, which was funded by Corpbank, made it so that he controlled around 85% of Bulgarian media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At some point, the two men had falling out. Vassilev told Peevski that he would discontinue funding Peevski's business expansion. The relationship became so sour that at one point, each man claimed that the other was trying to murder him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Peevski retaliated by using his media outlets to spread rumors that Corpbank was financially unstable. His oppnents state that these reports have triggered a bank run (see section: Bank run) that ultimately led to Corpbank's downfall. Yet the first to reveal the truth about Corpbank being turned into financial pyramid by his majority holder were not Peevski's media outlets but his opponent's publications (Ivo Prokoiev) Capital and Dnevnik. Moreover, after the bank run in the third week of June 2014, the administration of the bank asked  conservatorship from the Bulgarian National Bank. The Bulgarian National Bank withdrew the bank's license on 6 November 2014.The decision was prompted by the results of a triple probe, ordered by the Bulgarian National Bank and performed by three auditing firms. The probe showed that Corpbank was completely syphoned off and cannot be revived. One year later Bulgaria's Deposit Insurance Fund chose forensic advisory firm AlixPartners to help trace and recover the assets of insolvent Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank), Reuters reported here. AlixPartners issued a report which was translated and published after the approval of a new bill, moved by Delyan Peevski and his colleagues from the parliamentary group of DPS. AlixPartners' investigation showed that the bank functioned as a financial pyramid and describes the siphoning off schemes. The company's report showed that Corpbank was siphoned off through large loans to companies related to the majority shareholder Tzvetan Vassilev. More than half of the loans at the value of 2,5 billion BGN were given to companies related to Vassilev. It also showed that the majority shareholder also used the bank for “personal transactions”. 243 corporate clients of the bank had 472 outstanding loans. These loans, according to the auditors, are unlikely to be recovered, because they were given to non-functioning enterprises or had little collateral. The loans were used to settle other loans to CCB or to finance people who were not CCB's clients. The schemes for siphoning off included:Loans to companies without credit history and without resource; loans to borrowers to repay other loans; loans without collateral; loans for working capital; loans for purchase of shares in companies ownership of CCB, Bulgarian National TV reported [https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/the-report-by-alixpartners-on-corpbank-published-in-bulgarian here].  

Peevski grew up with connections; his mother, according to ''The New York Times'', used to head the national lottery empire and is the ultimate leader over Peevski's growing media empire. She has strong connections, both economic and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/world/europe/after-political-appointment-in-bulgaria-rage-boils-over.html|title=After Political Appointment in Bulgaria, Rage Boils Over|last=Brunwasser|first=Matthew|date=2013-06-28|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peevski is both a politician and a businessman. He has long been associated with the political party "[[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]" (DPS in Bulgarian). Among the locals, the party is known as the "Turkish party" because it promotes the rights of Bulgaria's Turkish minority.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Forbes, "Peevski ... is associated with shady dealings going back years: he was briefly investigated for corruption in 2007 but the case was dropped. Because of the scale of his business interests (including those in his mother’s name), he effectively controls large parts of the Bulgarian economy."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2013, Bulgarian voters elected Peevski as a Member of Parliament. The [[Oresharski Government]] then appointed him as head of the State Security Agency, but removed him from the position after street protests and demands for the government's resignation. Nonetheless, accusations that the government was supporting Bulgarian oligarchs and mobsters continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Delyan Peevski is simply one of the main tools that the Bulgarian political mafia uses to blackmail Bulgarian business—the visible part of a rather large iceberg of corruption. The political mafia is persistently trying to downgrade what happened to Corpbank to a personal conflict between Mr. Peevski and me, which is utterly untrue. I had a conflict with the political mafia ruling the country, which has been blackmailing and threatening me for many years." - Tzvetan Vassilev, Forbes interview (10/5/15)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Extortion attempt ==
In April 2014, associates of the mafia-ruled DPS, one of the most powerful political parties in Bulgaria, asked Vassilev to give them bank assets for free.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"I was told that Corpbank would be taken down if I did not satisfy their ‘request’," Vassilev said.  "I refused…..but I now know that Corpbank’s destruction was planned months before the bank run. The goal was to acquire Corpbank’s most attractive assets at a low price and to eliminate me as an influencer in the socio-economic life of the country."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bank run ==
The bank run started when the prosecution entered the offices of the bank as a result of a fake accusation accompanied by a black PR campaign in the media of Peevski.

Following the bank run, Corpbank was closed for nearly six months. During that time, depositors were unable to pull their money out. Bulgaria's deposit insurance fund was not large enough to compensate insured depositors, so Bulgaria needed to raise additional funds. To complicate matters further, the country was without a government from July to October 2014. Therefore, paying the depositors was an impossible task. Reopening the bank was not an option either, since that would simply restart the run. Therefore, the BNB kept the bank "on ice".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Shutdown of Corpbank ==
In July 2014, the central bank said it was removing Corpbank's banking license and would move the bank's healthy divisions into a separate bank. These events marked the first banking collapse since Bulgaria's 1996-1997 domestic financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-banking-idUSL6N0PM28G20140711|title=UPDATE 5-Bulgaria to allow its fourth-biggest bank to collapse|date=2017-07-11|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Forbes, "The central bank denied Corpbank liquidity support, forcing it to close its doors. Corpbank’s management asked the central bank to put Corpbank into "special supervision", a procedure under which the central bank temporarily takes over a troubled bank in order to put it back on track."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Special treatment of another bank ===
Shortly after Corpbank’s failure, another bank run happened to a bank called FIBank. The central bank’s response to FIBank’s bank run was much different than its response to Corpbank’s. The central bank gave FIBank plenty of liquidity to protect FIBank’s financial stability, even though it had already allowed the bank to fail. According to Vassilev, this double standard was due to "the will of the political mafia".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The government ultimately brought down Corpbank to remove Vassilev; it protected FIBank to serve political ends.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== No nationalization ===
The Bulgarian central bank (BNB) accused Corpbank of extensive fraud. Because of this apparent fraud, BNB said that nationalizing Corpbank was not an option. BNB described the extent of the bank's fraud as "a bottomless barrel".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2014/07/12/the-curious-case-of-the-bulgarian-bank-runs/#3ecbf63c6323|title=The Curious Case Of The Bulgarian Bank Runs|last=Coppola|first=Frances|date=2014-07-12|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-24|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deposit Insurance Fund of Bulgaria guaranteed all deposits up to 100,000 euros.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Blame ===
Media reports say that BNB was aware that it failed to adequately supervise the bank. But more specifically, BNB places blame on one of its officials, the Deputy Head of Banking Supervision. Everyone else on the BNB board was exonerated. "This does not bode well for the future of bank supervision in Bulgaria," Forbes wrote.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

BNB also made a specific accusation of fraud against Vassilev in relation to the withdrawing of funds in advance of Corpbank's failure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to BNB, "Specifically - according to conservators - on June 19 this year, the day before the Corporate Commercial Bank was to be placed in special measures, a third party downloaded and delivered against receipt to the majority owner of Corporate Commercial Bank 205 887 223 BGN equivalent in cash, mostly Euro."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Attempted rescue plans ==

=== Breach of EU rules ===
Bulgaria was in "triple breach of EU law regarding treatment of its depositors":&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Bulgaria wrongfully transposed the [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directive]] on the Deposit Guarantee Schemes.
# It did not perform its obligation, as required by the directive, to repay the eligible deposits within 20 days following the bank's failure.
# The Deposit Insurance Fund, which is supposed to insure all guaranteed deposits in the Bulgarian banking system, was mismanaged. Furthermore, the fund only held 1 billion euros, an insufficient amount of money to repay the guaranteed deposits "even in one troubled bank."

In October 2014, following complaints from depositors, the [[European Commission]] and [[European Banking Authority]] demanded that Bulgaria compensate insured depositors. Bulgaria refused, claiming that under Bulgarian law the bank had to be "declared insolvent" before deposit insurance could be paid. Insolvency could only be declared after a full audit, which would take four months to do. In December 2014, the depositors eventually got their funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Attempted rescue by owners ===
The shareholders attempted to put a rescue plan together for the bank, but it wasn’t accepted. According to Vassilev, the circumstances surrounding the revocation of the bank's license were suspicious. He and other shareholders, including the Omani Sovereign Wealth Fund (the second-largest shareholder) put forward a rescue plan for the bank. But the parliament dismissed their proposal "out of hand."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Even though we made a solid proposal to the Bulgarian state, we were turned away in the most humiliating manner by the central bank and by the ruling government," Vassilev said. "We were simply told that our proposal was "unserious" without any clarification on the reasons why they deemed so and without a proper meeting to discuss it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After Corpbank’s license was revoked, the bank was forced into insolvency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Omani Sovereign Wealth Fund sued the Bulgarian government in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|International Court for Settlement of Investment Disputes]], based in Washington, D.C., for rejecting the rescue plan. Omani Sovereign Wealth Fund alleged that the rejection breached key principles regarding equal treatment and protection of investors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Embezzlement charges ==
As of October 2015, Vassilev was accused of embezzlement, although at that time no charges were officially filed. The BNB claimed that he ran a [[pyramid scheme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Bulgarian’s office fabricated the accusation, Vassilev said, in order to arrest him and use it as an action to block his and his family’s assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Initially, the central bank’s governor accused Vassilev of taking 200 million leva in plastic bags from Corpbank’s headquarters during the week of the bank run. Vassilev said he had been traveling abroad that week. He also said, "200 million takes a lot of space and cannot go unnoticed if you carry it on your back in the middle of Sofia." The Bulgarian Prosecutor General modified the charging documents, changing the timeframe of the alleged embezzlement from the week of the bank run to the span of several years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, the accusation was based on the statements of only two witnesses. "It was already proven in court that one of the witnesses had forged my signature on documents she presented as proof of the alleged crime," Vassilev said. "And some of the senior staff of Corpbank were pressured to testify against me by the prosecution service through the use of threats."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Greeks}}

The '''Sfakians''' (or '''Sphakians''' or '''Sfakiots'''; {{lang-el|'''Σφακιανοί'''}}) are the  inhabitants of the region of [[Sfakia]] located in western [[Crete]]. The Sfakians hold themselves to be the direct descendants of the [[Dorians]] who invaded the island around 1100 BC. The inhabitants of Sfakia have faced numerous foreign invaders, to which fact they owe their reputation as courageous warriors that they have had for centuries as cousins of the [[Maniots]] and [[Souliots]].

==Sfakians and Saracens==
When the [[Saracen]] [[Arabs]] invaded [[Crete]] in 824 AD, many regions of the island, Sphakia included, escaped effective Arab rule. One reason frequently offered is geography: Sphakians, secure in their  mountain fastness, could mount a formidable [[deep defence]] ''de haut en bas'' (from top to bottom), gradually retreating upward while imposing relatively high casualties on invaders from the lowlands.

In refusing to submit to the Arabs, the Sfakians established a form of self-government known as the ''Gerousia'' ("Council of Elders"); this had its antecedent in the [[Sparta]]n [[Gerousia]], but it is not clear there is any connection. The members of the council were either known as ''Gerontes'' ("Elders") or ''Dimogerontes'' ("Public Elders") who were selected based on the general consensus of the members of the entire community (cf. [[alderman]]).

[[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]], general of the Greek [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces sent to liberate Crete, appointed large numbers of Sfakian warriors to defend his [[rear (military)|rear]] against Arab attacks from the south while he besieged [[Heraklion|Chandax]]. Chandax was the key to Phocas's campaign as it was both the most formidable Arab fortress and the capital of Crete under Arab rule.

The Sfakians not only successfully protected General Phocas's troops, but they also supported him in the siege of Chandax, which fell on March 7, 961 AD, marking the end of Arab rule in Crete. General Phocas was so grateful for the contributions of the Sfakians that he gave the ''Gerontes'' many presents which included weapons and lavish clothing. Moreover, the general allowed the Sfakians the right to continue with their own form of self-government with the added benefit of being exempt from all taxes. Moreover, when General Phocas became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, he reconfirmed these privileges.

==Peace in Byzantine Crete==
[[File:Loutron (Crete).JPG|thumb|View of [[Loutro, Chania|Loutro]] community at Sfakia region.]]

At the dawn of the second Byzantine period in Crete (961–1204), the island itself was in a state of devastation. Many of the inhabitants were sold to slave markets, the economy was in ruins, and the administrative structure of government had no presence on the island. The Byzantines immediately started to rebuild fortifications on the island in order to guard against future attacks. Also, they placed a new administrative system that divided the island into a number of provinces that appointed their own governors.

A new period of cultural and economic renewal began to emerge in Crete. [[Christianity]] in Crete was undergoing a revival thanks to missionaries such as [[Saint Nikon the Metanoeite]] ("The Repenter") and Saint Ioannis Xenos ("John the Stranger"). The local population grew and further assistance was provided by Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]]. In 1080, the emperor ordered the migration and settlement of Greek Byzantine families in Crete.

Emperor [[Alexius II Comnenus]], grandson of Alexius I Comnenus, issued an imperial order that divided the island into twelve provinces and appointed twelve princes from the Byzantine Empire to govern them. Each prince was known as an ''archondopoulon'' ("petty lord"; cp. English [[baron]]) and he would arrive with his extended family to settle in the area allocated to him. From this event, a number of great aristocratic families of Crete emerged, some of them still in existence today. The ''archondopoula'' of Crete entailed the families of Kallergis, Skordilis, Melisseni, Varouchi, Mousouri, Vlasti, Hortatzi, and others.

Sfakia itself was allocated to the emperor's nephew, [[Marinos Skordilis]], who came to Crete with nine of his brothers who also brought over their sons and families. The borders of Skordilis's territory ranged from Askyfou east to Koustogerako and along the south coast to [[Agia Roumeli]], Omprosgialos (today's Hora Sfakion) and to Frangokastello (the largest town in Skordilis's territory was Anopoli and many Sfakian families today claim to be direct descendants of the original Skordiles).

[[John Phocas]], a direct descendant of the emperor who freed Crete from the Arabs, was considered to be the most senior member of the twelve ''archondopoula''. His territory was one of the largest, which covered the greater part of today's province of Rethymno, all the way south to the coast and westward up to the valley of Askyfou, where the border of the Skordilis' territory was located (the name of the family changed a few years later under the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] to Kallergis and families that today claim to be direct descendants of the Phocas-Kallergis dynasty are one of the largest family groups in Crete, including a number from Sfakia).

==Revolts against Venice==

===Rebellions (1212–1283)===

During Venetian rule in Crete (1204–1669), the Greek inhabitants of the island rebelled at least twenty-seven times (without counting any of the other smaller local uprisings) particularly during the first decades of Venetian occupation in favor of re-unification with the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;Agelarakis, P. A. (2012), Cretans in Byzantine foreign policy and military affairs following the Fourth Crusade. Cretika Chronika, 32, 41-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these revolutions lasted for years and were eventually suppressed by the Venetians with great brutality. Many of these revolutions sprang out of the "[[Lefka Ori]]" (or "White Mountains"), which was a Sfakian stronghold. Many of the revolutionaries were led by members of the ''Archondopouloi'' families, especially members of the Sfakian-based families of Skordilis and Phocas/Kallergis.

There occurred over fourteen insurrections between 1207 and 1365. The first rebellion in 1212, against Venetian resettlement, was started by the Aghiostephanites or Argyropouli but was quickly quelled by Venice. In 1217, another revolt occurred that was caused by a private dispute over stolen horses between the noble Skordilis and the Venetian Castellan. The revolt spread rapidly, but a treaty was made and signed between a new Duke and the rebels. Another large rebellion occurred in 1230 in the [[Rethymno]] area as a result of the gathering of the noble clans of Skordilis, Melisseni, and Drakontopouli. The rebellion went on for six years until Venice conceded much land and many garrisons in order to bring the revolt to an end. Venice, from this point on, had its hands full with Crete.

Over the next few decades starting in 1212, the Venetians began to resettle numerous noble families from Venice in order to acquire better control over Crete. Chandax was renamed Candia (today's [[Heraklion]]) and became the seat of the [[Duke of Candia]]. The duke was appointed for a two-year term by Venice and the island was known as the "Regno di Candia" or the "Kingdom of Crete." In 1252, Chania was built on the ancient city of [[Kydonia]] by the Venetians and Crete was divided into six provinces (''sexteria''). Eventually, the six provinces became four counties, but Sfakia always remained out of the direct control of the Venetians who maintained only a small garrison at the castle at Omprosgialos (today's [[Hora Sfakion]]). The Venetians would rarely venture outside of their castle walls.

In 1273, the Hortatzi brothers Georgios and Theodore became the leaders of a great rebellion supported by all Cretan archons but of one revealing exception. The revolt lasted for six years and the costs to the Venetians were heavy. However, the Cretan nobleman, Alexios Kallergis, was lured by the promises given to him by the Venetians and he eventually supported them. The Venetian attack against the Hortatzi brothers was decisive and in 1279, the entire rebellion was crushed.

The Venetians did not keep their promises to Alexios Kallergis and were unfortunately very cruel in their treatment of the Cretan rebels. As a result, Kallergis started one of the largest and most destructive rebellions against the Venetians in 1283. After sixteen years of fighting, the Venetians and Kallergis secretly negotiated an end to the rebellion with numerous concessions made on both sides. In return for the Venetian concessions that entailed the allowing of mixed marriages (in which such a "privilege" did not persuade the Sfakians and Cretans to perceive the Venetians any more favorably) and the installation of a Greek bishopric, Kallergis would swear allegiance to Venice.

===The Chrysomallousa revolution (1319)===

One of the major Sfakian revolutions against Venetian rule was the Chrysomallousa Revolution of 1319. The Venetian garrison maintained at Omprosgialos at Sfakia consisted of only fifteen soldiers and an officer. These troops were merely keeping an eye out on the Sfakians, but rarely did they venture outside and they never interfered in Sfakian affairs. Capuleto, the Venetian officer in charge of the garrison, was attracted one day by a young girl at the well of the village. He approached the young girl and kissed her. She slapped Capuleto in the face, but he managed to pull out a dagger and cut some of the girl's golden hair. The girl's name was Chrysi Skordilis and she was from the Archondopoula family of the Skordilises. She was also called "''Chrysomallousa''" (or "Golden Hair") due to her blond hair. Upon hearing what happened to Chrysi, her relatives immediately killed the offending Venetian officer and most of the guards. Venetian troops arrived soon from Chania and the locals fought the Venetians bravely throughout the district. The revolution went on for more than a year until Archondas Kallergis intervened and had reached a peace treaty with the Venetians. The peace treaty entailed an agreement for the withdrawal of the Venetian forces from the area and an end to hostilities.

===Rebellions (1332–1371)===

More rebellions against the Venetians broke out in 1332 in Margarites and in 1341 in [[Apokoronas]]. In Amari, Sfakia, [[Mesara]] and elsewhere throughout the island, the Cretans succeeded in winning for themselves many new benefits. As a result of the hard tax policy Venice exercised towards its colony, both Cretans and Venetian settlers revolted in 1363. The revolt, which became to be known as the [[revolt of St. Titus]], overthrew official Venetian rule and declared a Cretan Republic under the protection of [[Saint Titus]], Crete's patron saint who had Christianized the island thirteen centuries earlier. A new rebellion occurred in 1365 and it was crushed by Venice to the point where life in Crete was very miserable.

The Venetians decided to build a castle on the fertile plains east of Sfakia where they intended to place a strong military presence in order to protect Venetian nobles and their properties. This decision was a result of the constant incursions the Venetians were experiencing on the southern coast of Crete from pirates (some of whom were Sfakians). The castle itself would also serve to protect the Venetians from the Sfakians who lived in the mountains north and west of the plains and who were harassing Venetian nobles. In 1371, a Venetian fleet with soldiers and builders arrived on the fertile plain to begin construction on the castle. However, the local Sfakians were against having a castle on their territory. The Sfakians, under the leadership of the six Patsos brothers from the nearby settlement of Patsianos, would destroy every night what the Venetians built during the day. Eventually, the Venetians were forced to bring in additional troops that surrounded the whole area during the whole period that the castle was being built. The Patsos brothers, ready to resume their campaigns against the Venetians, were unfortunately betrayed, arrested and ultimately hanged at the site of the castle. In 1374, the castle was complete, but the Sfakians were not threatened in their stronghold by the Venetian troops who much preferred to be stationed at the castle looking out for pirates instead of trying to establish control over the Sfakians.  The castle is now known as [[Frangokastello]].

===War of the chickens (1470)===

Another major Sfakian revolution was known as the "''Ornithopolemos''" (or the "War of the Chickens"), which took place in 1470. This revolution was caused by the pressures the Venetians were placing on the Cretans in order to extract additional tax revenues. A new tax was introduced requiring all Cretan families to provide one well-fed chicken every month to the Venetian in charge of their area. As time went by and Cretan families began to multiply, the number of chickens demanded was increasing and arguments began to start about the correct number of chickens that should be given to the Venetian in charge of the area. Some villages started giving eggs rather than chickens on the basis that the Venetians would hatch the eggs themselves. Legal action was taken by the Venetians against the villagers for short payment, as well as against the Sfakians who were refusing to pay the tax altogether. Eventually, the Venetians issued over 10,000 indictments. The Sfakians, in return, compiled a report charging the Venetian authorities of corruption and sent the report to Chania for dispatch to Venice. The authorities at Chania imprisoned the Sfakian who brought the report and as a result, the Sfakians declared a revolution and encouraged the rest of the Cretans to refuse the tax. The revolution lasted for three years and at the end of the fighting, the Venetians agreed to withdraw the tax from the whole island, as well as withdraw all outstanding legal actions.

===Kantanoleon's revolution (1527 or 1570)===

There occurred yet another Sfakian revolution, which became a part of Cretan mythology since the publication of a book in 1872 known as "The Cretan Weddings" by a Lefkadiot writer and historian named Zambelios. The full historical events have never been proven, but there are Venetian records that substantiate large parts of the overall story. However, the records do not fully explain why the wedding was proposed in the first place and by whom. The name of this major uprising was called Kantanoleon's Revolution and the Cretan Weddings. The protagonists of this revolution were George Kantanoleon (who came from the small village of Koustogerako north of Sougia), his son Petros, Francesco Molino (a Venetian noble from Chania), and Sophia (Molino's daughter). Although Kantanoleon came from Koustogerako, a small village just outside today's province of Sfakia, the village itself was on the border of the Sfakian territory owned by Archondopoulo Skordilis. Kantanoleon was also from the family of Skordilis (some sources also claim that his correct surname was Skordilis and that the surname "Kantanoleon" was given to him by the Venetians).

Some time before 1527 (or 1570 according to another source), many people from western Crete met at the monastery of Saint John at [[Akrotiri, Crete|Akrotiri]] to revolt against their Venetian rulers as a result of taxes and brutal treatment, and elected George Kantanoleon as ruler. Following battles at Impros Gorge near Rethymno and at [[Samaria Gorge]] at Lasithi, the Venetians withdrew to Chania, allowing the new Cretan government free rein over western Crete. Kantanoleon established his headquarters at Meskla at the foot of the Lefka Ori, about 15 kilometres south of Chania, and set up his government including a more acceptable level of taxation.

The events that followed are disputed. Zambelios, in his book "The Cretan Weddings", claims that Petros (Kantanoleon's son) fell in love with Sophia (Molino’s daughter) and that Molino conspired with the Duke of Candia to trap and kill all the revolutionaries. Molino's plan was for a marriage between his daughter and Petros in which the invitees would be arrested and the rebels killed. A Venetian historian, however, stated that it was Kantanoleon that tried to impose a reconciliation between Cretans and the noble Venetian families of western Crete by arranging the marriage of his son to Molino's daughter, thus trying to establish a new dynasty to govern western Crete.

Both historians agree on the events that transpired at the wedding. The wedding itself had a large number of invited Cretan guests and traditional festivities had large amounts of wine consumed (spiced with opium according to Zambelios). Eventually, all of the guests were surrounded by Venetian troops that came secretly from Chania, Rethymno, and Candia. The troops arrested both Kantanoleon and his son Petros and hanged them on the spot together with more than thirty other Cretan nobles. The rest of the prisoners, ranging in the hundreds, were divided into four groups and one was hanged at the gates of Chania, one at Koutsogerako, one on the road from Chania to Rethymno, and one at Meskla (the headquarters of the rebel government). Yet, the atrocities did not stop there as whole villages were destroyed including Koutsogerako, Meskla, and a few others. The atrocities continued for some time and quite a few Cretan leaders and their families fled up to the mountains and stayed there for some time until eventually an amnesty was issued.

==Sfakians and the fall of Constantinople==
[[File:Crete Sfakia.JPG|thumb|180px|Woman from Sfakia; 19th century.]]

In January 1453, Sultan [[Mehmet II]] had the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, [[Constantinople]], surrounded. He decided that he was going to take it over either by breaking through the city's defenses or by starving the inhabitants into submission. The sultan had his troops and an enormous fleet at his disposal while the besieged Byzantines (and their Christian allies) were demoralized and divided amongst themselves. Responding to a request for help from the Byzantine Emperor, the Sfakian leader Manousos Kallikratis gathered 300 Sfakian warriors and another 760 Cretan fighters from other parts of the island. The leader then sailed in five ships (three of which were Sfakian) and went to help the besieged Emperor.

The Sfakian/Cretan forces fought valiantly by breaking through the Ottoman blockade and by defending the city itself. Many Cretans died alongside the Byzantines, as well as alongside the few [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and Venetian co-defenders. When the city fell, the only 170 surviving Cretans had been surrounded by Ottoman troops in one of the city's towers and were refusing to surrender. The sultan was so impressed by their courage and fierce fighting skills that he agreed to let them walk out of the city with their flags, arms, and wounded and sail away to Crete in one of their ships.

A poet of the time has the Byzantine Emperor saying as he was surrounded by the Ottomans, '''''"Christians, Greeks, cut off my head, take it, good Cretans, and carry it to Crete, for the Cretans to see it and be sad at heart."''''' Just a few words from an anonymous poet described the deep impact of the fall of Constantinople had on the Cretans. They were to become the next home of the refugees from Byzantium and responsible for nurturing the rich heritage left to them by the collapsing Byzantine Empire.

==Against the Ottomans with the help of the Imperial Russia==
During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of Crete (1669–1898), and especially from  the 18th century onwards, the Greeks looked towards Christian [[Russia]] as its savior. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], as part of his plan to expand southward to the [[Black Sea]], promoted himself as a champion of the Christians residing in the [[Balkans]]. His overall policy, with some variations, was continued by [[Catherine the Great]] (1762–1796) in her wars against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. She dreamed of resurrecting the Byzantine Empire and placing her grandson as its emperor. Before the first [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russo-Turkish War]], she sent Russian agents to [[Morea]] and the islands in order to stir up the Greeks to fight against the Turks. One of the Russian agents reached a man named [[Daskalogiannis|Daskaloyiannis]] and told the Sfakian from Anopoli to lead a revolt. This was ill advice since the Sfakians, let alone the Cretans in general, were hardly ready for such a revolt, as they had virtually no weapons.

Yet, when in 1770, a Russian fleet under Count [[Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov]] appeared in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], precipitating the [[Orlov Revolt]], Daskaloyiannis and his Cretan followers revolted. However, when the Russo-Turkish conflict ran to an end, the Cretans were left alone against Turkish troops from Chania, Rethymno, and Heraklion. The [[pasha]] of Crete had captured the brother and daughters of Daskaloyiannis and with the promise of leniency he demanded that Daskaloyiannis surrender. Daskaloyiannis decided to surrender so that he could see his brother and daughters released. Most of the other leaders of the revolt were killed, and the pasha had Daskaloyiannis first tortured in order to provide any valuable strategic information. Naturally, Daskaloyiannis refused to surrender his people to the Turks. Even after the pasha had the Sfakian skinned alive strip by strip in front of hundreds summoned at a public square, Daskaloyiannis did not betray his people.

Neither the failed revolt of 1770 AD nor the death of Daskaloyiannis went in vain since both events aroused the national sentiments of all Cretans. The revolts made by the Cretans and the legendary Sfakians contributed to the rise of the independent Cretan state in 1898, which also paved the way for Crete’s union with [[Greece]] in 1912.

==The Sfakian dialect==
The Sfakian dialect is much like any other Cretan dialect, and yet it is also quite different. Like many other Cretan dialects, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPAslink|x}}, and {{IPAslink|ɣ}} before [[front vowel]]s become {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPAblink|dʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, and {{IPAblink|ʒ}}. However, one oddity present in the Sfakian dialect is how it treats {{IPA|/l/}}. Before an {{IPA|/il}} or an {{IPA|/e/}}, ⟨λ⟩ is a lateral {{IPA|[l]}}. However, before an {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, or {{IPA|/u/}}, it becomes an approximant {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, much like the English "r" sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfakia-crete.com/sfakia-crete/dialect.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "θάλασσα" (thalassa, meaning "sea") is pronounced by a Sfakian as {{IPA|[ˈθaɹasa]}}, but πουλί (''pouli'', meaning bird) is {{IPA|[pouˈli]}}, closer to standard Greek. This feature is not shared anywhere else, except for certain villages in the Aegean, including the village of [[Apiranthos]] on the Cyladic island of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. Indeed, the Sfakians believe that hundreds of years ago, probably after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, a group of Sfakians left Crete and came to [[Apiranthos]] on [[Naxos]]. The cultures of Sfakia and Apiranthos bear many striking similarities, not least of which includes the aforementioned dialectal peculiarity.

The '''Shipibo-Conibo''' are an [[indigenous people]] along the [[Ucayali River]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Perú]]. Formerly two groups, the Shipibo (apemen) and the Conibo (fishmen), they eventually became one distinct tribe through intermarriage and communal ritual and are currently known as the Shipibo-Conibo people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eakin|first=Lucile |author2=Erwin Laurialy |author3=Harry Boonstra|title=People of the Ucayali: The Shipibo and Conibo of Peru|journal=International Museum of Cultures Publication|year=1986|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Shipibo-Conibo Amazon Forest People at the Dawn of the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shipibo-Conibo Amazon Forest People at the Dawn of the 21st Century|url=http://ecoversity.org/case_focus/shipibo/shipibo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artesiana.jpg|thumb|Traditional embroidering. Shipibo-Conibo tribe.]]

==Lifestyle, tradition and diet==
The Shipibo-Conibo live in the 21st century while keeping one foot in the past, spanning millennia in the Amazonian rainforest. Many of their traditions are still practiced, such as [[ayahuasca]] [[shamanism]]. Shamanistic songs have inspired artistic tradition and decorative designs found in their clothing, pottery, tools and textiles. Some of the urbanized people live around Pucallpa in the Yarina Cocha, an extensive indigenous zone. Most others live in scattered villages over a large area of jungle forest extending from [[Brazil]] to [[Ecuador]].

Shipibo-Conibo women make beadwork and textiles, but are probably best known for their pottery, decorated with maze-like red and black geometric patterns. While these ceramics were traditionally made for use in the home, an expanding tourist market has provided many households with extra income through the sale of pots and other craft items. They also prepare [[Chapo (beverage)|chapo]], a sweet plantain beverage.

The Shipibo of the village of Pao-Yan used to have a diet of fish, yuca and fruits. Now, however, the situation has deteriorated because of global weather changes and now there is mostly just yuca and fish. Since there has been drought followed by flooding, most of the mature fruit trees have died, and some of the banana trees and plantains are struggling. Global increases in energy and food prices have risen due to deforestation and erosion along the [[Ucayali River]]. The basic needs of the people are more important now than ever, affecting their long term planning abilities. There is now a sense that hunger may not be that far off for those in the farther reaches of the Shipibo nation.&lt;ref name="The Shipibo-Conibo Amazon Forest People at the Dawn of the 21st Century" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradfield|first=R.B|author2=James Lauriault |title=Diet and food beliefs of Peruvian jungle tribes: 1. The Shipibo (monkey people)|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic|year=1961|issue=39|pages=126–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with western sources – including the governments of Peru and Brazil – has been sporadic over the past three centuries.  The Shipibo are noted for a rich and complex cosmology, which is tied directly to the art and artifacts they produce. Christian missionaries have worked to convert them since the late 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eakin|first=Lucille|author2=Erwin Lauriault |author3=Harry Boonstra |title=Bosquejo etnográfico de los shipibo-conibo del Ucayali|journal=Lima|year=1980|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Kenneth M|title=Panoan linguistic, folklorisic and ehtnographic research: retrospect and prospect|journal=South American Indian languages: retrospect and prospect|year=1985|pages=224–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly from the [[Franciscans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sipibo Indians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
[[File:Shipibo.png|280px|right|thumb|Distribution of the Shipibo-Conibo (marked with an arrow) amongst other [[Panoan languages|Pano-speaking]] ethnicities]]

With an estimated population of over 20,000, the Shipibo-Conibo represent approximately 8% of the indigenous registered population. Census data is unreliable due to the transitory nature of the group.  Large amounts of the population have relocated to urban areas –  in particular the eastern Peruvian cities of [[Pucallpa]] and [[Yarinacocha District|Yarinacocha]] – to gain access to better educational and health services, as well as to look for alternative sources of monetary income.

The population numbers for this group have fluctuated in the last decades between approximately 11,000 (Wise and Ribeiro, 1978) to as many as 25,000 individuals (Hern 1994).

Like all other indigenous populations in the Amazon basin, the Shipibo-Conibo are threatened by severe pressure from outside influences such as oil speculation, logging, narco-trafficking, and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bardales R.|first=César|title=Quimisha Incabo ini yoia (Leyendas de los shipibo-conibo sobre los tres Incas)|journal=Comunidades y Culturas Peruanas|year=1979|issue=12|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eakin|first=Lucille|title=Nuevo destino: The life story of a Shipibo bilingual educator|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics Museum of Anthropology publication|issue=9|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of Victory''' (Latin templum Victoriae) is a temple on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome.  It is traditionally ascribed to [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionys. I.32.5, where it is called a [[temenos|τέμενος]].&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually built by [[Lucius Postumius Megellus (consul 305 BC)|Lucius Postumius Megellus]] out of fines he levied during his [[aedile]]ship and dedicated by him on 1 August&lt;ref&gt;''Fasti Praenestini'' ad Kal. August , EE IX. No. 740; NS 1897, 421; Ant. ap. NS 1921, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; when consul in 294 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy X.33.9).&lt;/ref&gt; This temple was used to house Cybele's sacred stone between 204 BC and 191 BC, while [[temple of Cybele (Palatine)|her own nearby temple]] was still being built&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXIX.14.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cato the Elder]] afterwards built a shrine of Victoria Virgo&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXV.9.6.&lt;/ref&gt; next to the temple of Victory. If still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. 

It was in the Temple of Victory that the spoils of war from Roman victories were eventually deposited. Some of its notable contents came from the spoils of Titus from the Temple of Jerusalem which remained deposited in the Temple of Victory until it was looted by the Vandals in the 5th century and subsequently taken to Africa. The golden roof of the temple was also removed by the barbarians during their pillage of Rome.

There is no record of any restoration of this temple&lt;ref&gt;AJA 1905, 438‑440; Mem. Am. Acad. II.61.&lt;/ref&gt; and its exact site is still uncertain. See CJ 1920, 297, where Chase states that Boni identified this temple with foundations found near the [[arch of Titus]]. It was doubtless on the Clivus Victoriae, and remains of two dedicatory inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI.31049 = i2.805; 31060.&lt;/ref&gt; found about 50 metres west of the present church of [[San Teodoro (Rome)|San Teodoro]], may indicate its position.&lt;ref&gt;HJ 47‑49; WR 139; Gilb.

"'''The Most Dangerous Game'''", also published as "'''The Hounds of Zaroff'''"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, is a [[short story]] by [[Richard Connell]], first published in ''[[Collier's]]'' on January 19, 1924. The story features a [[big-game hunter]] from [[New York City]] who falls off a [[yacht]] and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated [[island]] in the [[Caribbean]], where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting [[safari]]s in [[Africa]] and [[South America]] that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.

The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 [[RKO Pictures]] film ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', starring [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Leslie Banks]], and for a 1943 episode of the [[CBS Radio]] series ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', starring [[Orson Welles]].

==Plot Summary==
Sanger Rainsford and his friend, Whitney, are traveling to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to hunt the region's big cat: the [[jaguar]]. After a discussion about how they are "the hunters" instead of "the hunted", Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford hears gunshots. He climbs onto the yacht's rail and accidentally falls overboard, swimming to Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. On the island, he finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two [[Cossack]]s: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic [[deaf-mute]] servant, Ivan.

Zaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting [[snow leopard]]s in [[Tibet]]. After inviting him to dinner, General Zaroff tells Rainsford he is bored of hunting because it no longer challenges him; he has moved to Ship-Trap in order to capture shipwrecked sailors. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of [[hunting dog]]s for three days are set free. Zaroff reveals that no one has lasted that long, although a couple of sailors had come close. Zaroff also says that he offers sailors a "choice"; should they decline to be hunted they will be handed over to Ivan, who had once been official [[Knout|knouter]] for [[Nicholas II|The Great White Czar]]. Rainsford denounces this as barbarism. Zaroff reacts in a cosmopolitan manner that "[[survival of the fittest|life is for the strong]]". Realizing he has no way out, Rainsford reluctantly agrees to be hunted.

During his three-hour head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse, standing underneath the tree Rainsford is hiding in, smoking a cigarette, and then abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a Malay man-catcher, a [[Deadfall trap|weighted log attached to a trigger]]. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night. The next day Rainsford creates a [[Trapping pit|Burmese tiger pit]], which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sacrifices his knife and ties it to a sapling to make a [[Uganda]]n knife trap; Ivan is killed when he stumbles into this trap and the knife plunges into his heart. To escape Zaroff and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff, disappointed at Rainsford's suicide, returns home. 

Zaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights only to find Rainsford waiting for him; he had swum around the island in order to sneak into the chateau without the dogs finding him. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the "game", but Rainsford decides to fight him, saying he is still a beast-at-bay and that the original hunt is not over. Accepting the challenge, Zaroff says that the loser will be fed to the dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. Though the ensuing fight is not described, the story ends with Rainsford observing that "he had never slept in a better bed"—implying that he defeated and killed Zaroff.

==Analysis==
"The Most Dangerous Game" is a popular read within middle and high school curricula due to the strength of the themes within the story. The first and foremost question that the story bears is that of justifiable murder. Rainsford justifies his hunting of animals because he believes that man is superior to animals because animals do not feel. To contradict, General Zaroff believes that men are superior because they are able to reason. Zaroff uses his reasoning to explain why men are the most interesting game to hunt; men can reason, and thus provide a challenge that no animal can contend with. The story simultaneously highlights through the experience of Rainsford, as he is hunted, the fears that animals must experience while being hunted.

Zaroff himself is a contradiction because his exquisite manners are juxtaposed with his heartless brutality in killing men. The idea of a man who is proper in all aspects, but still contains a desire to kill, is a suggestion by Connell that men possess murderous instincts that can only be subdued by the presence of society and law. Zaroff is only able to partake in his "hobby" because he does not live within a civilization.

The ending of the story bears questions about the true nature of Rainsford, who is implied to have killed Zaroff in order to secure his own safety. By killing Zaroff, he thus took part in the "game" that Zaroff wanted him to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/most-dangerous-game/themes|title=The Most Dangerous Game Themes |publisher=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and in popular culture==
[[File:Most Dangerous Game poster.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theatrical release poster for ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932)]]

===Film===
This story has been adapted to film numerous times. The most significant of these adaptations—and the only film to use the original characters—was [[RKO Pictures]]' film released in [[1932 in film|1932]], ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]''. [[Joel McCrea]] stars as Rainsford; [[Leslie Banks]] portrays Zaroff. The adaptation by [[James Ashmore Creelman]] adds two other principal characters, brother-and-sister pair Eve Trowbridge ([[Fay Wray]]) and Martin Trowbridge ([[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]), who are castaways from a shipwreck. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was co-directed by [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] and [[Irving Pichel]]; also with a score by [[Max Steiner]], the film was a favorite project of producer [[Merian C. Cooper]]. The production shared several sets with ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), a simultaneous RKO project that also involved Schoedsack, Cooper, Wray, Armstrong, Creelman, and Steiner. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was a modest success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=3937 |title=The Most Dangerous Game  |publisher=''AFI Catalog of Feature Films'' |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKO Story"&gt;Jewell, Richard B., ''The RKO Story''. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. {{ISBN|0-517-54656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51|date=February 2014}}

RKO produced a remake titled ''[[A Game of Death]]'' (1945), directed by [[Robert Wise]], from a screenplay Norman Houston wrote. This film stars [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] and [[Audrey Long]], with [[Edgar Barrier]] as the mad hunter.&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}} In order to keep with events of that time, ''A Game of Death'' changed Zaroff into "Erich Kreiger", a Nazi, and was set in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]].

In 1956, United Artists released another film adaptation, ''[[Run for the Sun]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Jane Greer]].&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}}

In 1961, the film ''[[Bloodlust!]]'' was released, directed by [[Ralph Brooke]] and starring [[Wilton Graff]] as the Zaroff-type character, and [[Robert Reed]] as the leader of a band of youths who become stranded on the island.

1972's ''[[The Woman Hunt]]'' starring [[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] and [[Sid Haig]] made for [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]] is an unofficial remake of the story. 

The Australian film ''[[Turkey Shoot (1982 film)|Turkey Shoot]]'' has similar elements.

[[John Woo]]'s first Hollywood directorial effort, the [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] thriller ''[[Hard Target]]'' (1993), was loosely based on the same story. The locale was shifted to 1990s New Orleans, with homeless Vietnam war veterans voluntarily serving (in return for potential payment from a shady businessman) as human prey.

In ''[[Surviving the Game]]'' (1994), a homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains. He is unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, the film stars [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Ice-T]], and [[Charles S. Dutton]].

''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]'' (1997) is a comedic parody of the story, with German huntsman Gustav Shank accidentally bringing Puerto Rican teenage hustler Pestario "Pest" Vargas to his island instead of the skilled man he had intended to hunt, only to decide to hunt the Pest anyway due to his sheer obnoxiousness. Shank's ambition is to have a head of a warrior of every ethnicity in his Trophy Room. He also rigs the "game" by having his prey unknowingly drink a slow-acting poison before the hunt, making sure that they die even if they escape him. 

In '' [[The Eliminator (film)|The Eliminator]]'' (2004), seven captured people are hunted at night for sport on an island as a betting game for the wealthy.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' Halloween special "[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]" contained a segment "Survival of the Fattest" which parodied the story closely. In this segment Mr. Burns invited much of the cast to his hunting lodge on a private island only to reveal that he intended to hunt them all for sport. Another episode makes a reference to "The Most Dangerous Game" when [[Rainier Wolfcastle]] says that he bought a [[YMCA]] to demolish it and install a hunting ground dedicated to "hunt the most dangerous animal of all... Man".

An episode of the animated series ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' entitled "Hunted!" is an obvious parody of the story. The titular Johnny is forced to go through the same ordeal, but his stupidity and foolishness greatly frustrates the hunter, who eventually allows him to leave.

===Other adaptations===
The story has also served as an inspiration for books and films like ''[[Seventh Victim]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games]]''.

In a song called “Fly Over the Wall” by Joey Pecoraro, the opening interaction between Rainsford and General Zaroff is used as a prelude to the actual song.

The [[Rooster Teeth]] series "Let's Play Minecraft" featured an adaptation of the story into a game played by the show's cast members in the video game [[Minecraft]], where one player was given a map and hunted by the other five in and around the in-game world created by the [[Rooster Teeth|Achievement Hunter]] cast members.

A translated version was published in [[Malayalam]] as an audio book by Kathacafe in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kathacafe.com/collections/adventure/products/the_most_dangerous_game|title=Malayalam audio Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Hayes Noel, Bob Gurnsey, and [[Charles Gaines]] discussed Gaines's recent trip to Africa and his experiences hunting [[African buffalo]].

'''Vaal–Orange''', also known as '''Seroa''', is an extinct [[Tuu languages|ǃKwi language]] of [[South Africa]] and [[Lesotho]].  It comprised the ''ǂUngkue'' dialect (also rendered ''ǂKunkwe'') of the [[Warrenton, Northern Cape|Warrenton]] area, recorded by [[Carl Meinhof]], and the ''ǁŨǁ’e'' dialect (also rendered ''ǁKu-ǁ’e'' or ''ǁKuǁe''),&lt;ref&gt;Distinguish ''ǁNg ǃ’e'', a form of [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]], and ''Nǀhuǁéi'', which is a variety of [[Taa language|Taa]].&lt;/ref&gt; spoken near [[Theunissen]] and [[Bethany, Free State|Bethany]] in South Africa and into Lesotho, recorded by [[Dorothea Bleek]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Güldemann (2011) "The Lower Nossob varieties of Tuu: ǃUi, Taa or neither?"&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name "Vaal–Orange" comes from the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and [[Orange River]]s, which converge where ǂUngkue dialect was spoken.  ''Seroa'' is the [[Sesotho]] name, literally "language of the ''Baroa'' (Bushmen)". 

Like [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]], ǂUngkue used 'inclusory' pronouns for compound subjects:

:{|
|ǃhoeti ||nan ||koro ||nan ||tuē ||n ||a ||‖’a
|-
|lion ||and ||jackal ||and ||ostrich ||they ||?{{sc|past}} ||go

:'The lion and jackal and ostrich, they went'. (Meinhof 1929)
