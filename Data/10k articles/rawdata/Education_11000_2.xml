The '''American Graduate School of Business (AGSB)''' is a non-profit, private [[business school]] located in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=American Graduate School of Business (AGSB)|url=http://www.qisan.com/members/institutional-members/american-graduate-school-of-business-agsb/|journal=QISAN|date =2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The American Graduate School of Business (AGSB)|url=http://www.educations.com/study-abroad/agsb-university/|journal=Educations|date =2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
AGSB University was established in September 1991 as a non-profit, private institution of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=AGSB University |url=http://www.swissprivateuniversities.ch/agsb-university/ |journal=Swiss Private Universities |date=2016 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members recognized the needs of the existing student population and the educative demand for an American-paradigm offering undergraduate and graduate programs in business administration. A special emphasis on the existing cross-cultural commercial environment and the multilingual Swiss context is distinctive to AGSB's knowledge-based academic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=AGSB University (The american graduate school of business)|url=http://www.masterstudies.com/universities/Switzerland/AGSB/|journal=Masterstudies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic programs ==
AGSB offers English-language business education programs. Programs are classified at [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] level and include bachelor's, masters and doctoral degree programs in Business Administration ([[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration|BSBA]], [[Master of Inernational Business Administration|MIBA]] and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=QISAN|url=https://www.qisan.com/?s=agsb&amp;submit=|journal=Quality International Study Abroad Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">{{Advanced Placement}}
In the United States, '''Advanced Placement Computer Science''' is a suite of [[Advanced Placement]] courses and examinations covering areas of [[computer science]]. They are offered by the [[College Board]] to [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for [[college]]-level courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suite consists of two current classes and one discontinued class.

AP Computer Science was taught in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] for the 1984–1998 exams, in [[C++]] for 1999–2003, and in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsi.thecubscientist.com/05_DailySchedule/historyAPCS.pdf|title=AP Computer Science: A Brief History|last=Lew|first=Michael|date=|website=Thecubscientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science Principles==
[[AP Computer Science Principles]] is an introductory course to computer science, "with a focus on how computing powers the world".&lt;ref name=CSPcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/course-details | title = AP Computer Science Principles: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed as a parallel to AP Computer Science A, to emphasize [[computational thinking]] and fluency. It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science.

AP Computer Science Principles was introduced in the 2016–2017 school year.

==AP Computer Science A==
[[AP Computer Science A]] is a programming class.&lt;ref name=CSAcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/course-details | title = AP Computer Science A: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board  | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The course emphasizes [[object-oriented programming]] methodology, especially problem solving and [[algorithm]] development, plus an overview of data structures and abstraction. The [[AP Computer Science A]] exam tests students on their knowledge of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. 

The [[Microsoft]]-sponsored program [[Technology Education and Literacy in Schools]] (TEALS) aims to increase the number of students taking AP Computer Science classes.&lt;ref name="Bishop2012-07-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=2012-07-27 |title=Geek of the Week: Kevin Wang is putting computer scientists into high schools |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |newspaper=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=2015-07-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zo1zm7iP?url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science AB (discontinued)==
[[AP Computer Science AB]] included all the topics of AP Computer Science A, as well as a more formal and a more in-depth study of [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], and [[data abstraction]]. For example, [[binary trees]] were studied in AP Computer Science AB but not in AP Computer Science A. The use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] data structures and [[dynamic allocation|dynamically allocated]] structures were fundamental to AP Computer Science AB. 

AP Computer Science AB was equivalent to a full-year college course.&lt;ref name=CSABhomepage&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | title = AP Computer Science AB Course Home Page | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516202349/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | archive-date = May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to low numbers of students taking the exam, AP Computer Science AB was discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration.&lt;ref name=CSABdiscontinued&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | title = Important Announcement about AP Computer Science AB | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195847/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | archive-date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cech | first = Scott J. | url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/04/09/32ap.h27.html | title = College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects | work = Education Week | date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57364">The following is an '''academic genealogy of theoretical physicists''' and is constructed by following the pedigree of [[thesis advisor]]s. If an advisor did not exist, or if the field of physics is unrelated, an [[academic genealogy|academic genealogical]] link can be constructed by using the university from which the [[theoretical physicist]] graduated.

An academic genealogy tree lists the physicists' [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]{{efn|In most of [[Europe]], all fields ([[history]], philosophy, [[social sciences]], [[mathematics]] and [[natural philosophy]]/[[natural sciences]]) other than [[theology]], [[law]], and [[medicine]] (the so-called professional, vocational, or technical curriculum) were traditionally known as philosophy (see Sooyoung Chang, ''Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians'', World Scientific, 2010, p. 183).}} (or in some cases [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]/[[Master's degree|MA]]){{efn|Note that there were no PhDs in Germany before the 1650s (when they gradually started substituting the MA as the highest academic degree; arguably one of the earliest German PhD holders is [[Erhard Weigel]], 1652—[[#Erhard Weigel|see his academic lineage tree]]), in France before 1808 (when they gradually started substituting [[diploma]]s as the highest academic degree), in Russia before 1819 (when the ''[[Doktor Nauk]]'' degree, roughly equivalent to the PhD, gradually started substituting the [[specialist diploma]], roughly equivalent to the MA, as the highest academic degree) and in 1917–1934, in the U.S. before 1861 (when they gradually started substituting MAs as the highest academic degree), in the UK before 1917 (when they gradually started substituting the MA as the highest academic degree), and in Italy before 1927 (when they gradually started substituting the [[Laurea]] as the highest academic degree); see ''[[Doctor of Philosophy#History|Doctor of Philosophy: History]]'' and ''[[Doktor nauk#History|Doktor Nauk: History]]'' for further information.}} date and school, if known. Nobel Prize winners are indicated by {{sup|†}}. If physicists are advised by [[mathematician]]s, their genealogy can be readily traced using the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]].

==Classical lineages==
The [[Max Planck]], the [[Albert Einstein]], the [[Lev Landau]], and the [[Eugene Wigner]] academic genealogies ultimately lead to the [[Renaissance humanist]] [[Niccolò Leoniceno]].&lt;!--This lineage is not included below.--&gt;

The [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] genealogy leads to [[Felix Klein]] and then to [[Otto Mencke]] ''via Gauss'' and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. The Leibniz heritage, however, is due to the premature death of Klein's advisor, [[Julius Plücker]], which forced a second supervisor for the final examination, namely [[Rudolf Lipschitz]].

The [[Enrico Fermi]] and the [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] academic genealogies lead to [[Jurij Vega]].

The [[Max Born]] academic genealogy leads to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and then on to [[Otto Mencke]] and ultimately to [[Friedrich Leibniz]], Gottfried Leibniz's father. The [[Léon Van Hove]] lineage stems from the Gottfried Leibniz one as well.

Another advisor line in continental Europe descends from Gottfried Leibniz via—among others—Poisson, Lagrange, the Bernoullis, and Euler. The Gottfried Leibniz lineage ultimately proceeds from the [[Heinrich von Langenstein]] one (the Heinrich von Langenstein lineage&lt;!--This lineage is not included below.--&gt; also includes [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe]], and [[Johannes Kepler]]).

The lineage of the two main American branches (the [[Henry Augustus Rowland]] branch and the [[Arthur Gordon Webster]] branch—[[#Hermann von Helmholtz|see s.v.]]) proceeds ''via [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'' from [[Gerard van Swieten]]—and his mentor [[Herman Boerhaave]]—and ultimately from [[Jacques Dubois]] and [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]].&lt;!--This lineage is not included below.--&gt; The [[Ralph H. Fowler]] lineage also stems from the same line.

[[Isaac Barrow]] was influenced by the work of [[Vincenzo Viviani]], an assistant of [[Galileo Galilei]].

[[File:Electrician Mike Hughes Installing Meter Base.jpg|thumb|[[Electrician]]s are often trained through apprenticeships.]]
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|[[Carpentry]] is another occupation learned through apprenticeship.]]
An '''apprenticeship''' is a system of [[training]] a new generation of practitioners of a [[Tradesman|trade]] or [[profession]] with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading). Apprenticeship also enables practitioners to gain a [[license]] to practice in a [[regulation|regulated]] profession. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies. Apprenticeships typically last 3 to 7 years. People who successfully complete an apprenticeship reach the "[[journeyman]]" or [[professional certification]] level of competence.

Although the formal boundaries and terminology of the apprentice/journeyman/master system often do not extend outside [[guild]]s and [[trade union]]s, the concept of on-the-job training leading to competence over a period of years is found in any field of [[skilled worker|skilled labor]].

In [[early modern period|early modern]] usage, the [[clipping (morphology)|clipped form]] '''prentice''' was common.{{Citation needed|reason=Was it really?|date=April 2018}}

==Development==
[[File:Medieval baker.jpg|thumb|right|A medieval baker with his apprentice. The Bodleian Library, Oxford.]]

The system of apprenticeship first developed in the [[late middle ages|later Middle Ages]] and came to be supervised by craft [[guild]]s and town governments. A [[master craftsman]] was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing food, lodging and formal training in the craft. Most apprentices were males, but female apprentices were found in crafts such as [[seamstress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apprenticeship indenture |date=March 18, 1642 |work=Cambridge University Library Archives (Luard 179/9) |url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0265%2FLuard%20179%2F9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tailor]], [[cordwainer]], [[baker]] and [[stationer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Apprenticeship indentures 1604–1697 |work=Cambridge St Edward Parish Church archives (KP28/14/2) |url=http://calm.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/ArchiveCatalogue/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=Browse2.tcl&amp;dsqItem=KP28/14/2&amp;dsqKey=RefNo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813022632/http://calm.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/ArchiveCatalogue/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=Browse2.tcl&amp;dsqItem=KP28%2F14%2F2&amp;dsqKey=RefNo |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-13 |accessdate=2009-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apprentices usually began at ten to fifteen years of age, and would live in the master craftsman's household. Most apprentices aspired to becoming master craftsmen themselves on completion of their contract (usually a term of seven years), but some would spend time as a [[journeyman]] and a significant proportion would never acquire their own [[workshop]].

In [[Coventry]] those completing seven-year apprenticeships with [[stuff merchants]] were entitled to become [[Freedom of the City|freemen of the city]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Room, ‘[[Cash, John]] (1822–1880)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, governmental regulation and the licensing of [[technical college]]s and [[vocational education]] formalized and [[bureaucracy|bureaucratized]] the details of apprenticeship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Apprenticeship systems worldwide==

===Australia===
Australian Apprenticeships encompass all apprenticeships and traineeships.  They cover all industry sectors in Australia and are used to achieve both 'entry-level' and career 'upskilling' objectives. There were 475,000 Australian Apprentices in-training as at 31 March 2012, an increase of 2.4% from the previous year. Australian Government employer and employee incentives may be applicable, while State and Territory Governments may provide public funding support for the training element of the initiative. Australian Apprenticeships combine time at work with formal training and can be full-time, part-time or school-based.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Apprentice and Traineeship services are dedicated to promoting retention, therefore much effort is made to match applicants with the right apprenticeship or traineeship. This is done with the aid of aptitude tests, tips, and information on 'how to retain an apprentice or apprenticeship'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web
|url=http://www.apprenticeshipcentral.com.au/resource/tips-on-retaining-your-apprenticeship/
|title=Tips on Retaining Your Apprentice or Apprenticeship}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Information and resources on potential apprenticeship and traineeship occupations are available in over sixty industries.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web
|url=http://www.aapathways.com.au
|title=Australian Apprenticeships and Traineeships Information Service}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between the terms apprentices and trainees lies mainly around traditional trades and the time it takes to gain a qualification. The Australian government uses Australian Apprenticeships Centres to administer and facilitate Australian Apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses and apprentices and trainees and to support the whole process as it underpins the future skills of Australian industry. Australia also has a fairly unusual safety net in place for businesses and Australian Apprentices with its Group Training scheme. This is where businesses that are not able to employ the Australian Apprentice for the full period until they qualify, are able to lease or hire the Australian Apprentice from a Group Training Organisation. It is a safety net, because the Group Training Organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the Australian Apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianapprenticeships.gov.au|title=Australian Apprenticeships|work=Australian Apprenticeships}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megt.com.au|title=MEGT Australia – Apprenticeships, Traineeships, Recruitment|work=MEGT (Australia) Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a safety net, Group Training Organisations (GTO) have other benefits such as additional support for both the Host employer and the trainee/apprentice through an industry consultant who visits regularly to make sure that the trainee/apprentice are fulfilling their work and training obligations with their Host employer. There is the additional benefit of the trainee/apprentice being employed by the GTO reducing the Payroll/Superannuation and other legislative requirements on the Host employer who pays as invoiced per agreement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Austria===
Apprenticeship training in Austria is organized in a [[dual education system]]: company-based training of apprentices is complemented by compulsory attendance of a part-time vocational school for apprentices (Berufsschule).&lt;ref name="bmukk.gv.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmukk.gv.at/enfr/school/secon/app.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217003132/http://www.bmukk.gv.at/enfr/school/secon/app.xml |archivedate=2009-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasts two to four years &amp;ndash; the duration varies among the 250 legally recognized apprenticeship trades.

About 40 percent of all Austrian teenagers enter apprenticeship training upon completion of compulsory education (at age 15). This number has been stable since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wko.at/statistik/jahrbuch/Lehrling5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722084245/http://wko.at/statistik/jahrbuch/Lehrling5.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five most popular trades are: Retail Salesperson (5,000 people complete this apprenticeship per year), Clerk (3,500 / year), Car Mechanic (2,000 / year), Hairdresser (1,700 / year), Cook (1,600 / year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/soziales/gender-statistik/bildung/043955.html|title=Bildung|author=STATISTIK AUSTRIA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many smaller trades with small numbers of apprentices, like "EDV-Systemtechniker" (Sysadmin) which is completed by fewer than 100 people a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berufslexikon.at/pdf/beruf_pdf.php?id=114&amp;berufstyp=1{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apprenticeship Leave Certificate provides the apprentice with access to two different vocational careers. On the one hand, it is a prerequisite for the admission to the Master Craftsman Exam and for qualification tests, and on the other hand it gives access to higher education via the TVE-Exam or the Higher Education Entrance Exam which are prerequisites for taking up studies at colleges, universities, "Fachhochschulen", post-secondary courses and post-secondary colleges.&lt;ref name="bmukk.gv.at"/&gt;

The person responsible for overseeing the training inside the company is called "Lehrherr" or "Ausbilder". An Ausbilder must prove that he has the professional qualifications needed to educate another person, has no criminal record and is an otherwise-respectable person. The law states that "the person wanting to educate a young apprentice must prove that he has an ethical way of living and the civic qualities of a good citizen".&lt;ref&gt;Antrag auf Anerkennung als Lehrherr und Lehrbetrieb in der Landwritschaft; Land- und forstwirtschaftliche Fachausabildungsstelle Vorarlberg&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Czech Republic, the term "vocational school" (učiliště) can refer to the two, three or four years of secondary practical education. Apprenticeship Training is implemented under Education Act (školský zákon). Apprentices spend about 30–60% of their time in companies (sociální partneři školy) and the rest in formal education. Depending on the profession, they may work for two to three days a week in the company and then spend two or three days at a vocational school.

===Switzerland===
{{See also|Education in Switzerland|Vocational education#Switzerland}}

In Switzerland, after the end of compulsory schooling, two thirds of young people follow a vocational training&lt;ref name=Dubouloz&gt;{{fr}} Catherine Dubouloz, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/suisse-pays-lapprentissage "La Suisse, pays de l’apprentissage"], ''[[Le temps]]'', 27 December 2016 (page visited on 20 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;. Ninety percent of them are in the [[dual education system]]&lt;ref name=Dubouloz/&gt;.

Switzerland has an apprenticeship similarly to Germany and Austria. The educational system is ternar, which is basically [[dual education system]] with mandatory practical courses. The length of an apprenticeship can be 2, 3 or 4 years.

====Length====
Apprenticeships with a length of 2 years are for persons with weaker school results. The certificate awarded after successfully completing a 2-year apprenticeship is called "Eidgenössisches Berufsattest" (EBA) in German and "Certificato federale di formazione pratica" (CFP) in Italian.

Apprenticeship with a length of 3 or 4 years are the most common ones. The certificate awarded after successfully completing a 3 or 4-year apprenticeship is called "Certificat Fédérale de Capacité" ([[:fr:Certificat fédéral de capacité|CFC]]),  "Eidgenössisches Fähigkeitszeugnis" (EFZ) or "Attestato federale di capacità" (AFC).

Some crafts, such as [[electrician]], are educated in lengths of 3 and 4 years. In this case, an Electrician with 4 years apprenticeship gets more theoretical background than one with 3 years apprenticeship. Also, but that is easily lost in translation, the profession has a different name.

Each of the over 300 nationwide defined vocational profiles has defined framework – conditions as length of education, theoretical and practical learning goals and certification conditions.

====Age of the apprentices====
Typically an apprenticeship is started at age of 15 and 18 after finishing general education. Some apprenticeships have a recommend or required age of 18, which obviously leads to a higher average age. There is formally no maximum age, however, for persons above 21 it is hard to find a company due to companies preferring younger ages due to the lower cost of labour.

===Canada===
[[File:Red Seal Certification 196VI.png|thumb|upright=0.45|Canadian Inter-provincial 'Red Seal' certification (note that license number was replaced with the word 'CANOE').]]In Canada, each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] has its own apprenticeship program, which may be the only route into jobs within [[compulsory trade]]s.  In Canada, apprenticeships tend to be formalized for craft trades and technician level qualifications.  At the completion of the provincial exam, they may write the [[Inter-provincial Standards|Provincial Standard]] exam.  British Columbia is one province that uses these exams as the provincial exam. This means a qualification for the province will satisfy the whole country.  The inter-provincial exam questions are agreed upon by all provinces of the time.  At the time there were only four (4) provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada East ( now Ontario ), and Canada West ( now Quebec).

===France===
In France, apprenticeships also developed between the ninth and thirteenth centuries, with [[guild]]s structured around apprentices, [[Journeyman|journeymen]] and [[master craftsman|master craftsmen]], continuing in this way until 1791, when the guilds were suppressed.

The first laws regarding apprenticeships were passed in 1851. From 1919, young people had to take 150 hours of theory and general lessons in their subject a year. This minimum training time rose to 360 hours a year in 1961, then 400 in 1986.

The first training centres for apprentices (''centres de formation d'apprentis'', CFAs) appeared in 1961, and in 1971 apprenticeships were legally made part of professional training. In 1986 the age limit for beginning an apprenticeship was raised from 20 to 25. From 1987 the range of qualifications achieveable through an apprenticeship was widened to include the ''brevet professionnel'' (certificate of vocational aptitude), the ''[[Baccalauréat|bac]] professionnel'' (vocational baccalaureate diploma), the ''brevet de technicien supérieur'' (advanced technician's certificate), engineering diplomas, master's degree and more.

On January 18, 2005, President [[Jacques Chirac]] announced the introduction of a law on a programme for social cohesion comprising the three pillars of employment, housing and equal opportunities. The French government pledged to further develop apprenticeship as a path to success at school and to employment, based on its success: in 2005, 80% of young French people who had completed an apprenticeship entered employment. In France, the term apprenticeship often denotes manual labor but it also includes other jobs like secretary, manager, engineer, shop assistant... The plan aimed to raise the number of apprentices from 365,000 in 2005 to 500,000 in 2009. To achieve this aim, the government is, for example, granting tax relief for companies when they take on apprentices. (Since 1925 a tax has been levied to pay for apprenticeships.) The minister in charge of the campaign, [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], also hoped to improve the image of apprenticeships with an information campaign, as they are often connected with academic failure at school and an ability to grasp only practical skills and not theory. After the [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest end of 2005]], the government, led by prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], announced a new law. Dubbed "law on equality of chances", it created the [[First Employment Contract]] as well as manual apprenticeship from as early as 14 years of age. From this age, students are allowed to quit the compulsory school system in order to quickly learn a vocation. This measure has long been a policy of conservative French political parties, and was met by [[2006 labor protests in France|tough opposition from trade unions and students]].

===Germany===
[[File:Kaminfegerausbildung-2008 09 10 038.jpg|thumb|A [[modern chimney cleaning|master chimney sweep]] and apprentice in 2008]]

Apprenticeships are part of Germany's [[dual education system]], and as such form an integral part of many people's working life. Finding employment without having completed an apprenticeship is almost impossible. For some particular technical university professions, such as [[food technology]], a completed apprenticeship is often recommended; for some, such as [[Engine department (ship)|marine engineering]] it may even be mandatory.

In Germany, there are 342 recognized trades (''Ausbildungsberufe'') where an apprenticeship can be completed. They include for example doctor's [[Physician assistant|assistant]], banker, dispensing [[optician]], plumber or oven builder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany) | authorlink = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany) | title = BMWi – Ausbildungsberufe | work = german language | url = http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Ausbildung-und-Beruf/ausbildungsberufe.html | accessdate = 2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220182332/http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Ausbildung-und-Beruf/ausbildungsberufe.html| archivedate= 20 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual system means that apprentices spend about 50–70% of their time in companies and the rest in formal education. Depending on the profession, they may work for three to four days a week in the company and then spend one or two days at a [[vocational school]] (''Berufsschule''). This is usually the case for trade and craftspeople. For other professions, usually which require more theoretical learning, the working and school times take place blockwise e.g., in a 12–18 weeks interval. These ''Berufsschulen'' have been part of the education system since the 19th century.

In 2001, two-thirds of young people aged under 22 began an apprenticeship, and 78% of them completed it, meaning that approximately 51% of all young people under 22 have completed an apprenticeship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} One in three companies offered apprenticeships in 2003,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} in 2004 the government signed a pledge with [[industrial union]]s that all companies except very small ones must take on apprentices.

The latent decrease of the German population due to low [[birth rate]]s is now causing a lack of young people available to start an apprenticeship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====Apprenticeship after general education====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G0925-0036-001, Chemiefaserwerk Guben, Meister der Zentralwerkstatt.jpg|thumb|A master discusses a vacuum compressor with his apprentice (front left) and several other craftsmen]]
[[File:Gesellen1.jpg|thumb|German journeymen during [[journeyman years]] in traditional costume]]

After graduation from school at the age of fifteen to nineteen (depending on type of school), students start an apprenticeship in their chosen professions. [[Realschule]] and [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] graduates usually have better chances for being accepted as an apprentice for sophisticated craft professions or apprenticeships in white-collar jobs in finance or administration. An apprenticeship takes between 2.5 and 3.5 years. Originally, at the beginning of the 20th century, less than 1% of German students attended the Gymnasium (the 8–9 year university-preparatory school) to obtain the Abitur graduation which was the only way to university back then. In the 1950s still only 5% of German youngsters entered university and in 1960 only 6% did. Due to the risen social wealth and the increased demand for academic professionals in Germany, about 24% of the youngsters entered college/university in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hadjar, Rolf Becker: "Die Bildungsexpansion: Erwartete und unerwartete Folgen. 2006. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften; p. 32/33&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, who did not enter university many started an apprenticeship. The apprenticeships usually end a person's education by age 18–20, but also older apprentices are accepted by the employers under certain conditions. This is frequently the case for immigrants from countries without a compatible professional training system.

====History====
In 1969, a law (the ''Berufsbildungsgesetz'') was passed which regulated and unified the vocational training system and codified the shared responsibility of the state, the unions, associations and the chambers of trade and industry. The dual system was successful in both parts of the divided Germany. In the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]], three-quarters of the working population had completed apprenticeships.

====Business and administrative professions====
The precise skills and theory taught on German apprenticeships are strictly regulated. The employer is responsible for the entire education programme coordinated by the German [[chamber of commerce]]. Apprentices obtain a special apprenticeship contract until the end of the education programme. During the programme it is not allowed to assign the apprentice to regular employment and he is well protected from abrupt dismissal until the programme ends. The defined content and skill set of the apprentice profession must be fully provided and taught by the employer. The time taken is also regulated. Each profession takes a different time, usually between 24 and 36 months.

Thus, everyone who had completed an apprenticeship e.g., as an industrial manager (''Industriekaufmann'') has learned the same skills and has attended the same courses in [[procurement]] and stocking up, [[control (management)|controlling]], [[Human resources|staffing]], [[accounting]] procedures, [[production planning]], [[terms of trade]] and transport [[logistics]] and various other subjects.
Someone who has not taken this apprenticeship or did not pass the final examinations at the chamber of industry and commerce is not allowed to call himself an ''Industriekaufmann''. Most job titles are legally standardized and restricted. An employment in such function in any company would require this completed degree.

====Trade and craft professions====
The rules and laws for the trade and craftwork apprentices such as [[mechanic]]s, [[bakery|bakers]], [[joiner]]s, etc. are as strict as and even broader than for the business professions. The involved procedures, titles and traditions still strongly reflect the [[medieval]] origin of the system. Here, the average duration is about 36 months, some specialized crafts even take up to 42 months.

After completion of the dual education, e.g., a baker is allowed to call himself a bakery [[journeyman]] (''Bäckergeselle''). After the apprenticeship the journeyman can enter the master's school (''Meisterschule'') and continue his education at evening courses for 3–4 years or full-time for about one year. The graduation from the master's school leads to the title of a [[master craftsman]] (''Meister'') of his profession, so e.g., a bakery master is entitled as ''Bäckermeister''. A master is officially entered in the local trade register, the craftspeople's roll (''Handwerksrolle''). A master craftsman is allowed to employ and to train new apprentices. In some mostly safety-related professions, e.g., that of [[electrician]]s only a master is allowed to found his own company.

====License for educating apprentices====
To employ and to educate apprentices requires a specific license. The AdA – ''Ausbildung der Ausbilder'' – "Education of the Educators" license needs to be acquired by a training at the chamber of industry and commerce.

The masters complete this license course within their own master's coursework. The training and examination of new masters is only possible for masters who have been working several years in their profession and who have been accepted by the chambers as a trainer and examiner.

Academic professionals, e.g., [[engineer]]s, seeking this license need to complete the AdA during or after their university studies, usually by a one-year evening course.

The holder of the license is only allowed to train apprentices within his own field of expertise. For example, a [[mechanical engineer]] would be able to educate industrial mechanics, but not e.g., laboratory assistants or civil builders.

====After the apprenticeship of trade and craft professions====
When the apprenticeship is ended, the former apprentice now is considered a [[journeyman]]. He may choose to go on his [[journeyman years]]-travels.

===India===
In India, the Apprentices Act was enacted in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apprenticeshiptraining.gov.in/Act1961.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507061446/http://apprenticeshiptraining.gov.in/Act1961.htm |archivedate=2009-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates the programme of training of apprentices in the industry so as to conform to the syllabi, period of training etc. as laid down by the Central Apprenticeship Council and to utilise fully the facilities available in industry for imparting practical training with a view to meeting the requirements of skilled manpower for industry.

The Apprentices Act enacted in 1961 and was implemented effectively in 1962. Initially, the Act envisaged training of trade apprentices.  The Act was amended in 1973 to include training of graduate and diploma engineers as "Graduate" &amp; "Technician" Apprentices. The Act was further amended in 1986 to bring within its purview the training of the 10+2 vocational stream as "Technician (Vocational)" Apprentices.

====Responsibility of implementing Apprentices Act====
Overall responsibility is with the Directorate General of Employment &amp; Training (DGE&amp;T) in the Union [[Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dget.nic.in/content/innerpage/apprenticeship-training-scheme-ats.php Apprenticeship Training Scheme (ATS)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024105039/http://www.dget.nic.in/content/innerpage/apprenticeship-training-scheme-ats.php |date=October 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Apprenticeship Training is implemented under a National Apprenticeship Ordinance 1962 and Apprenticeship Rules 1966. It regulates apprenticeship programs in industry and a TVET institute for theoretical instructions. It is obligatory for industry having fifty or more workers in an apprenticeable trade to operate apprenticeship training in the industry. Entire cost of training is borne by industry including wages to apprentices. The provincial governments through Technical Education &amp; Vocational Training Authorities (Punjab TEVTA, Sindh TEVTA, KP TEVTA, Balochistan TEVTA and AJK TEVTA) enforce implementation of apprenticeship.

The training period varies for different trades ranging from 1–4 years. As of 2015, more than 30,000 apprentices are being trained in 2,751 industries in 276 trades across Pakistan. This figure constitutes less than 10% of institution based Vocational Training i.e. more than 350 thousand annually.

Recently, Government of Pakistan through National Vocational &amp; Technical Training Commission ([http://navttc.org NAVTTC]) has initiated to reform existing system of apprenticeship. Highlights of the modern apprenticeship system are:

- Inclusion of services, agriculture and mining sector
- Cost sharing by Industry and Government
- Regulating and formalizing Informal Apprenticeships
- Mainstream Apprenticeship Qualifications with National Vocational Qualifications Framework (Pakistan NVQF)
- Increased participation of Female
- Training Cost reimbursement (for those industries training more number of apprentices than the required)
- Assessment and Certification of apprentices jointly by Industry – Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry – Government
- Apprenticeship Management Committee (having representation of 40% employers, 20% workers and 40% Government officials)

===Turkey===
In Turkey, apprenticeship has been part of the small business culture for centuries since the time of [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] who claimed Anatolia as their homeland in the 11th century.

There are three levels of apprenticeship. The first level is the apprentice, i.e., the "çırak" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The second level is pre-master which is called, "kalfa" in Turkish. The mastery level is called as "usta" and is the highest level of achievement. An 'usta' is eligible to take in and accept new 'ciraks' to train and bring them up. The training process usually starts when the small boy is of age 10–11 and becomes a full-grown master at the age of 20–25. Many years of hard work and disciplining under the authority of the master is the key to the young apprentice's education and learning process.

In Turkey today there are many vocational schools that train children to gain skills to learn a new profession. The student after graduation looks for a job at the nearest local marketplace usually under the authority of a master.

===United Kingdom===

====Early history====
Apprenticeships have a long tradition in the [[United Kingdom]], dating back to around the 12th century and flourishing by the 14th century. The parents or guardians of a minor would agree with a [[master craftsman]] or tradesman the conditions for an apprenticeship. This contract would then bind the youth for 5–9 years (e.g., from age 14 to 21). Apprentice's families would sometimes pay a "premium" or fee to the craftsman and the contract would usually be recorded in a written [[indenture]].&lt;ref name="Aldrich1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aldrich |first=Richard |title=Lessons from History of Education |origyear=1997 in A. Heikkinen and R. Sultana (eds), Vocational Education and Apprenticeships in Europe |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9lGp9Tad5-QC&amp;dq=apprentice+twelfth+century |accessdate=2008-06-15 |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-35892-2 |pages=195–205 |chapter=13 – Apprenticeships in England}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern apprenticeships range from craft to high status in professional practice in engineering, law, accounting, architecture, management consulting, and others.

In towns and cities with guilds, apprenticeship would often be subject to guild regulation, setting minimum terms of service, or limiting the number of apprentices that a master could train at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Patrick|date=September 2008|title=Apprenticeship and Training in Premodern England|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=68|pages=832–861|doi=10.1017/S002205070800065X|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds also often kept records of who became an apprentice, and this would often provide a qualification for later becoming a freeman of a guild or a citizen of a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Commonwealth: Citizens and Freemen in Early Modern England|last=Withington|first=Phil|publisher=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many youths would train in villages or communities that lacked guilds, however, so avoiding the impact of these regulations.

In the 16th century, the payment of a "premium" to the master was not at all common, but such fees became relatively common by the end of the 17th century, though they varied greatly from trade to trade. The payment of a one-off fee could be very difficult for some parents, limiting who was able to undertake apprenticeships. In the 18th-century, apprenticeship premiums were taxed, and the registers of the Stamp Duty that recorded tax payments mostly survive, showing that roughly one in ten teenage males served an apprenticeship for which they paid fees, and that the majority paid five to ten pounds to their master.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minns|first=Chris|last2=Wallis|first2=Patrick|date=July 2013|title=The price of human capital in a pre-industrial economy: Premiums and apprenticeship contracts in 18th century England|url=|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=50|pages=335–350|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2013.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory no wage had to be paid to an apprentice since the technical training was provided in return for the labour given, and wages were illegal in some cities, such as London. However, it was usual to pay small sums to apprentices, sometimes with which to buy, or instead of, new clothes. By the 18th century regular payments, at least in the last two or three years of the apprentice's term, became usual and those who lived apart from their masters were frequently paid a regular wage. This was sometimes called the "half-pay" system or "colting", payments being made weekly or monthly to the apprentice or to his parents. In these cases, the apprentice often went home from Saturday night to Monday morning. This was the norm in the 19th century but this system had existed in some trades since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Apprenticeship in England"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Apprenticeship_in_England|title=Apprenticeship in England – Learn – FamilySearch.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1563, the [[Statute of Artificers 1562|Statute of Artificers and Apprentices]] was passed to regulate and protect the apprenticeship system, forbidding anyone from practising a trade or craft without first serving a 7-year period as an apprentice to a master&lt;ref name="NA_FamilyHistory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/familyhistory/guide/trade/apprentices.htm |title= Research, education &amp; online exhibitions &gt; Family history &gt; In depth guide to family history &gt; People at work &gt; Apprentices |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2008-06-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080727032828/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/familyhistory/guide/trade/apprentices.htm| archivedate= 27 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though in practice Freemen's sons could negotiate shorter terms).&lt;ref name="Dunlop1912"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunlop |first=O.

From 1601, '[[parish]]' apprenticeships under the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Elizabethan Poor Law]] came to be used as a way of providing for poor, illegitimate and orphaned children of both sexes alongside the regular system of skilled apprenticeships, which tended to provide for boys from slightly more affluent backgrounds. These parish apprenticeships, which could be created with the assent of two [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]], supplied apprentices for occupations of lower status such as farm labouring, brickmaking and menial household service.&lt;ref name="Aldrich1997" /&gt;

In the early years of the [[Industrial Revolution]] entrepreneurs began to resist the restrictions of the apprenticeship system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|last=Langford|first=Paul|publisher=OUP|year=1984|isbn=0-19-822684-5|editor=Kenneth O.

====System introduced in 1964====
The mainstay of training in industry has been the apprenticeship system (combining academic and practice), and the main concern has been to avoid skill shortages in traditionally skilled occupations and higher technician and engineering professionals, e.g., through the UK Industry Training Boards (ITBs) set up under the 1964 Act. The aims were to ensure an adequate supply of training at all levels; to improve the quality and quantity of training; and to share the costs of training among employers. The ITBs were empowered to publish training recommendations, which contained full details of the tasks to be learned, the syllabus to be followed, the standards to be reached and vocational courses to be followed. These were often accompanied by training manuals, which were in effect practitioners' guides to apprentice training, and some ITBs provide training in their own centres. The ITBs did much to formalise what could have been a haphazard training experience and greatly improved its quality. The years from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s saw the highest levels of apprentice recruitment, yet even so, out of a school leaving cohort of about 750,000, only about 110,000 (mostly boys) became apprentices. The apprenticeship system aimed at highly developed craft and higher technician skills for an elite minority of the workforce, the majority of whom were trained in industries that declined rapidly from 1973 onwards, and by the 1980s it was clear that in manufacturing this decline was permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haxby and David Parkes. "Apprenticeship in the United Kingdom: From ITBs to YTS". ''European Journal of Education'', Vol. 24, No. 2 (1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;167–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the UK high technology industry (Aerospace, Nuclear, Oil &amp; Gas, Automotive, Telecommunications, Power Generation and Distribution etc.) trained its higher technicians and professional engineers via the traditional indentured apprenticeship system of learning – usually a 4–6 year process from age 16–21. There were 4 types of traditional apprenticeship: craft, technician, higher technician, and graduate.  Craft, technician and higher technician apprenticeships usually took 4 to 5 years while a graduate apprenticeship was a short 2-year experience usually while at university or post graduate experience.  Non-graduate technician apprenticeships were often referred to as "technical apprenticeships". The traditional apprenticeship framework in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was designed to allow young people (from 16 years old) an alternative path to A Levels to achieve both an academic qualification (equivalent to today's level 4 or 5 NVQs) and competency-based skills for [[knowledge worker|knowledge work]]. Often referred to as the "Golden Age" of work and employment for bright young people, the traditional technical apprenticeship framework was open to young people who had a minimum of 4 O Levels to enroll in an Ordinary National Certificate or Diploma (ONC, OND) or a City &amp; Guilds engineering technician course. Apprentices could progress to the [[Higher National Certificate]], [[Higher National Diploma]] (HNC, HND) or advanced [[City and Guilds]] course such as Full Technological Certification. Apprenticeship positions at elite companies often had hundreds of applications for a placement. Academic learning during an apprenticeship was achieved either via block release or day release at a local technical institute. An OND or HND was usually obtained via the block release approach whereby an apprentice would be released for periods of up to 3 months to study academic courses full-time and then return to the employer for applied work experience. For entrance into the higher technical engineering apprenticeships, O Levels had to include Mathematics, Physics, and English language. The academic level of subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry on ONC/OND, and some City &amp; Guilds advanced technician courses, was equivalent to A level mathematics, physics and chemistry. The academic science subjects were based on applied science in subjects such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mechanics of machines, dynamics and statics, electrical science and electronics.  These are often referred to as the engineering sciences. HNC and HND were broadly equivalent to subjects in the first year of a bachelor's degree in engineering but not studied to the same intensity or mathematical depth. HNC was accepted as entrance into the first year of an engineering degree and high performance on an HND course could allow a student direct entry into the second year of a degree.  Few apprentices followed this path since it would have meant 10–12 years in further and higher education. For the few that did follow this path they accomplished a solid foundation of competency-based work training via apprenticeship and attained a higher academic qualification at a university or Polytechnic combining both forms of education; vocational plus academic. During the 1970s, City and Guilds assumed responsibility for the administration of HNC and HND courses.

The [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] the forerunner of [[Imperial College]] engineering school has been offering vocational education through apprenticeships since the 1870s from basic craft skills (mechanic, hairdresser, chef, plumbing, carpentry, bricklaying, etc.) all the way up to qualifications equivalent to university master's degrees and doctorates. The City and Guilds diploma of fellowship is awarded to individuals who are nationally recognised through peer review as having achieved the very highest level in competency-based achievement. The first award of FCGI was approved by Council in December 1892 and awarded in 1893 to Mr H A Humphrey, Engineering Manager of the Refined Bicarbonate and Crystal Plant Departments of [[Brunner Mond|Brunner, Mond &amp; Co]]. His award was for material improvements in the manufacture of bicarbonate of soda. The system of nomination was administered within Imperial College, with recommendations being passed to the Council of the Institute for approval. About 500–600 people have been awarded Fellowship.

====Traditional framework====
The traditional apprenticeship framework's purpose was to provide a supply of young people seeking to enter work-based learning via apprenticeships by offering structured high-value learning and transferable skills and knowledge. Apprenticeship training was enabled by linking industry with local technical colleges and professional engineering institutions. The apprenticeship framework offered a clear pathway and competency outcomes that addressed the issues facing the industry sector and specific companies. This system was in place since the 1950s. The system provided young people with an alternative to staying in full-time education post- 16/18 to gain purely academic qualifications without work-based learning. The apprenticeship system of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s provided the necessary preparation for young people to qualify as a Craft trade (Machinist, Toolmaker, Fitter, Plumber, Welder, Mechanic, Millwright etc.), or Technician (quality inspector, draughtsman, designer, planner, work study, programmer), or Technician Engineer (tool design, product design, methods, stress and structural analysis, machine design etc.) and enabled a path to a fully qualified Chartered Engineer in a specific discipline (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Aeronautical, Chemical, Building, Structural, Manufacturing etc.). The Chartered Engineer qualification was usually achieved aged 28 and above.  Apprentices undertook a variety of job roles in numerous shop floor and office technical functions to assist the work of master craftsmen, technicians, engineers, and managers in the design, development, manufacture and maintenance of products and production systems.

It was possible for apprentices to progress from national certificates and diplomas to engineering degrees if they had the aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Whalley, "The social production of technical work: the case of British engineers", SUNY Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The system allowed young people to find their level and still achieve milestones along the path from apprenticeship into higher education via a polytechnic or university. Though rare, it was possible for an apprentice to advance from vocational studies, to undergraduate degree, to graduate study and earn a master's degree or a PhD. The system was effective; industry was assured of a supply of practically educated and work-skilled staff, local technical colleges offered industry relevant courses that had a high measure of academic content and an apprentice was prepared for professional life or higher education by the age of 21. With the exception of advanced technology companies particularly in aerospace (BAE systems, Rolls-Royce, Bombardier) this system declined with the decline of general manufacturing industry in the UK.

Traditional apprenticeships reached their lowest point in the 1980s: by that time, training programmes declined.  The exception to this was in the high technology engineering areas of aerospace, chemicals, nuclear, automotive, power and energy systems where apprentices continued to served the structured four- to five-year programmes of both practical and academic study to qualify as [[engineering technician]] or Incorporate Engineer ([[engineering technologist]]) and go on to earn a master of engineering degree and qualify as a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)]]; the UK gold standard engineering qualification.  Engineering technicians and technologists undertook combined theory and practice typically for example at a technical college for one day and two evenings per week on a [[City &amp; Guilds]] programme or [[Ordinary National Certificate]] / [[Higher National Certificate]] course. Becoming a chartered engineer via the apprenticeship route normally involved 10 – 12 years of academic and vocational training at a combination of an employer, college of further education and/or university. In 1986 [[National Vocational Qualification]]s (NVQs) commenced to stem a great fall in [[vocational training]]. By 1990, apprenticeship had reached an approximate low, at {{frac|2|3}} of 1% of total employment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Revitalisation from 1990s onward====
In 1994, the [[Second Major ministry|UK Government]] introduced Modern Apprenticeships (renamed '''Apprenticeships''' in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), based on frameworks today of the [[Sector Skills Councils]]. In 2009, the [[National Apprenticeship Service]] was founded to coordinate apprenticeships in England. Apprenticeship frameworks contain a number of separately certified elements:
*a knowledge-based element, typically certified through a qualification known as a ‘Technical Certificate’ (not mandatory in the Scottish Modern Apprenticeship);
*a competence-based element, typically certified through an NVQ (in Scotland this can be through an SVQ or an alternative competence-based qualification);
*[[Functional Skills]] which are in all cases minimum levels of Mathematics and English attainment and in some cases additionally IT (in Scotland, Core Skills); and
* Employment Rights and Responsibilities (ERR) to show that the Apprentice has had a full induction to the company or training programme, and is aware of those rights and responsibilities that are essential in the workplace; this usually requires the creation of a personal portfolio of activities, reading and instruction sessions, but is not examined.
*A path with parity involving university-only education.

In Scotland, Modern Apprenticeship Frameworks are approved by the Modern Apprenticeship Group (MAG) and it, with the support of the [[Scottish Government]], has determined that from January 2010, all Frameworks submitted to it for approval, must have the mandatory elements credit rated for the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF).

As of 2009, there are over 180 apprenticeship frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notgoingtouni.co.uk/advice/apprenticeships/ |title=What can I do an apprenticeship in? |publisher=NGTU |accessdate=2009-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531012933/http://www.notgoingtouni.co.uk/advice/apprenticeships/ |archivedate=31 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current scheme extends beyond manufacturing and high technology industry to parts of the [[service sector]] with no apprenticeship tradition. In 2008, [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]], the [[Sector Skills Council]], introduced a set of Creative Apprenticeships awarded by EDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nsa-ccskills.co.uk/apprenticeships/|title=Creative Apprenticeships|publisher=Creative &amp; Cultural Skills|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120815130236/http%3A//nsa%2Dccskills.co.uk/what%2Dare%2Dapprenticeships|archivedate=2012-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A freelance apprenticeship framework was also approved and uses freelance professionals to mentor freelance apprentices. The Freelance Apprenticeship was first written and proposed by Karen Akroyd (Access To Music) in 2008. In 2011, Freelance Music Apprenticeships are available in music colleges in Birmingham, Manchester and London. The [[Department for Children, Schools and Families|Department of Education under its 2007–2010 name]] stated their intention to make apprenticeships a "mainstream part of England's [[Education in the United Kingdom|education system]]".&lt;ref name="World Class Apprenticeships"&gt;World Class Apprenticeships. The Government’s strategy for the future of Apprenticeships in England. DIUS/DCSF, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers who offer apprenticeship places have an [[employment contract]] with their apprentices, but off-the-job training and assessment is wholly funded by the state for apprentices aged between 16-18 years. In England, Government only contributes 50% of the cost of training for apprentices aged 19-24 years. Apprenticeships at Level 3 or above for those aged 24 or over no longer receive state funding, although there is a state loan facility in place by which individuals or companies can cover the cost of study and assessment and repay the state by installments over an extended period at preferential rates of interest.

Government funding agencies (in England, the [[Skills Funding Agency]]) contract with "learning providers" to deliver apprenticeships, and may accredit them as a National Skills Academy. These organisations provide off-the-job tuition and manage the bureaucratic workload associated with the apprenticeships. Providers are usually private training companies but might also be [[further education]] colleges, [[voluntary sector]] organisations, [[Chambers of Commerce]] or employers themselves.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=February 2018}}

====Structure of apprenticeships in 2000s====
The UK government has implemented a rigorous apprenticeship structure which in many ways resembles the traditional architecture of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. There are three levels of apprenticeship available spanning 2–6 years of progression. It is possible for ambitious apprentices to progress from level 2 (intermediate) to level 7 ( master's degree) over many years of training and education. Learners start at a level which reflects their current qualifications and the opportunities available in the sector of interest:

'''Intermediate Apprenticeship (Level 2; equivalent to five good GCSE passes)''': provides learners with the skills and qualifications for their chosen career and allow entry (if desired) to an Advanced Apprenticeship. To be accepted learners need to be enthusiastic, keen to learn and have a reasonable standard of education; most employers require applicants to have two or more GCSEs (A*-C), including English and Maths.&lt;ref&gt;RateMyApprenticeship, 'Intermediate Apprenticeships' {{cite web|url=https://www.ratemyapprenticeship.co.uk/intermediate-apprenticeships |title=Intermediate Apprenticeships |accessdate=2016-12-12 }} accessed 12 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advanced Apprenticeship (Level 3; equivalent to two A-level passes)''': to start this programme, learners should have five GCSEs (grade A*-C) or have completed an Intermediate Apprenticeship. This will provide them with the skills and qualifications needed for their career and allow entry (if desired) to a Higher Apprenticeship or degree level qualification. Advanced apprenticeships can last between two and four years.&lt;ref&gt;RateMyApprenticeship, 'Advanced Apprenticeships' {{cite web|url=https://www.ratemyapprenticeship.co.uk/advanced-apprenticeships |title=Advanced Apprenticeships |accessdate=2016-11-23 }} accessed 23 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Higher Apprenticeship (Level 4/5; equivalent to a Foundation Degree)''': to start this programme, learners should have a Level 3 qualification (A-Levels, Advanced Diploma or International Baccalaureate) or have completed an Advanced Apprenticeship. Higher apprenticeships are designed for students who are aged 18 or over.&lt;ref&gt;RateMyApprenticeship, 'Higher Apprenticeships' {{cite web|url=https://www.ratemyapprenticeship.co.uk/higher-apprenticeships |title=Higher Apprenticeships |accessdate=2016-11-23 }} accessed 23 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Degree Apprenticeship (Level 5/6; achieve bachelor's degree)''' and '''(Level 7 Masters)''': to start this programme, learners should have a level 3/4 qualification (A-Levels, Advanced Diploma or International Baccalaureate) relevant to occupation or have completed an Advanced Apprenticeship also relevant to occupation. It differs from a 'Higher Apprenticeship' due to graduating with a bachelor's degree at an accredited university. Degree apprenticeships can last between two and four years.&lt;ref&gt;RateMyApprenticeship, 'Degree Apprenticeships' {{cite web|url=https://www.ratemyapprenticeship.co.uk/degree-apprenticeships |title=Degree Apprenticeships |accessdate=2016-11-23 }} accessed 23 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current UK system, commencing from 2013, groups of employers ('trailblazers') develop new apprenticeships, working together to design apprenticeship standards and assessment approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and [[Department for Education]], 'Future of apprenticeships in England: guidance for trailblazers', accessed 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As at July 2015, there were 140 Trailblazer employer groups which had so far collectively delivered or were in the process of delivering over 350 apprenticeship standards.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government, 'The Future of Apprenticeships in England' {{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447413/BIS-15-355-guidance-for-trailblazers-standards-to-starts-July-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010132848/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447413/BIS-15-355-guidance-for-trailblazers-standards-to-starts-July-2015.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-10 |df= }} accessed 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2017 an [[Apprenticeship Levy]] has been in place to fund apprenticeships. Many UK public bodies are subject to a statutory target to employ an average of at least 2.3% of their staff as new start apprentices over the period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2021, and to "have regard" to this target when planning their recruitment and career development activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/public-sector-apprenticeship-targets Public sector apprenticeship targets], accessed 21 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Institute for apprenticeships IFA set out a new Apprenticeship standards development process as part of the ‘faster and better’ campaign. This campaign was launched after calls from trailer blazer to simplify the system. Johnathan Mitchell - IFA Deputy Director (Standards Development) set out the changes to the standards development process which includes a restructure and refresh of all forms and templates. In addition to new guidance, new intense workshops and generally more support to trailblazers. &lt;ref&gt;Paragon Skills, 'Apprenticeships Standards' {{cite web|url=https://paragonskills.co.uk/about-us/news/2018/june/apprenticeship-standards-development-faster-and-better-in-2018/ |title=Apprenticeships Standards |accessdate=2018-06-13 }} accessed 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Apprenticeship programs in the United States are regulated by the [[Smith–Hughes Act]] (1917), The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (1933), and [[National Apprenticeship Act]], also known as the "Fitzgerald Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/|title=UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR|work=U.S. Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of American apprentices has increased from 375,000 in 2014 to 500,000 in 2016, while the federal government intends to see 750,000 by 2019, particularly by expanding the apprenticeship model to include [[White-collar worker|white-collar occupations]] such as [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Educational regime====
{{Main article|School-to-work transition}}
:''See also [[standards based education reform]]'' which eliminates different standards for vocational or academic tracks

[[File:Apprenticeship.jpg|thumb|right|A shoe repairman and his young apprentice.]]

In the United States, education officials and nonprofit organizations who seek to emulate the apprenticeship system in other nations have created [[school to work]] education reforms. They seek to link academic education to careers. Some programs include [[job shadowing]], watching a real worker for a short period of time, or actually spending significant time at a job at no or reduced pay that would otherwise be spent in academic classes or working at a local business. Some legislators raised the issue of child labor laws for unpaid labor or jobs with hazards.

In the United States, [[school to work]] programs usually occur only in high school. American high schools were introduced in the early 20th century to educate students of all ability and interests in one learning community rather than prepare a small number for college. Traditionally, American students are tracked within a wide choice of courses based on ability, with vocational courses (such as auto repair and carpentry) tending to be at the lower end of academic ability and trigonometry and pre-calculus at the upper end.

American education reformers have sought to end such [[Tracking (education)|tracking]], which is seen as a barrier to opportunity. By contrast, the system studied by the [[NCEE]] (National Center on Education and the Economy) actually relies much more heavily on tracking. Education officials in the U.S., based largely on school redesign proposals by NCEE and other organizations, have chosen to use [[criterion-referenced test]]s that define one high standard that must be achieved by all students to receive a uniform diploma. American education policy under the "[[No Child Left Behind Act]]" has as an official goal the elimination of the [[achievement gap]] between populations. This has often led to the need for remedial classes in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saisd.net/Mission_Statement/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210090455/http://www.saisd.net/Mission_Statement/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-10 |df= }} SAISD Fundamental Beliefs: Excellence and equity in student performance are achievable for all students.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. states now require passing a [[high school graduation examination]] to ensure that students across all ethnic, gender and income groups possess the same skills. In states such as Washington, critics have questioned whether this ensures success for all or just creates massive failure (as only half of all 10th graders have demonstrated they can meet the standards).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=wasl09m&amp;date=20060909&amp;source=st Seattle Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027171345/http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=wasl09m&amp;date=20060909&amp;source=st |date=October 27, 2007 }}, September 09, 2006 "WASL results show strong gains, puzzling declines across the state" By Linda Shaw&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction industry is perhaps the heaviest user of apprenticeship programs in the United States, with the US Department of Labor reporting 74,164 new apprentices accepted in 2007 at the height of the construction boom. Most of these apprentices participated in what are called "joint" apprenticeship programs, administered jointly by construction employers and construction labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Construction Chart Book: The US Construction Industry and its Workers|url=http://www.cpwr.com/sites/default/files/publications/CB%20page%2031.pdf|publisher=CPWR|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[International Union of Painters and Allied Trades]] (IUPAT) has opened the Finishing Trades Institute (FTI). The FTI is working towards national accreditation so that it may offer associate and bachelor's degrees that integrate academics with a more traditional apprentice programs. The IUPAT has joined forces with the Professional Decorative Painters Association (PDPA) to build educational standards using a model of apprenticeship created by the PDPA.

====Examples of programs====
Persons interested in learning to become electricians can join one of several apprenticeship programs offered jointly by the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]] and the [[National Electrical Contractors Association]]. No background in electrical work is required. A minimum age of 18 is required. There is no maximum age. Men and women are equally invited to participate. The organization in charge of the program is called the [[National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee]] [http://njatc.org].

Apprentice electricians work 32 to 40+ hours per week at the trade under the supervision of a journeyman wireman and receive pay and benefits. They spend an additional 8 hours every other week in classroom training. At the conclusion of training (five years for inside wireman and outside lineman, less for telecommunications), apprentices reach the level of journeyman wireman. All of this is offered at no charge, except for the cost of books (which is approximately $200–600 per year), depending on grades. Persons completing this program are considered highly skilled by employers and command high pay and benefits. Other unions such as the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, United Association of Plumbers, Fitters, Welders and HVAC Service Techs, Operating Engineers, [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|Ironworkers]], [[Sheet Metal Workers International Association|Sheet Metal Workers]], [[International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers|Plasterers]], [[International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers|Bricklayers]] and others offer similar programs.

Trade associations such as the [[Independent Electrical Contractors]] and [[Associated Builders and Contractors]] also offer a variety of apprentice training programs. Registered programs also are offered by the
[http://ajactraining.org Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee (AJAC)] to fill a shortage of aerospace and advanced manufacturing workers in Washington State.

For FDA-regulated industries such as [[Food industry|food]], [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceuticals]], medical devices, [[nutraceutical]]s and [[Cosmeceutical|cosemecuticals]], companies may offer apprenticeships in [[Quality assurance|Quality Assurance]], [[Quality control|Quality Control]], [[Medical science liaison|Medical Affairs (MSLs)]], [[Clinical trial|Clinical Trials]], or [[Regulatory affairs|Regulatory Affairs]]. Apprentices may be placed at a host company and must continue to work toward an industry certification such as those offered by ASQ or RAPS while they remain in the apprenticeship. The costs of training and mentorship can be covered by the program and apprentices receive full pay and benefits.

====Example of a professional apprenticeship====
A modified form of apprenticeship is required for before an engineer is licensed as a [[Professional Engineer]] in any of the states of the United States. In the United States, regulation of professional engineering licenses is the right and responsibility of the [[federated state]]. That is, each of the 50 states sets its own licensing requirements and issues (and, if needed, revokes) licenses to practice engineering in that state.

Although the requirements can vary slightly from state to state, in general to obtain a Professional Engineering License in a given state, one must graduate with Bachelor of Science in Engineering from an accredited college or university, pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam]], which designates the title of [[Engineer in Training|Engineer in Training (EIT)]], work in that discipline for at least four years under a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), and then pass the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam]].  One and two years of experience credit is given for those with qualifying master’s and doctoral degrees, respectively.&lt;ref name="NCEES: The P.E. License"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |title=NCEES: Students |work=NCEES |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063039/http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |archivedate=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the states have reciprocity agreements so that once an individual becomes licensed in one state can also become licensed in other states with relative ease.

====Youth Apprenticeship====
Youth Apprenticeship is promising new strategy to engage youth in career connected learning, encourage high school completion, lower the youth unemployment rate, lower the skills gap and to provide a pipeline for youth into higher education or into industry as qualified workers to fill open positions. 
 
These programs provide high school juniors and seniors with a career and educational pathway into industry. They develop real-world skills, earn competitive wages, and gain high school credits towards graduation and receive tuition free college credits.  Upon completion of the program, the youth apprentices will obtain a journey level certification from the State Department of Labor and Industries, a nationally recognized credential.

Youth apprenticeship has been successfully piloted in a number of states including, Washington, Wisconsin, Colorado, Oregon, North Carolina and South Carolina. In these states, thousands of high school students engage in both classroom technical training and paid structured on-the-job training across a number of high-growth, high-demand industries. In Charlotte, NC several companies, many rooted in Europe, have started joint programs (Apprenticeship Charlotte and Apprenticeship 2000) to jointly further the idea of apprenticeships and close the gap in technical workforce availability.

=== Africa ===
In Liberia, tailor apprenticeships engage with more skilled tailors to learn the craft and the skills that may be taught in more traditional school settings. They learn from master tailors, which gives the apprentices a promised job once their training is completed. 
Apprentices must have a grasp on patterns, measurement, and other math skills. They demonstrate full concept mastery before moving on to the next piece of clothing. Instead of formal testing for evaluation, articles of clothing must meet the quality standards before they can be sold and before the apprentice can begin a new design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Acquisition and the Practice of Understanding|last=Lave|first=Jean|publisher=Institute for Research Learning|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=310–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Analogues at universities and professional development==
The modern concept of an [[internship]] is similar to an apprenticeship but not as rigorous. Universities still use apprenticeship schemes in their production of [[scholar]]s: bachelors are promoted to masters and then produce a [[thesis]] under the oversight of a [[supervisor]] before the corporate body of the [[university]] recognises the achievement of the standard of a [[doctorate]]. Another view of this system is of [[graduate student]]s in the role of apprentices, [[post-doctoral fellow]]s as [[journeyman|journeymen]], and [[professor]]s as [[master tradesman|masters]] .{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In the "Wealth of Nations" Adam Smith states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called universities, which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors, etc., are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient towns [...] As to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master, and to have himself apprenticed in a common trade; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices (words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=Wealth of Nations: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations|date=1776|publisher=W. Strahan and T. Cadell|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGPdfRyy2VoC&amp;lpg=PT133&amp;ots=ua_o_gwYRx&amp;dq=%22all%20such%20incorporations%20were%20anciently%20called%20universities%22&amp;pg=PT133#v=onepage&amp;q=%22all%20such%20incorporations%20were%20anciently%20called%20universities%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also similar to apprenticeships are the [[professional development]] arrangements for new graduates in the professions of [[accountancy]], [[Chartered Engineer|engineering]], [[management consulting]], and the [[solicitors|law]]. A British example was training contracts known as '[[articled clerk|articles of clerkship]]'. The learning curve in modern professional service firms, such as law firms, consultancies or accountancies, generally resembles the traditional master-apprentice model: the newcomer to the firm is assigned to one or several more experienced colleagues (ideally partners in the firm) and learns his skills on the job.

==History==
Ashesi was founded by [[Patrick Awuah]], a Ghanaian who spent over 15 years living and working in the United States. [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] left Ghana in 1985 to attend [[Swarthmore College]] on a full scholarship, after which he worked for [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] as an engineer and a program manager for eight years. Experiencing first hand the dramatic impact that education can have on one's life, [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] embarked on a mission in 1997 to provide greater educational opportunities in [[Ghana]]. He enrolled in business school at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, both to evaluate the feasibility of his goal and to gain managerial skills with which to found and manage a university.

==The Meaning of Ashesi==
 [[File:Ashesi_Todd_&amp;_Ruth_Warren_Library.jpg |frame|The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi|alt=The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi]]
"If there is anything you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."
 
These words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are the inspiration behind the university's name, Ashesi, which means "beginning" in Fante, a native Ghanaian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi History: Meaning of Ashesi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117100304/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi |date=17 November 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility study==
During the summer of 1998, a team of four MBA students from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business travelled to Ghana to conduct extensive market research and evaluate the feasibility of establishing a new university. With the goal of gathering data to provide a foundation for business decisions, the team administered over 3,300 surveys to students and parents; conducted interviews and focus groups with parents, teachers and business leaders; and gathered secondary information from local and international sources. The result was a comprehensive feasibility study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html Early years feasibility study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106021317/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html |date=6 January 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt; analysing Ghanaian tertiary education.

==Ashesi campus==
Set on 100 acres in Berekuso, overlooking Ghana's capital city of Accra, Ashesi’s campus unites traditional Ghanaian design, modern technology and environmental best practices. The  campus has interconnected courtyards, that emphasize a sense of community. The architecture borrows from the Ghanaian vernacular, with echoes of traditional compound houses, as well as elements of traditional Northern dwellings. The natural contours of the site are used in concert with buildings to create exterior gathering spaces throughout campus, as well as ramps that provide wheel chair access to buildings.  Buildings are designed to maximize natural views, light and ventilation.

Ground water is supplemented with harvested rainwater, filtered and treated to provide potable water all year round. A community-scale sewage and organic treatment plant provides environmental and economic benefits by converting waste to biogas for some of the campus’ cooking needs and recycling treated water for landscaping.

==Global Recognition==
On Wednesday 3 May 2018, [[President of the Republic of Ghana]], H.E [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] awarded Ashesi University a Presidential Charter meaning the University will now award degrees to its graduated in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com|title=Akufo-Addo grants Ashesi University Presidential Charter|last=Ibrahim|first=Abubakar|date=3 May 2018|work=Myjoyonline|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashesi, until this year was affiliated to the University of Cape Coast(UCC), Ghana meaning its graduates were awarded a UCC degree.

In 2012, the university was ranked by [[PwC]] as the seventh most respected organisation in Ghana, becoming the first university to make the list. Ashesi's President, Dr. Patrick Awuah, was also ranked the 4th Most Respected CEO in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicle.com.gh/ut-bank-rlg-bosses-outshine-rivals-at-ghanas-most-respected-ceo-awards/ UT Bank, Rlg bosses outshine rivals –at Ghana’s Most Respected CEO awards].

''http://africa.com''. February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been ranked as one of Ghana's 50 Best Places to work (2015), according to a survey by Ghanaian consulting firm Goodman AMC; it was again, the only university on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com/2015/03/top-50-best-places-to-work-in-ghana.html Top 50 Best Places to Work in Ghana]. ''http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[CNN]] shared the story of Ashesi and its founder on its African Voices programme. In the interview, Ashesi's President said: "If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students. I hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical. If that happens, it will change the continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/world/africa/patrick-awuah-ashesi-ghana/ Millionaire who quit Microsoft to educate Africa's future leaders]. ''http://cnn.com''. May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ashesi's President was ranked by [[Fortune (magazine)]] as one of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders, together with the likes of [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates]], [[Pope Francis]] and founder of [[Amazon.com]], [[Jeff Bezos]]. The list according to Forbes, was made up of men and women who "in an era that feels starved for leadership, will inspire you—some famous, others little known, all of them energizing their followers and making the world better." &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/03/20/worlds-50-greatest-leaders/ The World's 50 Greatest Leaders: 2015]. ''http://fortune.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the [https://www.wise-qatar.org/2017-wise-prize-education-patrick-awuah World Innovation Summit in Education Prize], one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

He is a member of the [[Royal Physiographic Society in Lund]], an academy of sciences founded in 1792, is a Knight of the [[Royal Order of Vasa]], Sweden, as well as of the [[Order of the White Rose of Finland]].&lt;ref name="distance-educator.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distance-educator.com/introduction-to-distance-education-theorists-and-theories-borje-holmberg/|title=Introduction to Distance Education: Theorists and Theories: Börje Holmberg|work=distance-educator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eden-online.org/contents/conferences/research/barcelona/Holmberg.pdf |title=Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.(multi) Börje Holmberg |date=7 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203130543/http://www.eden-online.org/contents/conferences/research/barcelona/Holmberg.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Holmberg studied English, German, Romance Languages and Education at the [[University of Lund]] and later went on to earn his doctorate in 1956. Holmberg worked in the field of distance education at {{Interlanguage link multi|Hermods|sv|3=Hermods AB}} in Sweden for over 19 years. He held the position of Education Director from 1956 to 1965. In 1966 he was appointed was appointed Director General of [[Hermods Foundation]] up till his resignation in 1975.

In 1976, Holmberg became Professor of Distance Education Methodology and Director of the Institute for Distance Education Research at the [[FernUniversität]] in [[Hagen, Germany]]. During his tenure there Holmberg published several books and made contributions to scholarly journals and papers. Among his works is ''Theory and Practice of Distance Education'', a second and revised edition of which was published by [[Routledge]] in 1990.

In 1995 he became Planning President of the new ''Private FernFachhochschule Darmstadt'' (Distance Polytechnic, now {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule|de}}) in [[Darmstadt]]. After his retirement from the FernUniversität, Holmberg continued contributing both to research and debate on distance education as an active practitioner in the field.

In July 2003, Holmberg joined a project concerned with online teaching and learning initiated by [[Ulrich Bernath]] and [[Eugene Rubin]]. As a member of their team he contributed to the development of the Virtual Seminar for Professional Development in Distance Education, which was successfully conducted in 1997 and 1998 with participants from all over the world. This course became the recommended first core course in the online Master of Distance Education (MDE) program, which is jointly offered by the [[University of Maryland University College]] and the [[Carl von Ossietzky University]] of [[Oldenburg]].

== Research ==
'''Guided Didactic Conversation'''&lt;ref name="distance-educator.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19970813&amp;id=p5xOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HBUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6720,3080748|title=New Straits Times - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sewart, D., Keegan, and B. Holmberg (Eds.), Distance education: International perspectives (pp. 114-122). London: Croom Helm&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.c3l.uni-oldenburg.de/cde/support/readings/holm83.pdf]

Holmberg is primarily known for his theory of personal communication between instructors and learners in distance education. He views distance education as the conversation-like interaction between the student on the one hand and the tutor/counselor of the supporting organization administering the study on the other. The central concepts of his theory are motivation; empathy; non-contiguous communication; learner autonomy and interpersonal communication.

In Holmberg's way of describing how distance educators should communicate with students in order to ensure real learning. He uses the analogy of conversation to describe didactic conversation and derived seven postulates.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg (1995). Theory and practice of distance education. New York, NY: Routhledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided didactic communication includes: [[Simulated conversation]] (one-way, the presentation of materials) and [[Real conversation]] (two-way between tutor and student). Examples of simulated conversation include self-checking exercises, review questions w/ model answers, and inserted questions. In essence, Holmberg believes that by fostering empathy between learning and tutor parties through appropriate one-way and two-way interactions, learners will be motivated and encouraged to engage in their studies. He also holds a general assumption that "real learning is primarily an individual activity and is attained only through an internalizing process." This assumption is one in which theory on distance education can be based. Thus, the goal of his theory is to support individualized learning.

== Books and other publications ==
In his Distance Education in Essence publication as a researcher Holmberg, looked carefully into the character and applications of distance education, and presents a revised version of his much discussed overarching theory. Particular attention is paid to the innovatory character of distance education and the role of technology in today's practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''CITBOK''') is the project sponsored and undertaken by [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS) to define and outline the [[body of knowledge]] that defines a Canadian [[Information Systems Professional]] (ISP).

CIPS recognizes that in order to strengthen the criteria of the ISP designation successfully while still maintaining high standards, the association needs to develop a Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge (CITBOK) that will set standards for knowledge.  The CITBOK is an outline of the knowledge bases that form the intellectual basis for the IT profession.  CIPS has identified a core CITBOK that all professionals would be expected to master and specialty bodies of knowledge that would depend on your area of practice.  When setting this Canadian standard for Information Technology (IT) knowledge, CIPS looked to other organizations and internationally for standards and bodies of knowledge that CIPS could adopt or adapt, especially for the specialty areas.  For example, in 2004, CIPS adopted the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) Professional Examination Study Guide Syllabus Diploma level (Core and 11 specialist modules) as the initial Body of Knowledge for CIPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |title=Moving towards a Canadian IT Body of Knowledge |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230307/http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITBOK aims to:

* be an industry structure model that can be used to define the set of performance, training and development standards for all IT practitioners (CIPS members and non-members) in [[Canada]];
* create alternate paths to certification based on concepts of CITBOK;
* establish guidelines for accreditation criteria based on concepts of CITBOK; and
* create a professional development model that sets the standards criteria for the knowledge base including knowledge, skills, and professional activities for IT practitioners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6870">The '''College of Teacher Education of Nanjing Normal University''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:南京师范大学教师教育学院)&lt;ref name="sina"&gt;http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2005-06-03/10336069590s.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; is one of twenty-three colleges of [[Nanjing Normal University]]. It was proposed in 2005 and came into existence in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njnu.edu.cn/news.aspx?lb=学校概况,内设机构,学院设置&lt;/ref&gt; The college has 10 majors and the total enrolment is on a large scale. 
[[File:College of Teacher Education of Nanjing Normal University.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the College of Teacher Education]][[File:The entrance towards the Faculty of Teachers' Education of Nanjing Normal University.JPG|thumb|the College of Teacher Education of Nanjing Normal University]]
==Introduction==
As the southern [[birthplace]] of China's education of teachers, [[Nanjing Normal University]] has developed into a [[comprehensive university]] with a distinct feature of [[teacher education]]. The title “the southern birthplace of China's education of teachers” given to Nanjing Normal University is intended to honor its long history in [[teacher education]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southcn.com/edu/kejiaobest/200209110485.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Nanjing Normal University]] has a history more than 100&amp;nbsp;years, its predecessor was dating from [[Three Rivers Normal School]] which established in 1902. In this period, many [[celebrities]] were born here. They are the great [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[educator]] [[Tao Xingzhi]], the famous Chinese educator [[Wu Yifang]],the Chinese early childhood [[educationist]] [[Chen Heqin]] the artist [[Xu Beihong]] and so on. To respond to the call of [[China|Chinese]] government and conform to the trend of teacher's professional development in China, the university founded the faculty of Teachers' Education in 2010.

Before the foundation of the faculty, effort had been put into the project. Since the construction programme of the new undergraduate course about the teacher education was put into effort in 2005, an experience on the reformation of "2.5+1.5" developing pattern was conducted, which targeted the normal students of 2007, 2008 and 2009 on campus. When a university is on the “2.5+1.5” developing pattern in China, the university students are expected to learn the basic and general knowledge in the beginning two and half years of university. While in the last one and half years of university, the students will be exposed to specialized and professional subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://job.njnu.edu.cn/detach.portal?.pa=aT1QODc1MTQ4JnQ9ciZzPW1heGltaXplZCZtPXZpZXc%3D&amp;viewaction=viewdetail&amp;fei=840&amp;pagenum=1&amp;level=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041516/http://job.njnu.edu.cn/detach.portal?.pa=aT1QODc1MTQ4JnQ9ciZzPW1heGltaXplZCZtPXZpZXc%3D&amp;viewaction=viewdetail&amp;fei=840&amp;pagenum=1&amp;level=1 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Double-tutors system]] has been set up in the course of graduation design.&lt;ref name="sina"/&gt;

== The faculty today ==
Ten [[academic major]]s have been gathered in the faculty. They are English teaching，chemistry teaching, history teaching, physics teaching, mathematics teaching, Chinese teaching, biology teaching, geography teaching, politics teaching and computer teaching. literally, these [[academic major]]s belong to the faculty of Teachers' Education. Actually, the teacher - training students are also exposed to other relevant professional resources from other colleges in [[Nanjing Normal University]]. For example, the English teaching student will be cultivated by both the College of Teacher Education and [[College of Foreign Languages]] of [[Nanjing Normal University]].&lt;br /&gt;
The faculty today has 112 specialized teachers with 26 professors and 34 [[associate professors]].The [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the faculty is [[Xia Jinwen]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:夏锦文)who is also the vice-president of [[Nanjing Normal University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jsjyxy.njnu.edu.cn/show.aspx?id=158&amp;cid=17 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425204747/http://jsjyxy.njnu.edu.cn/show.aspx?id=158&amp;cid=17 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jsjyxy.njnu.edu.cn/show.aspx?id=171&amp;cid=16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425204833/http://jsjyxy.njnu.edu.cn/show.aspx?id=171&amp;cid=16 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students’ Organizations==
In [[China]], universities provide students with opportunities to challenge and promote their sophisticated abilities in addition to their academic level. In this way, various students’ organizations spring like mushroom. There are four major organizations in this college. They are the [[Students’ Union]], the [[Youth Volunteers Association]], the Youth League general branch and the Mental Weather Station. The four organizations almost cover all the aspects of students’ activities.
=== The Students' Union ===
The leading organization is the [[Students’ Union]], which consists of 8 separate and distinctive departments. It is operated by students themselves for its [[chairman]] is selected from students in the college. To ensure necessary help from the college is available and punctual, a certain teacher acts as a [[supervisor]] to the organization. The organization’s responsibility is to organize varied and extensive activities on the behalf of students.

===Youth League general branch===
As to Youth League general league, it deals with the issues related to the [[Communist Youth League]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. For example, if a student in the Teacher’s College submits an application to join the [[Chinese Communist Party]], then the general branch will inspect the student in a certain period to find whether he or she is qualified or not. Apart from that, to assist the students to accomplish their [[summer social practice]] is what they are working on.
===The Youth Volunteers Association===
Volunteer work is an essential part of university life, so the Youth Volunteers Association is supposed to provide information and opportunities about the available volunteer work, both in school and in society. 
===The Mental Weather Station===
These three organizations mentioned above are customary ones of a college while the Mental Weather Station is set aside from the Students’ Union particularly. This organization caters to the affairs of state that more and more university students are suffering pressure。 In the way, more professional advice and instant help is in touch for the students in the College of Teacher Education whenever needed.

'''Education about the Holocaust''' or Holocaust education refers to efforts, in formal and non-formal settings, to teach about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust (TLH) addresses didactics and learning, under the larger umbrella of education about the Holocaust, which also comprises curricula and textbooks studies. The expression “Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust” is used by the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002480/248071E.pdf|title=Education about the Holocaust and preventing genocide|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100221-2|location=|pages=18, 23–24, 27–28, 30, 38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Holocaust education centers have focused on the genocide committed against Jews by the Nazis, a growing number have expanded their mission and programming to include the murder of other groups by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes, the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian genocide]], the [[Rwandan genocide]], [[Kurdish genocide (disambiguation)|Kurdish genocide]], [[Croatian Genocide|Croatian genocide]], [[Bosnian genocide]], indigenous genocide due to colonization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas 1492 to the Present|last=Churchill|first=Ward|publisher=City Lights Books|year=1997|isbn=9780872863231|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and other mass exterminations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Bystanders: Educational Leadership for a Humane Culture in a Globalizing Reality|last=Auron|first=Yair|last2=|first2=|publisher=SensePublishers|year=2017|isbn=978-94-6351-026-4|editor-last=Aloni|editor-first=Nimrod|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands|pages=169-180|chapter=The Obligation to Teach About the Holocaust and Genocide, and the Obligation to Educate Against Racism|editor-last2=Weintrob|editor-first2=Lori}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These centers also address [[racism]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], [[Islamophobia]], [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], [[biphobia]], and [[transphobia]].

== Contexts for teaching about the Holocaust ==
Multiple opportunities exist for teaching about the Holocaust. The text that follows explores the role that teaching and learning about the Holocaust can play in three specific contexts: the prevention of genocide, the promotion of human rights and dealing with traumatic pasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== The prevention of genocide ===
To teach about the particularity of the Holocaust is an opportunity to teach about the nature and dynamics of mass atrocity crimes, i.e. [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. The United Nations Framework of Analysis of Atrocity Crimes states “atrocity crimes are considered to be the most serious crimes against humankind. Their status as international crimes is based on the belief that the acts associated with them affect the core dignity of human beings.” From a human perspective, but also from social, political and economic perspectives, the costs and consequences of these crimes are immeasurable and extend far beyond the limits of territories where they were perpetrated. Prevention has, therefore, been identified by the international community as a necessity for international peace and stability. Prevention requires continuous efforts and awareness in both the short and long term at the local, national and global levels. Such measures may include institutional initiatives that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights, ensure a better management of diverse societies and reinforce civil society and independent media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Education about the Holocaust, as well as [[Genocide education|education more broadly about genocide]] and mass atrocities, provides the opportunity to help build critical thinking skills, to augment resilient and effective responses to extreme and exclusionary ideologies, and to illuminate for students how they see themselves in the context of their country’s past, present and future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The promotion of human rights ===
The Holocaust began with abuses of power and gross [[human rights]] violations by [[Nazi Germany]] that over time escalated into war and genocide. While not all human rights violations result in genocide, the Holocaust presents an important case to be explored in a human rights context. The discriminatory policies and practices that dehumanized and marginalized Jews and other minority or political groups (such as depriving individuals of their citizenship) illuminate how human rights violations when combined with factors such as the abuse of power and/or exclusionary ideology can become normalized in a society – even one framed by the rule of law. That these policies escalated over time to a state-sponsored system for murder underlines the dangerous environment that can result when human rights are disavowed. In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the Holocaust, a number of international norms promoting human rights were formulated, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. Examining this outcome represents a crucial phase in understanding the evolution of human rights concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Still, education about the Holocaust and [[human rights education]] are two distinct fields. How educators can create the space for students to examine the history in a manner that respects the tenets of each field requires some thought. A number of organizations have considered these points of intersection, including the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] (FRA), in partnership with [[Yad Vashem]],&lt;ref&gt;European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. 2011. Toolkit on the Holocaust and Human Rights education in the EU. &lt;/ref&gt; and the German Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” (EVZ). Thoughtfully integrating examination of the Holocaust into a human rights framework can be an important dimension of education that promotes critical thinking about the roles and responsibilities of members of society and their leaders in the context of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Eckmann, M. 2015. Is Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust Relevant for Human Rights Education? Gross, Z. and Stevic, E.D. (eds.), ''As the Witnesses Fall Silent: 21st Century Holocaust Education in Curriculum, Policy and Practice'', UNESCO IBE/Springer International, pp. 65-53. &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Dealing with the past ===
Educating about the Holocaust is primarily a duty for European countries, in which considerable segments of societies either collaborated with Nazi Germany or stood by. After an initial period of silence and/or minimization, many countries have developed an understanding of the need to educate about the Holocaust and the obligation to investigate and face their national past. Nevertheless, national, professional or individual responsibilities remain heavily debated within and among countries where the Holocaust took place. Even more than 70 years after the events, a self-critical vision of history that accounts for the range of responsibilities in the murder of Jews and other groups such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] has yet to emerge in many places. Nationalistic ideologies continue to influence the ways in which history is remembered and taught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many post-atrocity communities throughout the world struggle with divided societies. Social cohesion remains fractured and progress is blocked by the country’s refusal to deal with its national history of genocide and mass atrocities and the long-term trauma such crimes cause. This challenge increases when con icting parties or survivors and their tormentors must co-exist in the same society in the aftermaths of atrocity crimes. While some societies opt for an approach of silence, others have found that as a society transitions towards non-violent and humane ways to handle conflict, facing the past can become an important element of the national narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Teaching about a contested history involving atrocities that still affect the present is a particularly challenging task, all the more so because history education is one of the most difficult segments of education systems to reform. Moreover, dealing with the history of past abuses through education often requires a minimal consensus within the society, and therefore institutional support, before new historical narratives accounting for crimes perpetrated can be integrated in curricula and textbooks or tackled by teachers in formal education settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such a process is happening in [[Lithuania]], where the Holocaust and the [[history of the Jews in Lithuania]] has not been taught adequately until fairly recently.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdziunas, Benas.  [http://www.politico.eu/interactive/decades-after-soviet-terror-lithuania-confronts-holocaust/ "Decades after Soviet terror, Lithuania confronts its Holocaust."] ''Politico''.  30 August 2017.  6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educating about genocide ==
{{Main|Genocide education}}

“Genocide education” deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. To date, the Holocaust has been the most researched, documented and widely taught case of genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

[http://www.ihgjlm.com The Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem] established in 1979, believes that it may be the first holocaust education center to address the genocide of all peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihgjlm.com|title=Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem : Taking the side of protecting all human life.|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of holocaust education centers include [[genocide]], intolerance, [[hatred]], and [[human rights]] within their mission, programming, and curriculum.  

== The Holocaust in curricula and textbooks ==
{{Main|The Holocaust in curricula|The Holocaust in textbooks}}The Holocaust in [[Curriculum|curricula]] and [[textbook]]s discusses the ways in which the Holocaust is presented in secondary school level history and social studies [[Curriculum|curricula]] worldwide, and conceptualized and narrated in [[textbook]]s. The status of the Holocaust in curricula and textbooks varies considerably worldwide.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002287/228776e.pdf|title=The International status of education about the Holocaust: a global mapping of textbooks and curricula|last=Carrier|first=Peter|last2=Fuchs|first2=Eckhardt|last3=Messinger|first3=Torben|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100033-1|location=|pages=4, 12, 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curricula and textbooks, in particular those designed for history teaching, provide both a space for the formation of a condensed canon of knowledge which is considered to be relevant to a specific society, and a means by which claims to social legitimacy may be made. The study of curricula and textbooks enables the reconstruction of patterns of perception and interpretation, or the standards and values which hold sway at any given time. Moreover, they offer insights into the variety of ways in which national identities are conceived of and constructed. They are ideal sources for the following reasons:
# Curricula and textbooks strive towards the construction of a socially cohesive understanding of history. They not only determine which historical events are considered relevant and thus worth incorporating into a shared inventory of historical understanding, but also prescribe the interpretative framework in which such events may be classified.
# Textbooks share a relatively homogeneous function across a wide geographical space. They thus meet a prerequisite for the analysis of ways in which concepts of identity change from place to place and of processes of convergence and divergence to which concepts of the Holocaust are subjected.
# Curricula and textbooks continue to provide reasonably reliable points of reference for educators. The complexity of the Holocaust and the sensitivity towards the social and political consequences of this event which continues to be felt in the present day mean that teachers are often uncertain about how they should teach the Holocaust. As a result, curricula and in particular textbooks are held by educators to provide secure sources of information and of methods to which teachers refer on the assumption that they provide accurate content and reliable didactic and methodological guidelines, which have been compiled by experienced historians, educational experts and authors.
# Although television, the [[internet]] and family stories generally represent the primary sources of knowledge about the Holocaust, curricula and textbooks tell the contemporary formation of historical knowledge because they fix in words the conceptual and narrative categories in which events of the past are to be learnt in a given society. One of the central concerns when comparing both curricula and textbooks, is therefore to ensure that linguistic variations be given due attention. The absence of the words ‘Holocaust’ or ‘Shoah’ (or their equivalents in each language), for example, does not mean that this event is not taught, because alternative words or paraphrases may also convey knowledge of the event in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Contribution to Global Citizenship Education (GCED) ==
[[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) aims to develop students to be informed and critically literate, socially connected, respectful of diversity, and ethically responsible and engaged. There exist strong opportunities for aligning education about the Holocaust with the goals of GCED. Indeed, understanding how and why the Holocaust happened can help learners reflect on their role as global citizens, develop skills in historical understanding regarding why individuals and states acted the way they did in their given circumstances, and possibly take action on civic issues important for their school and society. Teaching about the Holocaust can, therefore, be expected to provide opportunities for contemporary skill-building, decision-making, and critical self-reflection on one’s own role in society. The study of the Holocaust is highly compatible with GCED for at least three key reasons:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The Holocaust addresses themes that are central concerns of GCED, including human rights and discrimination.
* The Holocaust forms the historical backdrop that informed the development of the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which can be understood concretely by linking them to specific violations before and during the Second World War.
* A review of research about teaching and learning about the Holocaust demonstrates that some approaches can have outcomes that are sought by the GCED framework.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[UNESCO]] has stated that holocaust and genocide education is part of its efforts to promote Global Citizenship Education and a priority within its Education 2030 agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/holocaust-genocide-education|title=Education about the Holocaust and Genocide|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO: Education about the Holocaust and Genocide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Compact Oxford English Dictionary and others interchangeably define the noun "objective" as, ''Objective: '''noun 1''' a goal or aim.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/objective?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[noun]] forms of the three words ''aim'', ''objective'' and ''[[goal]]'' are often used [[synonym]]ously, professionals in organised [[education]] define the words ''aim'' and ''objective'' more narrowly and consider them to be distinct from each other.  

Aims are concerned with purpose whereas objectives are concerned with achievement.  

Usually an educational objective relates to gaining an ability, a skill, some knowledge, a new attitude etc. rather than having merely completed a given task.  Since the achievement of objectives usually takes place during the course and the aims look forward into the student's career and life beyond the course one can expect the aims of a course to be relatively more long term than the objectives of that same course.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medical-school/tips/aims_objectives.html#difference University of Nottingham, Medical School, Learning Objectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Sociology, Vol. 8, No. 3, Why Formalize the Aims of Instruction?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course aims==
The course aims are the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of the course. In the context of an organised unit of education, such as a course module or course programme, an aim is a (relatively) long-term goal. Sometimes an aim sets a goal for the teacher to achieve in relation to the learners, sometimes course aims explicitly list long-term goals for the learner and at other times there is a joint goal for the teacher and learner to achieve together. While the aim may be phrased as a goal for the teacher within the scope of the course it can also imply goals for the learner beyond the duration of the course. In a statement of an aim the [[Grammatical person|third person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] form of the verb with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] ''course, programme or module'' is often used as an impersonal way of referring to the teaching staff and their goals. Similarly the learner is often referred to in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] singular even when he or she is the intended reader.

==Course objectives==
An objective is a (relatively) shorter term goal which successful learners will achieve within the scope of the course itself. Objectives are often worded in course documentation in a way that explains to learners what they should try to achieve as they learn. Some educational organisations design objectives which carefully match the [[SMART criteria]] borrowed from the business world.

==Learning outcomes==
Since both aim and objective are in common language synonymous with goal they are both suggestive of a form of [[goal-oriented]] education. For this reason some educational organisations use the term learning outcome since this term is inclusive of education in which learners strive to achieve goals but extends further to include other forms of education. For example, in [[learning through play]] children are not made aware of specific goals but planned, beneficial outcomes result from the activity nevertheless.

Therefore, the term learning outcome is replacing objective in some educational organisations. In some organisations the term learning outcome is used in the part of a course description where aims are normally found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelearningmanager.com/pubdownloads/developing_clear_learning_outcomes_and_objectives.pdf Developing Outcomes and Objectives, The Learning Management Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eslprogram.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/outcomes-versus-objectives-whats-the-difference/ Outcomes Versus Objectives? What’s the Difference? Daniel Pittaway]&lt;/ref&gt; One can equate aims to ''intended'' learning outcomes and objectives to ''measured'' learning outcomes. A third category of learning outcome is the ''unintended'' learning outcome which would include beneficial outcomes that were neither planned nor sought but are simply observed.

The '''Escuela de Periodismo Carlos Septién García''' (EPCSG - ''School of Journalism Carlos Septién García'') was the first [[Mexico|Mexican]] educational institution of [[journalism]]. It was founded by [[Luis Beltrán y Mendoza]], and supported by the [[Acción Católica Mexicana]] (Mexican [[Catholic Action]]), on May 30, 1939, and achieved certification of the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]] on July 2, 1976. The school was named after its second director.

Under the leadership of Alejandro Avilés Insunza the school detached itself from the Acción Católica Mexicana and its associated political and ideological tendencies concerning [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.septien.edu.mx/institucional/presentacion.htm ''Escuela de Periodismo Carlos Septién García''] (Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flannelgraph''' (also called '''flannel board''' or '''flannelgram''') is a storytelling system that uses a board covered with [[flannel]] fabric, usually resting on an [[easel]]. It is very similar to [[Fuzzy Felt]], although its primary use is as a [[storytelling]] medium, rather than as a [[toy]].

==Description of use==

The flannel board is usually painted to depict a background scene appropriate to the story being told.   Paper cutouts of characters and objects in the story are then placed on the board, and moved around, as the story unfolds.  These cutouts are backed, either with flannel, or with some other substance that adheres lightly to the flannel background, such as coarse sandpaper.&lt;ref name="wbsp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Write Better, Speak Better|author=''[[Reader's Digest]]''|year=1972|edition=6th|isbn=0-89577-006-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain, undecorated flannel boards can also be used as a visual aid during presentations, allowing the speaker to display and remove charts and graphs as needed.&lt;ref name="wbsp"/&gt;

==Associations with Christianity==

Flannelgraph has been (and continues to be) a popular medium for telling [[Bible story|Bible stories]] to young [[Sunday School]] students in [[Christianity|Christian]] (and particularly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]]) [[Church body|churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Flannel Boards in Early Childhood Education|url=http://ece-earlychildhoodeducation.com/using-flannel-boards-in-early-childhood-education/|work=ece-earlychildhoodeducation.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|author=Gail Leopold}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it is used as a storytelling method almost exclusively in elementary-level Christian education.&lt;ref name="Balmer2002"&gt;Randall Herbert Balmer. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&amp;pg=PA221 Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism]''. 1st ed. Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press; 2002 [cited 25 October 2011]. {{ISBN|978-0-664-22409-7}}. p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;   This may be attributed, in part, to the fact that flannelgraph is relatively inexpensive, yet provides a more vivid alternative to storytelling without visual [[illustration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Flannel Boards|url=http://www.studydiscussions.com/how-to-use-flannel-boards/|work=studydiscussions.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Conakry''' (in French ''L'Université Gamal Abdel Nasser de Conakry'', UGANC), is the largest university in [[Guinea]] and located in [[Dixinn]] Commune, [[Conakry]], the Guinean capital. The name is generally shortened to the '''University of Conakry'''.

[[Image:RevereWickedStatesman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Political cartoon from 1774 by [[Paul Revere]], depicting Death attacking Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]].]]

The '''Hutchinson Letters Affair''' was an incident that increased tensions between the colonists of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] and the British government prior to the [[American Revolution]].  In June 1773 letters written several years earlier by [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and [[Andrew Oliver]], governor and lieutenant governor of the province at the time of their publication, were published in a [[Boston]] newspaper.  The content of the letters was propagandistically claimed by Massachusetts radical politicians to call for the abridgement of colonial rights, and a duel was fought in England over the matter.

The affair served to inflame tensions in Massachusetts, where implementation of the 1773 [[Tea Act]] was met with resistance that culminated in the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773.  The response of the British government to the publication of the letters served to turn [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the principal figures in the affair, into a committed [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]].

==Background==
[[File:ThomasHutchinson.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], author of some of the inflammatory letters]]
{{Main article|American Revolution}}
During the 1760s, relations between Great Britain and some of its [[British colonization of the Americas|North American colonies]] became strained by a series of Parliamentary laws (including the 1765 [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]]), intended to raise revenue for the crown, and to assert Parliament's authority to pass such legislation despite [[No taxation without representation|a lack of colonial representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Knollenberg, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  These laws had sparked strong protests in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]; the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in particular saw significant unrest and [[direct action]] against crown officials.&lt;ref&gt;Danver, pp. 127–132&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[British Army]] troops into [[Boston]] in 1768 further raised tensions that escalated to the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Danver, pp. 151–154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the enactment of the Townshend Acts, Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his colonial secretary (and brother-in-law) [[Andrew Oliver]] wrote a series of letters concerning the acts, the protests against them, and containing suggestions on how to respond, to [[Thomas Whately]], an assistant to Prime Minister [[George Grenville]].&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Whately died in 1772, and his papers were turned over to his brother William.  Whately at one point gave access to his brother's papers to [[John Temple (diplomat)|John Temple]], another colonial official who sought to recover letters of his own from those papers.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson was appointed governor of Massachusetts in 1770, following the critical publication by opposition politicians of letters written by his predecessor, [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]].&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, pp. 178, 180–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next two years Hutchinson engaged in an extended and rancorous written debate with the provincial assembly and the governor's council, both of which were dominated by radical leadership hostile to Parliamentary authority.  The debate centered on the arbitrariness of executive prerogative and the role of Parliament in colonial governance, and greatly deepened divisions in the province.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, pp. 171–173, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Benjamin Franklin]], portrait by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], 1767]]
The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in England when the colonial secretary, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], insisted that [[Benjamin Franklin]], then acting as agent for Massachusetts in London, demanded that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response to a speech the governor gave early in 1772 as part of this ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin had acquired a packet of about twenty letters that had been written to Whately.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 27. Penegar notes that there are varying interpretations on how many letters constitute the set at issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon reading them, Franklin concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament.  He felt that wider knowledge of these letters would then focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters.&lt;ref name=Morgan187/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin sent the letters to [[Thomas Cushing]], the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.&lt;ref name=Morgan187&gt;Morgan, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated.  He specifically wrote that they should be seen only by a few people, and that he was not "at liberty to make the letters public."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters arrived in Massachusetts in March 1773, and came into the hands of [[Samuel Adams]], then serving as the clerk of the Massachusetts assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  By Franklin's instructions, only a select few people, including the Massachusetts [[Committee of Correspondence]], were to see the letters.&lt;ref name=Bailyn239&gt;Bailyn, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarmed at what they read, Cushing wrote Franklin, asking if the restrictions on their circulation could be eased.  In a response received by Cushing in early June, Franklin reiterated that they were not to be copied or published, but could be shown to anyone.&lt;ref name=Bailyn239/&gt;

==Publication==
A longtime opponent of Hutchinson's, Samuel Adams narrowly followed Franklin's request, but managed to orchestrate a propaganda campaign against Hutchinson without immediately disclosing the letters.  He informed the assembly of the existence of the letters, after which it designated a committee to analyze them.  Strategic leaks suggestive of their content made their way into the press and political discussions, causing Hutchinson much discomfort.  The assembly eventually concluded, according to [[John Hancock]], that in the letters Hutchinson sought to "overthrow the Constitution of this Government, and to introduce arbitrary Power into the Province", and called for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson complained that Adams and the opposition were misrepresenting what he had written, and that nothing he had written in them on the subject of Parliamentary supremacy went beyond other statements he had made.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 152"&gt;Alexander, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters were finally published in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' in mid-June 1773,&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.&lt;ref name=Penegar29/&gt;

==Content of the letters==
[[Image:Andrew Oliver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Oliver]], portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]], c. 1758]]
The letters were written primarily in 1768 and 1769, principally by Hutchinson and Oliver, although the published letters also included some written by Charles Paxton, a customs official and Hutchinson supporter, and Hutchinson's nephew Nathaniel Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters written by Oliver (who became lieutenant governor when Hutchinson became governor) proposed a significant revamping of the Massachusetts government to strengthen the executive, while those of Hutchinson were ruminations on the difficult state of affairs in the province.  Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] confirms Hutchinson's own assertion that much of the content of his letters expressed relatively little that had not already been publicly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bailyn, Hutchinson's ruminations included the observation that it was impossible for colonists have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an "abridgement of what are called [[Rights of Englishmen|English liberties]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson, unlike Oliver, made no specific proposals on ''how'' the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, "I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event."&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;  Oliver's letters, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members where then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin at the Court of St. James - NARA - 518216.jpg|thumb|right|19th century engraving depicting Benjamin Franklin's appearance before the Privy Council]]
In England, speculation ran rampant over the source of the leak.  William Whately accused John Temple of taking the letters, which Temple denied, challenging Whately to a duel.  Whately was wounded in the encounter in early December 1773, but neither participant was satisfied, and a second duel was planned.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 22–23, 34&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to forestall that event, Franklin on [[Christmas Day]] published a letter admitting that he was responsible for the acquisition and transmission of the letters, to prevent "further mischief".&lt;ref name=Penegar34&gt;Penegar, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He justified his actions by pointing out that the letters had been written between public officials for the purpose of influencing public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hutchinson's opponents in Massachusetts read the letters, they seized on key phrases (including the "abridgement" phrase) to argue that Hutchinson was in fact lobbying the London government to make changes that would effect such an abridgement.  Combined with Oliver's explicit recommendations for reform, they presented this as a clear indication that the provincial leaders were working against the interests of the people and not for them.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Bostonians were outraged at the content of the published letters, burning Hutchinson and Oliver in effigy on [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name=Penegar29&gt;Penegar, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters were widely reprinted throughout the British North American colonies, and acts of protest took place as far away as [[Philadelphia]].  The Massachusetts assembly and governor's council petitioned the Board of Trade for Hutchinson's removal.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 152"/&gt;  In the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] hearing concerning Hutchinson's fate, in which the aftermath of the [[Boston Tea Party]] was also discussed, Franklin stood silently while he was lambasted by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]] for his role in the affair.  He was accused of thievery and dishonor, and called the prime mover in England on behalf of Boston's radical [[Committee of Correspondence]].  The Board of Trade dismissed Franklin from his post as colonial [[Postmaster General (disambiguation)|Postmaster General]]&lt;!--lacking a more suitable link--&gt;, and dismissed the petition for Hutchinson's removal as "groundless" and "vexatious".&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 83–97&lt;/ref&gt;  Parliament then passed the so-called "[[Coercive Acts]]", a package of measures designed to punish Massachusetts for the tea party.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson was recalled, and the Massachusetts governorship was given to the commander of British forces in North America, [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Thomas Gage]].  Hutchinson left Massachusetts in May 1774, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;Hosmer, pp. 314–315&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Oliver suffered a stroke and died in March 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thomas Pownall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|[[Thomas Pownall]], who may have given Franklin the letters]]
Gage's implementation of the Coercive Acts further raised tensions that led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 41ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin, who had been politically neutral with respect to the colonial radicals prior to his appearance before the Board of Trade, returned to America in early 1775, committed to independence.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 284–291&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to serve in the [[Second Continental Congress]] and became a leading figure in the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 291ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who gave Franklin the letters?==
A number of candidates have been proposed as the means by which Benjamin Franklin acquired the letters.  John Temple, despite his political differences with Hutchinson, was apparently able to convince the latter in 1774 that he was not involved in their acquisition.  He did, however, claim to know who ''was'' involved, but refused to name him, because that would "prove the ruin of the guilty party."&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  Several historians (including Bernard Bailyn and Bernard Knollenberg) have concluded that [[Thomas Pownall]] was the probable source of the letters.  Pownall was Massachusetts governor before Francis Bernard, had similar views to Franklin on colonial matters, and had access to centers of colonial administration through his brother John, the colonial secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  Other individuals have also been suggested, but all appear to have an only tenuous connection to Franklin or the situation.  Historian Kenneth Penegar believes the question will remain unanswerable unless new documents emerge to shed light on the episode.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Independent reading''' is a term used in educational settings, where students are involved in choosing and reading material (fiction books, non-fiction, magazine, other media) for their independent consumption and enjoyment. Students that read independently have an emphasized creative choice in what they want to read and choose to learn.  Usually, '''Independent Reading''' takes place alongside the ongoing curriculum in the classroom or [[homeschool]].  Independent Reading can be tied to assessment and evaluation or remain as an activity in itself. 

==More Names for Independent Reading==
*SSR: Sustained Silent Reading
*DEAR: Drop Everything And Read
*Voluntary Reading 
&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr038.shtml] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Some of the Aims of Independent Reading==

'''Students will'''
*Read more willingly and more often.
*Become more interested in the printed word in general, including their own writing.
*Become more receptive to enrichment activities related to their reading.
*Discover that they can think and write in a meaningful way about their reading.
*Learn that literature can enrich their lives.
*Expand their vocabulary.
*Receive higher test scores.

&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.k12reader.com/independent-reading-the-foundation-of-lifelong-reading/] &lt;/ref&gt;

==How to include Independent Reading into a Routine==

'''Teachers can'''
*Allot time each to independent, where the student will choose a book and read for that amount of time.
*Set a number of pages that students have to read by the end of a specific timeframe.
*Have a book report due where the student chooses and reads a book of their choice and explains it to the class.
'''Parents can:'''
*Set a certain amount of time that their child has to read.
*Have their children read them books of their choice.

The '''International Conference on Web Services''' or '''ICWS''' is an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners focused on [[Web services]]. ICWS is sponsored by Services Society and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Computer Society. It has an 'A' rating in the Conference Portal - Core&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/678/&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'A' rating in the [[Excellence in Research for Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conferenceranks.com/?searchall=ICWS#data&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Areas of focus==
ICWS features [[research papers]] with a wide range of topics, focusing on various aspects of [[information technology|IT]] services. Some of the topics include Web services [[Specification (technical standard)#Software_development|specifications]] and enhancements, Web services discovery and [[Digital integration|integration]], Web services [[Information security|security]], Web services standards and formalizations, Web services modeling, Web services-oriented [[software engineering]], Web services-oriented [[software testing]], Web services-based applications and solutions, Web services realizations,  [[semantics#Computer_science|semantics]] in Web services, and all aspects of [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] (SOA) infrastructure.

== History ==
The International Conference on Web Services was founded by Dr. [[Liang-Jie Zhang]] in June 2003, Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the first ICWS-Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe'03), founded by Dr. [[Liang-Jie Zhang]] with Prof. [[Mario Jeckle]], was held in Germany in Oct, 2003. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), held in Erfurt, Germany. In 2012, ECOWS was formally merged into ICWS. Since then, the entire Services Computing community combined the efforts and focused on one prime international forum for web-based services: ICWS.

For 2018, there are two ICWS conferences. One is sponsored by the IEEE and the other by the Services Society and Springer.

== History of the archives ==
The first document stored in the [[General Directorate of Archives (Albania)|Central State Archive]], which deals with efforts to create a Central Archive, is the decision dated on 02.01.1932 of the High State Council for reviewing the draft-regulation for the registration of important events. In this draft-regulation, it was foreseen the creation of a General State Archive.

=== World War II ===
[[World War II in Albania|World War II]] slowed down the initiatives undertaken by state authorities for the creation of a centralized system of archives. During this period, documents and records were preserved and managed by the administration of the institution which they belonged to. This collection of documents and records enabled the creation of a large archivial database which became the foundation of a future Central State Archive.

=== Communism ===
Efforts to create a central archive continued after the war. In 1947, the "Documentary Archive of the Institute" was created at the Institute of Studies. It collected a considerable amount of historical documents kept by state institutions or individuals, thus taking on the attributes of a Central Archive, but not with all the features of such an entity.

The [[General Directorate of Archives (Albania)|Central State Archive]] (AQSH) was finally established as a central body, although subordinated to the Institute of Studies, by the Council of Ministers Order No. 21 dated 08.06.1949.

Its creation marked a culminating moment in the history of Albanian archives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="118924">{{Main article|Multilingualism|official multilingualism}}
This is an incomplete list of areas with either multilingualism at the community level or at the personal level.

There is a distinction between social and personal bilingualism. Many countries, such as [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]], which are officially multilingual, may have many monolinguals in their population. Officially monolingual countries, on the other hand, such as [[France]], can have sizable multilingual populations. Some countries have official languages but also have regional and local official languages, notably [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]] and [[Taiwan]].

However, those languages are considered foreign and thus are given no official status.
* [[Hungary]], the official language is [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

* [[Albania]] has one official language, [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. Other languages such as Greek and Italian are heavily spoken without official recognition, yet are minority languages. Albania recognises{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} 6 minorities languages; Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek and Italian. Majority Albanians are polyglots, speaking more than 3 languages, which is due to the high amount of Albanian immigrants in Europe and elsewhere, as well as political, socio-cultural relations with their neighbours. Today, Albanians are considered one of the most linguistically diverse peoples in Europe. Italian is spoken by a large amount of Albanians that have learnt the language by watching Italian television.

*In most countries of the Former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] are understood by all three groups (see [[Serbo-Croatian]]) - and smaller languages in the other republics of Slovenia ([[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]), Macedonia ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]) and (Montenegro) [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]. Other languages have co-official status in some parts of these countries (e.g. [[Italian language|Italian]] in [[Istria]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in [[Vojvodina]]).

[[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; The northern autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]] has a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual identity, with a number of mechanisms for the promotion of minority rights; there are more than 26 ethnic groups in the province. The province has six official languages. Some Serbs are recognised as fluent polyglot, many of them being able to speak German, French and English, due to the huge amount of Serbian immigrants in Europe, especially in Austria, Germany and France, whilst English is quite popular due to the large Serbian immigrant community in Australia and Canada.

*[[Andorra]] has one official language, [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Other languages (mainly Spanish, Portuguese and French) are also spoken without official recognition.
*[[Gibraltar]] is a [[British overseas territory]] whose sole official language is [[English language|English]].

*[[Portugal]] – although Portuguese is practically universal, [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], a related [[Leonese language]], is spoken in [[Miranda do Douro]], northeastern Portugal and is officially recognized (see: [[Languages of Portugal]]), and there is some familiarity with the [[Spanish language]] in border towns with neighboring [[Spain]].

*[[Luxembourg]] is a rare example of a truly trilingual society, in that it not only has three official languages – [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], French and German&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0016/a016.pdf#page=6 Loi du 24 février 1984 sur le régime des langues]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but has a trilingual education system. For the first four years of school, Luxembourgish is the [[medium of instruction]], before giving way to German, which in turn gives way to French. (In addition, children learn English and sometimes another European language, usually Spanish or Italian.) Similarly in the country's [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|parliament]], debates are conducted in Luxembourgish, draft legislation is drafted in German, while the statute laws are in French.

'''Marilee Jones''' (born June 12, 1951) is a former [[dean of admissions]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and the co-author of the popular guide to the college admission process ''Less Stress, More Success: A New Approach to Guiding Your Teen Through College Admissions and Beyond'' (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006).&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1581102305 ''Less Stress, More Success'' description from Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The book received critical acclaim and Jones was featured on [[CBS]], [[National Public Radio]], ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitadmissions.org/Marilee.shtml |title=Jones' MIT profile |accessdate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027101436/http://www.mitadmissions.org/Marilee.shtml |archivedate=October 27, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was first hired by MIT as an entry-level admissions officer in 1979; she was later promoted to associate director of admissions. She then served as interim dean of admissions from May 1997 until January 1998, when she was appointed to the position full-time.&lt;ref name="NewDean"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1997/jones-1217.html |title=Jones is new dean of admissions |publisher=MIT News Office |date=December 17, 1997 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones is quoted in [[Daniel Golden]]'s “[[The Price of Admission]]," as describing a [[Korean-American]] student as “yet another textureless math grind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/148996763|title=The price of admission : how America's ruling class buys its way into elite colleges--and who gets left outside the gates|last=1957-|first=Golden, Daniel,|date=2007|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=9781400097975|edition= 1st paperback|location=New York|oclc=148996763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation==
On April 23, 2007, Jones resigned her position after MIT learned she had fabricated her academic degrees from Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute when she first applied for an entry-level admissions officer position with MIT in 1979&lt;ref name="TheTech"&gt;
{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Semenkovich |title=Admissions Dean Resigns After Lying on Résumé |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N21/jones.html |work=MIT Tech |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she had fabricated "a degree" from Albany Medical College "after she was hired."&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt; MIT administrators were alerted to the discrepancy on or around April 16, 2007. MIT has not released the name of the person or persons who alerted them about Jones's background.&lt;ref name="TheTech"/&gt; Jones issued a statement on the MIT web site, in which she admitted to wrongdoing: {{quote|I misrepresented my academic degrees when I first applied to MIT 28 years ago and did not have the courage to correct my resume when I applied for my current job or at any time since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/admissions-jones.html Statement of Marilee Jones], MIT website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A spokesperson from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reported on April 26, 2007, that Jones attended the institute as a "part-time, [[Matriculation#Special student|non-matriculating]] student" from September 1974 to June 1975 and did not receive a degree.&lt;ref name="bloombergdegrees"&gt;

  | accessdate = 2007-04-26 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Spokespeople from Union College and from Albany Medical College both reported that there are no records of Jones ever attending either institution.&lt;ref name="bloombergdegrees"/&gt; On May 2, 2007, it was reported that she had actually earned a bachelor's degree in biology from [[The College of Saint Rose]] in 1973, though she did not list that degree when applying for her first job at MIT or when being considered for subsequent promotions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jones was appointed to the position of Dean of Admissions in 1998, she was credited with having earned an "SB and an SM in biology from Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute" in an article published in ''[http://tech.mit.edu/V117/N65/djones.65n.html The Tech]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Buchman | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=New Director of Admissions Jones Appointed at Year End | date=1998-01-07 | publisher= ''The Tech'' | url =http://tech.mit.edu/V117/N65/djones.65n.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an article published by ''[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1997/jones-1217.html MIT Tech Talk]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sarah | last=Wright | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Jones Is New Dean of Admissions | date=1997-12-17 | publisher= ''MIT News'' | url =http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1997/jones-1217.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-11 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither article made any mention of the degree from Union College which she had placed on her resume in 1979 nor of a Ph.D. credited to her several times in 2007.  Shortly before her resignation, she was referred to by the title "Dr. Marilee Jones" in a number of forums.  A biography of her on the website for the 2007 September Conference of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160121210648/http://www.nacacnet.org/Pages/default.aspx National Association of College Admission Counselors] referred to her as "Dr. Marilee Jones, Ph.D." and credited her with degrees from RPI and Albany Medical in biology and chemistry but offered no further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She could not, however, remember the details.&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;

After her departure from MIT Jones created her own consulting firm which provides service for admissions both institutions and applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tamar | last=Lewin | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Former Dean Resurfaces, Leaving Scandal Behind | date=2009-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/education/08jones.html?_r=1&amp;hpw | work =[[New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She states she was also offered the position of Dean of Admissions at several undisclosed universities for which she declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, she hired Rose Marie Terenzio, a public relations consultant who was the former personal assistant of [[John F. Kennedy Jr]], to help her make a "reclamation," a "comeback."&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2001, Jones received MIT's Excellence Award for Leading Change, which recognized Jones's leadership as dean of admissions. An excerpt from the presentation reads: {{quote|Because of Marilee's leadership and passion, the message of: "science in the service of mankind," now resonates among generations of students. She helps students understand that they have a responsibility as members of society, to utilize their skills and talents to make a difference in the world.

'''''Masters of the Elements''''' is an educational adventure video game developed by IJsfontein Interactive Media, and published by Bombilla (Dutch), Van In (Belgium), VNU Interactive, Tivola (English &amp; German), and Gallimard (French).&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/1999/10/08/Med/03.html|title=Nieuwsselectie: Media|website=retro.nrc.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally released in November, 1997 and ended up on Macintosh and Windows. 

In the Anglosphere, it was published by Tivola, who had recently published other edutainment titles such as [[Physicus]], [[Bioscopia]], and [[Chemicus]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameboomers.com/reviews/Mm/MastersElementsbyjenny100.htm|title=Masters of the Elements review|last=jenny100|website=www.gameboomers.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally in Dutch, the game was later translated into English, German, Japanese, French and Italian. The game was voiced by Joost Prinsen and won a BAFTA Award in 1999 after its English-language release.

==Production==
The game was created by Jan Willem Huisman, Hayo Wagenaar, and Sander Hassing.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/het-handige-sprookje-van-drie-snotneuzen~a452355/|title=Het handige sprookje van drie snotneuzen - Wetenschap - Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|website=De Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three developers at IJsfontein knew each other from the InterAction Design department of the Utrecht School of the Arts, where they designed the concept of the game.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"/&gt; Hajo Wagenaar made all the drawings, Sander Hassing served as programmer, Jan Willem Huisman organised the operation.&lt;ref name="trouw.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/cultuur/een-spannend-spel-met-een-literaire-bodem-voor-de-pc~acb843c7/|title=Een spannend spel met een literaire bodem voor de pc|website=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The came up with the name "IJsfontein" during the development of this game, which was their first project; while other development companies had English names they wanted to choose something Dutch-sounding.&lt;ref name="publicspacemedia.nl"&gt;http://www.publicspacemedia.nl/downloads/158_159_inAM2_NAMENLR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The game's sound designer came up with "Ice fountain" because ice is static while a fountain is dynamic.&lt;ref name="publicspacemedia.nl"/&gt;

While getting into large debt, the team was invited to the Cannes expo named Milia, where they set up a stall in a section for young talent.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; Interest from a Japanese publisher put them in a strong negotiating position with VNU Interactive; while it was standard for the publisher to get rights to the game, the develoeprs refused.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; They felt the publisher was condescending from their comments that the world does not work the way they think it does.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; 

Upon signing a contract with the Chinese, they discovered VNU still expected the company to lose the copyright due to not meeting a deadline.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; The team entered into a 'double or nothing' negotiation, whereby failing to complete the titled by 6 October, it would result in heavy royalty regulations.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; The team ultimately presented a beta version to children at an Amsterdam primary school, after suffering through a panic-stricken September.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt; The game was playtested by children from the top three groups of primary school; the developers noted the potential for the game to be popular with girld due to them finding solutions in a process-wise way, as opposed to boys who will click the screen 10,000 times until something happens.&lt;ref name="trouw.nl"/&gt; By 2016, 40 people would work at IJsfontein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kindermediaawards.nl/uitreiking-7-april/|title=- Kinder Media Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
It was one of the first [[serious game]]s ever to be developed.&lt;ref name="ijsfontein.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ijsfontein.nl/en/projecten/masters-of-power|title=Masters of Power – award-winning debuut - By IJsfontein|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, IJsfontein was the first Dutch studio to explicitly develop a game with an educational bend.&lt;ref&gt;http://creativeindustries.com.cuhk.edu.hk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/European-Game-Industry-Report-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The game attempts to bridge two opposing sides of the video gaming market by offering an experience that is both fun and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/1997/12/19/Med/09.html|title=Nieuwsselectie: Media|website=retro.nrc.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
In the Castle of Infinity, there are five masters that bring balance to the elements. When Master of Chance loses his cat, the balance of the elements is disturbed. It is up to the player to collect pages of the Garden of Chance story, which will then cause Master of Chance to reveal clues about the whereabouts of his cat.

The game is puzzle based, with themes ranging from the natural world to physics to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprout.nl/artikel/special-marketing-20-game-marketing|title=Special marketing 2.0: Game marketing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Gameboomers felt the puzzles required more dexterity than thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Feibel felt the game was difficult and beautifully illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126062205/http://www.feibel.de/index.php?id=7&amp;catId=11&amp;prodId=2129&amp;cHash=62b01939735c814423e155b9992d4154|title=Alle Spiele - Meister Zufall und die Herrscher der Elemente - Experimente, Rätsel und Geheimnisse|date=26 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay ''Op de koffie bij de Meester van Wanhoop '' thought the game demonstrated the wondrous potential of merging art and play in the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_lit004199901_01/_lit004199901_01_0043.php|title=Literatuur zonder leeftijd. Jaargang 13 · dbnl|first=|last=DBNL|website=DBNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game won a BAFTA award and a La Fletche d'Or.&lt;ref name="ijsfontein.nl"/&gt; The game was nominated for the Bafta for most instructive game for children, and for the most interactive game for children.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"/&gt; The game was featured at the IFFR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iffr.com/nl/1998/films/meesters-van-macht|title=Meesters van Macht|date=4 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was also a commercial success&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xQgbDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=IJsfontein+"Meister+Zufall+und+die+Herrscher+der+Elemente"+OR+"Meesters+van+Macht"+OR+"Le+Maître+des+éléments"&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=08jw0cxe7b&amp;sig=jGcEdGmxyzBlV8SkdtGZsnGuAZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLttafyZXaAhWIGJQKHRNCC8gQ6AEIeDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=IJsfontein%20"Meister%20Zufall%20und%20die%20Herrscher%20der%20Elemente"%20OR%20"Meesters%20van%20Macht"%20OR%20"Le%20Maître%20des%20éléments"&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, and become one of the best-selling pieces of Dutch CD-ROM software.&lt;ref name="volkskrant.nl"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Nicholas Wolterstorff lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan with his wife Claire. He has 4 grown children and 1 that died at age 25 while mountain climbing in Austria. He has seven grandchildren.

==Thought==
While an undergraduate at Calvin College, Wolterstorff was greatly influenced by professors [[William Harry Jellema]], [[Henry Stob]] and [[Henry Zylstra]], who introduced him to schools of thought that have dominated his mature thinking: Reformed theology and [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|common sense]] philosophy (these have also influenced the thinking of Wolterstorff's friend and colleague [[Alvin Plantinga]], another alumnus of Calvin College).

Wolterstorff  builds upon the ideas of the Scottish common sense philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], who approached knowledge "from the bottom-up". Instead of reasoning about [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] conditions of knowledge, Wolterstorff suggests that knowledge and our knowing faculties are not the subject of our research but have to be seen as its starting point. Wolterstorff rejects classical [[foundationalism]] and instead sees knowledge as based upon insights in reality which are direct and indubitable.

'''Pforta''', or '''Schulpforta''', is a school located in a former [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[monastery]], '''[[Pforta monastery]]''' (1137–1540), near [[Naumburg]] on the [[Saale River]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. 

Since the 16th century the site has been a school. Notable past alumni include the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and the German chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]]. Today, it is a well-known [[public education|public]] [[boarding school]] for academically gifted children, called '''Landesschule Pforta'''. It is [[coeducation]]al and teaches around 300 [[high school]] students. 

Pforta is proposed for inscription in the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] as one component of the German nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. 

==History==

===Monastery===
[[File:Pforta Altes Schulhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Pforta, ''Altes Schulhaus'']]
{{Main|Pforta monastery}}

The abbey was at first situated in [[Altenburger Land|Schmölln]] on the Sprotta, near [[Altenburg]]. In 1127, Count Bruno of Pleissengau founded a [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery there and endowed it with 1,100 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}} This foundation not being successful, on 23 April 1132, {{Interlanguage link multi|Udo I of Naumburg|de|3=Udo I. von Thüringen|lt=Bishop Udo I of Naumburg}}, a relative of Bruno's, replaced the Benedictines by Cistercian monks from [[Walkenried Abbey]]. The situation here proved undesirable, and in 1137 Udo transferred the monastery to Pforta, and conferred upon it fifty hides of arable land, an important tract of forest, and two farms belonging to the [[Diocese of Naumburg|diocese]].{{sfn|Löffler|1911}}

The [[Patron saint|patroness]] of the abbey was the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The first abbot was Adalbert, from 1132 to 1152. Under the third abbot, Adetold, two daughter houses&lt;!--?which--&gt; were founded under Pforta's auspices, in the [[Marches|Mark]] of [[Meissen]] and in [[Silesia]], and in 1163, the monasteries of [[Altzella Abbey|Altzella]] and [[Leubus]] were also established in the latter province. At this period the monks numbered about eighty. In 1205, Pforta sent a colony of monks to [[Livonia]], founding there the monastery of [[Dünamünde]]. The abbey was distinguished for its excellent system of management, and after the first 140 years of its existence its possessions had increased tenfold.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}}

At the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th centuries, after a period of strife, the monastery flourished again. The last quarter of the 14th century witnessed, however, the gradual decline of its prosperity, and also the relaxation of monastic discipline. When Abbot Johannes IV was elected in 1515, there were forty-two monks and seven [[lay brother]]s who later revolted against the abbot; an inspection by [[George, Duke of Saxony|Duke George of Saxony]] reported that morality had ceased to exist in the monastery.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}}

The last abbot, Peter Schederich, was elected in 1533. When the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Duke George was succeeded by his [[Protestantism|Protestant]] brother [[Henry IV, Duke of Saxony|Henry]], the monastery was suppressed on 9 November 1540, with the abbot, eleven monks, and four lay brothers being pensioned off.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}}

===Boarding school===
[[File:Schulpforte Fürstenhaus.jpg|thumb|right|''Fürstenhaus'']]
In 1543, Henry's son [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Duke Moritz]] opened a national school in the abbey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesschule-pforta.de/index.php?a=en&amp;z=intro Landesschule Pforta's English website]&lt;/ref&gt; appropriating for its use the revenues of the suppressed monastery of [[Memleben Abbey]]. At first the number of scholars was 100; in 1563 fifty more could be accommodated. The first rector was [[Johann Gigas]], renowned as a lyric poet. Under [[Justinus Bertuch]] (1601–1626) the school attained the zenith of its prosperity. It suffered greatly during the [[Thirty Years' War]], in 1643, there being only eleven scholars.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}} After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended in 1815, Pforta belonged to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and then to [[Imperial Germany]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

From 1935 until 1945 Schulpforta served as a ''Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt'' (NPEA) or National Political Institution of Teaching. As an NPEA the institution was concerned with promoting National Socialist ([[Nazi]]) ideals and encouraging boys between the ages of 11 and 18 to pursue occupations (such as work within the [[Schutzstaffel]]/SS) which supported the National Socialist cause.&lt;ref&gt;http://helenroche.com/work/wanderer-kommst-du-nach-pforta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saale-unstrut-tourismus.de/en/pforta-abbey&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the institute became co-educational.{{sfn|''Landesschule Pforta''|2014}} Today the school is maintained by the German state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], but still supported by its own Schulpforta Foundation.

==Architecture==
The remains of the monastery include the 13th century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] church;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}} it is a cross-[[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]], [[colonnade]]d [[basilica]] with an extraordinarily long [[nave]], a peculiar western [[Facade|façade]], and a late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] double-naved [[cloister]]. What remains of the original building (1137–40) is in the Romanesque style, while the restoration (1251–1268) belongs to the early Gothic.{{sfn|Löffler|1911}} Other buildings are now used as dormitories and lecture halls.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There is also the ''Fürstenhaus'' ("prince's house"), built in 1573. Schulpforta was one of the three ''Fürstenschulen'' ("prince's schools") founded in 1543 by Maurice, Elector of Saxony (at that time Duke), the two others being at Grima and at Meissen.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13046">'''Pre-medical''' (often referred to as '''pre-med''') is an educational track that [[undergraduate]] students in the United States and Canada pursue prior to becoming medical students. It involves activities that prepare a student for [[medical school]], such as pre-med coursework, volunteer activities, clinical experience, research, and the application process. Some pre-med programs providing broad preparation are referred to as “pre-professional” and may simultaneously prepare students for entry into a variety of [[first professional degree]] or [[graduate school]] programs that require similar prerequisites (such as medical, veterinary, or pharmacy schools).
==Major==
At most colleges and universities, students do not have the option of pre-medical [[academic major]] or [[Minor (academic)|minor]]. A student on a pre-med track may choose any undergraduate major in any field, so long as certain required courses are completed. Such courses are generally focused in the scientific fields of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[neuroscience]], and [[physics]], which are necessary to prepare for the [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/mcat/preparing/ | title=Preparing for the MCAT Exam | publisher=AMCAS | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satisfy most medical school prerequisites.&lt;ref name=AAMCReq /&gt; It is for this reason students on a pre-med track generally undertake a major associated with one of those fields; however, an increasing number of students with a background in humanities have been applying in recent years,&lt;ref name="AAMC2010MajorData"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161692/data/table18-facts2010mcatgpabymaj1-web.pdf.pdf | title=MCAT and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools by Primary Undergraduate Major, 2010 | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a situation applauded by medical schools.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{Citation | last=Kliff | first=Sarah | url=http://saveksuhistory.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/newsweek-med-schools-seek-more-nonscience-students/ | title=Med Schools Seek More Nonscience Students | newspaper=[[Newsweek]] | date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] has created a program specifically for non-science majors. The Humanities and Medicine Program admits undergraduates majoring in the humanities or social sciences without requiring the MCAT, or science coursework.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Citation | last=Hartocollis | first=Anemona | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/nyregion/30medschools.html | title=Getting Into Medical School Without Hard Sciences | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-med timeline==
Typical pre-med students will structure their coursework in their first year in [[university]] to accommodate the required courses. After a semester, many pursue extracurricular activities that demonstrate a commitment to medicine. Once junior year arrives, students register for and take the MCAT, the required standardized exam that medical schools use to identify qualified candidates.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Once the test is taken, students apply to various schools using the automated [[American Medical College Application Service]] (AMCAS) system, [[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service]] (AACOMAS) system, or in some cases, the school's own application system. AMCAS primary applications are verified by AMCAS staff, a process that often takes four to six weeks.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; The application process consists of a review of academic records, MCAT scores, activities, work experience, and a personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hms.harvard.edu/admissions/default.asp?page=selection | title=Selection Factors | publisher=Harvard Medical School | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants can expect to hear from schools within a few months, at which point they may receive "secondary applications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prehealthadvising.com/2010/11/2011-2012-medical-school-application-timeline/ | title=2011-2012 Medical School Application Timeline | publisher=prehealthadvising.com | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools have different policies on sending secondary applications to students; many send secondary applications to all students, others screen applications prior to inviting an applicant to submit a secondary application. These applications are generated by each individual school. They generally contain essay questions that the applicant must answer to demonstrate that the applicant possesses qualities that the schools deem necessary to be a good medical student and physician.&lt;ref name=PRMSA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.princetonreview.com/medical/medical-school-applications.aspx | title=Medical School Applications | publisher=The Princeton Review | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified applicants can next expect to receive invitations to interview at schools. Upon completion of an interview and receipt of any additional application materials, the application is considered to be complete, and the student then waits for the school's decision to either accept or reject the student.&lt;ref name=PRMSA /&gt;

Some applicants receive admittance to medical school through a "post-baccalaureate" pre-medical program. These programs may be formal, such as the programs offered through [[Columbia University |Columbia]], [[Johns Hopkins University |Johns Hopkins]], [[Mayo Clinic]] with Barrett, The Honors College, [[Bryn Mawr College |Bryn Mawr]], [[Goucher]] and [[Scripps College |Scripps]], or semi-formal, such as the program offered at [[Harvard University |Harvard]], but often consist of a student informally enrolling in a college to complete science coursework required for admission to medical school prior to sitting for the MCAT. The [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) maintains a list of all formal and semi-formal post-baccalaureate pre-medical programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://services.aamc.org/postbac/ | title=Postbaccalaureate Premedical Programs - Search | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coursework==
The AAMC has created a list of required courses that every pre-med student must take.&lt;ref name=AAMCReq /&gt; Each school is allowed to place its own further requirements.

The pre-medical coursework is offered at many American colleges and [[universities]]; however, it is considered to be a "track" that follows a certain curriculum. Most pre-medical students major in the natural and applied sciences, such as [[agricultural science]], biology, chemistry, or physics, though this is not a requirement. Some pre-professional degree programs in agriculture prepare students for direct entry into the workforce in fields in high demand, while also meeting requirements for medical or veterinary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cals.cornell.edu/admissions/academics/pre-professional-programs/ |title=Pre-professional Programs &amp;#124; College of Agriculture and Life Sciences |publisher=[[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eppws.nmsu.edu/pre-professional-program/ |title=Pre-professional Programs NMSU |publisher= New Mexico State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ag.purdue.edu/foodsci/Pages/premed.aspx |title=Pre-Med |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter curriculum model is meant to enhance employability of graduates awaiting admission or choosing not to attend professional or graduate school.

The courses that must be taken to meet the pre-medical requirements from the AAMC are two years of chemistry, with one being in chemistry, one year of biology, and one year of physics.&lt;ref name=AAMCReq&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/requirements/ | title=Admission Requirements | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These course requirements are expected to change since the MR5 Committee, charged with revising the MCAT has created a new set of core competencies for success in medical education and practice.  Those core competencies will include a greater emphasis on molecular genetics within the biology curriculum and will include biochemistry. In addition, the 2015 MCAT will test in areas related to multicultural sensitivity and in critical analysis of ethics and philosophy.&lt;ref name=newAAMCReq&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/download/266006/data/2015previewguide.pdf | title=2015 MCAT preview | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Elizabeth | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/education/edlife/pre-meds-new-priorities-heart-and-soul-and-social-science.html?_r=4&amp;ref=elisabethrosenthal&amp; | title= Pre-Med’s New Priorities: Heart and Soul and Social Science | accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many colleges of medicine and undergraduate pre-medical advising offices have yet to formalize pre-medical curricular recommendations. Though it did not address changes in the mathematics, physics, psychosocial or humanities portion of pre-medical education, the [[American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] (ASBMB) developed a set of pre-medical curricular recommendations. ASBMB advocated that the year of biology includes genetics; that general and organic chemistry be taught with an orientation toward the chemistry of molecules encountered in living things; that one semester of biochemistry be required and two semesters of biochemistry be recommended; and that the laboratory course requirement can be taught in biology, chemistry or biochemistry, so long as research methods and data analysis are emphasized.&lt;ref name=ASBMBcurriculum&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article.aspx?id=16052 | title=ASBMB pre-medical curriculum | publisher=ASBMB | accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-medical students may be advised or required to take upper level biology and chemistry electives, such as [[cellular biology]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]]. Specific requirements for these courses vary by institution. Schools may also have requirements for non-science classes. Some require a certain number of general [[humanities]] credits, while others have specific requirements for courses in [[English studies |English]], [[psychology]], or other disciplines.

==Volunteering and clinical experiences==
Many pre-medical students volunteer in a health care setting to explore the option of a career in medicine. Past volunteer experience can increase an applicant's chances of acceptance to a medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith-Barrow |first=Delece |title=Bolster a Medical School Application With Volunteer Work |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2013/09/04/bolster-a-medical-school-application-with-volunteer-work |publisher=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often volunteer experiences are topics of discussion during medical school interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franco |first=Kathleen |title=How Volunteer Work Can Offer Lessons to Prospective Medical Students |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2014/04/22/how-volunteer-work-can-offer-lessons-to-prospective-medical-students |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students "shadow" a physician, where the student follows a physician, directly observing the doctor as they care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chang |first=Edward |title=Shadow a Physician to Gain Insight for Medical School |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2014/01/28/shadow-a-physician-to-gain-insight-for-medical-school |publisher=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
In Australia and the United Kingdom, a number of universities offer a three or four year Bachelor of Medical Science, Bachelor of Health Sciences or Biomedical Science degree, which is similar in content and aim to pre-med courses in the US. However, it is also possible to gain entry to a professional degree program in medicine (usually the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree) directly from High School if the applicant achieves high grades upon graduation and is successful in the [[Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test]] (UMAT), for Australian and New Zealand medicine courses, and the [[UK Clinical Aptitude Test]] (UKCAT) and [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] (BMAT) for UK medicine courses.

Nurses and [[midwives]] are educated in the hospital for work outside the North Korean capital. There is a [[neonatal intensive care unit]] at the hospital. In addition, there are multiple different wards, such as [[dentistry|dental]] and [[breast cancer]] wards, to treat mothers' various health problems.

The hospital employs a unique system of [[Videotelephony|video call]] booths for family to communicate with a woman who has given birth, as family members are restricted from being in personal contact with the newborn and the mother for five days. It is believed that this helps to prevent infections.

[[Traditional Korean medicine]] is used conspicuously in the treatment of patients, and around 30 percent of all given treatments are based on traditional methods.

In 2012 the hospital was expanded when a new wing specialized for breast cancer was constructed at the hospital grounds by orders of [[Kim Jong-un]].

==History==
In the 1970s, a state policy for maternity issues was initiated.&lt;ref name="Joongang_Daily_2005"/&gt; [[Kim Jong-il]] decided to build the hospital in 1978, and it was rumored that he wished that no women would die any longer due to pregnancy complications, as his mother [[Kim Jong-suk]] had died.&lt;ref name="Lim2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Kim Jong-il's Leadership of North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ag16AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=24 November 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-01712-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of building the hospital was used as means to emphasize Kim Jong-il's achievements for his confirmed status as a [[List of leaders of North Korea|heir apparent]].&lt;ref name="NKLW_2012_Oct"/&gt;

The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital was part of the [[Pyongyang Speed campaign]] to construct various public facilities for the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea]], which took place on 10–14 October 1980—the congress' beginning coincided with the 35th [[Party Foundation Day]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Kim Jong Il – Brief History|date=1998|url=http://www.korea-dpr.info/lib/103.pdf|publisher=[[Foreign Language Publishing House]]|page=79|access-date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the congress was followed by large construction projects continuing into the early 1980s. The hospital was completed in less than nine months.&lt;ref name="Willoughby2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Willoughby|title=North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4XKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|date=22 July 2014|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-476-1|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sechiyama2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaku Sechiyama|title=Patriarchy in East Asia: A Comparative Sociology of Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wN5X31LS6hwC&amp;pg=PA215|date=1 March 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-23060-2|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen-Louise Hunter|title=Kim Il-song's North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrz5OJvCkmIC&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96296-8|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1979, the hospital began operating on the 34th anniversary of the [[Law on Sex Equality]] on 30 July 1980.&lt;ref name="Lim2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corfield2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Corfield|title=Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zKWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-78308-341-1|pages=xxi, 59–60, 160–161, 177–179, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pictorial_Korea_2015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kang Su Jong |date=July 2015 |title=Pyongyang Maternity Hospital with 35-Year History |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/periodic/korea/index.php?contents+4600+2015-07+303+2 |newspaper=[[Korea Pictorial]] |location=[[Pyongyang]] |publisher= |issn=1727-9208 |access-date=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital was praised as one of the best in mainland Northeast Asia after opening; the quality of maternity care in the country had improved since the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea O'Reilly|title=Encyclopedia of Motherhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UP9yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA622|date=6 April 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6629-9|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2005, nationwide attention was given to maternity hospitals and [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetric and gynecological]] departments to ensure that a larger proportion of women would receive in-hospital care for childbirth by competent medical staff. The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital's management and facilities were also improved at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw33/responses/kor/kor-E.pdf|title=Written replies by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the list of issues and questions (CEDAW/PSWG/2005/II/CRP.1/Add.3) issued by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women|date=March 2005|website=[[United Nations]]|pages=14–15|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breast Cancer Research Center===

Kim Jong-un gave orders to build a new wing for the hospital in 2012. The Breast Cancer Research Center, also known as the Breast Cancer Institute, began operating in this wing on 8 October 2012.&lt;ref name="NKLW_2012_Oct"/&gt; The institute has a floor space of 8,500&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on six floors and over 160 rooms. It contains rooms for [[CT scan]] and [[X-ray]], and other rooms for medical procedures such as treating tumours. Achieving early diagnosis and regular [[cancer screening]] were goals set for the new medical services offered by the institute. There is also office space for research work.&lt;ref name="Pictorial_Korea_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RT_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korea_Today_2013"/&gt;

===Traditional medicine===
{{further|Traditional Korean medicine}}

Pyongyang Maternity Hospital uses both conventional and traditional medicine to treat patients.&lt;ref name="Joongang_Daily_2005"/&gt; The hospital has a Department of Traditional Medicine known as '''The Koryo Medical Gynecology Department'''. Traditional medicine is used for treating obstetrics and gynecology patients. A separate pharmacy for [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] exists, and there are facilities for producing traditional medicines within the hospital. A manufacturing unit for herbal medicines maintains extraction, sterilization, and storage units within the hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO_2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.searo.who.int/PDS_DOCS/B0020.pdf |title=Development of Traditional Medicine in the South-East Asia Region |author= |date=November 2005 |website=[[WHO]] |pages=26–27 |access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 60 different traditional medicines were in use {{As of|2005|lc=y}}. Common traditional treatments include [[cupping therapy]], [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]] with and without [[Electroacupuncture|electric charge]]. Approximately 30 percent of services provided by the hospital are based on traditional medicine.&lt;ref name="WHO_2005"/&gt;

The Breast Cancer Research Center was featured on the local news in 2012 after it had received two advanced [[Siemens Healthcare|Siemens]] [[Medical imaging|medical imaging scanners]]. [[North Korea Tech]] speculated from the news that these were Artis and Somatom Emotion type medical scanners. However, modern medical equipment remains rare in the North Korean healthcare system,&lt;ref name="NorthKoreaTech_2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northkoreatech.org/tag/pyongyang-maternity-hospital/ |title=Pyongyang Maternity Hospital gets advanced Siemens scanners |last=Williams |first=Martyn |date=28 September 2012 |website=[[North Korea Tech]] |publisher= |access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the presence of some advanced equipment from Siemens.&lt;ref name="Business_Insider_2014"/&gt; {{As of|February 2009}} old equipment dating back from the 1970s was still in use.&lt;ref name="Business_Insider_2014"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korean-healthcare-2014-5|title=I Had A Scary Encounter With North Korea’s Crumbling Healthcare System|last=Mack|first=Benjamin|website=[[Business Insider]]|date=1 June 2014|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the NGO ''WomenCrossDMZ'' were told on their visit to the hospital that international sanctions had previously stopped the hospital from obtaining necessary parts for an x-ray machine. Experts have responded unclearly on these claims that the sanctions could cause problems with medicine. However, the x-ray machine contains radioactive materials, which complicates the export of such machines from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nknews.org/2015/05/koreas-peace-symposium-pushes-for-more-engagement/ |title=Koreas’ Peace Symposium pushes for more engagement |last=Leo |first=Leo |website=[[NK News]] |date=26 May 2015 |access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Our Warm House]]'', a North Korean [[medical drama]] [[List of North Korean television series|television series]] filmed in 2000, was set in Pyongyang Maternity Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ri|first=Ok Gyong|editor1=Hong Chan Su |editor2=Ri Un Gyong |title=Korean film: Feature Film, TV Drama, Documentary, Science Film, Children's Film / |script-title=ko:조선 영화: 예술, 텔레비죤극, 기록, 과학, 아동 |language=English, Korean |others=Translated by Ro Yong Chol, Jang Hyang Gi and Yang Sung Mi |location=[[Pyongyang]] |publisher=[[Korea Film Export &amp; Import Corporation]] |publication-date=15 September 2012|oclc=857899124 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="korf_Koreo"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Korea Film Coporation [sic].

The hospital has commonly appeared in [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) news articles. Many of these news stories are about cases of triplets, and North Koreans are fascinated by triple births. When asked to explain this fascination, the doctors of the hospital explained that the third baby needs extra care as women only have two breasts for two children. As a result, the government provides help for mothers of triplets.&lt;ref name="Joongang_Daily_2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2639128|title=Activist mother lauds hospital care in North|author=Ser Myo-ja|website=[[Korea Joongang Daily]]|date=6 November 2005|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and [[North Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital]] were awarded plaques declaring them a ''Baby-Friendly Hospital'' on 5 February 2009 by the [[UNICEF]] [[UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office|Thailand office]] for attaining all ten targets of [[breastfeeding]] set by [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]. A reassessment in late 2008 indicated that the hospitals had met the targets. However, [[South Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital]], a new candidate for the award, did not meet the breastfeeding standards. Previously the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and North Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital had been awarded in 1996. Director Kim Song-hui stated that in addition to health workers, both community-based and nursery workers will help mothers maintain breastfeeding after their hospital discharge. It was planned that by the end of 2009, there would be seven baby-friendly hospitals in North Korea.&lt;ref name="UNICEF_2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/dprk/6620_10229.html |title=Baby-Friendly Hospital Award Ceremony |last=Sahin |first=Nilgun |date=5 February 2009 |website=[[UNICEF]] |publisher= |access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Durgnat''' (1 September 1932&amp;nbsp;– 19 May 2002) was a British film critic, who was born in London of Swiss parents. During his life he wrote for virtually every major English language film publication. In 1965 he published the first major critical essay on [[Michael Powell]], who had hitherto been "fashionably dismissed by critics as a 'technician’s director'", as Durgnat put it.

His many books include ''Films and Feelings'' (1967), ''A Mirror for England: British Movies from Austerity to Affluence'' (1970), and ''The Strange Case of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'' (1974). He wrote principally for ''[[Films and Filming]]'' (in the 1960s), ''[[Film Comment]]'' (in the 1970s) and ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' (in the 1980s), and taught at various art schools and universities, notably [[St Martin's College]] and the [[Royal College of Art]], where his students included [[Tony Scott]]. Toward the end of his life he was visiting professor at the [[University of East London]].&lt;ref name="UEL HSS"&gt;,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/hss/|title= UEL HSS|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091001100857/http://www.uel.ac.uk/hss/|archivedate= 1 October 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Durgnat was born in London in 1932 to Swiss parents who had emigrated to England in 1924.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Obits/Durgnat/Guardian.html Raymond Durgnat: Prolific film critic contemptuous of his trade's doctrinal theories.]&lt;/ref&gt; Durgnat's family was of [[French Huguenot]] descent, and he was raised in a religious [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] household.&lt;ref name="rouge"&gt;[http://www.rouge.com.au/8/interview.html "Culture Always is a Fog:" Interview with Raymond Durgnat.] ''Rouge.''&lt;/ref&gt; Durgnat's father worked as a [[window dresser]] but lost his job in 1932; afterwards, he opened a drapery shop.&lt;ref name="rouge"/&gt;

He was educated at the [[Sir George Monoux College|Sir George Monoux School]], a state grammar school in Walthamstow, before serving his statutory two years of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]], which he spent in the [[Royal Army Educational Corps|Education Corps]] in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name="rouge"/&gt; then a British possession. After leaving the army in 1954, he studied English Literature at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; With the filmmaker [[Don Levy]], Durgnat became one of the first post-graduate students of film in Britain, studying under [[Thorold Dickinson]] (director of ''[[Gaslight (1940 film)|Gaslight]]'' and ''[[The Next of Kin]]'') at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] from 1960. The thesis he wrote there provided the source material for a number of his books.

In the early 1950s, he had written for ''[[Sight and Sound]]'', but fell out with this [[British Film Institute]] publication after the exit of [[Gavin Lambert]] in 1957, often accusing it of elitism, puritanism, and upper-middle-class snobbery, notably in his 1963 essay "Standing Up For Jesus" (which appeared in the short-lived magazine ''Motion'', which he co-edited with Ian Johnson) and in his 1965 piece "Auteurs and Dream Factories" (an edited version of which later appeared in ''Films and Feelings''). From 1960 he was a regular presence in the monthly [https://www.academia.edu/3284715/The_Queer_History_of_Films_and_Filming ''Films and Filming''], writing reviews and serial essays.

In 1966–7 he was a major player in the nascent [[London Film-Makers' Co-op]] (LFMC),&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Gough-Yates [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/24/guardianobituaries1 Obituary: Raymond Durgnat], ''The Guardian'', 24 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; then based at [[Better Books]] on Charing Cross Road, a hub of the emerging British [[Underground (British subculture)|underground]]. As the LFMC's chairman he was instrumental in promoting filmmakers such as [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1359564/index.html Jeff Keen] and [[Stephen Dwoskin]], writing the first articles on both.

The rise of structural film (at the LFMC) and of structuralism (in the journal [[Screen (journal)|''Screen'']]) – and the far-left politics which accompanied the latter – saw Durgnat become an outsider figure within British film culture. In 1973 he moved to Canada, beginning a peripatetic teaching career in North America which took him to New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the late 1970s he taught film at the [[University of California, San Diego]] alongside [[Manny Farber]], [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]] and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]].&lt;ref name="RosenbaumonFarber"&gt;Rosenbaum, Jonathan. [http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=14534 They Drive by Night: The Criticism of Manny Farber.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to London at the close of the decade, he launched a series of withering assaults on the linguistics-based film theory that had come to dominate film academia over the previous decade; perhaps as a result, he did not published another new book until 1999. He did, however, return to write for the BFI publication ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' in the years before its merger with ''Sight and Sound'' in 1991, and contributed to that publication again later in the 1990s.

His last two books, including ''A Long Hard look at Psycho'', were also published by the BFI. ''The Essential Raymond Durgnat'', published in 2014 – again by the BFI – contains previously unpublished work, including a translation of an essay originally published in [[Positif (magazine)|''Positif'']] on Michael Powell, on whom Durgnat began but did not complete a full-length book. It also includes such rare pieces as "Standing Up for Jesus". The collection was described by [[Adrian Martin]] as "[http://www.filmkrant.nl/world_wide_angle/11499 the essential film book of this or almost any year]".

Durgnat's socio-political approach&amp;nbsp;– strongly supportive of the working classes and, almost as a direct result of this, American popular culture, and dismissive of left-wing intellectuals whom he accused of actually being [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeois]] conservatives in disguise, and dismissive of overt politicisation of film criticism, refusing to bring his own left-wing views overtly into his writings on film&amp;nbsp;– can best be described as "radical populist".

===Religious views===
Aslan was born into a [[Twelver|Shia Muslim]] family.&lt;ref name="The Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim author's book about Jesus goes top of Amazon's sales charts after TV interview challenging his credentials goes viral|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2381869/Muslim-author-Reza-Aslans-book-Jesus-goes-Amazons-sales-charts-TV-interview-challenging-credentials-goes-viral.html|date=31 July 2013 |work=[[The Daily Mail]] |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converted to [[evangelical Christianity]] at the age of 15,&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21582239-perhaps-jesus-was-no-pacifist-no-angel |title=The life of Jesus: No angel |work=[[The Economist]] |date=July 27, 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted back to [[Islam]] the summer before attending Harvard.&lt;ref name="loon watch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/11/exclusive-loonwatch-interview-with-reza-aslan/|title=Exclusive Loonwatch Interview with Reza Aslan|publisher=Loonwatch.com|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him "a [[Shia]] by persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waiting for an Islamic Enlightenment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/22/highereducation.islam|date=22 October 2005|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview with [[WNYC]] host [[Brian Lehrer]], Aslan said: "I'm definitely a [[Muslim]] and [[Sufism]] is the tradition within Islam that I most closely adhere to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Dan|title=Can Muslims write about Christianity?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0728/Can-Muslims-write-about-Christianity|date=July 28, 2013|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also proclaims himself a "genuinely committed disciple of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]."&lt;ref name="The Daily Mail"/&gt; In a 2013 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Aslan states: "It's not [that] I think Islam is correct and Christianity is incorrect. It's that all religions are nothing more than a language made up of symbols and metaphors to help an individual explain faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roig |first=Manuel |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/reza-aslan-a-jesus-scholar-whos-hard-to-pin-down/2013/08/08/2b6eee80-002b-11e3-9a3e-916de805f65d_story.html |title=Reza Aslan: A Jesus scholar who's hard to pin down |work=The Washington Post |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, in an interview with [[Cenk Uygur]] of ''[[The Young Turks]]'', Aslan described Islam as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a man-made institution. It's a set of symbols and metaphors that provides a language for which to express what is inexpressible, and that is faith. It's symbols and metaphors that I prefer, but it's not more right or more wrong than any other symbols and metaphors. It's a language, that's all it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Aslan |first=Reza |subjectlink=Reza Aslan |interviewer=[[Cenk Uygur]] |title=Reza Aslan - Bigotry, Fundamentalism and Neo-Atheism in the Media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F-SiZt0amg |date=October 13, 2014 |work=The Young Turks |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Books====
=====''No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam''=====
{{main|No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam}}
''No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam'' is a non-fiction book published in 2005.  The book describes the history of Islam and argues for a liberal interpretation of the religion. It blames Western imperialism and self-serving misinterpretations of Islamic law by past scholars for the current controversies within Islam,&lt;ref name=ked&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikki R. |last=Keddie |title=Taking History on Faith |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32729-2005Apr6.html |date=2005-04-07 |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the "clash of civilizations" thesis.&lt;ref name=stan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2006/pr-aslan-102506.html|title=Author of No god but God: The Origins, Evolution and Future of Islam to speak on campus |publisher=stanford.edu |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''How to Win a Cosmic War'' (a.k.a. ''Beyond Fundamentalism'')=====
In 2009, Aslan published his second book, ''How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization, and the End of Terror.''  The following year, it was rereleased in paperback as ''Beyond Fundamentalism: Confronting Religious Extremism in the Age of Globalization.''&lt;ref name=foreign/&gt;  The book is both an in-depth study of the ideology fueling [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]] and like-minded militants throughout the Muslim world, and an exploration of religious violence in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The author argues that the United States, by infusing the [[War on Terror]] with its own religiously polarizing rhetoric, is fighting a similar war - a war that he asserts can't be won.&lt;ref name = "The Washington Post"/&gt;

Aslan refers to Al Qaeda's [[jihad]] against the west as "a cosmic war", distinct from holy war, in which rival religious groups are engaged in an earthly battle for material goals. "A cosmic war is like a ritual drama in which participants act out on earth a battle they believe is actually taking place in the heavens." American rhetoric of "war on terrorism", Aslan says, is in precise "cosmic dualism" to Al Qaeda's jihad. Aslan draws a distinction between [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]]. [[Islamists]] have legitimate goals and can be negotiated with, unlike [[Jihadists]], who dream of an idealized past of a [[pan Islamism|pan-Islamic]], borderless "religious communalism". Aslan's prescription for winning the cosmic war is not to fight, but rather to engage moderate Islamic political forces in the democratic process. "Throughout the Middle East, whenever moderate Islamist parties have been allowed to participate in the political process, popular support for more extremist groups has diminished."&lt;ref name = "The Washington Post"/&gt;

''The New Yorker'' called Beyond Fundamentalism a "thoughtful analysis of America's War on Terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/briefly-noted-914 |title=Briefly Noted |publisher=newyorker.com |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Post added that it "offers a very persuasive argument for the best way to counter jihadism."&lt;ref name = "The Washington Post"/&gt;

=====''Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth''=====
{{main|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth}}
In 2013, Aslan published ''Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,'' an [[Historical Jesus|historical account]] of the life of [[Jesus]], which analyzes the various [[religious perspectives on Jesus]], as well as the creation of [[Christianity]].  In the book, Aslan argues that Jesus was a political, rebellious and [[eschatological]] (end times) Jew whose proclamation of the coming kingdom of God was a call for regime change that would end Roman hegemony over Judea and end a corrupt and oppressive aristocratic priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/books/reza-aslans-zealot-the-life-and-times-of-jesus-of-nazareth.html |title=Still a Firebrand, 2,000 Years Later |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Believer''=====
In 2015, Aslan began production for "spiritual travel series" ''Believer'', a documentary series that follows Aslan as he immerses himself and experiences various religious traditions all over the world, focusing on sects considered fringe and disreputable by larger religions. The program, which Aslan compared to ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Makarechi|first1=Kia|title=Reza Aslan on the Stakes of America's "Crisis of Identity"|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/reza-aslan-believer-american-identity|work=Vanity Fair|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of CNN's original programming lineup and premiered in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2016/05/18/cnn-greenlights-three-new-cnnoriginals-for-2017-slate-picks-up-new-seasons-of-returning-series/ |title=CNN Greenlights Three New Original Series For The 2017 Programming Slate|publisher=CNN.com |date=2016-05-18 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-reza-aslan-believer-cnn-20150321-story.html |title=In CNN's 'Believer,' Reza Aslan to aim for a window on world religions |publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=2015-03-21 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remarks about President Trump====

After the [[June 2017 London Bridge attack]] Aslan took to Twitter to call President Trump "a piece of shit" and a "man baby" for his response to the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caitlin Yilek |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/cnn-host-calls-trump-a-piece-of-s-t-after-london-attack/article/2624900 |title=CNN host calls Trump 'a piece of s-t' after London attack |publisher=Washingtonexaminer.com |date=2017-06-04 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 9, 2017, in response to his remarks, CNN decided to cut ties with Aslan and announced they would not move forward with season two of the ''Believer'' series.&lt;ref name="StelterCNN06092017"&gt;Stelter, Brian.

I am a social commentator and scholar. And so I agree with CNN that it is best that we part ways."&lt;ref name="StelterCNN06092017" /&gt;

===Other media appearances===
Aslan has made numerous appearances on TV and radio, including [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), ''[[List of programs broadcast by Fox News Channel#FoxNews.com Live programming|Spirited Debate]]'' on Fox News, [[PBS]], ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'', ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'', and ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia's]]'' ''[[Big Ideas (Australia)|Big Ideas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2010/06/01/2913953.htm|title=Reza Aslan: Terrorism and How to Win a Cosmic War - Politics - Browse - Big Ideas - ABC TV|publisher=Abc.net.au|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013 Fox News interview ====
On 26 July 2013, Aslan was interviewed on ''Spirited Debate'', a [[Fox News]] [[webcast]] by Chief Religion Correspondent [[Lauren Green]] about his book ''[[Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]''.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/business/media/odd-fox-news-interview-lifts-reza-aslans-biography-on-jesus.html?_r=0|title=Odd Fox News Interview Lifts Reza Aslan's Biography on Jesus|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxInterviewAslan&gt;[http://video.foxnews.com/v/2568059649001/zealot-author-reza-aslan-responds-to-critics/?#sp=show-clips Fox News: "'Zealot' author Reza Aslan responds to critics"] Lauren Green interview of Reza Aslan on July 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Green was "unsatisfied with Aslan's credentials," and she pressed Aslan, questioning why a Muslim would write about Jesus.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-fox-news-reza-aslan-interview-lauren-green-jesus-20130729,0,5756316.story "Fox News interview with religion scholar Reza Aslan goes viral"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Aslan answered, "Because it's my job as an academic. I am a professor of religion, including the New Testament. That's what I do for a living, actually."  The interview lasted about ten minutes and focused "on Aslan's background more than the actual contents of the book."&lt;ref name=lat /&gt; The video clip of the interview went [[Viral video|viral]] within days&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; and the book, which was up to that point selling "steadily",&lt;ref name=fox /&gt; appeared at the 4th place on the ''[[New York Times]]'' print hardcover best-seller list.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; By late July 2013, it was topping the U.S. best-seller list on Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=sr_bs_1|title=Amazon Best Sellers: Best Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Aslan's interview with [[Fox News]], Elizabeth Castelli, professor of religion at [[Barnard College|Barnard College, Columbia University]], reported a sense of outrage in academia, writing "Those of us in the academic field of religious studies, especially biblical scholars and historians of [[early Christianity]], found the whole business deeply cringe-worthy. The [[Fox News]] interview was not just [[embarrassment|embarrassing]] but downright offensive. The [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] bias of Fox is well-documented and is bad enough, whatever the specific context. For scholars of religion, [[Lauren Green|Green]]'s conflation of the academic study of religion with personal religious identification is a familiar misunderstanding."&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt;

Despite Elizabeth Castelli's dismissal of Fox News for questioning Aslan as a religious scholar as she acknowledged Aslan could claim as a scholar of "history-of-religions", she dismissed his claims of being a historian. She wrote "''History of religions'' is [...] a particular disciplinary approach[...] often associated in the United States with the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]], where Aslan earned his [[PhD]] in [[sociology]]. To the extent that he did coursework in the UCSB Religious Studies department, he can certainly lay claim... But his claims are more grandiose than that and are based on his repeated public statements that he speaks with authority as a historian. He has therefore reasonably opened himself to criticism."&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' concurred with Prof. Castelli's acknowledgment on Aslan's religious credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=David A.|title=Is Muslim Academic Reza Aslan More Biased Than a Christian Scholar?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/is-muslim-academic-reza-aslan-more-biased-than-a-christian-scholar/278175/|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|date=July 29, 2013|quote=Aslan may not have a graduate degree in history, but he does have a Ph.D. and an M.T.S. that bear on the topic at hand. He has also published extensively on religion. Arguing he's somehow not a scholar, as John S. Dickerson did, isn't really credible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the journalist Manuel Roig-Franzia concurred with Prof. Castelli's critique of Aslan's historian credentials, noting that Aslan's university does not offer degrees in the history or the sociology of religion and writing that Aslan "boasts of academic laurels he does not have." However, he quoted Aslan's dissertation adviser, [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], who acknowledged that their departments "don't have a degree in sociology of religions as such" but said that he "doesn't have a problem with Aslan's characterization of his doctorate, noting... [Aslan] did most of his course work in religion" and his arrangement of getting Aslan out of the religious studies department into the sociology department "was undertaken to get Aslan out of time-consuming required language courses".&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/reza-aslan-a-jesus-scholar-whos-hard-to-pin-down/2013/08/08/2b6eee80-002b-11e3-9a3e-916de805f65d_story.html|title=Reza Aslan: A Jesus scholar who's hard to pin down|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' also noted UCSB "is famous for its [[interdisciplinary]] program—students tailor their studies around a topic, not a department. They choose a department only for the diploma."&lt;ref name=Philly&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Reza Aslan's 'Zealot': Muslim's book about Jesus stirs things up|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-09-18/entertainment/42151956_1_mediterranean-jewish-peasant-jesus-reza-aslan|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=September 23, 2013|date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aslan is a sitting member of the advisory board for the [[National Iranian American Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff &amp; Board|url=https://www.niacouncil.org/about-niac/staff-board/|website=National Iranian American Council|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 as a member of the group, he joined with 73 other "prominent International Relations and Middle East scholars" in signing a statement of support for the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], an international agreement regarding the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Studies Professors Shill for Iran on Nuclear Deal, Morally Equate US and Islamic Republic|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/09/02/middle-east-studies-professors-shill-for-iran-on-nuclear-deal-morally-equate-us-and-islamic-republic/|website=''The Algemeiner''|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saud|first1=Laith|title=Iran Deal Supporters Don't Care about Iraqi and Syrian People|url=http://chicagomonitor.com/2015/09/op-ed-iran-deal-supporters-dont-care-about-iraqi-and-syrian-people/|website=Chicago Monitor|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political analysis==

===Analysis of War on Terrorism===
[[File:Aslan, Reza -MBFI 2013 fRF 06.jpg|thumb|right|Reza Aslan at the [[Miami Book Fair International]] 2013]]
Aslan refers to Al Qaeda's ''[[jihad]]'' against the west as "a cosmic war", distinct from holy war, in which rival religious groups are engaged in an earthly battle for material goals. "A cosmic war is like a ritual drama in which participants act out on earth a battle they believe is actually taking place in the heavens." American rhetoric of "[[War on Terror|war on terrorism]]", Aslan says, is in precise "cosmic dualism" to Al Qaeda's ''jihad''. Aslan draws a distinction between [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]]. Islamists have legitimate goals and can be negotiated with, unlike Jihadists, who dream of an idealized past of a [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]], borderless "religious communalism". Aslan's prescription for winning the cosmic war is not to fight, but rather to engage moderate Islamic political forces in the democratic process. "Throughout the Middle East, whenever moderate Islamist parties have been allowed to participate in the political process, popular support for more extremist groups has diminished."&lt;ref name="The Washington Post" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/26/AR2009062601717.html|title=Book Review: 'How to Win a Cosmic War' by Reza Aslan|publisher=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of religious freedom===
Aslan has argued for religious freedom and protection for religious minorities throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name=WPIRAN&gt;{{cite news|author= Reza Aslan and Michael Brooks|title=For Iran's Rouhani, the human rights of Baha'is are the ultimate test of reform |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/wp/2013/09/25/for-irans-rouhani-the-human-rights-of-bahais-are-the-ultimate-test-of-reform/ |publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2013|date=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForeignAffairs&gt;{{cite news|last=Aslan |first=Reza |title=The Christian Exodus |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139917/reza-aslan/the-christian-exodus |publisher=[[Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=September 25, 2013|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called for Iran to protect and stop the "horrific human rights abuses" against its [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]] community.&lt;ref name=WPIRAN /&gt; Aslan has also said that the persecution and displacement of Middle Eastern Christian communities "is nothing less than a regional religious cleansing that will soon prove to be a historic disaster for Christians and Muslims alike."&lt;ref name=ForeignAffairs /&gt;

===Criticism of New Atheism===
In a 2014 interview, Aslan criticized the "armchair atheism" of atheists like [[Sam Harris]] and [[Bill Maher]] for not having a formal background in the study of religion, and who in Aslan's opinion are therefore unable to effectively comment on how it shapes human behavior.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web |title=Reza Aslan on What the New Atheists Get Wrong About Islam|url= http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/10/reza-aslan-on-what-the-new-atheists-get-wrong.html |first=Jesse |last=Singal |publisher=New York Magazine |date=October 14, 2014 |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aslan has also referred to [[Richard Dawkins]] as a "buffoon, embarrassing himself every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/14/reza-aslan-zealot-fox-news-dawkins|title=Reza Aslan on Zealot, Fox News and Richard Dawkins|first=Sophie|last=Heawood|date=14 August 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] to the "philosophical atheism" of earlier thinkers who "were experts in religion, and so they were able to offer critiques of it that came from a place of knowledge, from a sophistication of education, of research."&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

On 29 September 2014, Antonia Blumberg in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' stated that Reza Aslan, on [[CNN]], "criticized comedian [[Bill Maher]] for characterizing [[female genital mutilation]] as an 'Islamic problem,' in addition to making several other sweeping generalizations about the faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/30/reza-aslan-bill-maher_n_5907612.html|title=Reza Aslan Blasts Bill Maher, Media For 'Unsophisticated' Reporting On Islam|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=30 September 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=4 October 2014|quote=Reza Aslan has a thing or two to say about media coverage of Islam. Speaking in that CNN interview, Aslan criticized comedian Bill Maher for characterizing female genital mutilation as an "Islamic problem," in addition to making several other sweeping generalizations about the faith. "When it comes to the topic of religion he's not very sophisticated in the way that he thinks," Aslan said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aslan was reported as saying that "To say 'Muslim countries', as though Pakistan and Turkey are the same... it's frankly, and I use this word seriously, stupid!"  His criticism was not just of Maher, but of the overall way Muslims are portrayed in mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/01/reza-aslan-slams-the-bigoted-media-for-generalisation-that-muslims-are-misogynistic-and-violent_n_5915176.html|title=Reza Aslan Slams 'Bigoted' Media For Generalisation That Muslims Are Misogynistic And Violent|date=1 October 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prachi Gupta, in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', wrote that Reza Aslan believed that the United States was partnering with [[Saudi Arabia]] while simultaneously condemning [[ISIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/30/reza_aslan_takes_down_bill_mahers_facile_arguments_on_islam_in_just_5_minutes/|title=Reza Aslan takes down Bill Maher's "facile arguments" on Islam in just 5 minutes|last=Gupta|first=Prachi|date=30 September 2014|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=4 October 2014|quote=He also pointed out the U.S.'s own hypocrisy in calling out ISIS for its brutality while partnering with Saudi Arabia: "Look, Saudi Arabia is one of the most, if not the most, extremist countries in the world. In the month that we've been talking about ISIS and their terrible actions in Iraq and Syria, Saudi Arabia, our closest ally, has beheaded 19 people."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2014, Aslan published a ''[[New York Times]]'' article titled, "Bill Maher Isn't the Only One Who Misunderstands Religion" writing that, "Bill Maher is right to condemn religious practices that violate fundamental human rights. Religious communities must do more to counter extremist interpretations of their faith. But failing to recognize that religion is embedded in culture—and making a blanket judgment about the world's second largest religion—is simply bigotry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|title=Bill Maher Isn't the Only One Who Misunderstands Religion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/opinion/bill-maher-isnt-the-only-one-who-misunderstands-religion.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', Eric Sasson took issue with Aslan's claim in the CNN interview that men and women are treated equally in [[Indonesia]] and [[Turkey]] due to the countries having elected female leaders, pointing out that the [[Human Rights Watch]] reported a "significant rollback" of women's rights in both countries. Sasson also challenged Aslan's statement that female genital mutilation is only a problem in Central Africa, stating that it's also an issue in the predominantly Muslim country of [[Malaysia]], which is in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sasson|first1=Eric|title=Yes, Bill Maher Is Boorish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5650">The '''rotation model of learning''' involves the traditional face-to-face learning with [[E-learning|online learning]]. In this, the time schedule is divided and fixed between these two processes or it runs on the teacher's discretion for a given course. The classroom [[teacher]] usually monitors both the face-to-face and online learning, and the online learning takes place on a one-to-one basis. Students rotate across online learning, small group instruction and pencil-pen assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |title=Blending Learning: |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126073710/http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model includes four sub-models:
# Station rotation: a rotation model in which for a given course or the subject, the student rotate on a fixed schedule or at teacher's discretion one online learning station to another which might be activities such as small group instruction, group projects, and individual tutoring. It differs from individual-rotation model.
# Lab-rotation model: The student rotates to a [[brick and mortar]] [[computer lab]] for online learning station.
# Flipped-classroom model: In this, the students rotate on a fixed schedule or at a teacher's discretion across the classroom learning and online learning after the school hours. The online learning acts as a primary source for the content to be taught in the next day's class.
# Individual-rotation model: In this rotation model, the teacher sets individual timing for the students for rotation among different learning modalities. It differs from other rotation models as the student doesn't have to rotate to each available station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf |title=Model 1: ROTATION  A. Station-Rotation model |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926043046/http://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Station rotation, lab-rotation, and [[flipped classroom|flipped-classroom]] rotation are to be considered truly [[blended learning|blended]] or hybrid classrooms while individual-rotation model borders on a more typical online classroom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.christenseninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Is-K-12-Blended-Learning-Disruptive.pdf|title = Is K-12 Blended Learning Disruptive? An introduction of the theory of hybrids|last = Christensen|first = Clayton|date = May 2013|journal = Clayton Christensen Institute|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Station, lab, and flipped-classroom rotations are considered to be blended, or hybrid classrooms, because they meet the four criteria; they represent an integration of old and new styles, they are designed with traditional mainstream [[curriculum]] in mind with the addition of [[online content]], they keep students in their seats in traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms, and they are not simpler versions of the class but integrated classrooms where the teacher still needs expertise from traditional styles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The individual-rotation model, while considered a blended classroom, really falls closer to online learning. The curriculum is built for the individual, meaning that students could independently work completely online if this style suits them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over all the rotation model of learning consists of the following components:
* Personalized online instruction
* Teacher led small group instruction
* Independent and collaborative practice

== Role of teacher ==
In the rotation model, teachers navigate the program in such a way that they would be aware of the issues faced by the students during their independent work time, which helps in designing [[educational assessment|assessment tool]]s to monitor their students' learning path. 
Teachers should follow certain guidelines to assist the students to use [[computer]]s effectively, appropriately and safely.
Teachers should be always prepared for technical issues or the power outages coming up between or before the class.
They should address the behaviour of the students on the computer.
The physical layout of the class should be designed for the transition happening during the rotations.

== Advantages ==
This model helps the students to receive differentiated experiences from face-to-face learning to online learning along with independent and [[Collaborative learning|collaborative practice]].
This model helps students to learn on their own pace and researchers have shown that these students out performs the students who have exposure only to one type of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |title=BLENDED LEARNING 101 |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021130409/http://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">'''Scientifically based research''' ('''SBR''') is the required standard in professional development and the foundation of academic instruction under the guidelines of [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 (NCLB).&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg107.html Title IX - General Provisions]. Department of Education. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of what should be considered to be "scientifically based" has been the subject of a great deal of controversy, particularly relating to the Reading First program authorized under NCLB. The first time the concept appeared in Federal legislation was in the Reading Excellence Act, and subsequently the term appeared in the Comprehensive School Reform program authorized for many years on the annual appropriations bills.

NCLB, however, marked the first time that the idea that education practice should be scientifically based became a central feature of major federal education legislation. Within the Act, the Reading First program became the standard bearer for this concept – or its misapplication. After publishing a series of 7 reports on the mismanagement of Reading First – and referring the matter to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] – the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested that the US Congress clarify what is meant by scientifically based, and whether it is sufficient to contain elements that have been researched, or whether it's necessary for a program's efficacy to have itself been researched.

Since the 2001 passage of NCLB, various efforts have been undertaken both by the US government and by private businesses to create databases of such scientifically based, or scientifically proven, programs. Examples of these databases include the [[What Works Clearinghouse]], a program of the federal [[Institute of Education Sciences]] that has been criticized for its questionable standards{{Citation needed|date = September 2013}} and extremely slow review process; the Doing What Works web site, an attempt to address criticisms of the WWC; and the Best Evidence Encyclopedia, a grant-funded site operating under the Center for Data-Driven Reform in Education. This site, known as the BEE, synthesizes the available research on specific education programs in several formats, including summaries directed to educators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44756">'''Sluggish cognitive tempo''' ('''SCT''') is the term for a [[syndrome]] that may comprise a novel and distinct attention disorder from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]]. Symptoms of it include dreaminess, [[Clouding of consciousness|mental fogginess]], [[hypoactivity]], sluggishness, staring frequently, inconsistent [[alertness]] and a slow working speed.

SCT has been a subject of controversy for decades and debate about its nature still continues. But it is clear now that this set of symptoms is important because it significantly adds to impairment in ADHD and independently predicts a low [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mary Silva (Cincinnati Children's Hospital 2015).

Barkley|publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online|year=2015|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935291.013.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, SCT was thought to be entirely limited to about 1/3 of the [[Inattentive ADD|inattentive subtype of ADHD]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and being apparently incompatible with hyperactivity. But new studies showed that it is also seen in some with the other two ADHD subtypes – and in individuals without ADHD as well. Therefore, some psychologists and psychiatrists think it should be its own [[psychiatric disorder|mental disorder]]. Others dismiss it altogether or believe it is a separate symptom group within ADHD (like Hyperactivity, Impulsivity or Inattention). It even may be useful as a transdiagnostic concept that is shared among different mental disorders (like [[emotional dysregulation]], for example, which cuts across many disorders).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[ADHD]] is the only disorder of attention currently defined by the [[DSM-5]] or [[ICD-10]]. Formal diagnosis is made by a qualified professional. It includes demonstrating six or more of the following symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (or both).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;APA (2013)''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Persistent+pattern+of+inattention#v=snippet&amp;q=Persistent%20pattern%20of%20inattention&amp;f=false Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]'' (Fifth ed.). {{ISBN|978-0-89042-555-8}}. pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html|title=ADHD: Symptoms and Diagnosis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms must also be [[Age-inappropriate|age inappropriate]], start before age 12, occur often and be present in at least two settings. They must clearly interfere with social, school, or work functioning and not be better explained by another mental disorder. Based on the above symptoms, three types of ADHD are defined:

* a predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I)
* a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD-HI)
* a combined presentation (ADHD-C)

SCT is proposed to be a similar disorder to the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive presentation]] (ADHD-I), but can be distinguished from it by the very different symptoms shown below who were developed by leading researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2016|title=The Internal, External, and Diagnostic Validity of Sluggish Cognitive Tempo: A Meta-Analysis and Critical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288021110|journal=Journal of the AACAP.|volume=55|issue=|pages=163–178|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2015.12.006|pmc=4764798|via=|author=Stephen P.

As a  comparison of both tables shows, there is no overlap between the official ADHD-I symptoms and those for SCT (although both may exist in parallel within the same person). Yet, one problem is still that some individuals who actually have SCT are currently misdiagnosed with the inattentive presentation. &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D_PswEACAAJ|title=Oxford textbook of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780191059766|edition=First|location=|pages=147–154|chapter=Sluggish cognitive tempo (Chapter 15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social behaviour ===
In many ways, those who have an SCT profile have some of the opposite symptoms of those with classic ADHD: instead of being [[hyperactive]], [[extroverted]], obtrusive, excessively energetic and risk takers, those with SCT are drifting, [[Absent-mindedness|absent-minded]], listless, [[Introspection|introspective]] and daydreamy. They feel as if "in the fog" and seem "out of it".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Russel A. Barkley (2013): [https://books.google.com/books?id=BSLF7yueqoUC&amp;pg=PA150 Two Types of Attention Disorders Now Recognized by Clinical Scientists.] In: Taking Charge of ADHD: The Complete, Authoritative Guide for Parents''. Guilford Press (3rd ed.), p.150. {{ISBN|978-1-46250-789-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] psychiatric problems often associated with SCT are more often of the [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing types]], such as [[anxiety]], unhappiness or [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caryn Carlson, Miranda Mann|first=|year=2002|title=Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Predicts a Different Pattern of Impairment in the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caryn_Carlson/publication/11514939_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_Predicts_a_Different_Pattern_of_Impairment_in_the_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Predominantly_Inattentive_Type/links/53e9241b0cf2fb1b9b64f355.pdf|journal=Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=123–129|doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3101_14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most consistent across studies was a pattern of reticence and [[Shyness|social withdrawal]] in interactions with peers. Their typically shy nature and slow response time has often been misinterpreted as aloofness or disinterest by others. In social group interactions, those with SCT may be ignored. People with classic ADHD are more likely to be rejected in these situations, because of their social [[intrusiveness]] or aggressive behavior. Compared to children with SCT, they are also much more likely to show [[Externalizing disorders|antisocial behaviours]] like [[substance abuse]], [[oppositional-defiant disorder]] or [[conduct disorder]] (frequent lying, stealing, fighting etc.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fittingly, in terms of personality, ADHD seems to be associated with sensitivity to reward and fun seeking while SCT may be associated with [[Fear of negative evaluation|punishment sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2013|title=Reward and punishment sensitivity are differentially associated with ADHD and sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms in children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/256287832_Reward_and_punishment_sensitivity_are_differentially_associated_with_ADHD_and_sluggish_cognitive_tempo_symptoms_in_children/links/0a85e53262a0de646f000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47|issue=|pages=719–727|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.07.001|via=|author=Stephen P. Becker et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Attention deficits ===
Those with SCT symptoms may show a qualitatively different kind of attention deficit that is more typical of a true information input-output problem, such as poor [[Selective attention|focusing of attention]] on details or the capacity to distinguish important from unimportant information rapidly. In contrast, people with ADHD have more difficulties with [[Sustained attention|persistence of attention]] and action toward goals coupled with impaired resistance to responding to distractions. Unlike SCT, they also have no difficulty processing information or selecting and filtering sensory input. Instead, those with classic ADHD have problems with [[Impulsiveness|inhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Weiler et al. (2002): [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00222194020350050501 Information Processing Deficits in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Inattentive Type, and Children with Reading Disability]. doi: 10.1177/00222194020350050501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some think that SCT and ADHD produce two different kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the attentional style in SCT may be more halting and sluggish, whereas in ADHD it is jumpy and flighty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEhsBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult ADHD: An integrative psychosocial and medical approach.|first=J.

A series of studies in children who would now be classified as CB failed to identify deficits in the stimulus input stages of information-processing (Sergeant, 2005). The observably more sluggish orientation and response style of the child with PI by contrast, does suggest deficits in these early attentional processes.|via=|pmc=2265203|pmid=17629724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both disorders interfere significantly with academic performance but may do so by different means. SCT may be more problematic with the accuracy of the work a child does in school and lead to  making more errors. Conversely, ADHD may more adversely affect productivity which represents the amount of work done in a particular time interval. Children with SCT seem to have more difficulty with consistently remembering things that were previously learned and make more mistakes on [[Recall (memory)|memory retrieval]] tests than do children with ADHD. They have been found to perform much worse on psychological tests involving perceptual-motor speed or [[hand-eye coordination]] and speed. They also have a more disorganized thought process, a greater degree of sloppiness, and lose things more easily. The risk for additional [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]] seems equal in both ADHD and SCT (23–50%) but math disorders may be more frequent in the SCT-group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A key behavioral characteristic of those with SCT symptoms is that they are more likely to appear to be lacking motivation and may even have an unusually higher frequency of daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen P. Becker et al.|first=|year=2014|title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Dimensions and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Symptoms in Relation to College Students’ Sleep Functioning|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/260153858_Attention-DeficitHyperactivity_Disorder_Dimensions_and_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_Symptoms_in_Relation_to_College_Students'_Sleep_Functioning/links/00b7d52f9811d748ba000000.pdf|journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=675–685|doi=10.1007/s10578-014-0436-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to lack energy to deal with mundane tasks and will consequently seek to concentrate on things that are mentally stimulating perhaps because of their [[Low arousal theory|underaroused state]]. Alternatively, SCT may involve a pathological form of excessive [[mind-wandering]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Executive function ===
The [[executive system]] of the human brain provides for the cross-temporal organization of behavior towards goals and the future and coordinates actions and strategies for everyday goal-directed tasks.  Essentially, this system permits humans to self-regulate their behavior so as to sustain action and problem solving toward goals specifically and the future more generally. [[Dysexecutive syndrome]] is defined as a "cluster of impairments generally associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain" which includes "difficulties with high-level tasks such as planning, organising, initiating, monitoring and adapting behaviour".&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|year=|title=Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS)|url=http://www.sxf.uevora.pt/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Munir_2003.pdf#page=38|journal=Journal of Occupational Psychology, Employment and Disability|volume=5|issue=2|pages=33–37|issn=1740-4193|via=|last1=Barbara A. Wilson|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive deficits pose serious problems for a person's ability to engage in self-regulation over time to attain their goals and anticipate and prepare for the future.

[[Adele Diamond]] postulated that the core cognitive deficit of those with ADHD-I is [[working memory]], or, as she coined in her recent paper on the subject, "childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome".&lt;ref name="Diamond05" /&gt; However, two more recent studies by Barkley found that while children and adults with SCT had some deficits in [[executive functions]] (EF) in everyday life activities, they were primarily of far less magnitude and largely centered around problems with self-organization and problem-solving.  Even then, analyses showed that most of the difficulties with EF deficits were the result of overlapping ADHD symptoms that may co-exist with SCT rather than being attributable to SCT itself.  More research on the link of SCT to EF deficits is clearly indicated—but, as of this time, SCT does not seem to be as strongly associated with EF deficits as is ADHD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
SCT is currently not an official diagnosis in [[DSM-5]] and no universally accepted set of symptoms exists yet. But there are [[rating scale]]s that can be used to screen for SCT symptoms such as the ''Concentration Inventory'' (for children and adults) or the ''Barkley Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Scale-Children and Adolescents (BSCTS-CA)''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Becker et al.: [http://stephenbecker.weebly.com/measures.html Concentration Inventory for Children and Adults].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ''Comprehensive Behaviour Rating Scale for Children'' (CBRSC), an older scale, can also be used for SCT as this case study shows.&lt;ref name="KamphausFrick2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3sqjg8j7P8C&amp;pg=PA395|title=Clinical Assessment of Child And Adolescent Personality And Behavior|author1=Randy W.

Although having no diagnosic code either, [[ICD-10]] mentions the SCT group as a reason for why it did not replace the term ''"[[Hyperkinetic disorder|Hyperkinetic Disorder]]''" with ''"ADHD".''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf#206|title=ICD-10 – Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|last=|first=|publisher=WHO (2010)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=206|chapter=Hyperkinetic disorders (F90)|quote=In recent years the use of the diagnostic term attention deficit disorder" for these syndromes has been promoted.  It has not been used here because it implies a knowledge of psychological processes that is not yet available, and it suggests the inclusion of anxious, preoccupied, or "dreamy" apathetic children whose problems are probably different.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mental disorders may produce similar symptoms to SCT (e.g. excessive daydreaming or "staring blankly") and should not be confused with it. Examples might be conditions like [[depersonalization disorder]], [[dysthymia]], [[hypothyroidism|thyroid problems]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[absence seizure]]s, [[Bipolar II disorder]], [[Kleine–Levin syndrome]], forms of [[autism]] or [[schizoid personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="DSM3"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm3.pdf#323|title=Schizoid Personality Disorder, Associated features|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0521315289|volume=[[DSM-III]] (1980)|location=|pages=310|chapter=|quote=Individuals with this disorder are often unable to express aggressiveness or hostility.

== Impact on functioning ==
Additional requirements for a proposed SCT diagnosis (such as the number and duration of symptoms or the impact on functioning) are continuing to be investigated. But there is no doubt that both ADHD and SCT are found in children and adults and are linked to significant impairment and a diminished [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life (QoL)]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; SCT on its own is linked to increased stress as well as lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The research by Barkley suggests that ADHD and SCT compound each other if they occur together: In adults, those comorbid cases were more likely to be unmarried and to be out of work on disability compared to cases with ADHD only. But SCT alone is also present in the population and can be quite impairing in educational and occupational settings, even if it is not as pervasively impairing as ADHD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Unlike ADHD, the general causes of SCT symptoms are almost unknown, though one recent study of twins suggested that the condition appears to be nearly as heritable or genetically influenced in nature as ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2014|title=A Twin Study of the Relationships among Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Problems|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/182b/9e7e797481546b9dc13c24c350aa8ecf4220.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=42|issue=|pages=63–75|doi=10.1007/s10802-013-9725-0|via=|author=Sara Moruzzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say that the majority of differences among individuals in these traits in the population may be due mostly to variation in their genes. The heritability of SCT symptoms in that study was only slightly lower than that for ADHD symptoms with a somewhat greater share of trait variation being due to unique environmental events. For instance, in ADHD, the genetic contribution to individual differences in ADHD traits typically averages between 75 and 80% and may even be as high as 90%+ in some studies.  That for SCT may be 50–60%.

Far less is known about SCT yet the symptoms seem to indicate that the posterior attention networks may be more involved in the disorder than the prefrontal cortex region of the brain and difficulties with working memory so prominent in ADHD. This hypothesis gained greater support following a 2015 fMRI-study comparing Inattentive ADHD and SCT-diagnosed patients, which found that the left [[superior parietal lobule]] (SPL) showed remarkably decreased activity in SCT-[[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2015|title=Differentiating SCT and inattentive symptoms in ADHD using fMRI measures of cognitive control|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d06a/e7a531a6ac492a0455eb2cf4dc61fa457fef.pdf|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|volume=8|issue=|pages=390–397|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2015.05.007|pmid=26106564|via=|author=Catherine Fassbender et al.|pmc=4474281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ADHD in which there exist hundreds of studies on molecular genetics identifying candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, there are no studies of molecular genetics that specifically evaluated individuals having SCT. Although ADHD appears to be linked to problems with the availability of or sensitivity to [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] and the efficiency of the large chemical structures of the specific receptors and re-uptake receptors, the neurotransmitters that may be linked to SCT are unknown.

Recently a study showed a small link between thyroid functioning and SCT symptoms suggesting that thyroid dysfunction is not the cause of SCT. High rates of SCT were observed in children who had suffered [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder|prenatal alcohol exposure]] and in survivors of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]], where they were associated with [[Radiation therapy#Late side effects|cognitive late effects]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2012|title=A preliminary investigation of the relation between thyroid functioning and sluggish cognitive tempo in children|url=|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|volume=|issue=|page=|pages=|doi=10.1177/1087054712466917|via=|author=Stephen Becker et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2013|title=Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo|url=http://www.uncnri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Prenatal-Alcohol-Exposure-ADHD-and-Sluggish-Cognitive-Tempo.pdf|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research|volume=37|issue=|pages=338–346|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01886.x|via=|author=Diana M.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of SCT has not been well investigated. Initial drug studies were done only with the ADHD medication [[methylphenidate]] (e.g. Ritalin'''®'''), and even then only with children who were diagnosed as ADD without hyperactivity (using [[DSM III#DSM-III (1980)|DSM-III]] criteria) and not specifically for SCT. The research seems to have found that most children with ADD with Hyperactivity (currently ADHD-C) responded well at medium-to-high doses.&lt;ref name="Diamond05"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2005|title=ADD (ADHD without hyperactivity): a neurobiologically and behaviorally distinct disorder from ADHD with hyperactivity|journal=Dev.

Barkley, George DuPaul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one study and a retrospective analysis of medical histories found that the presence or absence of SCT symptoms made no difference in response to methylphenidate in children with ADHD-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2009|title=Do Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Symptoms Predict Response to Methylphenidate in Patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder–Inattentive Type?|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychopharmacology|volume=19|issue=4|pages=461–465|doi=10.1089/cap.2008.0115|via=|author1=Henrique T. Ludwig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But these studies did not specifically and explicitly examine the effect of the drug on SCT symptoms in children. The only medication study to date who did this used [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) and found it to have significant beneficial effects that were independent of ADHD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith McBurnett|first=|year=2016|title=Atomoxetine-Related Change in Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Is Partially Independent of Change in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Inattentive Symptoms|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–42|doi=10.1089/cap.2016.0115|via=|pmid=27845858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one study has investigated the use of [[behavior modification]] methods at home and school for children with predominantly SCT symptoms and it found good success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linda Pfiffner|first=|year=2007|title=A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Integrated Home-School Behavioral Treatment for ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type|url=|journal=J.

In April 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that sluggish cognitive tempo is the subject of pharmaceutical company clinical drug trials, including ones by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] that proposed that one of its biggest-selling drugs, [[Strattera]], could be prescribed to treat proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo.&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt; Other researchers believe that there is no effective treatment for SCT.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
The [[prognosis]] of SCT is unknown. In contrast, much is known about the adolescent and adult outcomes of children having ADHD. Those with SCT symptoms typically show a later onset of their symptoms than do those with ADHD, perhaps by as much as a year or two later on average. They have as much or more difficulty with academic tasks and far fewer social difficulties than do people having ADHD. They do not have the same risks for oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or social aggression and thus may have different life course outcomes compared to children with ADHD-HI and Combined subtypes who have far higher risks for these other "[[Externalizing disorders|externalizing]]" disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, unlike ADHD, there are no longitudinal studies of children with SCT that can shed light on the developmental course and adolescent or adult outcomes of these individuals.

== Epidemiology ==
Recent studies indicate that the symptoms of SCT in children form two dimensions: daydreamy-spacey and sluggish-lethargic, and that the former are more distinctive of the disorder from ADHD than the latter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erik G.

Yet it is one that overlaps with ADHD in 30–50% of cases of each disorder, suggesting a pattern of comorbidity between two related disorders rather than subtypes of the same disorder. Nevertheless, SCT is strongly correlated with ADHD inattentive and combined subtypes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to a Norwegian study, "SCT correlated significantly with inattentiveness, regardless of the subtype of ADHD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benedicte Skirbekk et al.|first=|year=2011|title=The relationship between sluggish cognitive tempo, subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety disorders|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=513–525|doi=10.1007/s10802-011-9488-4|via=|pmid=21331639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early observations===
[[File:H Hoffmann Struwwel 22.jpg|thumb|upright|230px|Johnny Head-in-Air is an absent-minded boy who seems unaware of his surroundings.]]

There have been descriptions in literature for centuries of children who are very inattentive and prone to foggy thought.

Symptoms similar to [[ADHD]] were first systematically described in 1775 by [[History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Melchior Adam Weikard|Melchior Adam Weikard]] and in 1798 by [[Alexander Crichton]] in their medical textbooks. Although Weikard mainly described a single disorder of attention resembling the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD, Crichton postulates an additional attention disorder, described as a "morbid diminution of its power or energy", and further explores possible "corporeal" and "mental" causes for the disorder (including "irregularities in diet, excessive evacuations, and the abuse of corporeal desires"). However, he does not further describe any symptoms of the disorder, making this an early but certainly non-specific reference to an SCT-like syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlRJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA254|title=An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement|last=Alexander Crichton|first=|date=1798|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 2. On Attention, and its diseases|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One example from fictional literature is [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s character of "Johnny Head-in-Air" (''Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft''), in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (1845). (Some researchers see several characters in this book as showing signs of child psychiatric disorders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=1970|title=Hyperactive children|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=222|issue=|pages=94–98|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0470-94|via=|author=Mark A. Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian pediatrician Guy Falardeau, besides working with hyperactive children, also wrote about very dreamy, quiet and well-behaved children that he encountered in his practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Falardeau|title=Les enfants hyperactifs et lunatiques|year=1997|ISBN=978-2890446267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First research efforts===

In more modern times, research surrounding attention disorders has traditionally focused on hyperactive symptoms, but began to newly address inattentive symptoms in the 1970s. Influenced by this research, the [[DSM-III]] (1980) allowed for the first time a diagnosis of an ADD subtype that presented without hyperactivity. Researchers exploring this subtype created rating scales for children which included questions regarding symptoms such as short attention span, distractibility, drowsiness, and passivity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen P. Becker et al.|first=|year=2014|title=Sluggish cognitive tempo in abnormal child psychology: an historical overview and introduction to the special section|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/258856101_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_in_Abnormal_Child_Psychology_An_Historical_Overview_and_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section/links/00b4952dd32463fafb000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1007/s10802-013-9825-x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1980s, it was proposed that as opposed to the then accepted dichotomy of ADD with or without hyperactivity (ADD/H, ADD/noH), instead a three factor model of ADD was more appropriate, consisting of hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention-disorganization, and slow tempo subtypes.&lt;ref name="Lahey88"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=1988|title=Dimensions and Types of Attention Deficit Disorder|url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)65585-4/|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=27|issue=3|pages=330–335|doi=10.1097/00004583-198805000-00011|via=|vauthors=Lahey BB, Pelham WE, Schaughency EA, Atkins MS, Murphy A, Hynd G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Weinberg and Brumback proposed a new disorder: "primary disorder of vigilance" (PVD). Characteristic symptoms of it were difficulty sustaining [[alertness]] and [[arousal]], daydreaming, difficulty focusing attention, losing one's place in activities and conversation, slow completion of tasks and a kind personality. The most detailed case report in their article looks like a prototypical representation of SCT. The authors acknowledged an overlap of PVD and ADHD but argued in favor of considering PVD to be distinct in its unique cognitive impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/book/10.3109/9781420017144|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder – Concepts, Controversies, New Directions.|last=Keith McBurnett|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8247-2927-1|location=|page=352|pages=|chapter=Sluggish Cognitive Tempo: The Promise and Problems of Measuring Syndromes in the Attention Spectrum|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren Weinberg, Roger Brumback|first=|year=1990|title=Primary disorder of vigilance: A novel explanation of inattentiveness, daydreaming, boredom, restlessness, and sleepiness|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002234760582654X|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=116|issue=5|pages=720–725|doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82654-x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problematic with the paper is that it dismissed ADHD as a nonexistent disorder (despite it having several thousand research studies by then) and preferred the term PVD for this SCT-like symptom complex.  A further difficulty with the PVD diagnosis is that not only is it based merely on 6 cases instead of the far larger samples of SCT children used in other studies but the very term implies that science has established the underlying cognitive deficits giving rise to SCT symptoms, and this is hardly the case.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With the publication of [[DSM-IV]] in 1994, the disorder was labeled as [[ADHD]], and was divided into three subtypes: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. Of the proposed SCT specific symptoms discussed while developing the DSM-IV, only "forgetfulness" was included in the symptom list for ADHD-I, and no others were mentioned. However, several of the proposed SCT symptoms were included in the diagnosis of "ADHD, not otherwise specified".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Prior to 2001, there were a total of four scientific journal articles specifically addressing symptoms of SCT. But then a researcher suggested that sluggish tempo symptoms (such as inconsistent alertness and orientation) were, in fact, adequate for the diagnosis of ADHD-I. Thus, he argued, their exclusion from DSM-IV was inappropriate.&lt;ref name="McBurnett01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keith McBurnett et al|year=2001|title=Symptom properties as a function of ADHD type: An argument for continued study of sluggish cognitive tempo|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=207–213|doi=10.1023/A:1010377530749|via=|pmid=11411783}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research article and its accompanying commentary urging the undertaking of more research on SCT spurred the publication of over 30 scientific journal articles to date which specifically address symptoms of SCT.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, with the publication of [[DSM-5]] in 2013, ADHD continues to be classified as predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type and there continues to be no mention of SCT as a diagnosis or a diagnosis subtype anywhere in the manual. The diagnosis of "ADHD, not otherwise specified"  also no longer includes any mention of SCT symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similarly, [[ICD-10]], the medical diagnostic manual, has no diagnosis code for SCT. Although SCT is not recognized as a disorder at this point, researchers continue to debate its usefulness as a construct and its implications for further attention disorder research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Controversy ==

Significant skepticism has been raised within the medical and scientific communities as to whether SCT, currently considered a "symptom cluster," actually exists as a distinct disorder.&lt;ref name="schwarz1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/health/idea-of-new-attention-disorder-spurs-research-and-debate.html |title=Idea of New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and Debate|author=Alan Schwarz |work=The New York Times |date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Allen Frances]], an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University, has commented "We're seeing a fad in evolution: Just as ADHD has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another. This is a public health experiment on millions of kids...I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant. The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world."&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt;

[[UCLA]] researcher and [[Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology]] editorial board member Steve S. Lee has also expressed concern based on SCT's close relationship to ADHD, cautioning that a pattern of over-diagnosis of the latter has "already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources." Lee states, "The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have [sluggish cognitive tempo], and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real...ADHD has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of SCT."&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt;

Adding to the controversy are potential conflicts of interest among the condition's proponents, including the funding of prominent SCT researchers' work by the global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt; and, in the case of [[Russell Barkley|Dr. Russell Barkley]], a leader in the burgeoning SCT research field, direct financial ties to that company (Dr. Barkley has received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly).&lt;ref name=ProPublica&gt;{{cite web|title=Has Your Health Professional Received Drug Company Money?|url=http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/search?utf8=_&amp;term=barkley&amp;state%5Bid%5D=41&amp;company%5Bid%5D=&amp;period%5B%5D=&amp;services%5B%5D=|work=[[ProPublica]]|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to the "increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT", Dr. Barkley writes "The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others."&lt;ref name="Barkley, R. A. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

The '''Technology Student Association''' ('''TSA''') is a national student organization created to develop skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well as business education. TSA aims to develop leadership, academic, and business management skills in the workplace among students and leaders within the community. The organization has 250,000 members.&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/sites/default/files/2017%20Conference%20Program.pdf|title=National TSA Conference: Defining Your Future|publisher=Technology Student Association|date=2017-06-21|accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 national conference was held June 21–25, 2017, in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref name="TSA Conference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsaweb.org/National-Conference|title=National Conference|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 national conference will be held June 22-26, 2018, in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref name="TSA Conference 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/2018-national-conference|title=National Conference|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==
Competitive events are separated into middle school and high school levels, with students competing only with their respective age group. Competitions take place at the local, state, regional and national level. A component of leadership is often entailed in events at both levels, with some events being devoted to leadership (such as the Leadership Challenge).

All TSA competitions are correlated with national science, technology, engineering and mathematics and business standards. Expert judging by technology educators and industry representatives inspires the best from participants. Sample middle school events include Agriculture and Biotechnology Issues, Career Prep, Video Game Design, and Inventions and Innovations. High school events include [[Animatronics]], [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD), [[CO2 dragster|Dragster Design]], Promotional Design, System Control Technology, Flight Endurance, Software Development, and Desktop Publishing.&lt;ref name="TSAOurStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/Our-Story |title=Our Story |publisher=Technology Student Association |work=TSAweb.org  |date= |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scores are out of 100 points and based upon a nationally developed rubric.  Winners are chosen based on these scores.  In many events, semi-finalists (top 12) move onto a second round of competition which usually involves an interview with the judges about the project.  First, second, and third-place winners are awarded a trophy, and finalists (top 10) are recognized at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/Competitions |title=Competitions |publisher=Technology Student Association |work=TSAweb.org  |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program initiatives===

The Technology Student Association has partnered with many groups to promote other skills. [[Junior Solar Sprint]] is a national program allows students to design solar-powered cars. [[Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science]] (TEAMS) is an annual one-day competition where students use their skills to solve issues facing our global society.&lt;ref name="TSA TEAMS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teams.tsaweb.org/|title=TEAMS|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSA has partnered with the [[VEX Robotics Competition]] to allow students to design and create robots to complete specific tasks.&lt;ref name="TSA VEX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsaweb.org/Vex-Robotics-Competition|title=VEX Robotics Competition|publisher=Technology Student Association |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNITE is a summer program funded by the [[U.S. Army Research Office]] that encourages high school students to pursue engineering careers.&lt;ref name="TSA UNITE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/TSA-UNITE|title=UNITE Program|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every TSA middle school and high school member is required to submit LEAP (Leadership. Education. Achievement. Personal Growth.) documentation as part of every competition in which they compete. LEAP documentation tracks the leadership activities and experiences a TSA member has completed as part of each competition.&lt;ref name="TSA UNITE leap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/LEAP-competition-engagement|title=UNITE Program|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Sidebox|above=&lt;center&gt;'''Mission Statement'''&lt;/center&gt;|text=The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.&lt;ref name="TSA Mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsaweb.org/Our-Mission|title=Mission Statement, TSA Motto and Creed|publisher=Technology Student Association|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

TSA became an independent organization in 1978, when AIASA Inc. was formed to oversee the activities of the American Industrial Arts Student Association. Between the foundation of AIASA as an independent organization (it had formerly been a part of the American Industrial Arts Association) and 1988, the association grew and began to take shape.&lt;ref name="TSAHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/History |title=History |publisher=Technology Student Association |work=TSAweb.org  |date=1995-04-24 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the AIASA changed its name to the Technology Student Association as part of a shift in focus from industrial arts to mainstream technology.  This action followed a similar name change by the Texas state delegation the previous year.  In 1989, the official logo, submitted by a chapter advisor, was adopted. In 1990, the logo received a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;ref name="TSAHist"/&gt;

Today, the association has grown to include over 250,000 members in 2,000 secondary schools across 49 states.&lt;ref name="Program"/&gt; It has established an Honor Society, manages numerous competitive events and has partnerships with several organizations.

Additionally, TSA has a service partnership with the [[American Cancer Society]] (ACS), which are parts of their National Service Project. TSA members raise money to promote advocacy and research in the ACS, and the ACS issues Spirit of Service awards at each national conference.  In the past, conferences have hosted Relay for Life events on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsaweb.org/National-Service-Project |title=National Service Project |publisher=Technology Student Association |work=TSAweb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Race Question''' is the first of four [[UNESCO]] statements about issues of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. It was issued on 18 July 1950 following [[World War II]] and Nazi racism to clarify what was scientifically known about race, and as a moral condemnation of [[racism]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO1950"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf "The Race Question"], [[UNESCO]], 1950, 11pp&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} It was criticized on several grounds and revised versions were publicized in 1951, 1967, and 1978.

== Authors ==
The statements were signed by some of the leading researchers of the time, in the field of [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

The original statement was drafted by [[Ernest Beaglehole]]; [[Juan Comas]]; [[Luiz de Aguiar Costa Pinto]]; [[Franklin Frazier]], sociologist specialised in race relations studies; [[Morris Ginsberg]], founding chairperson of the [[British Sociological Association]]; [[Humayun Kabir]], writer, philosopher, and twice Education Minister of India; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], one of the founders of [[ethnology]] and leading theorist of [[structural anthropology]]; and [[Ashley Montagu]], anthropologist and author of ''[[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity]]'', who was the [[wikt:rapporteur|rapporteur]].

The text was then revised by Ashley Montagu following criticisms submitted by [[Hadley Cantril]]; [[E. G. Conklin]]; [[Gunnar Dahlberg]]; [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], author of ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' (1937); [[L. C. Dunn]]; [[Donald Hager]]; [[Julian Huxley]], first director of UNESCO and one of the many key contributors to [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]; [[Otto Klineberg]]; [[Wilbert Moore]]; [[H. J. Muller]]; [[Gunnar Myrdal]], author of ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944); [[Joseph Needham]], a biochemist specialist of [[Chinese science]]; and geneticist [[Curt Stern (geneticist)|Curt Stern]].

== Introduction ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
The introduction states that it was inevitable that UNESCO should take a position in the controversy. The preamble to the UNESCO constitution states that it should combat racism. The constitution itself stated that "The great and terrible war that has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the ''inequality'' of men and races."&lt;ref name="UNESCO1950"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

A 1948 UN Social and Economic Council resolution called upon UNESCO to consider the timeliness "of proposing and recommending the general adoption of a programme of dissemination of scientific facts designed to bring about the disappearance of that which is commonly called race prejudice." In 1949, the UNESCO adopted three resolutions which committed it to "study and collect scientific materials concerning questions of race", "to give wide diffusion to the scientific material collected", and "to prepare an education campaign based on this information." Before undertaking this campaign, the scientific position had to be clarified.

Furthermore, in doing this
{{quotation|UNESCO took up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project which the International Institute for Intellectual Co-operation has wished to carry through but which it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race... ...But they were not given such an opportunity. Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.}}

The introduction stated "Knowledge of the truth does not always help change emotional attitudes that draw their real strength from the subconscious or from factors beside the real issue." But it could "however, prevent rationalizations of reprehensive acts or behaviour prompted by feelings that men will not easily avow openly."

UNESCO made a moral statement:
{{quotation|Concern for human dignity demands that all citizens be [[equality before the law|equal before the law]], and that they share equally in the advantages assured them by the law, no matter what their physical or intellectual differences may be. The law sees in each person only a human being who has the right to the same consideration and to equal respect. The conscience of all mankind demand that this be true for all the peoples of the earth. It matters little, therefore, whether the diversity of men's gift be the result of biological or cultural factors.}}

UNESCO would start a campaign to spread the results of the report to a "vast public" such as by publishing pamphlets. It described Brazil as having an "exemplary situation" regarding race relations and that research should be undertaken in order to understand the causes of this "harmony".

== Criticism and controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Despite the introduction stating that "The competence and objectivity of the scientists who signed the document in its final form cannot be questioned", the first version of the statement was heavily criticized. A revised edition in 1951 explained the controversy as "At the first discussion on the problem of race, it was chiefly sociologists who gave their opinions and framed the ‘Statement on Race’. That statement had a good effect, but it did not carry the authority of just those groups within whose special province fall the biological problems of race, namely the physical anthropologists and geneticists. Secondly, the first statement did not, in all its details, carry conviction of these groups and, because of this, it was not supported by many authorities in these two fields. In general, the chief conclusions of the first statement were sustained, but with differences in emphasis and with some important omissions."

Some examples of differences include that the first version argued that there was no evidence for intellectual or personality differences. The revised version stated that "When intelligence tests, even non-verbal, are made on a group of non-literate people, their scores are usually lower than those of more civilised people" but concluded that "Available scientific knowledge provides no basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development."

The first version did not reject the idea of [[race biology]], a biological basis to racial categories. It defined the concept of race in terms of a population defined by certain anatomical and physiological characteristics diverging from other populations; it gives as examples the [[Caucasian race]], [[Mongoloid]] and [[Negroid race]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banton |first=Michael |editor-last=Schaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |year=2008 |title= Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society |chapter=UNESCO Statements on Race |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2 |pages=1096, 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version stated that "National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term ‘race’ is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term ‘race’ altogether and speak of ethnic groups." The revised version instead stated that the experts "agreed to reserve race as the word to be used for anthropological classification of groups showing definite combinations of physical (including physiological) traits in characteristic proportions."

The well known English [[statistics|statistician]] and biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] opposed the statement, believing that evidence and everyday experience showed that human groups differ profoundly "in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development" and concluded that the "practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature", and that "this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist". The revised statement titled "The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry" (1951) was accompanied by Fisher's dissenting commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000733/073351eo.pdf "The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry"], p. 27. UNESCO, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 1951 revised statement ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
The 1951 revised statement stated that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is one species. "The concept of race is unanimously regarded by anthropologists as a classificatory device providing a zoological frame within which the various groups of mankind may be arranged and by means of which studies of evolutionary processes can be facilitated. In its anthropological sense, the word ‘race’ should be reserved for groups of mankind possessing well-developed and primarily heritable physical differences from other groups." These differences have been caused in part by partial isolation preventing intermingling, geography an important explanation for the major races, often cultural for the minor races. National, religious, geographical, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups.

There is no evidence for the existence of so-called "pure races" and no scientific justification exists for discouraging reproduction between persons of different races.

== Legacy and other UNESCO statements ==
The UNESCO later published other similar statements on [[racism]]. In 1978, the ''UNESCO Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice''&lt;ref name="1978UNESCO"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice"], [[UNESCO]], 1978. ([http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114032e.pdf#page=60 PDF:])&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "All peoples of the world possess equal faculties for attaining the highest level in intellectual, technical, social, economic, cultural and political development" and "The differences between the achievements of the different peoples are entirely attributable to geographical, historical, political, economic, social and cultural factors." It also argued for implementing a number of policies in order to combat racism and inequalities, and stated that "Population groups of foreign origin, particularly migrant workers and their families who contribute to the development of the host country, should benefit from appropriate measures designed to afford them security and respect for their dignity and cultural values and to facilitate their adaptation to the host environment and their professional advancement with a view to their subsequent reintegration in their country of origin and their contribution to its development; steps should be taken to make it possible for their children to be taught their mother tongue."

A draft of the statement was prepared by the Director-General and "eminent specialists in human rights". It was discussed at a meeting by government representatives from over 100 member states. It was recommended that the representatives should include among them "social scientists and other persons particularly qualified to in the social, political, economic, cultural, and scientific aspects of the problem". A number of non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations sent observers. A final text of was adopted by the meeting of government representatives "by consensus, without opposition or vote" and later by the UNESCO General Conference, Twentieth Session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Draft Declaration on race and racial prejudice | location=General Conference, Twentieth Session, Paris, 1978 | publisher=UNESCO | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000287/028739eb.pdf | date=25 September 1978 | accessdate=6 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, UNESCO published a ''Declaration of Principles on Tolerance''&lt;ref name="1995UNESCO"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Declaration of Principles on Tolerance"], [[UNESCO]], 1995. ([http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001018/101803e.pdf#page=75 PDF:])&lt;/ref&gt; to add to its dialogue about racial equality with recommendations for tolerant treatment of persons with varied racial and cultural backgrounds. It stated "Tolerance is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world's cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being human. It is fostered by knowledge, openness, communication, and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. Tolerance is harmony in difference. It is not only a moral duty, it is also a political and legal requirement. Tolerance, the virtue that makes peace possible, contributes to the replacement of the culture of war by a culture of peace."

The 1950 UNESCO statement contributed to the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]''.&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prins |first1=Harald E.

[[File:49ers training camp 2010-08-09 28.JPG|thumb|The [[San Francisco 49ers]] conducting training camp at the team's headquarters and practice facility in [[Santa Clara, California]] in August 2010]]
In the [[National Football League]], '''training camp''' refers to the time before the season commences. During this time, teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location, usually a university, to conduct [[training camp]] for at least the first few weeks. This is similar to [[baseball]]'s [[spring training]].

Training camp is used in several different ways. New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems. For younger players, it serves as a period of evaluation; for veterans, it is time to round back into form.

Training camp is divided into several different components. The first is scrimmages. These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games' worth of plays. Sometimes, two practice sessions are held on the same day. This concept is referred to as ''two-a-days''. Other parts of training camp include drills, meetings with coaches and other players at one's position, [[weight training]], and pre-season games.

The latter half of training camp leads directly into the [[National Football League exhibition season|exhibition season]].

With NFL training camps starting in late-July, the biggest concern has been dehydration. In 2001, [[Minnesota Vikings]] player [[Korey Stringer]] died of a medical condition based from [[dehydration]] and [[heatstroke]]. The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies. At each practice, every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field; additionally, an ambulance must be present during practices.

With NFL training camps beginning in late July, severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games. In 2002, a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps.

Fans are often able to visit their favorite team's training camp to catch an early look at the players; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket, making training camp trips a popular option for fans who cannot attend many games due to financial or other reasons. NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience.

Official NFL training camps should be distinguished from private training camps, often for certain tactics or positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steveclarksondreammaker.com/quarterback-camp Quarterback Camp]. [[Steve Clarkson]] Dreammaker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized team activities==
Recently the NFL has let teams have off-season training sessions, officially called "organized team activities" (OTAs). Many teams use the OTAs to help develop players and make them better. These training sessions are in late May and early June. The OTAs are the only practices between the end of the previous season and the start of training camp. Players new to the NFL attend seminars and lectures organized by the NFL from mid-June to mid-July. For veteran players, they use the off-time to sponsor football camps for children, [[golf]] outings for charity, or even some family time.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Differences with baseball==
Unlike [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], where teams congregate at locations in two states (Arizona and Florida), NFL teams train all over the [[United States]]. However, an increasing number of teams do so in the same facilities at which they practice all year long - 19 teams in 2014, and 20 in 2015, up from five in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/more-nfl-teams-opting-for-comforts-of-home-over-going-away-for-training-camp-new-york-giants-philadelphia-eagles-072613|title=More teams staying home for camp|author=|date=26 July 2013|website=foxsports.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams have abandoned remote locations to "come home" for training camp, largely for practicality reasons. Many clubs have recently constructed state-of-the-art practice facilities, replete with amenities (multiple practice fields, indoor practice fields, weightlifting rooms, meeting rooms, lecture halls, film study rooms, cafeteria, medical facilities, IT infrastructure, etc.) that can not be provided or matched at other distant locations (colleges, parks, etc.) Most if not all of these new team practice facilities were in fact designed with hosting training camp in mind, and they are able to accommodate the expanded training camp roster sizes. In addition, the cost of temporarily relocating and accommodating the entire team organization to another location is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2527998-why-are-nfl-teams-no-longer-traveling-for-training-camp|title=Why Are NFL Teams No Longer Traveling for Training Camp?|first=Brad|last=Gagnon|date=|website=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitudes about how to run training camp have also evolved - leading more teams to stay home. With ''Organized Team Activities'' ("OTAs"), mini-camps, and conditioning during the off-season, players remain in top physical shape year-round. The focus of training camp is no longer getting players back in shape, but more of fostering camaraderie.

For example, the Lions' camp was long held at [[Saginaw Valley State College]], the Broncos trained at the [[University of Northern Colorado]], the Patriots at [[Bryant University]] in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]], and the Redskins moved in from [[Dickinson College]], the former site of [[Carlisle Indian School]]. Tampa Bay used to train at the [[University of Tampa]], then at the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex]] before moving permanently back to their headquarters. Similarly, after many years on the road, the [[New York Jets|Jets]] ([[State University of New York at Cortland|SUNY Cortland]]) and the [[New York Giants|Giants]] ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]) both recently moved back to team headquarters.

There are still a handful of teams that use somewhat distant locations at the fringes of their markets to promote their team. For instance, the [[Buffalo Bills]] moved their training camp from [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]] to [[Saint John Fisher College]] in suburban [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; as a team representing one of the smallest cities in the NFL, the holding of training camp in the nearby city of Rochester allows the Bills to lay claim to a larger portion of [[upstate New York]] and thus take advantage of a market closer in size to other teams in the NFL (similar rationale was used for the [[Bills Toronto Series|Bills' games in Toronto, Ontario, Canada]] prior to 2014). The Dallas Cowboys have historically hosted their training camp in locales very distant from their home market, even before they were given the moniker "[[America's Team]]" in the late 1970s; from 2001 to 2015, the Cowboys held their training camp at the River Ridge Playing Fields in [[Oxnard, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles. The Cowboys' arrangement with Oxnard ended when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] returned to southern California and the Cowboys constructed a [[The Ford Center at The Star|considerable multi-purpose facility]] in [[Frisco, Texas]] whose main lure is being the team's practice facility.

Another difference between spring training and training camp is that true intra-squad games do not take place (anymore), though informal scrimmages are very common. Split-squad games never happen in the NFL. It is also fairly common to see two teams hold a short joint camp and scrimmage at a neutral site in addition to their main camp.

A '''varsity letter''' (or '''monogram''') is an award earned in the [[United States]] for excellence in school activities. A varsity letter signifies that its winner was a qualified [[varsity team]] member, awarded after a certain standard was met.

== Description ==

The award letter is usually made in the colors and initials representing the school that the recipient attends. The letter patch is primarily constructed of [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] and [[felt]] materials. Standard sizes range from {{convert|4|in|0}} to {{convert|8|in|0}}. While {{convert|4|in|0}} and {{convert|5|in|0}} usually denote Junior Varsity achievements, {{convert|6|in|0}} to {{convert|8|in|0}} would denote full (Senior) Varsity. The stitching style used for creating the chenille look is called a moss stitch, while the outlining sew down is called a chain stitch.

== History ==

With the advent of organized sports, there was a need for uniforms. There was an additional need for identifications which was satisfied by the use of emblems or letters.

In 1865, the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] baseball team added an Old English 'H'. The 'H' was embroidered on the gray flannel shirt. The football team started to use the 'H' in 1875. For 25 years following the introduction in 1865 of the letter, it was the practice for the team captain to allow certain players who played in the most important games (Yale or Princeton) to keep the 'H' jerseys as an award. If a player did not play in an important game, the player had to return the jersey at the end of the season. Awarding the 'H' jersey may have been the birth of the varsity letter as an award. The letterman sweater was first regularly used by the 1891 "Nine" (baseball) and was black with a small Crimson 'H' on the left breast.

It is not known when the letter sweater came to high schools. The earliest known example of a letter sweater in a high school is found in the 1911 yearbook of Phoenix Union High School, Arizona Territory.{{needs citation|date=December 2016}} A student in a group photo is pictured, not in football uniform, wearing a [[V-neck sweater]] with the letter 'P' on the left side.

The sweater seems to be the home of the award letter from the 1890s until the 1930s. Another award during the 1920s and 1930s was a stadium style blanket given as an award. In the 1930s, the letter award started to appear on leather sleeved, wool-bodied jackets. The jackets from the 1930s were different in design than today's modern jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017114347/http://members.cox.net/phxjer/sleeves/history.htm|url=http://members.cox.net/phxjer/sleeves/history.htm|title=History of the Letter Award Tradition|archivedate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations and application ==
As a decorative clothing item, the varsity letter has a huge number of variations and no set standard is made to any school on how it should look.

Chenille letters come in many different forms and shapes. Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three letter monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block style. Students generally receive only one actual letter, but can win the distinction multiple times. These additional designations are shown by adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled metal insert pins, or bars that are attached to the letter. Some schools may embroider non-athletic letters with their award title, such as "Academics" or "Arts".

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:C_w_3D_Shading.png|Letter with 3D shading
Image:Traditional_Block_Letter_R_with_Embroidered_Mascot.gif|Traditional block letter with embroidered mascot
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The chenille letter is traditionally placed on the left chest of the varsity jacket, which is also at times adorned with championship chenille patches showcasing the team or individual accomplishments. School mascot patches are also commonly used.

During the 1980s, and again in the 2010s, varsity jackets have been adopted into [[hip-hop fashion]], with companies such as [[Avirex]], [[Phat farm|Phat Farm]] and [[Rocawear]] making their own variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/galleries/baseball-jackets.html Varsity jackets as street fashion]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video-based reflection''' is a [[reflective practice]] technique in which [[video recording]]s, rather than one's own [[memory]], is used as a basis for reflection and professional growth. Video-based reflection is used with moderations in various [[profession]]al fields, e.g. in the field of [[education]] and [[pedagogy]]. Several [[charrette|workshop]] formats can be described as based on video-based reflection, e.g. "Videobased Reflection on Team Interaction" ([http://circd.ku.dk/documents/Videobased_Reflection_on_Team_Interaction.pdf The ViRTI Method; Due &amp; Lange 2015]) within the conversation analytic school of [[research]], or the concept of [[Marte Meo]], a method of [[Educational counseling|educational counseling]].

==In the education field ==
Individual [[teacher]]s can practice video-based reflection, but it is more commonly done when teachers are a part of video clubs. Research about the effect that [[video]] club participation can have on teacher practice has been done by Katherine A. Linsenmeier, Miriam Gamoran Sherin, and Elizabeth van Es.

===Individual video-based reflection===
Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosaen|first=Cheryl L.|author2=Lundeberg, Mary |author3=Cooper, Marjorie |author4=Fritzen, Anny |author5= Terpstra, Majorie |title=Noticing Noticing: How Does Investigation of Video Records Change How Teachers Reflect on Their Experiences|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=59|issue=4|pages=347–360|doi=10.1177/0022487108322128}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that teachers can benefit from video-based reflection, even when done apart from a group.  Individuals using this mode of reflection tend to write longer and have more specific reflections than when writing a reflection using memory alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosaen|first=Cheryl L.|author2=Lundeberg, Mary |author3=Cooper, Marjorie |author4=Fritzen, Anny |author5= Terpstra, Majorie |title=Noticing Noticing: How Does Investigation of Video Records Change How Teachers Reflect on Their Experiences|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=59|issue=4|pages=347–360|doi=10.1177/0022487108322128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice has also been shown to help pre-service and [[novice]] teachers focus their attention on their students' learning rather than on their own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calandra|first=Brendan|author2=Brantley-Dias, Laurie |author3=Lee, John K. |author4= Fox, Dana L. |title=Using video editing to cultivate novice teachers' practice|journal=Journal of Research on Technology in Education|year=2009|volume=42|issue=1|pages=73–94|doi=10.1080/15391523.2009.10782542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=David M.|author2=Hammer, David |author3=Coffey, Janet E. |title=Novice Teachers' Attention to Student Thinking|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|date=March–April 2009|volume=60|issue=2|pages=142–154|doi=10.1177/0022487108330245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video clubs ===
Video clubs are formed by groups of teachers who want to investigate a specific aspect of their teaching practice.  These [[Club (organization)|clubs]] often meet on a monthly basis to view and discuss a video clip of a member's teaching.  Teachers participating in video clubs focused on student learning report feeling better able to notice and respond to [[student]] learning during instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linsenmeier|first=Katherine A.|author2=Sherin |title=Miriam Gamoran|journal=Teaching Children Mathematics|year=2009|volume=15|issue=7|pages=418–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherin|first=Miriam Gamoran|title=Viewing teaching on videotape|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2000|volume=57|issue=8|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Es|first=Elizabeth|title=Viewer Discussion Is Advised: Video Clubs Focus Teacher Discussion on Student Learning|journal=Journal of Staff Development|year=2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WISHES''' stands for '''[[Web-based]] Information Service for Higher Education Students''' (WISHES). As a European Project run by nine European institutions WISHES centrally promotes European work and study offers for students worldwide by means of a user-driven  [[web-based]] information portal.&lt;ref&gt;http://uib.omu.edu.tr/belgeler/A_First_Introduction_tothe_WISHEs-Project_240208.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the expressed needs of over 4.000 students, this WISHES web-portal centralizes information and creates profiles of European higher education institutions (HEIs) and employment bodies, tailored to [[Bologna process|Bologna]] and [[Lisbon Treaty|Lisbon parameters]].

Backed up with a powerful and diverse supporting network consisting of more than 100 HEIs, European associations and networks, as well as with the support of various national agencies, Rector's Conferences and the European Commission, WISHES offers its services to three main target groups: Students worldwide, higher education institutions and  [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Embed Video Subscribe to comments Post Comment |url=http://www.slideshare.net/Euwishes/erasmus-mundus-project-wishes |title=Erasmus mundus project WISHES |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WISHES target groups==
WISHES offers its benefits to three main [[target group]]s:

'''Students''' – students of universities and colleges worldwide interested in studying or working abroad. Additionally, WISHES also targets pupils searching for higher abroad. Close cooperation with student associations are currently set up (such as with the [[Erasmus Student Network]] or the European Medical Students Association).

'''Higher education institutions''' – Universities, Colleges, Academic Associations, Educational Networks, European Network, and other [[higher education|higher education institutions]] based in the [[Bologna process|Bologna signatory countries]]  are eligible to present themselves and their offers in WISHES. Concretely WISHES targets persons responsible for international affairs such as vice rectors for international relations and international officers.

'''Enterprisers''' – employment bodies, members of professional associations, and companies based in the [[Bologna process|Bologna signatory states]] looking for ways to reach international students and recent graduates worldwide.

==Basic elements==
Meeting the needs of today's international students, the WISHES Mobility Portal consists of three components:

* '''Information Portal''': The information [[web portal|portal]] presents European study offers. Here in addition to relevant information about the various courses of study available, information about country, city, housing, cost of living, and similar will be presented.
* '''Work placement database''': The second component of the platform, the international work placement [[database]], presents employment bodies  and their offers by means of  individual web-based business cards to students worldwide.
* '''Online Community''': In the "[[online community]]", the third component of the WISHES Mobility [[Web portal|Portal]], students comment, discuss and evaluate the various studies and work offers and practical issues of how to organize a stay abroad. This virtual marketplace is structured according to the various countries respectively university towns in Europe and thus enables a virtual matching of former and future international students – between and within the various students' generations.

==WISHES consortium==
The WISHES consortium consists of 9 institutions:

* [[University of Paderborn]] (DE)
* [[Haute École de la Province de Liège]] (BE)
* [[CATT Innovation-Management GmbH]] (AT)
* [[European Office of Cyprus]] (CY)

==History==
In December 2006 during their Erasmus Semester at [[Tomas Bata University in Zlín]], Czech Republic Michael Steinmann and Ricardo Dores came up with the idea of creating one [[web portal]] centrally presenting all relevant information about living and learning in the [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus Universities]] throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17540421/2009-Tomas-Bata-University-in-Zlin-Universalia-Spring-Edition-p-12-13-WISHES-Web-Portal-for-Students |title=2009 Tomas Bata University in Zlin – Universalia Spring Edition – p 12 – 13 – WISHES – Web Portal for Students |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their huge commitment and achieved early support by various universities, their idea grew rapidly : Presentations on diverse international conferences were followed by an invitation from Alan Smith to present the idea behind WISHES in the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|Directorate General of Education and Culture (DG EAC)]] of the [[European Commission]] in [[Brussels]] in April 2007.

Supported by the [[University of Paderborn]], Michael Steinmann and Prof. Dr. Leena Suhl submitted in 2008 a project proposal within the Action 4 of the [[Erasmus Mundus]] Programme to enhance the attractiveness of higher in Europe. Subsequently, in October 2008, WISHES has been approved by the [[European Commission]] (Agreement No. 2008-2457 / 001 – 001 MUN MUNATT), and was kicked of in December 2008.

In 2009 three major WISHES surveys have been carried out to lay solid grounds for the future WISHES mobility portal: Within these surveys 600 [[higher educationw|higher education institutions]], 100  [[Business|enterprises]] and 4 000 students stated their wishes concerning a central source of information concerning European study and work options. Additionally, to further promote the project's idea, WISHES has in 2009 been presented within various major European conferences on higher education mobility: The ERACON Conference 2009 (29 April – 3 May 2009, [[Nicosia]], Cyprus) and the [[EAIE|EAIE Conference]] 2009 (16th – 19 September, [[Madrid]], Spain).

In May 2010 the WISHES mobility portal was launched for [[higher education| higher education institutions]]  during the WISHES Networking days (NWD 2010) in [[Essen]], Germany. Since June 2010 European [[higher education|higher education institutions]] have been enabled to prepare their presentations in WISHES for the launch of WISHES for students worldwide in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/28677765/WISHES-Newsletter-01-0310 |title=WISHES Newsletter 01 0310 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Next steps==
In September 2010 WISHES will be launched for students worldwide. Starting from February 2011 employment bodies will be able to promote their offers by means of WISHES.
