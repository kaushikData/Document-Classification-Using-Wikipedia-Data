'''Amala''' is a mythological [[giant (mythology)|giant]] who supports the world in the mythology of the [[Tsimshian]], [[Nisga'a|Nass]], [[Skidegate]], [[Haida people|Kaigani]], Massett, and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] [[North American Indians|Native Americans]]. He supports the [[Earth]] which he balances on a spinning pole. He receives an annual application of wild duck-oil to his muscles from a servant which brings relief to his muscles. The belief is that when all the [[ducks]] are hunted out, there will no longer be any duck-oil available in the world. At this point, Amala dies and the world topples off the pole and comes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Native American Mythology A to Z |last1=Lynch |first1=Patricia |authorlink= |last2=Roberts |first2=Jeremy |year=2010 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |location= |isbn=978-1-60413-894-8 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MIqNXvxNNUC&amp;lpg=PR25&amp;dq=Amala%20native%20american&amp;pg=PR25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The myth==
The name Amala refers to his being very dirty and literally means “smoke hole.” Amala is said to be the youngest child in a family who is physically weak and lazy. He is made to sleep in the ashes and suffers mistreatment from everybody. In many variants of the myth, Amala sleeps in his urine.&lt;ref name = enc&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of folk heroes |last=Seal |first=Graham |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |location= |isbn=978-1-57607-216-5 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qfTcKDzzqvIC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Cinderella%20%2B%20amala%20%2B%20duck&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=Cinderella%20+%20amala%20+%20duck&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his life he attains supernatural strength in secret and becomes a handsome, and powerful young man who performs many daring feats and turns savior and protector for his relatives against their enemies. The concluding feat of his life is to succeed a dying chief on an island in the Southwest sea in the task of holding the Earth up. The dying chief hears of Amala's various exploits and, impressed by his prowess, calls the hero. When Amala arrives, the chief hands over the long pole upon which the flat world revolves. Some versions of the myth state that the chief places the pole on Amala's chest,&lt;ref name = enc /&gt; while some versions hold that the pole is held behind Amala's back. A servant relieves Amala's muscles with yearly application of spoonfuls of duck grease and wild-duck oil which help Amala to keep the world spinning.

==Possible influences==
There is a possibility that the myths about Amala and similar heroes of Native American mythology were influenced by the tales of [[Cinderella]] and [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] - the titan who carries the world on his shoulder in Greek mythology, introduced into Native American culture from [[Europe]]. There is a similarity between Cinderella and Amala in that both sleep in ashes and both are abused by their tribe or family. The storyline of Amala - the despised member of the tribe who overcomes adversity and rises to be a hero among his people, may be a combination of elements of the downtrodden and derided hero or heroine, such as Cinderella, and the hero of the Atlas-type who dwells in the underworld.&lt;ref name = enc /&gt;

In [[category theory]], the '''anamorphism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνά|ἀνά]]}} "upwards" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]]}} "form, shape") of a [[coinduction|coinductive type]] denotes the assignment of a [[coalgebra]] to its unique [[morphism]] to the [[Initial algebra|final coalgebra]] of an [[endofunctor]]. These objects are used in [[functional programming]] as ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]''. The [[categorical dual]] of the anamorphism is the [[catamorphism]].

== Anamorphisms in functional programming ==

In [[functional programming]], an '''anamorphism''' is a generalization of the concept of ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]'' on coinductive [[List (computing)|lists]]. Formally, anamorphisms are [[generic function]]s that can [[Corecursion|corecursively]] construct a result of a certain [[Algebraic data type|type]] and which is parameterized by functions that determine the next single step of the construction.

The data type in question is defined as the greatest fixed point ''ν X . F X'' of a functor ''F''. By the universal property of final coalgebras, there is a unique coalgebra morphism ''A → ν X . F X'' for any other ''F''-coalgebra ''a : A → F A''. Thus, one can define functions from a type ''A'' _into_ a coinductive datatype by specifying a coalgebra structure ''a'' on ''A''.

=== Example: Potentially infinite lists ===

As an example, the type of potentially infinite [[List (computing)|lists]] (with elements of a fixed type ''value'') is given as the fixpoint ''[value] = ν X . value × X + 1'', i.e. a list consists either of a ''value'' and a further list, or it is empty. A (pseudo-)[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-Definition might look like this:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data [value] = (value:[value]) | []
&lt;/source&gt;

It is the fixed point of the functor &lt;code&gt;F value&lt;/code&gt;, where:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
data F value x = Maybe (value, x)
&lt;/source&gt;

One can easily check that indeed the type &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;code&gt; F value [value]&lt;/code&gt;, and thus &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is the fixed point.
(Also note that in Haskell, least and greatest fixpoints of functors coincide, therefore inductive lists are the same as coinductive, potentially infinite lists.)

The ''anamorphism'' for lists (then usually known as ''unfold'') would build a (potentially infinite) list from a state value. Typically, the unfold takes a state value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and a function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; that yields either a pair of a value and a new state, or a singleton to mark the end of the list. The anamorphism would then begin with a first seed, compute whether the list continues or ends, and in case of a nonempty list, prepend the computed value to the recursive call to the anamorphism.

A Haskell definition of an unfold, or anamorphism for lists, called &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, is as follows:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
ana :: (state -&gt; Maybe (value, state)) -&gt; state -&gt; [value]
ana f stateOld = case f stateOld of
            Nothing                -&gt; []
            Just (value, stateNew) -&gt; value : ana f stateNew
&lt;/source&gt;

We can now implement quite general functions using ''ana'', for example a countdown:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
f :: Int -&gt; Maybe (Int, Int)
f current = let oneSmaller = current - 1
            in   if oneSmaller &lt; 0
                   then Nothing
                   else Just (oneSmaller, oneSmaller)
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will decrement an integer and output it at the same time, until it is negative, at which point it will mark the end of the list. Correspondingly, &lt;code&gt;ana f 3&lt;/code&gt; will compute the list &lt;code&gt;[2,1,0]&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Anamorphisms on other data structures ===

An anamorphism can be defined for any recursive type, according to a generic pattern, generalizing the second version of ''ana'' for lists.

For example, the unfold for the tree data structure

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) a (Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is as follows
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 ana :: (b -&gt; Either a (b, a, b)) -&gt; b -&gt; Tree a
 ana unspool x = case unspool x of
                   Left a          -&gt; Leaf a
                   Right (l, x, r) -&gt; Branch (ana unspool l) x (ana unspool r)
&lt;/source&gt;

To better see the relationship between the recursive type and its anamorphism, note that &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; can be defined thus:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
&lt;/source&gt;

The analogy with &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; appears by renaming &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in its type:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}
 anaList ::       (list_a       -&gt; Maybe (a, list_a)) -&gt; (list_a -&gt; List a)

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
 anaTree ::       (tree_a       -&gt; Either a (tree_a, a, tree_a)) -&gt; (tree_a -&gt; Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

With these definitions, the argument to the constructor of the type has the same type as the return type of the first argument of &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, with the recursive mentions of the type replaced with &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.

== History ==

One of the first publications to introduce the notion of an anamorphism in the context of programming was the paper ''Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|citeseerx = 10.1.1.41.125
|title=Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire
|first=Erik
|last=Meijer
|authorlink=Erik Meijer (computer scientist)
|author2=Fokkinga, Maarten|author3=Paterson, Ross
|year=1991
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|Erik Meijer]] ''et al.'', which was in the context of the [[Squiggol]] programming language.

==Applications==
Functions like [[Zip (higher-order function)|&lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt;]] and &lt;code&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; are examples of anamorphisms.  &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; takes a pair of lists, say ['a','b','c'] and [1,2,3] and returns a list of pairs [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]. &lt;code&gt;Iterate&lt;/code&gt; takes a thing, x, and a function, f, from such things to such things, and returns the infinite list that comes from repeated application of f, i.e. the list [x, (f x), (f (f x)), (f (f (f x))), ...].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip (a:as) (b:bs) = if (as==[]) || (bs ==[])   -- || means 'or'
                      then [(a,b)]
                      else (a,b):(zip as bs) 
 
 iterate f x = x:(iterate f (f x))&lt;/source&gt;

To prove this, we can implement both using our generic unfold, &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, using a simple recursive routine:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip2 = ana unsp fin
    where
    fin (as,bs) = (as==[]) || (bs ==[]) 
    unsp ((a:as), (b:bs)) = ((a,b),(as,bs))

 iterate2 f = ana (\a-&gt;(a,f a)) (\x-&gt;False) &lt;/source&gt;
In a language like Haskell, even the abstract functions &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; are merely defined terms, as we have seen from the definitions given above.

== Anamorphisms in category theory ==

In [[category theory]], anamorphisms are the [[categorical dual]] of [[catamorphism]]s (and catamorphisms are the categorical dual of anamorphisms).

That means the following. 
Suppose (''A'', ''fin'') is a [[Initial algebra|final]] [[F-coalgebra|''F''-coalgebra]] for some [[endofunctor]] ''F'' of some [[category (mathematics)|category]] into itself.
Thus, ''fin'' is a [[morphism]] from ''A'' to ''FA'', and since it is assumed to be final we know that whenever (''X'', ''f'') is another ''F''-coalgebra (a morphism ''f'' from ''X'' to ''FX''), there will be a unique [[homomorphism]] ''h'' from (''X'', ''f'') to (''A'', ''fin''), that is a morphism ''h'' from ''X'' to ''A'' such that ''fin '''.''' h = Fh '''.''' f''.
Then for each such ''f'' we denote by '''ana''' '''''f''''' that uniquely specified morphism ''h''.

In other words, we have the following defining relationship, given some fixed ''F'', ''A'', and ''fin'' as above:

*&lt;math&gt;h = \mathrm{ana}\ f&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{fin}\circ h = Fh \circ f&lt;/math&gt;

=== Notation ===

A notation for ana ''f'' found in the literature is &lt;math&gt;[\!(f)\!]&lt;/math&gt;. The brackets used are known as '''lens brackets''', after which anamorphisms are sometimes referred to as ''lenses''.

'''''Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces''''' is a 2007 [[encyclopedia]] written by Brian Camp and Julie Davis and published by [[Stone Bridge Press]] which provides basic details and short reviews of 100 Japanese [[anime]] titles, most of which have been translated and licensed for release in English in North America.&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt; Stone Bridge Press published the printed version on September 15, 2007, with the [[e-book]] version published on August 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1933330228/ |title=''Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces'' |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OA893G/ |title=''Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces'' [Kindle Edition]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Harford County Public Library]]'s Jamie Watson commends the books as "indispensable for anyone with an interest in anime", with further comments about the book's "interest to teens and also serve as a great reference for collection development as all of the movies are considered classics by the authors."&lt;ref name="SLJ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson |first=Jamie |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6527304.html |title=Adult Books for High School Students |date=January 2, 2008 |publisher=[[School Library Journal]] |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724182909/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6527304.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ain't It Cool News]]'s Scott Green comments that the book is "written with a more objective voice than ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917|The Anime Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]''. It is possible to suss out some vague sense of preference, but while a given person is unlikely to truly enjoy every work of anime discussed; every anime is described and evaluated in an even manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Scott |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35306 |title=AICN Anime-''Persepolis'', ''Anime Classics Zettai'', News and More |date=January 18, 2008 |publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century''' is a list compiled in August 2016 by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), chosen by a voting poll of 177 film critics from around the world. It was compiled by collating the top ten films submitted by the critics who were asked to list the best films released since the year [[2000 in film|2000]].

==Selection criteria==

BBC Culture requested 177 film critics from around the world to submit their responses for ten films which according to them are the greatest. The time period was limited from January 2000 to June 2016 (when the responses were completely collected). Each film listed in these responses were then given points based on their ranking. For instance, if a film was ranked at #1 in a critic's list, that film would get 10 points, whereas the one ranked at #10 would get 1 point. The list has 102 titles to be exact, due to a tie between ''[[Carlos (miniseries)|Carlos]]'', ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', and ''[[Toni Erdmann]]'' for the 100th rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films | title=The 21st Century's 100 Greatest Films | publisher=BBC | date=23 August 2016 | accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - Culture - The 21st Century's 1-- Greatest Films: Who Voted?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films-who-voted|publisher=BBC.Com|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With three each, [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], [[Christopher Nolan]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Michael Haneke]], and the [[Coen brothers]] have the largest number of films in the list.

A total of 177 critics from 36 countries participated in the poll, with the largest number (81) from the [[United States]] followed by the [[United Kingdom]]. Out of the 177, 122 are men and 55 are women, and are primarily newspaper/magazine film reviewers, website film reviewers, academics, and cinema curators.

The '''Biographicon''' was a [[wiki]]-based website containing [[biography|biographies]] of famous and non-famous people, that existed from March to August 2008. The site also showed connections between individuals covered, and explained the circumstances under which they met.&lt;ref name=marsden/&gt;

The site was launched on March 1, 2008 by computer programmer Ethan Herdrick and business partner Daniel Terhorst. The site had received a small amount of [[seed funding]] from venture capital firm [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]. Herdrick served as the company's [[Chief Executive Officer]], while Terhorst was [[Chief Technology Officer]].&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;

The blog ''The Wired Campus'' labelled the Biographicon "[[Wikipedia]] for non-[[Notability|notables]]"&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the fact that unlike the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, the Biographicon did not have a notability threshold for inclusion, operating under the tagline "all the people of the world". Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Rhodri Marsden]] commented that on the Biographicon, "anyone can put up details about themselves without fear of being nominated for deletion", though he noted that since the site operated using wiki software, "there's always the chance that someone will log in and alter your entry to include the time you cried on a school trip because someone stole your sandwiches."&lt;ref name=marsden&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Boyd v. Mayor of Wellington''''' [1924] NZLR 1174 is a leading [[case law]] in [[New Zealand]] on the concept of [[Torrens title|indefeasibility of title]].&lt;ref name="Gerbic &amp; Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Commercial Law |edition=5th |last1=Gerbic |first1=Philippa |last2=Lawrence |first2=Martin |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71714-9|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The plaintiff in this case, Mr, Boyd, owned a parcel of land in [[Wellington]] until in 1917 the local council [[Eminent domain|compulsorily acquired the land]] under the Public Works Act [1908] to build part of the [[Wellington tramway system]].

After the council was registered as the new owner of this property, it came to the plaintiff's attention that because there was an existing building on the property, the council had no legal right to acquire the property without the owner's consent.

The plaintiff took legal action against the council to return the land back to his ownership.

==Held==
The court ruled in favor of the council, as the transfer was not obtained due to fraud, i.e. the council was not aware at the time that it needed the owners consent, but rather to oversight by the council, and this meant that the [[Wellington City Council]] had an indefeasible title to the property.

'''Footnote:''' Had this claim not been about real estate, it is likely that the decision would have been different.

The '''British Film Institute''' ('''BFI''') is a [[film]] and [[charitable organisation]] which promotes and preserves [[filmmaking]] and [[television]] in the United Kingdom.

It was established by [[Royal Charter]] to:
: Encourage the development of the arts of film, television and the moving image throughout the United Kingdom, to promote their use as a record of contemporary life and manners, to promote education about film, television and the moving image generally, and their impact on society, to promote access to and appreciation of the widest possible range of British and [[world cinema]] and to establish, care for and develop collections reflecting the moving image history and heritage of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/about/pdf/charter.pdf |format=PDF |title=British Film Institute: Royal Charter |author=[[Elizabeth II]] |date=18 July 1983 |publisher=[[Charity Commissioners for England and Wales]] |accessdate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003104623/http://www.bfi.org.uk/about/pdf/charter.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BFI activities ==

=== Archive ===
The BFI maintains the world's largest [[film archive]], the [[BFI National Archive]], previously called [[National Film Library]] (1935–1955), National Film Archive (1955–1992), and National Film and Television Archive (1993–2006). The archive contains more than 50,000 fiction films, over 100,000 non-fiction titles, and around 625,000 television programmes. The majority of the collection is British material but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.

=== Cinemas ===
[[File:BFI London IMAX at night.jpg|thumb|right|[[London IMAX]] cinema]]
The BFI runs the [[BFI Southbank]] (formerly the National Film Theatre (NFT)) and [[London IMAX]] cinema, both located on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/research-projects/british-film-institute-research-project |title=British Film Institute research project {{!}} School of History|website=www.history.qmul.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMAX has the largest cinema screen in the UK and shows popular recent releases and short films showcasing its technology, which includes 3D screenings and 11,600 watts of digital surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/about-bfi/business-services/venue-hire/bfi-imax |title=BFI IMAX BFI |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |access-date=12 March 2016 |quote=Britain's biggest cinema screen – 20&amp;nbsp;m x 26&amp;nbsp;m, IMAX 2D and 3D, 70&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm film projectors}}{{citation needed|reason=after fixing dead link can no longer substantiate claim of 11,600 watt sound|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFI Southbank (the National Film Theatre screens and the Studio) shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical &amp; specialised films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. The BFI also distributes archival and cultural cinema to other venues – each year to more than 800 venues all across the UK, as well as to a substantial number of overseas venues.

=== Education ===
The BFI offers a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/ |title=Education and research |work=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, the BFI received money from the [[Department For Education]] to create the BFI Film Academy Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Film/2013-04-24/BFI_Film_Academy_Premier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210183518/http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Film/2013-04-24/BFI_Film_Academy_Premier.html |archivedate=10 December 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Festivals ===
The BFI runs the annual [[London Film Festival]] along with [[BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival]] and the youth-orientated Future Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/ |title=BFI |website=British Film Institute |access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other activities ===
The BFI publishes the monthly ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' magazine as well as films on [[Blu-ray]], [[DVD]] and books. It runs the BFI National Library (a reference library), and maintains the [[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] and [[Summary of Information on Film and Television]] (SIFT), which are databases of credits, synopses and other information about film and television productions. SIFT has a collection of about 7 million [[still frame]]s from film and television.

The BFI has co-produced a number of television series featuring footage from the BFI National Archive, in partnership with the [[BBC]], including ''[[The Lost World of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon]]'', ''[[The Lost World of Friese-Greene]]'', and ''[[The Lost World of Tibet]]''.

== Organisation ==

=== History ===
[[File:NFT.jpg|thumb|[[BFI Southbank|National Film Theatre]]]]

The institute was founded in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/british-film-institute |title=British Film Institute – GOV.UK |website=www.gov.uk |language=en |access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its foundation resulting from a recommendation in a report on ''Film in National Life'', at that time the institute was a private company, though it has received public money throughout its history—from the [[Privy Council]] and Treasury until 1965 and the various culture departments since then.

The institute was restructured following the Radcliffe Report of 1948 which recommended that it should concentrate on developing the appreciation of filmic art, rather than creating film itself. Thus control of educational film production passed to the National Committee for Visual Aids in Education and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Film Academy]] assumed control for promoting production. From 1952–2000, the BFI provided funding for new and experimental filmmakers via the [[BFI Production Board]].

The institute received a Royal Charter in 1983. This was updated in 2000, and in the same year the newly established [[UK Film Council]] took responsibility for providing the BFI's annual grant-in-aid (government subsidy). As an independent registered charity, the BFI is regulated by the [[Charity Commission]] and the Privy Council.

In 1988, the BFI opened the London [[Museum of the Moving Image (London)|Museum of the Moving Image]] (MOMI) on the [[South Bank]]. MOMI was acclaimed internationally and set new standards for education through entertainment, but subsequently it did not receive the high levels of continuing investment that might have enabled it to keep pace with technological developments and ever-rising audience expectations.  The Museum was "temporarily" closed in 1999 when the BFI stated that it would be re-sited. This did not happen, and MOMI's closure became permanent in 2002 when it was decided to redevelop the South Bank site. This redevelopment was itself then further delayed.

=== Today ===
The BFI is currently managed on a day-to-day basis by its chief executive, Amanda Nevill. Supreme decision-making authority rests with a chair and a board of up to 14 governors. The current chair is Josh Berger, who took up the post in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/josh-berger-take-over-chair-bfi |title=Josh Berger to take over as Chair of the BFI |access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded [[Greg Dyke]], who took office on 1 March 2008. Dyke succeeded the late [[Anthony Minghella]] (film director), who was chair from 2003 until 31 December 2007. The chair of the board is appointed by the BFI's own Board of Governors but requires the consent of the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]]. Other Governors are co-opted by existing board members when required (but if one of these is appointed Deputy Chair, that appointment is subject to ratification by the Secretary of State).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The BFI operates with three sources of income. The largest is public money allocated by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. In 2011–12, this funding amounted to approximately £20m.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The second largest source is commercial activity such as receipts from ticket sales at BFI Southbank or the BFI London IMAX theatre (£5m in 2007), sales of DVDs, etc. Thirdly, grants and sponsorship of around £5m are obtained from various sources, including [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding grants, private sponsors and through donations ([[Paul Getty|J. Paul Getty, Jr.]] donated around £1m in his will following his death in 2003). The BFI is also the distributor for all Lottery funds for film (in 2011–12 this amounted to c.£25m).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As well as its work on film, the BFI also devotes a large amount of its time to the preservation and study of British [[television]] programming and its history. In 2000, it published a high-profile list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]], as voted for by a range of industry figures.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The delayed redevelopment of the National Film Theatre finally took place in 2007, creating in the rebranded "BFI Southbank" new education spaces, a gallery, and a pioneering mediatheque which for the first time enabled the public to gain access, free of charge, to some of the otherwise inaccessible treasures in the National Film &amp; Television Archive. The mediatheque has proved to be the most successful element of this redevelopment, and there are plans to roll out a network of them across the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

An announcement of a £25 million capital investment in the Strategy for UK Screen Heritage was made by Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport at the opening night of the 2007 London Film Festival. The bulk of this money paid for long overdue development of the BFI National Archive facilities in Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

During 2009 the [[UK Film Council]] persuaded the government that there should only be one main public-funded body for film, and that body should be the UKFC while the BFI should be abolished. During 2010 the government announced that there would be a single body for film. Despite intensive lobbying (including controversially using public funding to pay public relations agencies to put its case) the UKFC failed to persuade the government that it should have that role and, instead, the BFI took over most of the UKFC's functions and funding from 1 April 2011, and the UKFC was subsequently abolished. Since then, the BFI has been responsible for all Lottery funding for film—originally in excess of £25m p.a., and currently in excess of £40m p.a.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The BFI Film Academy forms part of the BFI's overall 5-19 Education Scheme. The programme is being supported by the Department for Education in England who have committed £1m per annum funding from April 2012 and 31 March 2015. It is also funded through the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], [[Creative Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland Screen]].

On 29 November 2016 BFI announced that over 100,000 television programmes are to be digitised before the video tapes, which currently have an estimated five-to-six-year shelf life, become unusable. BFI aim to make sure that the television archive is still there in 200 years' time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38131911 |title=Basil Brush and Tiswas among 'at risk' TV shows, says BFI |publisher=BBC News |last=Masters |first=Tim |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlsberg Museum''', situated next to the [[Carl Jacobsen House|former home]] of [[Carl Jacobsen]] in the [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg]] area of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], was the first home of his sculpture collection, now on display in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in the city centre. The building consists of a total of 20 [[art museum#Galleries in museums|galleries]] accumulated between 1892 and 1895 through a series of extensions to designs by [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]] and [[Hack Kampmann]]. It now serves as a venue for conferences, receptions and other events.

==History==
After purchasing ''Bakkegården'' and making it his family home, Carl Jacobsen expanded it with a winter garden in 1882. A passionate art collector, Carl Jacobsen used it for his sculptures which soon outnumbered the plants. In the autumn of 1882, he opened the collection to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlsbergbyen.dk/294/bygningsbeskrivelser/ |title=Bygningesbeskrivelser - eksisterende bygninger |language=Danish |publisher=Carlsberg Byen |accessdate=2012-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026173149/http://www.carlsbergbyen.dk/294/bygningsbeskrivelser/ |archivedate=2012-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections grew rapidly and in 1885 Dahlerup expanded the museum with four new galleries (Gallery 2&amp;ndash;5) and the following year with another nine (Gallery 6&amp;ndash;14).[[Hack Kampmann]] who had built Jacobsen a new home in 1892 expanded the museum with six more galleries to its current size in 1896. He also adapted most of the old rooms, leaving only galleries 2&amp;ndash;4 unchanged.

After the collections were moved to the present [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in two stages, the modern collection in 1896 and the classical collection in 1905, the building served as a studio for an artist and a private venue for celebrations in the Jacobsen family. In 1915, Vagn Jacobsen, Carl Jacobsen's son and successor as director of [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]], turned it into a museum with exhibitions about the brewery's history. For many years it was the last stop on guided tours of the brewery but in 1999 Carlsberg opened a new visitor centre elsewhere and on 1 June 2009 the museum closed permanently.

==Architecture==
The building is made in red brick. Of particular note is the Empress Gallery which consists of a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] featuring four [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] inline with the [[apse]]. The remaining galleries display variations in ornamentation of floors, walls and ceilings and are [[Daylighting#Skylights|toplit]].

==Carlsberg Business Centre==
Carlsberg Museum is now rented out as a venue for smaller conferences, meetings, dinners, receptions and other similar events under the name Carlsberg Business Centre. It is administrated by Visit Carlsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/dansk/virksomheder/Pages/CarlsbergMuseum.aspx|title=Carlsberg Museum|language=Danish|publisher=Visit Carlsberg|accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1476">The '''''Chronicle of Galaxeidi'''''  ({{lang-el|Χρονικό του Γαλαξειδίου}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] chronicle written in the year 1703 detailing the history of the town of [[Galaxeidi]] on the northern shore of the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and its wider region, including the towns of [[Naupaktos]], [[Amfissa]], and [[Loidoriki]], from the [[Middle Ages]] to 1690. It was written by the monk Euthymios in the vernacular language using original sources found in the [[Monastery of Christ the Saviour]]. Discovered in 1864, it was published by the Greek scholar [[Konstantinos Sathas]] in 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15360">[[Image:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|right|240px|In this graph, comparative statics shows an increase in demand causing a rise in price and quantity. Comparing two equilibrium states, comparative statics doesn't describe ''how the increases actually occur''.]]

In [[economics]], '''comparative statics''' is the comparison of two different economic outcomes, before and after a change in some underlying [[exogenous]] [[parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;(Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green, 1995, p. 24; Silberberg and Suen, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a type of ''[[static analysis]]'' it compares two different [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] states, after the process of adjustment (if any).  It does not study the motion towards equilibrium, nor the process of the change itself.

Comparative statics is commonly used to study changes in [[supply and demand]] when analyzing a single [[Market (economics)|market]], and to study changes in [[monetary policy|monetary]] or [[fiscal policy]] when analyzing the whole [[macroeconomics|economy]].  Comparative statics is a tool of analysis in [[microeconomics]] (including [[general equilibrium]] analysis) and [[macroeconomics]]. Comparative statics was formalized by [[Sir John Richard Hicks|John R. Hicks]] (1939) and [[Paul A. Samuelson]] (1947) (Kehoe, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;517) but was presented graphically from at least the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fleeming Jenkin]] (1870), "The Graphical Representation of the Laws of Supply and Demand, and their Application to Labour," in Alexander Grant, ''Recess Studies'' and (1872), "On the principles which regulate the incidence of taxes," ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1871-2'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AGxUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA618&amp;lpg=PA618&amp;dq=%22On+the+Principles+which+Regulate+the+Incidence+of+Taxes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ltLMj55E4I&amp;sig=BH5FAoGSMXZ0LYsC7Hvg6N3TUBs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N8kGTO6eCMH_lgeTzYnxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22On%20the%20Principles%20which%20Regulate%20the%20Incidence%20of%20Taxes%22&amp;f=false 618-30.], also in ''Papers, Literary, Scientific, &amp;c'', v. 2 (1887), ed. S.C. Colvin and J.A. Ewing via scroll to chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fwVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For models of stable equilibrium rates of change, such as the [[neoclassical growth model]], [[comparative dynamics]] is the counterpart of comparative statics (Eatwell, 1987).

==Linear approximation==

Comparative statics results are usually derived by using the [[implicit function theorem]] to calculate a [[linear approximation]] to the system of equations that defines the equilibrium, under the assumption that the equilibrium is stable.  That is, if we consider a sufficiently small change in some exogenous parameter, we can calculate how each endogenous variable changes using only the [[Derivative|first derivatives]] of the terms that appear in the equilibrium equations.

For example, suppose the equilibrium value of some endogenous variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,a)=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an exogenous parameter.  Then, to a first-order approximation, the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; caused by a small change in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;B \text{d}x + C \text{d}a = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{d}a&lt;/math&gt; represent the changes in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, while &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (evaluated at the initial values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;), respectively. Equivalently, we can write the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}x = -B^{-1}C \text{d}a .&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing through the last equation by d''a'' gives the '''comparative static derivative''' of ''x'' with respect to ''a'', also called the [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] of ''a'' on ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\text{d}x}}{{\text{d}a}} = -B^{-1}C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Many equations and unknowns===
All the equations above remain true in the case of a system of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equations in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.  In other words, suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x,a)=0&lt;/math&gt; represents a system of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equations involving the vector of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; unknowns &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; given parameters &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  If we make a sufficiently small change &lt;math&gt;\text{d}a&lt;/math&gt; in the parameters, then the resulting changes in the endogenous variables can be approximated arbitrarily well by &lt;math&gt;\text{d}x = -B^{-1}C \text{d}a&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; represents the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[Jacobian matrix|matrix of partial derivatives]] of the functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; represents the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; matrix of partial derivatives of the functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the parameters &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. (The derivatives in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated at the initial values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.) Note that if one wants just the comparative static effect of one exogenous variable on one endogenous variable, [[Cramer's Rule]] can be used on the [[Total differentiation#The total derivative via differentials|totally differentiated]] system of equations &lt;math&gt;B\text{d}x + C \text{d}a \,=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stability===
The assumption that the equilibrium is stable matters for two reasons. First, if the equilibrium were unstable, a small parameter change might cause a large jump in the value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, invalidating the use of a linear approximation. Moreover, [[Paul A. Samuelson]]'s '''correspondence principle'''&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul, "The stability of equilibrium: Comparative statics and dynamics", ''[[Econometrica]]'' 9, April 1941, 97-120: introduces the concept of the correspondence principle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul, "The stability of equilibrium: Linear and non-linear systems", ''Econometrica'' 10(1), January 1942, 1-25: coins the term "correspondence principle".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J., ''Economic Dynamics'', Macmillan Co., 3rd edition, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.122–123.}} states that stability of equilibrium has qualitative implications about the comparative static effects. In other words, knowing that the equilibrium is stable may help us predict whether each of the coefficients in the vector &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}C&lt;/math&gt; is positive or negative. Specifically, one of the ''n'' necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for stability is that the [[determinant]] of the ''n''×''n'' matrix ''B'' have a particular sign; since this determinant appears as the denominator in the expression for &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,  the sign of the determinant influences the signs of all the elements of the vector &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}C\text{d} a&lt;/math&gt; of comparative static effects.

====An example of the role of the stability assumption====
Suppose that the quantities demanded and supplied of a product are determined by the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;Q^{d}(P) = a + bP&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q^{s}(P) = c + gP&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q^{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity demanded, &lt;math&gt;Q^{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity supplied, ''P'' is the price, ''a'' and ''c'' are intercept parameters determined by exogenous influences on demand and supply respectively, ''b'' &lt; 0 is the reciprocal of the slope of the [[demand curve]], and ''g'' is the reciprocal of the slope of the supply curve; ''g'' &gt; 0 if the supply curve is upward sloped, ''g'' = 0 if the supply curve is vertical, and ''g'' &lt; 0 if the supply curve is backward-bending. If we equate quantity supplied with quantity demanded to find the equilibrium price &lt;math&gt;P^{eqb}&lt;/math&gt;, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;P^{eqb}=\frac{a-c}{g-b}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the equilibrium price depends positively on the demand intercept if ''g'' – ''b'' &gt; 0, but depends negatively on it if ''g'' – ''b'' &lt; 0.  Which of these possibilities is relevant? In fact, starting from an initial static equilibrium and then changing ''a'', the new equilibrium is relevant ''only'' if the market actually goes to that new equilibrium.  Suppose that price adjustments in the market occur according to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=\lambda (Q^{d}(P) - Q^{s}(P))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 is the speed of adjustment parameter and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time derivative]] of the price — that is, it denotes how fast and in what direction the price changes.  By [[stability theory]], ''P'' will converge to its equilibrium value if and only if the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(dP/dt)}{dP}&lt;/math&gt; is negative.  This derivative is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(dP/dt)}{dP} = - \lambda(-b+g).&lt;/math&gt;

This is negative if and only if ''g'' – ''b'' &gt; 0, in which case the demand intercept parameter ''a'' positively influences the price.  So we can say that while the direction of effect of the demand intercept on the equilibrium price is ambiguous when all we know is that the reciprocal of the supply curve's slope, ''g'', is negative, in the only relevant case (in which the price actually goes to its new equilibrium value) an increase in the demand intercept increases the price.  Note that this case, with ''g'' – ''b'' &gt; 0, is the case in which the supply curve, if negatively sloped, is steeper than the demand curve.

==Without constraints==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;p(x;q)&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth and strictly concave objective function where ''x'' is a vector of ''n'' endogenous variables and ''q'' is a vector of ''m'' exogenous parameters. Consider the unconstrained optimization problem &lt;math&gt;x^*(q)= \arg \max p(x;q) &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x;q)=D_xp(x;q)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n'' by ''n'' matrix of first partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;p(x;q)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to its first ''n'' arguments ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
The maximizer &lt;math&gt;x^*(q)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the ''n''×1 first order condition &lt;math&gt;f(x^*(q);q)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Comparative statics asks how this maximizer changes in response to changes in the ''m'' parameters. The aim is to find &lt;math&gt;\partial x^*_i/ \partial q_j, i=1,...,n, j=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt;.

The strict concavity of the objective function implies that the Jacobian of ''f'', which is exactly the matrix of second partial derivatives of ''p'' with respect to the endogenous variables, is nonsingular (has an inverse). By the [[implicit function theorem]], then, &lt;math&gt;x^*(q)&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed locally as a continuously differentiable function, and the local response of &lt;math&gt;x^*(q)&lt;/math&gt; to small changes in ''q'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;D_qx^*(q)=-[D_xf(x^*(q);q)]^{-1}D_qf(x^*(q);q).&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the chain rule and first order condition,
:&lt;math&gt;D_qp(x^*(q),q)=D_qp(x;q)|_{x=x^*(q)}.&lt;/math&gt;
(See [[Envelope theorem]]).

===Application for profit maximization===
Suppose a firm produces ''n'' goods in quantities &lt;math&gt;x_1,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The firm's profit is a function ''p'' of &lt;math&gt;x_1,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and of ''m'' exogenous parameters &lt;math&gt;q_1,...,q_m&lt;/math&gt; which may represent, for instance, various tax rates. Provided the profit function satisfies the smoothness and concavity requirements, the comparative statics method above describes the changes in the firm's profit due to small changes in the tax rates.

==With constraints==
A generalization of the above method allows the optimization problem to include a set of constraints. This leads to the general [[envelope theorem]]. Applications include determining changes in [[Marshallian demand function|Marshallian demand]] in response to changes in price or wage.

==Limitations and extensions==
One limitation of comparative statics using the implicit function theorem is that results are valid only in a (potentially very small) neighborhood of the optimum—that is, only for very small changes in the exogenous variables. Another limitation is the potentially overly restrictive nature of the assumptions conventionally used to justify comparative statics procedures.

Paul Milgrom and Chris Shannon&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom, Paul, and Shannon, Chris. "Monotone Comparative Statics" (1994). Econometrica, Vol. 62 Issue 1, pp. 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out in 1994 that the assumptions conventionally used to justify the use of comparative statics on optimization problems are not actually necessary—specifically, the assumptions of convexity of preferred sets or constraint sets, smoothness of their boundaries, first and second derivative conditions, and linearity of budget sets or objective functions. In fact, sometimes a problem meeting these conditions can be monotonically transformed to give a problem with identical comparative statics but violating some or all of these conditions; hence these conditions are not necessary to justify the comparative statics. Stemming from the article by Milgrom and Shannon as well as the results obtained by Veinott&lt;ref&gt;Veinott (1992): Lattice programming: qualitative optimization and equilibria. MS Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; and Topkis&lt;ref&gt;See: Topkis, D. M. (1979): “Equilibrium Points in Nonzero-Sum n-Person Submodular Games,” SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization, 17, 773–787; as well as Topkis, D. M. (1998): Supermodularity and Complementarity, Frontiers of economic research, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|9780691032443}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an important strand of [[operational research]] was developed called [[monotone comparative statics]]. In particular, this theory concentrates on the comparative statics analysis using only conditions that are independent of order-preserving transformations. The method uses [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] and introduces the notions of quasi-supermodularity and the single-crossing condition. The wide application of monotone comparative statics to economics includes production theory, consumer theory, game theory with complete and incomplete information, auction theory, and others.&lt;ref&gt;See: Topkis, D. M. (1998): Supermodularity and Complementarity, Frontiers of economic research, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|9780691032443}}; and Vives, X. (2001): Oligopoly Pricing: Old Ideas and New Tools.

Culture influences how people seek psychological help, their definitions of social structure, and coping strategies.

==Overview==
Research shows that cultural factors affect notions of perceived happiness.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The current general literature discusses positive psychology into two categories: Western and Eastern. Cultural psychologist [[Richard Shweder]] argues that these factors help shape what people deem is good, moral, and virtuous. [[Western world|Westerners]] seek rewards on more of a physical plane, while [[Eastern world|Easterners]] seek to transcend the physical plane to a spiritual one.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R.A., Much, N.C., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Park, L. (1997). The "Big Three" of Morality (Autonomy, Community, Divinity) and the "Big Three" Explanations of Suffering. In A. Brandt &amp; P. Rozin (Eds.) ''Morality and Health''. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Western literature generally stresses autonomy, individuality, and personal satisfaction, while Eastern work generally focuses on harmony, collective cooperation, and group satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, [[anthropologists]] and [[psychologists]] used [[Race (human classification)|race]] and culture as factors that influence positive and negative behaviors and attitudes.{Snyder, Lopez, Pedrotti (2011). Positive psychology: The scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (2nd ed.)} This led to a culturally deficient perspective{{clarify|date=July 2016}}, used for some groups to assert dominance over others through [[eugenics]]. American psychologists [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[Henry Goddard Hall]] were among some of the notable figures to adopt this view. By the mid 20th century, the dominant viewpoint was that culture did not predetermine life outcomes; instead differences were the consequence of environmental factors. The culturally different perspective holds that unique strengths can be highlighted within every culture.&lt;ref name="SueSue2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Derald Wing |last1=Sue|first2=David |last2=Sue|title=Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUrWYYpX2ScC|date=4 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04489-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Satcher]] was among the first to emphasize the influences of culture on mental health. Cultural differences occur both between and within nations.

== Major theories ==
Psychologists [[Charles R. Snyder]], [[Shane J. Lopez]], and [[Jennifer T. Pedrotti]] identify two major influential western traditions – Athenian and Judeo-Christian – and four major eastern traditions – Confucianism ([[China]]), Taoism (China), Buddhism ([[Japan]]), and Hinduism ([[Southeast Asia]]) – relevant to positive psychology.&lt;ref name="Snyder2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

===Western philosophy===
* The [[Athenian]] view (held by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]) stems from discussion of virtue and human strength. It emphasizes the importance of a political community, or "[[polis]]", and states that people with good human virtue arrange themselves into a society and model good behavior.
* The [[Judeo-Christian]] approach discusses the importance of the [[Virtue ethics|virtues]] of faith, hope, charity, fortitude, justice, temperance, and wisdom. It states that laws and rituals serve to cultivate strengths within society.

===Eastern philosophy===
* [[Confucianism]] stresses that leadership and education are central to morality. Emphasis is placed on taking care of others within the group. Virtues are used to achieve [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], or the good life.
* [[Taoism]] portrays the concept of "The Way," referring simultaneously to direction, movement, method, and thought. Tao is the energy surrounding and flowing through everyone, and The Way must be achieved through experience, rather than teaching alone.
* [[Buddhism]] refers to the teachings of the "[[Enlightened one|Enlightened One]]," which state that life is full of suffering brought on by human desire and attachment. There is, however, a possible end to the suffering through transcendence and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|ultimate understanding]]. Virtues are of utmost importance, and include love, joy, compassion, and composure
* [[Hinduism]] emphasizes the [[Monism|interconnectedness of all things]]. It advocates for the harmonious union among all individuals, who should strive for ultimate self betterment and also encouraged to be good to others. Good deeds are motivated by the process of [[karma]]

===Cultural differences in the concept of well-being===

Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. His analysis is based on his survey of the accounts of [[happiness]] and optimal functioning provided in Western as well as non-Western traditions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Sufism]]. These six major domains of difference are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Self-Transcendence versus self-enhancement'''. The way cultures define the self is of great importance in conceptualizing happiness. Whereas the Western concept of the self is primarily based on the ideals of individualism, eastern traditions tend to regard the self as a small part of the collective and the cosmos. Consistent with the Western understanding of the self, enhancing autonomy, independence, self-esteem, and a strong ego is considered to be a vital ingredient of a good life in these cultures. In contrast, in Asian traditions, the individual self is de-emphasised in one way or another. For example, in Buddhism, the existence of an individual self is considered an illusion.
*'''Eudaimonism versus hedonism'''. In contemporary Western psychology, scientific analysis of individuals' mental well-being and quality of life is mainly undertaken in the field of subjective well-being, which has been formulated based on a hedonic understanding of well-being. A hedonistic conceptualization of happiness is in accord with the core values and ethos of modern Western culture, namely liberal modernity, [[hedonism]], and romantic [[individualism]]. However, hedonism as a way of pursuing happiness is not equally favored in eastern traditions. In these traditions, positive emotions and pleasures are considered too temporary and marginal to be the criterion against which happiness is measured. Non-Western conceptualizations of happiness are thus more consistent with [[eudaimonism]], which emphasizes virtues in defining happiness.
*'''Harmony versus mastery'''. Consistent with the Western dominant way of thinking about humankind and its relationship with the environment, qualities such as environmental mastery and control are highly valued in Western cultures. In contrast, in eastern cultures where interpersonal harmony and adjustment are emphasized, people reach a sense of well-being basically through promoting mutual sympathy and harmony with others and the whole cosmos. These perspectives value self-transcendence, interdependence, softness, flexibility, and adjustment to the environment rather than autonomy and independence.
*'''Contentment versus satisfaction'''. [[Life satisfaction]] has been stressed over the past four decades in Western psychological literature on mental health. Life satisfaction is believed in the Western thought to result from need or desire satisfaction. However, [[contentment]], in non-Western cultures, involves satisfaction as well as many other qualities and experiences. It is understood as a delicate balance between joy and sorrow that should be preserved in both happy and sad times. It involves accepting any failure or misery one faces with composure, dignity, and gracefulness. This sense of contentment is believed to result from the realization of the transcendent self. Whereas the contentment is spiritually loaded, life satisfaction is not associated with morality and spirituality.
*'''Valuing versus avoiding suffering'''. A potential consequence of a hedonistic conceptualization of happiness that stresses the maximization of subjective well-being (consisting in part of the absence of negative emotions) is that such a conceptualization, which seems to be dominant in the West, makes it difficult to accept hardship, negative affect, and unhappiness as possible integral parts of a good life. Having this in mind, eastern eudaimonistic theories of well-being accept the existence of negative feelings and anhedonia in a truly happy life. From an eastern point of view, one should be able to embrace both positive and negative sides of life.
*'''Relevance versus relative irrelevance of spirituality and religion'''. In dominant Western lines of research where materialistic values and moral pluralism are valued, religion and spirituality are studied mainly as predictors of mental well-being, and they are not involved in formulating it. In contrast, in non-Western cultures, spirituality and religion are interwoven in individuals' understanding and experiencing of life in general and happiness in particular. Happiness for many non-Westerners is formulated based on religious and metaphysical worldviews. Transcendence, spirituality, mystical experience, following religious duties, and practicing religious rituals are essential for these people's sense of happiness.

===Viewpoints within positive psychology===
There are different approaches within the field of positive psychology. With the support of numerous sources, Bacon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bacon | first1 = S. F. | year = 2005 | title = Positive psychology's two cultures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 181–192 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presents the idea that there are two "cultures" in positive psychology, or two different ways to view the positive psychology construct of personal strengths: focus culture and balance culture. In focus culture, individuals are focused on developing and expressing their personal strengths. Balance culture is instead oriented towards balancing and bringing harmony within oneself and among others. Bacon argues that individuals ascribing to the focus culture will differ in their life experience and life path than those who believe in the balance culture. Bacon believes that the strengths can be categorized into these two cultures and goes into depth explaining why creativity is the prototypical strength in the focus culture and why wisdom represents an ideal strength in the balance culture. Rather than tying culture to a certain ethnic or cultural group, Bacon and others argues that there are two different cultures, or schools of thought, within positive psychology. These two cultures reflect a new way to categorize strengths (Bacon, 2005).

==Approaches==
There are two main approaches to cross-cultural positive psychology. One perspective, termed 'culturally-free' believes that there are numerous human strengths that are valued universally, and that the pursuit of happiness is common across cultures. Proponents of this side view their approach as descriptive and objective, claiming its results "transcend particular cultures and politics and approach universality".&lt;ref name="pmid11392865"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman ME, Csikszentmihalyi M | title = Positive psychology. An introduction | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–14 |date=January 2000  | pmid = 11392865 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.5| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/55/1/5 | accessdate = 2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other approach views values as culturally embedded, meaning that cultural values of the researchers influence their work. [[DSM-5|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5]] (DSM-V) takes this view and includes information throughout the manual to increase cultural sensitivity and further the awareness of a multicultural perspective in clinical practice. Some of the additional information includes insight into cultural differences in key symptoms of disorders, as well as suggestions on how to take cultural context into account during treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Concepts in DSM-5|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/file%20library/practice/dsm/dsm-5/cultural-concepts-in-dsm-5.pdfwww.psychiatry.org/file%20library/practice/dsm/dsm-5/cultural-concepts-in-dsm-5.pdf|website=DSM-5|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Western traditions fostered more [[Individualistic culture|individualistic societies]] while eastern traditions fostered more collectivistic societies. Individualistic cultures value the self above the group. Collectivistic cultures value the group above the individual.

There are distinct differences between the thought processes used by Westerners and Easterners resulting in differing [[worldviews]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} For example, in seeking happiness, Westerners give priority to "[[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]" as well as goal-directed thinking. Easterners, on the other hand, may be more accepting in their situation, and put more weight on inner life balance. The virtue of harmony appears to be a pillar of Eastern culture.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[Edward C. Chang]] did a series of quantitative studies in order to showcase the importance of understanding the equivalence of traits and constructs across cultural groups. For example, [[Asian Americans]] were more pessimistic than [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], but the two groups were not all that different on their levels of optimism.&lt;ref name="Chang1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Edward C.|title=Evidence for the cultural specificity of pessimism in Asians vs Caucasians: a test of a general negativity hypothesis|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=21|issue=5|year=1996|pages=819–822|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(96)00110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph G. Ponterotto]] et al. have suggested that the ability to navigate and adapt to the increasingly diverse context of the world, is an important strength. People high on this are said to have "multicultural personalities".&lt;ref name="PonterottoUtsey2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph G. Ponterotto|author2=Shawn O. Utsey|author3=Paul B. Pedersen|title=Preventing Prejudice: A Guide for Counselors, Educators, and Parents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMKVytfl6YQC|date=28 March 2006|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-2818-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adjusts for differences between cultures. Kristoffer G. van der Zee and Jan P. van Oudenhoven created the [[Multicultural Personality Questionnaire]] (MPQ), and identified five factors that describe personality style: cultural empathy, open-mindedness, emotional stability, initiative, and flexibility. This may correlate with enhanced well being.&lt;ref name="pmid22966866"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=van der Zee K, van Oudenhoven JP, Ponterotto JG, Fietzer AW | title=Multicultural personality questionnaire: development of a short form. | journal=J Pers Assess | year= 2013 | volume= 95 | issue= 1 | pages= 118–24 | pmid=22966866 | doi=10.1080/00223891.2012.718302 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22966866  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology researcher [[Daphna Oyserman]] and her colleagues advocate for a less static view of separate cultures (East vs. West), and suggest exploring more dynamic ways explaining the ways in which these cultures operate. Different cultures can operate together, rather than being seen as conflicting (it is not "me vs. we").&lt;ref name="pmid18298274"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oyserman D, Lee SW | title=Does culture influence what and how we think?

== Major empirical findings ==
There has been a recent effort by researchers to explore how concepts of Positive Psychology differ between cultures, as well as how culture influences how individuals view the good life.

For example, Snyder's chapter (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C. (2009). Positive Psychology Within a Cultural Context. In Oxford handbook of positive psychology (pp. 49-57). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explores the way in which culture affects positive psychology. More specifically, Snyder acknowledges the fact that culture impacts individual's understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Snyder claims that it is important to understand the cross section of positive psychology and culture, because it allows one to not only understand people within a culture but it also enables one to appreciate people from different cultures. Snyder outlines two schools of thought in the positive psychology field that pertain to how we should view strengths within a cultural context: culture-free and the culturally embedded perspective. Those ascribing to the culture-free perspective believe that strengths are not affected by culture and that there are universal strengths. The culturally embedded perspective argues that one must take into account culture when one is considering strengths, because they believe strengths manifest themselves differently in different cultures (Snyder, 2009).

Dahlsgaard, Peterson, and Seligman's (2005)&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dahlsgaard | first1 = K. | last2 = Peterson | first2 = C. | last3 = Seligman | first3 = M. E. P. | year = 2005 | title = Shared virtue: The convergence of valued human strengths across culture and history | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 203–213 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.3.203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis presents historical and psychological evidence supporting the contention that there are universal virtues that exist across cultures. They are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These authors note that these virtues have been represented in ancient texts within Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and from Athenian scholars. Each of these core virtues was represented in these schools of thoughts and became entrenched in the societies and cultures that ascribe to these religions and belief systems. Thus, these core virtues of courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence are valued equally across these different cultures (Dahlsgaard et al., 2005).

Another virtue put forth by Seligman in attaining the good life is [[forgiveness]]. Previous researchers have not looked extensively at how forgiveness occurs in non-Western cultures, yet virtue is a very culturally embedded value. The research that has explored the virtue of forgiveness in non-Western cultures has found that there are not significant differences in overall levels of forgiveness, yet the reasons behind forgiving and the meaning of forgiveness varies between collectivist and individualistic cultures. For example, forgiveness in individualistic cultures is focused on a particular individual, while Eastern cultures see forgiveness in a broader, community context. Since forgiveness is a key virtue in positive psychology and a relevant topic in counseling, it is important to research forgiveness more thoroughly in a variety of cultures in order to better understand how different cultures view forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=S.J.|last2=Hill|first2=P.C.|last3=Vang|first3=H.C.|title=Toward a multicultural positive psychology: Indigenous forgiveness and Hmong culture|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=564–592|doi=10.1177/0011000003256350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies that highlight differences between Western and Eastern cultures, discrepancies in values and emotions have been found when comparing the United States and China. It is often concluded that people in Eastern cultures are less happy than those in Western cultures, but research indicates that there is more value placed on suffering and transcendence in Eastern cultures than in the United States.{{Citation needed|date = June 2014}} It is also commonly believed that there is less happiness experienced by people in Eastern cultures because there is less individuality, but Eastern cultures are socialized in a much more collectivist mindset and develop into adults that are more concerned with finding a place in one's community rather than standing out, as Americans are.{{Citation needed|date = June 2014}} These differences in particular indicate that there should be further research into cultural differences to avoid mistakes in classifying behavior and psychological functioning.

Kubokawa and Ottaway's literature review examines how emotions vary across culture, suggesting that applications of positive psychology need to adapt to different cultural contexts. The authors use self-criticism as an example: self-criticism is considered as detrimental to one's well-being in Western cultures, whereas collectivistic cultures value self-criticism as an important tool for personal growth, and consider it useful in aligning with societal norms (Heine et al., 2001). The authors also discuss a study conducted in Asian Americans and Caucasians that examined optimism and pessimism. The study found that while Asian Americans rated higher in pessimism than Caucasians, they did not differ in levels of depressive symptoms, indicating that the association between pessimism and depression might not apply in Asian cultures the way it does in Western cultures. In general, many negative emotions in Western cultures do not hold the same connotations in East Asian cultures, leading the authors to suggest that classification of certain emotions as positive and negative is not universal, and that research in positive psychology should cater to these cultural aspects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kubokawa, A. and Ottaway, A. (2009). Positive Psychology and Cultural Sensitivity: A Review of the Literature. ''Graduate Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1(2), ''130-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubokawa and Ottaway also present research that discredits the cultural relevance of the Values in Action Classification of Strengths (VIA) created by Peterson and Seligman. Peterson and Seligman (2004) identified six universal [[Character Strengths and Virtues|characters strengths and virtues]] that are valued by all cultures: courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These virtues in turn led them to create a subset of 24 strengths common to all cultures. However, Christopher and Hickinbottom (2008) argue that the VIA Classification of Strengths is an oversimplification of cultures, and that while the values might be similar across cultures, the meaning that Peterson and Seligman ascribed to them are Western-orientated and might not translate well into more collectivist cultures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cultural differences and the good life===
Previous research has demonstrated that the good life, as defined by subjective well-being, is rooted in predominantly Western ways of thinking. But, throughout history, subjective well-being has often become less vital in comparison to the needs to the larger community. This change results in individuals feeling subjective well-being in response to the success of their community rather than from their individual experiences. For example, the people of [[Bali]] see life as having two realms, everyday life and the spiritual world. Due to this dichotomy, it is difficult to examine subjective well-being without considering both realms, which occurs when positive psychology uses Western ways of thinking about the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christopher|first1=J.C.|last2=Hickinbottom|first2=S.|title=Positive psychology, ethnocentrism, and the disguised ideology of individualism|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|date=2008|volume=18|issue=5|pages=563–589|doi=10.1177/0959354308093396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cultural difference in how one conceptualizes the good life can be seen in the beliefs of the [[Crow Nation|Apsáalooke tribe]], a Native American tribe in the US. Research has shown that for members of the Apsáalooke tribe, life satisfaction is deeply rooted in the belief that one's life is intertwined with others in their tribe. Due to this feeling of collectivity, satisfaction is taken from helping others. This example is just one of many in which other cultures differ in the concept of satisfaction from the concept of satisfaction in an individualistic culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition, a difference between collectivist and individualist cultures is the conceptualization of positive and negative emotions, including happiness. For example, research indicates that individualism moderates the relationship between hedonism and happiness, such that hedonism is more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic (vs collectivistic) cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|last2=Jarden|first2=Aaron|date=2016-05-01|title=Individualism as the moderator of the relationship between hedonism and happiness: A study in 19 nations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916300277|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=94|pages=149–152|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2016.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In individualist cultures, individuals attempt to avoid negative emotions, but in Eastern communities, some negative emotions are viewed as a virtue. One example of this is that collectivist cultures value [[shame]] because they view it as an opportunity to better themselves. So, when Western conceptualizations are applied to Eastern cultures, researchers run the risk of psychological imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

How does the culture of [[consumerism]] relate to positive psychology? Past research has shown that consumer culture and the pursuit of extrinsic goals leads to diminished well being, in comparison to pursuing intrinsic goals that lead to an increase in well-being. These findings not only occur in America, but the same results occurred in samples across a variety of countries, including Romania, Germany, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea. These countries represent both individualistic and collectivist cultures, which demonstrates that one possible universal in positive psychology across cultures is the importance of the pursuit of intrinsic goals.&lt;ref name="Positive Psychology in Practice"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasser|first1=T|title=Positive Psychology in Practice|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471459064|pages=55–65|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences in well-being, meaning, and hope ===
Maygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley identified specific cultural considerations that affect how practitioners should engage with concepts and theories in positive psychology within counseling settings. The literature review specifically addresses well-being, meaning, and hope.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Magyar-Moe | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Owens | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Conoley | first3 = C. W. | year = 2015 | title = Positive Psychological Interventions in Counseling: What Every Counseling Psychologist Should Know | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 1–50 | doi = 10.1177/0011000015573776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Well-being'''

Wealthy, individualistic cultures experience higher levels of social [[well-being]] than underprivileged, collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, &amp; Diener, 1995). Self-esteem was also more predictive of life satisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Suh, Diner, Oishi, &amp; Triadis, 1998).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Meaning ====
Research suggest that searching for [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] is viewed more positively in interdependent culture: Steger, Kawabata, Shimai, and Otake (2008) found that when comparing Japan (example of interdependent culture) and the U.S. (example of independent culture), the Japanese sample was high in searching for meaning while the U.S. sample was higher in experiencing meaning. Additionally, the search for meaning in the Japanese sample was positively related to presence of meaning, unlike in the U.S. sample.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Research also indicates that national levels of globalization can moderate the relationship between "thinking about the meaning of life" and life satisfaction. That is, in more globalized cultures, this relationship is negative, whereas in less globalized cultures, this correlation is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan|title=Does thinking about the meaning of life make you happy in a religious and globalised world? A 75-nation study|journal=Journal of Psychology in Africa|date=2 January 2014|volume=24|issue=1|pages=73–81|doi=10.1080/14330237.2014.904093|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14330237.2014.904093#.VxKG8NQrLVQ|issn=1433-0237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hope ====
Maygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley argue that while previous research supports the idea that is [[hope]] is universally a positive expectancy variably, the cultivation of hope varies based on cultural makeup.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''European Americans'' – life satisfaction serves as a source of agentic hope and positive affect was found to be predictive of pathways of hope. Therefore, European Americans would benefit most from interventions that improve life satisfaction and positive affect (Chang &amp; Banks, 2007).

''African Americans'' – lack of negative problem orientation was the strongest predictor for agentic, and positive problem orientation was the best predictor of pathways thinking. Therefore, African Americans would benefit best from interventions that simultaneously reduce a negative problem orientation and increase a positive problem orientation (Chang &amp; Banks, 2007).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Latinos'' – life satisfaction was the only predictor of pathways thinking, and rational problem solving was the best predictor of agentic thinking, therefore, Latinos would benefit most from interventions aiming to increasing rational problem solving and that would lead to higher life satisfaction (Chang &amp; Banks, 2007).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Asian Americans'' – positive problem orientation was the strongest predictor of pathways thinking, while positive affect was the strongest predictor of agentic thinking. Therefore, Asian Americans would benefit best from interventions that promote positive affect and a positive problem orientation (Chang &amp; Banks, 2007).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Culturally appropriate [[psychoeducational]] and counseling interventions would benefit from more empirical research on culturally embedded positive psychology. Cross-cultural studies would help with the application of psychological treatment and recovery, along with improving the general understanding of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of diverse populations of people. This is not only important for the differences between Western and Eastern civilizations, but has implications for the various cultural and ethnic groups within the United States of America, a society that has been considered a "[[melting pot]]" and has grappled with these issues throughout history. One important aspect of American culture that should be addressed is that of consumerism. Since the negative effects of the culture of consumption transcends specific cultures, it can become a common theme across counseling practices of positive psychology to encourage pursuing intrinsic values and the good life, and avoid pursuing extrinsic goals and the "goods" life.&lt;ref name="Positive Psychology in Practice"/&gt;

In addition, a culturally-embedded approach would allow professionals outside the mental health field to utilize methodology and concepts from psychology to motivate and help people. Specifically, employers in any field of business would be able to find techniques that are culturally appropriate for encouraging employees to be better engaged in their careers and to find meaning in their work. This can effectively be applied to the cultural network groups that many companies organize for employees, such as women's and African-Americans' networks, that allow for employees and employers to increase the understanding of perspectives and cultural sensitivity in the workplace.

Furthermore, teachers and administrators would be better equipped to address issues in educational achievement and behavioral development amongst diverse groups of students. Since there is currently strong criticism of the [[Public education in the United States|public education system]] for the achievement gap amongst students based on race and [[socioeconomic status]], it would be especially helpful for educational authorities to understand the disparities that students may face due to aspects of their background. Teachers would benefit from knowing how to better foster a love of learning, creativity, optimism, resilience, leadership, and teamwork in diverse groups of students in order to prepare students for achievement in the future. The concept of achievement is tied to the aforementioned topics for many children. When achievement seems possible for all students, regardless of their cultural backgrounds, they may be more likely to persistently pursue attaining it.

=== Applications of strengths theory across cultures ===
Virtues and strengths are valued differently across cultures, which in turn means that attempts to build strengths using positive psychology within counseling settings can only be successful if they include important cultural considerations. For example, Chang (1996) found that Asian Americans reported higher levels of pessimism than Caucasians, however within that population pessimism was not found to contribute to depression and was associated with positive problem-solving strategies. This suggests that while pessimism is considered a weakness in some cultures, it might actually serve as a strength in others: [[defensive pessimism]], for example, leads people to set lower expectations for themselves. This supports the idea that applications of positive psychology to cultivate strengths need to be altered to fit the clients' cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Overstatement of sample and cohort differences ===
Individual differences in the way people experience positive and negative emotions affect study results in a way that makes sample and cohort differences less important than the studies stress. More specifically, the conception of the self is key in positive psychology, and cross cultural differences in the conception of the self make it difficult to generalize results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Those individual differences often account for much of the variations between groups, and are often not taken into account.

===Nonstandardized measurement of emotion ===
The first two problems converge for an even larger issue: the measurement of emotion is far from accurate. However, many studies and researchers use "oversimple checklists and questionnaires without follow-up or exploration of their adequacy."{{Citation needed|date = June 2014}} Without in-depth explorations, the possibilities of finding observations about the flow of events in an emotional encounter is minimal. Thus, with very subjective results and the inadequacy to rule out other causal connections, the measurement of positive emotion itself is flawed.

With the cultural aspect of positive psychology, the problems largely consist of the definition of positive emotions and notions of a positive life. Many of the ideals that are associated with a positive psychology are notions that are deeply ingrained within Western cultures, and do not necessarily apply to all groups of people. In relation to the previous point about measuring positive emotion, many of the social conditions in emotion measurement are ignored.

"Positive psychology is doomed to being narrow and ethnocentric as long as its researchers remain unaware of the cultural assumptions underlying their work."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A large part of the literature debates whether positive psychology is innately culture-free or culture-embedded. Those who advocate culture-free positive psychology state that happiness is a universal trait, whereas advocates of culture-embedded positive psychology believe that the cultural context reach happiness differently, depending on their culture.

Nonstandardized measurements of emotion are also due to the fact that pleasant hedonic experiences are expressed in very different ways across cultural groups, hindering researchers' ability to choose universal terms that will accurately describe these experiences without completely disregarding their cultural context. For example, Mesquita and Frijda (1992) argue that the word for "happiness" not only changes across languages, it also describes a different emotional experience. In English, happiness refers to a "high arousal, exuberant experience," while its equivalent in [[Hindi]], ''sukhi, ''refers to a low-arousal experience of peace and happiness, and in Kenya, for the [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], "happiness" is a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This makes it challenging for researchers to study positive psychology across cultures, as different interpretations of these terms could lead to invalid assumptions about specific emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Mitamura, C., Leu, J., Campos,

The '''Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union''' was a proclamation issued on December 24, 1860, by the government of [[South Carolina]] to explain its reasons for [[secession|seceding]] from the [[United States]] ([http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp Full text of the declaration]). It followed the brief [[Ordinance of Secession]] that had been issued on December 20. The declaration is a product of a convention organized by the state's government in the month following the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as U.S. President, where it was drafted in a committee headed by [[Christopher Memminger]]. The declaration stated the primary reasoning behind South Carolina's declaring of secession from the U.S., which was described as "increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery".&lt;ref name="Teaching Decl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/DecofImCauses.htm |title='Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union,' 24 December 1860 |publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project|year=2009|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official secession convention met in South Carolina following the [[United States presidential election, 1860|November 1860 election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as President of the United States, on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery into U.S. territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sumter/Dilemmas/DDec20.html |title=December 20, 1860 |work=Crisis at Fort Sumter: Dilemmas of Compromise |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |first=Richard B. |last=Latner |publisher=Tulane University}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1860, the convention issued an [[ordinance of secession]] announcing the state's withdrawal from the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/Ordinance.htm |title='An Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina and other States,' or the South Carolina Ordinance of Secession, 20 December 1860 |publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project |year=2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance was brief and legalistic in nature, containing no explanation of the reasoning behind the delegates' decision:

{{quote|We, the People of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, That the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention, on the twenty-third day of May in the year of our Lord One Thousand Seven hundred and eighty eight, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State, ratifying amendment of the said Constitution, are here by repealed; and that the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States, under the name of “The United States of America,” is hereby dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/documents/Ordinance.pdf |title=Ordinance of Secession |year=1860 |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The convention had previously agreed to draft a separate statement that would summarize their justification and gave that task to a committee of seven members comprising [[Christopher G. Memminger]] (considered the primary author&lt;ref name="Teaching Decl" /&gt;), F. H. Wardlaw, R. W. Barnwell, J. P. Richardson, B. H. Rutledge, J. E. Jenkins, and P. E. Duncan.{{sfn|Journal of the Convention|1862|p=31, 39}} The document they produced, the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, was adopted by the convention on December 24.&lt;ref name="Teaching Decl2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/DecofImCauses.htm |title='Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union,' 24 December 1860 |publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project |year=2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The opening portion of the declaration outlines the historical background of South Carolina and offers a legal justification for its secession. It asserts that the right of states to secede is implicit in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and this right was explicitly reaffirmed by South Carolina in 1852. The declaration states that the agreement between South Carolina and the United States is subject to the law of compact, which creates obligations on both parties and which revokes the agreement if either party fails to uphold its obligations.

The next section asserts that the government of the United States and of states within that government had failed to uphold their obligations to South Carolina. The specific issue stated was the refusal of some states to enforce the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] and clauses in the U.S. Constitution protecting slavery and the federal government's perceived role in attempting to abolish slavery. 

The next section states that while these problems had existed for twenty-five years, the situation had recently become unacceptable due to the election of a President (this was [[Abraham Lincoln]] although he is not mentioned by name) who was planning to outlaw slavery. In reference to the failure of the northern states to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, South Carolina states the primary reason for its secession: 

{{Quote|The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Teaching Decl"/&gt;}}

The final section concludes with a statement that South Carolina had therefore seceded from the United States of America and was thus, no longer bound by its laws and authorities.

==Legacy==
While later claims have been made after the war's end that the South Carolinian decision to secede was prompted by other issues such as [[tariff]]s and taxes, these issues were not mentioned at all in the declaration. The primary focus of the declaration is the perceived violation of the Constitution by northern states in not extraditing escaped slaves (as the U.S. Constitution required in Article IV, Section 2) and actively working to abolish slavery (which South Carolinian secessionists saw as Constitutionally guaranteed and protected). The main thrust of the argument was that since the U.S. Constitution, being a contract, had been violated by some parties (the northern abolitionist states), the other parties (the southern slave-holding states) were no longer bound by it. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]] offered similar declarations when they seceded, following South Carolina's example.

The declaration does not make a simple declaration of states' rights. It asserts that South Carolina was a sovereign state that had delegated only particular powers to the federal government by means of the U.S. Constitution. It furthermore protests other states' failure to uphold their obligations under the Constitution. The declaration emphasizes that the Constitution explicitly requires states to deliver "person(s) held in service or labor" back to their state of origin.

The declaration was the second of three documents to be officially issued by the South Carolina Secession Convention. The first was the Ordinance of Secession itself. The third was "The Address of the people of South Carolina, assembled in Convention, to the people of the Slaveholding States of the United States", written by [[Robert Barnwell Rhett]], which called on other slave holding states to secede and join in forming a new nation. The convention resolved to print 15,000 copies of these three documents and distribute them to various parties.{{sfn|Journal of the Convention|1862|p=82, 88}}

The declaration was seen as analogous to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] from 1776, however, it omitted the phrases that "all men are created equal", "that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights", and "[[consent of the governed]]". Professor and historian [[Harry V. Jaffa]] noted this omission as significant in his 2000 book, ''A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War'':

{{Quote|South Carolina cites, loosely, but with substantial accuracy, some of the language of the original Declaration. That Declaration does say that it is the right of the people to abolish any form of government that becomes destructive of the ends for which it was established. But South Carolina does not repeat the preceding language in the earlier document: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal'...&lt;ref name=HVJaffap231&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780847699520|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jaffa states that South Carolina omitted references to human equality and consent of the governed, as due to their racist and pro-slavery views, secessionist South Carolinians did not believe in those ideals:

{{Quote|[G]overnments are legitimate only insofar as their "just powers" are derived "from the consent of the governed." All of the foregoing is omitted from South Carolina's declaration, for obvious reasons. In no sense could it have been said that the slaves in South Carolina were governed by powers derived from their consent. Nor could it be said that South Carolina was separating itself from the government of the Union because that government had become destructive of the ends for which it was established. South Carolina in 1860 had an entirely different idea of what the ends of government ought to be from that of 1776 or 1787. That difference can be summed up in the difference between holding slavery to be an evil, if possibly a necessary evil, and holding it to be a positive good.&lt;ref name=HVJaffap231/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">The '''Fon creation myth''' is the traditional [[creation myth|creation story]] of the [[Fon people]]s of [[West Africa]].  Various versions of the creation story are told. In most the creator is either [[Mawu]], the moon being and mother of all the gods and humanity, or [[Mawu|Mawu-Lisa]], the sun/moon being who is both male and female.  In others, [[Nana Buluku]] is the ultimate creator, an [[androgyny|androgynous]] deity who gave birth to the female Mawu and the male Lisa and passed the power over creation to them.

Many of the creation accounts tell of Mawu creating everything as she was carried from place to place on the back or in the mouth of [[Ayida-Weddo|Aido Hwedo]], the rainbow serpent.  The earth was created first, its curves, slopes and rises shaped by the winding, snaking motions of Aido Hwedo. Mountains formed from Aido Hwedo's excrement wherever they stopped to rest, leaving precious minerals inside.  When Mawu finished, all of the mountains, trees, elephants and other creations left world too heavy, so she asked Aido Hwedo to coil, to encircle the earth and rest underneath to support its weight.

Aido Hwedo holds his own tail in his mouth to hold fast to the earth, and rests in the cool of the seas which Mawu made for him to protect him from the heat. Mawu's son, Agbe, now commands them. Whenever Aido Hwedo shifts or readjusts his position, he causes an earthquake or tidal wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Courlander|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Historia Scholastica''''' is a twelfth-century [[Biblical paraphrase]] written in [[Medieval Latin]] by [[Petrus Comestor]].&lt;ref name="Morney1993"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=James H. Morey |first=James H. |last=Morey |title=Peter Comestor, Biblical Paraphrase, and the Medieval Popular Bible |journal=Speculum |volume=68 |issue=1 |date=January 1993 |pages=6–35 |doi=10.2307/2863832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes called the "Medieval Popular Bible", it draws on the Bible and other sources, including the works of classical scholars and the [[Fathers of the Church]], to present a [[universal history]] (universal, that is, from the perspective of [[medieval Europe]]).&lt;ref name="Morney1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Gareth|last2=Arrandale|first2=Rick|title=Blackwell Companion to Modern Theology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-5975-8|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Scholastica'' was a required part of the [[core curriculum]] at the [[University of Paris]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and other universities, and a significant [[secondary source]] of popular biblical knowledge from its completion around 1173&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ma'oz|first=Moshe|title=The Meeting of Civilizations: Muslim, Christian, and Jewish|year=2009|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1-84519-395-4|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the fifteenth century, although after about 1350 it was gradually supplanted by newer works.&lt;ref name="Morney1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seybolt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seybolt|first=Robert Francis|title=The ''Legenda Aurea'', Bible, and ''Historia Scholastica''|journal=Speculum|date=Jul 1946|volume=21|issue=3|pages=339–342|doi=10.2307/2851378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was translated into every major Western European [[vernacular]] of the period.&lt;ref name="Morney1993"/&gt;  Numerous paraphrases and abridgements were produced, in [[Latin]] and vernacular languages.&lt;ref name="Morney1993"/&gt;

It was among the [[incunabula|earliest printed works]], with editions appearing c. 1470 in both [[Strasbourg]] and [[Reutlingen]].&lt;ref name="Morney1993"/&gt;

The '''Irish Film Institute''' ('''IFI'''), formerly the '''Irish Film Centre''', is both an arthouse cinema and a national body that supports [[Cinema of Ireland|Irish Film]] heritage. The IFI presents film festivals, retrospectives and curated seasons, along with independent, Irish and foreign language films overlooked by commercial multiplexes at its cinemas in the Temple Bar quarter of Dublin. It maintains an archive of Irish films and provides education in film culture.

The IFI increases the range of films available to Irish audiences. New releases, national seasons, directors' retrospectives, thematic programmes, festivals, and special events have been regular features of the programme. Every year, the IFI rewards its audiences by hosting an Open Day, with free cinema screenings and tours. In 2011, the IFI was awarded Dublin's Best Cinema in Dublin Living Awards. In the last two decades the IFI has seen over 3.1 million cinema attendances to see 63,000 screenings of over 5900 different films. The IFI Café Bar has been serving over 1.78 million cups of tea and coffee to audiences that include over 8,000 members. The IFI Irish Film Archive contains 611 different collections with over 26,000 cans of films, the oldest of which, a [[Lumiere brothers]] film of Dublin and Belfast, dates back to 1897. In 2012, the IFI celebrated its 20th birthday in its landmark location in [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] with special screenings, talks, blogs, a series of commissioned illustrations by members of Temple Bar Graphic Studios, a QR code trail and pop-up museum and exhibition.

The IFI is a company limited by guarantee with charitable status.

==Mission==
{{ad|date=June 2013}}
The IFI has three core activities: 

;EXHIBIT: The IFI delivers a challenging and diverse programme of the best of international and Irish film culture through a programme of new releases, curated seasons, festivals and events. The IFI is committed to providing its audience with access to the best of new Irish film, including a number of films that would not otherwise have a theatrical release, and many films that would not otherwise be seen in Ireland.{{cn|date=June 2013}}
;PRESERVE: The IFI Irish Film Archive acquires, preserves and makes available Ireland’s moving image heritage, working to ensure that Ireland’s rich and varied film history, both amateur and professional, is protected and accessible for the benefit of current and future generations.{{cn|date=June 2013}}
;EDUCATE: IFI Education actively introduces new audiences to film culture and provides young people throughout Ireland with access to challenging and inspiring cinema. This is achieved through an extensive schools programme, both at the IFI and touring nationally, and through a number of innovative programmes aimed at family, youth and lifelong learning audiences.{{cn|date=June 2013}}

==History==
The National Film Institute (NFI, now the IFI) was founded in 1943 and officially incorporated on 2 June 1945. While the other leading film organisation of the time, the Irish Film Society, was interested in interpreting and understanding the art of cinema, the NFI saw itself as the teacher and moral guardian of the cinema-going public.

Under Archbishop McQuaid's direction, the NFI not only maintained a distributing library of films available to schools, colleges and associations around the country, but also became involved in the production of safety, health and educational films in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. Many of these were commissioned by government departments to offer information on matters of public health and safety, personal finance, and on historical and cultural subjects. The Institute also produced numerous educational 'filmstrips' for use in the classroom by teachers. Also notable is a series of films recording the highlights of All-Ireland Hurling and Football Finals between 1947 and 1979.

By the early 1980s, Church influence within the NFI had declined, and in 1982, the decision was made to delete references to the Vigilanti Cura from the articles of association to reflect the now secular nature of the Institute, and to rename the organisation as the Irish Film Institute (IFI). While it was clear that the Irish Film Institute was no longer concerned with the morals of its audience, education through (and about) film was still a significant part of its remit: an education department was developed with the aim of bringing a broader and deeper experience of cinema to audiences of all ages and abilities, from primary school children to senior citizens.

At this time of reinvention and reinvigoration, a campaign to create the Irish Film Centre (IFC) as a home for the Institute and other organisations dealing with film culture got underway, and an 18th-century Quaker Meeting House was acquired in the regenerated area of Temple Bar in Dublin. The Irish Film Centre (which is still home to the IFI) was opened in Eustace Street on 23 September 1992 by the then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. In the two decades since its move to Eustace Street, the IFI has become one of the busiest and most dynamic arts organisations in the country, engaging with audiences nationally and internationally.

Aside from providing the IFI with a centrally located public space with (then) two cinemas, a film shop and café bar, the new venue allowed the Institute to develop other aspects of its activities in addition to its main exhibition programme, such as the education, festivals and retrospective programmes. The location also provided the IFI Irish Film Archive with custom-built storage and research facilities, thereby ensuring that it was recognised as an essential part of the IFI, safeguarding its collections and increasing public access to its holdings.

The IFI has had many homes over the years and has seen a radical transformation in its ethos since its foundation; however, a commitment to and love of cinema have always been central to its mission. In 2009, the IFI underwent an extensive redevelopment, supported by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism ACCESS II Scheme, which expanded its facilities to include a third cinema and new archive research facilities, allowing it to have ever more ambitious aims for itself and its audiences, while remaining dedicated to achieving its core objectives: Preserve, Exhibit and Educate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifi.ie/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==

The IFI runs annual festival, including [http://www.ifi.ie/whatson/festivals/ifi-family-festival-2012/ IFI Family Festival] (August), [http://www.ifi.ie/whatson/festivals/stf/ IFI Docfest] (September), [http://www.ifi.ie/horrorthon IFI Horrorthon] (October), [http://www.ifi.ie/FrenchFest IFI French Film Festival] (November), [http://www.kinopolis.com.pl/ Kinopolis] – Polish Film Festival;(December)

==IFI Irish Film Archive &amp; Library==

The IFI [[Irish Film Archive]] acquires, preserves and makes available Ireland's moving image heritage, working to ensure that Ireland's rich and varied film history, both amateur and professional, is protected and accessible for the benefit of current and future generations. Film reels, digital materials and document collections are held in custom- built, climate- controlled vaults designed for the long- term storage of archival materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifi.ie/archive&lt;/ref&gt; 

Named in honour of Tiernan MacBride in recognition of his contribution to the Irish film industry, the Library holds one of the largest collections of film related publications in Ireland. The collection includes a wide range of books, journals, and reports covering both international and Irish cinema. The Library’s collections are reference only, researchers, students, teachers, filmmakers and members of the public are all welcome to use the Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifi.ie/learn/research-library/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IFI International==
IFI International provides Irish film programming services for cultural exhibitors worldwide. Drawing on the collections of the IFI Irish Film Archive and liaising with Irish film directors, producers and distributors, IFI International provides access for cultural exhibitors to new and classic Irish cinema. distributing archival and cultural cinema to international venues and has programmed work in New York’s [[MoMA]] and [[Lincoln Centre]], [[New Dehli]], Moscow, [[Brussels]] and [[Poland]], to name a few.

Supported by [[Culture Ireland]], IFI International works with over 100 exhibition partners in more than 40 countries annually to strategically develop a global audience for Irish film culture. Irish film programmes are presented in contexts which enhance understanding of Irish cinema and which provide new routes for audiences who may be unfamiliar with Irish culture.

==Other activities==

The IFI also provides a venue for debate and acts as a meeting place for a variety of groups. A series of public interviews has brought many international filmmakers and actors to IFI audiences over the years, including John Woo, Peter Greenaway, Dennis Hopper, Atom Egoyan, Sydney Pollack, Tim Roth, Joel Schumacher, Juliette Binoche, John C. Reilly, U2's Larry Mullen Jr. and Claude Miller. Evening courses offer opportunities to explore everything from Indian cinema and America independents to Spanish film, with lectures following each screening. Throughout the month, the IFI offers a wide range of activities and special screenings, including: The IFI Film Club (post-screening discussion), The Bigger Picture (A film chosen by a guest as a notable film canon), Wild Strawberries (morning screenings for the senior audiences), IFI Family (family-friendly films), Irish Focus (monthly showcase of new Irish film, often followed by a Q&amp;A with filmmakers), Archive at Lunchtime (free archive screenings), Feast Your Eyes (dinner club screenings), Mystery Matinee (a surprise film each month), From the Vaults (a film from the archives) Afternoon Talks, Monthly Must-See Cinema, Experimental Film Club and others. 
Films from the IFI Irish Film Archive are subsequently restored and released on DVD over the years, including Seoda, GAA Gold, GAA Hurling Gold, GAA Football Gold, Irish Destiny, The O’Kalem Collection.

==Technology==

In 2009, the IFI improved its facilities, including the introduction of digital sound, larger screens in each cinema, and the installation of Ireland's only functioning 70mm projection system in Cinema 1. The IFI is the only cinema in the country screening films in all possible formats – from Digibeta, DVD, Blu-ray and DCP, to 8, 16, 35 or 70mm. It also screens film in 3D.

==Financial Model==

The IFI operates a model of cultural enterprise, using core Arts Council subsidy to procure diverse income streams which are then invested back into our{{who|date=June 2013}} core activities to maximise the impact to the public of Arts Council funding.  The Arts Council's support of the IFI generates significant returns to the State, both economically and culturally. In 2010 the IFI used public subsidy of €800,000 to run a cultural organisation that employs 60 people and has an annual turnover of just over €3 million.{{cn|date=June 2013}}

==Patrons==
President [[Michael D. Higgins]] is the honorary Patron of the IFI.  	

==Venue==

There are three cinemas: Cinema 1 has a capacity of 258; Cinema 2 holds 106 people; and Cinema 3 seats 58. They are wheelchair accessible and support the use of hearing aids.

==IFI Film Shop==

IFI Film Shop stocks a wide selection of literature about Irish cinema, as well as Irish and world films on video and DVD.

'''John Walker III''' (1906 [[Pittsburgh]] - 1995 [[Amberley, West Sussex]]) was an American art [[curator]], and the second director of the [[National Gallery of Art]], from 1956 to 1969.

==Life==
Walker received an undergraduate degree in art history from [[Harvard University]] in 1930, where he studied with [[Paul J. Sachs]].
He formed the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art, with [[Philip Johnson]], [[Lincoln Kirstein]], and [[Edward Warburg]].  
He studied at Villa I Tatti in Florence with [[Bernard Berenson]], and served as professor and assistant director of the [[American Academy in Rome]] from 1935 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OBITUARY : John Walker|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-walker-1579816.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-10-14|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker became chief curator of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1939 and was involved in identifying works of art looted by the Nazis following World War II.  In 1956 he was named director of the National Gallery, succeeding [[David E. Finley Jr.]], and remained in the position until his retirement in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/17/arts/john-walker-washington-curator-dies-at-88.html| title=John Walker, Washington Curator, Dies at 88| work=The New York Times| author=Roberta Smith| date=October 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure at the gallery, Walker cultivated donor relationships with collectors such as the [[Andrew W. Mellon|Mellon]] family, [[Joseph Widener]], [[Armand Hammer]], and [[Chester Dale]]; his significant acquisitions included [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Aristotle with the Bust of Homer'', [[Fragonard]]'s ''La Liseuse'', [[El Greco]]'s ''Laocoon'', and the ''Ginevra de' Benci'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  Walker was the author of six books, including ''Bellini and Titian'' and ''Titian at Ferrara'', and an autobiography, ''Self-Portrait with Donors''. Like his predecessor, David Finley, Walker served on the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], from 1967 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Luebke, ed., ''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts'' (Washington, D.C.:  U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013):  Appendix B, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korean Film Archive''' or called '''Korean Federation of Film Archives''' and '''KOFA''' is the sole film archive in [[South Korea]] with nationwide coverage. It was founded in [[Seoul]] in 1974 as a non-profit organization. In 1976 KOFA joined the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) as an observer, and gained its full membership of FIAF in 1985.&lt;ref name="Doosan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?&amp;masterno=703468&amp;contentno=703468 |title=한국영상자료원 Korean Federation of Film Archives 韓國映像資料院|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafilm.org/kofa/history.asp |title=Korean Film Archive |publisher=Koreafilm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KOFA's main duties are to collect, preserve and categorize films and film-related materials, as well as to foster accessibility to its collections. Most of remaining originals and copies of Korean films are preserved in KOFA. Its main center is in [[Sangam-dong]], Seoul, with two local branch centers in [[Busan]] and [[Bucheon]], and a secondary preservation center in [[Seongnam]]. Its main center has several public facilities, including Cinematheque KOFA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreafilm.org/theatre/schedule.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Korean Film Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreafilm.org/museum/introduction.asp |title=Korean Film Archive |publisher=Koreafilm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115025259/http://www.koreafilm.org/museum/introduction.asp |archivedate=2010-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reference library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafilm.org/library/library.asp |title=Korean Film Archive |publisher=Koreafilm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently KOFA has concentrated on digitization of Korean films, and has published several features of the Classic Korean Cinema DVD Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafilm.org/publica/dvds.asp |title=Korean Film Archive |publisher=Koreafilm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates the most reliable online database of Korean films,&lt;ref name="한국영화 데이터베이스 KMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/index.asp |title=한국영화 데이터베이스 KMDB |publisher=Kmdb.or.kr |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an online film streaming service.&lt;ref name="한국영화 데이터베이스 KMDB"/&gt;

'''''Lingshu Jing''''' ({{zh|s=灵枢经|t=靈樞經|p=Língshūjīng}}), also known as '''''Divine Pivot''''', '''''Spiritual Pivot''''', or '''''Numinous Pivot''''', is an ancient Chinese medical text whose earliest version was probably compiled in the 1st century BCE on the basis of earlier texts.&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1993), 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two parts of a larger medical work known as the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' ('''Inner Canon of Huangdi''' or '''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon''').  The other section, which is more commonly used in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], is known as the ''[[Suwen]]'' 素問 ("Basic Questions").

==Textual history==

No version of the ''Lingshu'' prior to the 12th century has survived. Most scholars presume that the original title of the ''Lingshu'' was either ''Zhenjing'' 鍼經 ["Classic of Acupuncture" or "Needling Canon"] or ''Jiujuan'' 九卷 ["Nine Fascicles"]. They base this conclusion on the following evidence:
* The ''Huangdi neijing'' was listed as a book in 18 juan 卷 ("fascicles") in the bibliographical chapter ("Yiwenzhi" 藝文志) of [[Ban Gu]]'s 班固 [[Hanshu|Book of Han]] (''Hanshu'' 漢書).&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1993), 196.&lt;/ref&gt; That chapter was itself based on the ''Qilue'' 七略 ["Seven Summaries"], a bibliography that [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] 劉向 (79-8 BCE) and his son [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] 劉歆 (ca. 46 BCE-AD 23) compiled on the basis of a survey they began in 26 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi and Nylan (2003), 68, n. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zhang Zhongjing's preface to his ''Shanghan zabing lun'' 傷寒雜病論 ["Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Illnesses"] (before 220 CE) mentions that he compiled his work on the basis of books that included the ''Suwen'' and the ''Jiujuan'' 九卷 ["Nine fascicles"]. In turn, the passages that [[Huangfu Mi]] (215-282) attributed to the ''Jiujuan'' in his ''AB Canon of Acupuncture and [[Moxibustion]]'' (''Zhenjiu jiayi jing'' 鍼灸甲乙經) all have equivalents in the received edition of the ''Lingshu''.
* In the preface to his ''AB Canon of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'', Huangfu Mi claimed that the book listed as ''Huangdi neijing'' in the "Qilue yiwenzhi" 七略藝文志 was composed of two different parts: the ''Suwen'' ("Basic Questions") and the ''Zhenjing'' ("Needling Canon"), each in 9 juan, for a total of 18 juan.
* In the preface to Wang Bing's 762 edition of the ''Suwen'' (762 CE), where he identified ''Lingshu'' as the second of the two texts that comprised the ''Huangdi neijing'' in his time.&lt;ref name="Sivin 1993 203"&gt;Sivin (1993), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first instance of the title ''Lingshu''.
* Various titles similar to ''Zhenjing'' and ''Lingshu'' appeared in the bibliographies of the ''Old Book of Tang'' (''Jiu Tangshu'' 舊唐書) and the ''New Book of Tang'' (''Xin Tangshu'' 新唐書), suggesting that many different manuscript editions of a similar book were circulating in [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] times.&lt;ref&gt;Okanishi (1974), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles as seen in the ''Old Book of Tang'' were: ''Huangdi zhenjing'' 黃帝鍼經 ["Yellow Emperor's Canon of Acupuncture"] (in 9 juan), ''Huangdi zhenjiu jing'' 黃帝鍼灸經 ["Yellow Emperor's Canon of Acupuncture and Moxibustion"] (12 juan), ''Huangdi jiuling jing'' 黃帝九靈經 [Yellow Emperor's Nine-Spirit Canon], and ''Yugui zhenjing'' 玉匱針經 ["Canon of Acupuncture of the Golden Casket"] (12 juan).
* Early in the 11th century, the ''Huangdi zhenjing'' ["Yellow Emperor's Canon of Acupuncture"] was among the medical books the [[Goryeo]] court imported from [[Song dynasty|Song]] China.&lt;ref&gt;Jeon (1974), 259-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1067, the editors of the ''Suwen'' admitted that "since the ''Lingshu'' is no longer complete, we can no longer be sure" whether what Wang Bing called "Lingshu" always referred to the ''Zhenjing''.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Sivin (1993), 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1091, the Song court requested a copy of the ''Zhenjing'' from Goryeo, which delivered the book in 1093.&lt;ref name="Sivin 1993 203"&gt;Sivin (1993), 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sohn (1959), citing Wang Yingling's 王應臨 ''Yuhai'' 玉海 ["Sea of Jade"; completed before 1296], 63.23b.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1155, a scholar called Shi Song 史崧, "regretting that ''Lingshu'' has long been out of circulation," presented his 24-juan edition of that book to the imperial court.&lt;ref name="Sivin 1993 203"&gt;Sivin (1993), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; His recension claimed to be based on a copy kept in his family, which he compared with fragments cited in other works. His renaming of the "Zhenjing" to "Lingshu" followed Wang Bing.

==Editions==

All current editions of the ''Lingshu'' are based on Shi Song's edition from 1155. The earliest extant edition was made in 1339 and 1340, under the [[Yuan dynasty]], by a publishing house called the Gulin shutang 古林書堂.&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1993), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; One copy of this edition is still preserved at the [[National Library of China]] (Guojia tushuguan 国家图书馆) in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo Zhongyi yanjiu yuan tushuguan (1991), 1, item 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulin shutang edition was the earliest known joint edition of ''Lingshu'' and ''Suwen''.

Many practitioners through the ages have believed that the name "Lingshu" reflected the complex esoteric nature of the writings. It has been suggested that only someone of sufficient spiritual advancement (i.e. "Ling") could fully understand its true messages.

'''Malcolm A. Rogers''', [[CBE]] (born October 3, 1948 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]) is an [[England|English]] art historian who served as the Ann and Graham Gund Director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 1994 through 2015. An expert on [[portraiture]], Rogers has published extensively on the subject.

==Career==
A native of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Rogers was educated at [[Oakham School]] and later went on to receive degrees from [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] of the [[University of Oxford]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with first class honors and a [[D.Phil.]] in English. 

Rogers served as deputy director at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[London]], and in 1994, he was appointed the Ann and Graham Gund Director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], where he remained until being replaced by [[Matthew Teitelbaum]] in 2015.

A year after his appointment as director, Rogers undertook many building renovation projects including the openings of the museum's historic side entrances, which had been previously inaccessible. In addition, Rogers eliminated admission fees for children aged seventeen and under, and instituted a series of free public days.

In 1999, Rogers helped launch the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]] as a sister museum in order to internationalize the museum's brand. 

Rogers led the fundraising campaign that raised over $500 million to build a new wing for the museum's American art collection, which was completed in 2008. The wing was designed by the [[London]]-based architecture firm of [[Foster and Partners]]. In 2010, a glass-enclosed courtyard was built adjacent to the new wing.

==Controversies==
Rogers was criticized during his tenure at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston for his large salary and benefits packages that he received as director {{by whom|date=December 2015}}.  In 2013, it was reported that he received a total compensation of over $900,000 including a housing allowance of over $60,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/24/perks-come-with-job-running-some-prominent-area-arts-and-cultural-institutions/F3g3YbJQ9Y5NxK51bxKtjP/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Rogers has been criticized for firing two long-term curators in 1999, namely [[Jonathan Leo Fairbanks]] (28-year tenure) and [[Anne Poulet]] (20-year tenure), which also led other senior curators such as [[Theodore Stebbins]] (22-year tenure) to resign from their posts.

In 2003, Roger's decision to lend twenty-one [[Claude Monet|Monet]] paintings to the [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] resort in [[Las Vegas]] in exchange for $1 million also caused significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/09/12/malcolm_x/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario Borrelli''' (19 September 1922, in [[Naples]] – 13 February 2007, in [[Oxford]]) was a Neapolitan priest, sociologist and educationist.

Mario Borrelli received the attention of press and television for decades, overseas more than in Italy, his own country. The popularity of his social undertakings is demonstrated by hundreds of publications presently in the phase of being catalogued.
Mario Borrelli fits with the definition of organic intellectual according to Gramsci’s terminology: his historical and social studies mark the most significant stages of his life but especially his work in society.
Editor and Director of Lo Scugnizzo, media outlet of La Casa dello Scugnizzo (The House of the Urchins), he harboured multiple interests other than that for the social sciences. He was author of autobiographies, poems, scripts and educational projects until the 80’s when he principally narrowed down his interests to peace research and education.
His works still remain partly unpublished.
The documents and articles indicated below can only partly be found in Italian and foreign libraries, while the entire collection of publications is stored in his private archive of the Borrelli-West family, which continues to spend time and dedication to the catalogueing of Mario Borrelli’s main biographies and especially of his rich historical and critical production.
It should be stressed that the list of documents and publications indicated below, although representative of Mario Borrelli’s works, is by no means complete.

==Autobiographies==
Mario Borrelli was already popular in Anglophile countries since the 50’s thanks to the biographical novel Children of the Sun written by Morris West, in which his undertakings as priest-street urchin had been celebrated as an example of heroism and Christianity.
When, in 1963, he wrote together with A. Thorne his first autobiography, A Street Lamp and the Stars, it was with the aim to share with his trustees, around the world, both the story behind the foundation of the Casa dello Scugnizzo (House of the Urchins) and the spirit with which he continued to welcome and raise so many maladapted children.
In 1967, Un Prete nelle Baracche, was inspired by the diary he had kept between 1962–63, the first years he had spent in the slums of Naples, where the street urchins most commonly came from.

==Historical-archival research==
Archivist paleographer in education and researcher at the Archive of the Padri Girolamini Library in Naples, Mario Borrelli produced several bibliographic works.
From 1961, he published essays and articles of social and humanitary relevance such as L’Archivio del Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo (details below).
The volumes dedicated to the Cardinal [[Cesare Baronio]] and to the Neapolitan Oratory gave a significant contribution to the Neapolitan studies of the 15th-century.

==Works on social administration==
The works on social administration are the result of the years M. Borrelli spent at the London School of Economics to obtain a Master in Social Administration.
From the socio-political analysis of the sub-proletarian reality of Naples (1973) to the basic concepts for a comunitary action on the urban underclass (1974) we find the basic principles, which inspired M. Borrelli in all his activities at the Materdei Community Centre.
In addition, between 1969 and 1978, his idea of a participative democracy was a guideline for all his actions of social intervention among the people of the lower classes of the Neapolitan population: the CCM (Materdei Community Centre) worked for the awareness of the underclass taking inspiration from the method of Paulo Freire.
Extremely interesting are the essays focused on the relationship between school and capitalistic development in Italy (1972) e Italian compulsory schooling and mental retardation (1978).

==Peace research and education==
In 1977, Mario Borrelli was among the founders of IPRI (Italian Peace Research Institute) and soon afterwards became a member of PEC, Peace Education Commission, within IPRA (International Peace Research Association).
His essays on peace education were aimed at finding a paradigm that would consider peace education an autonomous science in the same way as peace research.
His most famous essay was Integration Between Peace Research, Peace Education and Peace Action, which was presented at the IPRA General Conference that took place in Oaxtapec, Mexico in 1977, a milestone for many researchers interested in peace education.

'''Michael Maclagan''', [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]] (14 April 1914 – 13 August 2003) was a British historian, [[antiquarian|antiquary]] and [[Officer of Arms|herald]]. He was Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], for more than forty years, a long-serving [[Officer of Arms|officer of arms]], and [[Mayors of Oxford|Lord Mayor of Oxford]] 1970–71.


==Career==
Maclagan was born in London and educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He graduated from Christ Church with a first class degree in 1935, and was awarded the Gladstone Memorial Exhibition. After two years as a lecturer at Christ Church, he was elected a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] in 1939 (the last Fellow to be so elected before the outbreak of [[World War II]]). At both Winchester and Oxford he was a member of the [[Officer Training Corps]];&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34529|page=4408|date=8 July 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35109|supp=y|page=1589|date=14 March 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he served as President of the [[Oxford University Archaeological Society]].

===World War II===
In February 1941, Maclagan was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[16th/5th Lancers]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35099|supp=y|page=1429|date=7 March 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of the war in staff and intelligence jobs: for a period he was in Cairo, but he was subsequently posted to Military Operations in the [[War Office]] in London, where his proficiency in Italian and Serbo-Croat stood him in good stead. He ultimately reached the rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]].

===Post-war===
In 1946, Maclagan returned to Trinity College, where he remained as Fellow and Tutor in Modern History until his retirement in 1981. For many years he shared teaching duties with the [[Early modern period|early modern]] scholar [[John Phillips Cooper]] (1920–1978). He held various college offices (including Dean, Librarian, Senior Tutor, Vice-President, and steward of the [[Common Room (university)|Senior Common Room)]]; was [[Proctor|Senior Proctor]] for the University in 1954–5; and he also served as Senior Librarian (1960–70) and Trustee (1970–99) of the [[Oxford Union]].

Outside the University, he served as a university-appointed [[alderman]] on [[Oxford City Council]], and held the offices of Sheriff in 1964–5, and [[Mayors of Oxford|Lord Mayor]] in 1970–71. He served as Chairman of the [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford Diocesan]] Advisory Committee, 1961–85; and as Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners|Scriveners' Company]], 1988–9.

He had lifelong interests in [[heraldry]] and [[genealogy]], and served both as a [[Private Officer of Arms|private officer of arms]] and at the [[College of Arms]] in London. He began his heraldic career in 1948 with an appointment as [[Slains Pursuivant|Slains Pursuivant of Arms]], and held that office until 1970. This appointment was made by the [[Clan Hay#Chief|Chief of the Name and Arms of Hay]] after the resurgence of private armorial officers following World War II.

In 1953 Maclagan was made an Officer Brother of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39743|pages=94–95|date=2 January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a Gold Staff Officer at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] and as a Green Staff Officer at the Investiture of the [[Prince of Wales]] in 1969. In 1970, he was appointed [[Portcullis Pursuivant|Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary]] at the College of Arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45066 |page=3415 |date=24 March 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post for 10 years until his promotion to the office of [[Richmond Herald]] on 14 July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=48255|page=10239|date=18 July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclagan held this last office until his retirement in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=51630|page=1187|date=30 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 75.

On his retirement from Trinity in 1981, a portrait of Maclagan in his herald's [[tabard]] by [[Paul Brason]] was commissioned by the Trinity Society and presented to the College: it is now hung in the [[Great hall|screens passage]] to the College dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in colour in ''Trinity College Oxford Report'' (1981), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Maclagan was characterised by his obituary-writer in ''[[The Times]]'' as an [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], rather than an historian.&lt;ref&gt;"Lives in Brief", ''The Times'', 21 Aug. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patric Dickinson (genealogist)|Patric Dickinson]], in the ''Independent'', called him "the quintessential Oxford don – a scholar of the old school, erudite, antiquarian and stylish", who "seemed to have strayed from an earlier age".&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Dickinson, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-maclagan-548684.html Michael Maclagan]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 2 Sept. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He had an eclectic range of historical interests spanning all periods (particularly, but far from exclusively, in the fields of genealogy, heraldry and bibliography); he was more concerned with arcane detail, for which he had a remarkable memory, than with [[Metanarrative|grand narrative]]; and he tended to pursue topics and projects which appealed to him, rather than those which might advance his career. All this meant that he published less than he might have done. 

He was a proficient linguist, fluent in Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian and Serbo-Croat, and with some knowledge of Arabic. His first book, in 1949, was a translation of part of the Venerable [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation]]''.

Many of his core interests were genealogical. He had a longstanding expertise in the history of the medieval Anglo-Norman family of [[de Clare]], although little of this came to print. His principal foray into modern history was a well-received biography of a kinsman (through his mother), the [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|first Earl Canning]], who was Governor-General of India during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and first [[Viceroy]] of India. He is best known to students of royal and noble genealogies and royal families as co-author (with Jiří Louda, who compiled and drew the tables, while Maclagan wrote the text) of the best-selling ''Lines of Succession'', first published in 1981, and subsequently reprinted and revised on several occasions.

He was also interested in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] history, and in 1968 published a history of [[Constantinople]]. For many years he spent part of his summer vacation as a popular lecturer on [[Swan Hellenic]] cruises in the eastern Mediterranean.

He was a keen [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]], and built up an extensive collection of rare books. In 1960 he published an edition of Bishop [[Richard de Bury]]'s ''Philobiblon'', one of the earliest studies of librarianship. He was a meticulous indexer: his biography of Canning was awarded the [[Society of Indexers]]' Wheatley Medal in 1962; and in 1988 he compiled the index for [[Francis Jones (Welsh historian)|Francis Jones]]'s ''Catalogue of Welsh Manuscripts in the College of Arms''.

==Family==
Michael Maclagan was the son of Sir [[Eric Maclagan]] (1879–1951), for many years director of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. His mother, Helen Elizabeth Lascelles (10 October 1879 – 19 October 1942),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsandleaves.com/ Wombat's Family Forest -Family History and Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt; who married Eric Maclagan on 8 July 1913, was a granddaughter of the 4th [[Earl of Harewood]]: she was a sister of Sir [[Alan Lascelles|Alan "Tommy" Lascelles]], [[Private Secretary]] to King [[George VI]] and a second cousin once removed to the 7th Earl of Harewood who married Mary, [[Princess Royal]], only daughter of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and sister to King George VI. 

Maclagan's paternal grandfather was the Most Reverend [[William Dalrymple Maclagan]] (1826–1910), [[Archbishop of York]] from 1891 to 1908, and the cleric who had crowned Queen Alexandra in 1902. His paternal grandmother, second wife of the Archbishop, was the Honourable Augusta Anne Barrington (1836–1915),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p1763.htm#i17622 The Peerage.com]&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of the 6th Viscount Barrington. (Augusta Maclagan had money settled upon her when she married Maclagan, then Bishop of Lichfield, in 1878: about half her money was settled on her son Eric when he married in 1913, giving him and his wife a considerable degree of financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:z8hh98gZ4uAJ:www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Maltby.pdf+Maclagan+Lascelles&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9 Financial position of the Honourable Augusta Maclagan, her son Eric Maclagan, etc], in a scholarly paper on women's investments 1900-1939 (cache version)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Through both his mother and his paternal grandmother, Maclagan thus had connections to several British aristocratic families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kittybrewster.com/ancestry/canning.htm Kittybrewster]&lt;/ref&gt; The Honourable Augusta Maclagan was a great-granddaughter of the 9th [[Earl of Strathmore]] and Kinghorne; thus making her grandson Michael Maclagan a distant kinsman to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]].

==Personal life==
Maclagan was twice married. His first marriage in 1939 to a cousin, Brenda Alexander, was dissolved by divorce in 1946. His second marriage in 1949 to Jean Elizabeth Brooksbank Garnett lasted almost 54 years; she died on 3 August 2003. He died ten days later on the day of her funeral. Maclagan had a son by his first marriage, and a son (who died, aged 26, in 1984) and two daughters by his second marriage.

'''Mokoš''' ({{lang-orv|Мокошь}}) is a [[Slavic goddess]] mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]], protector of women's work and women's destiny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=mokosh+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xMpdUfj8BYm68ATRgoHICg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20goddess&amp;f=false Russian folk belief By Linda J. Ivantis]&lt;/ref&gt; She watches over spinning and weaving, shearing of sheep,{{citation needed|reason=the shearing of sheep needs a citation|date=December 2015}} and protects women in childbirth. Mokosh is the [[Mother Goddess|Great Mother]].&lt;ref name=katicic2003&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Radoslav Katičić|Katičić]] |first=Radoslav |title=Die Hauswirtin am Tor: Auf den Spuren der großen Göttin in Fragmenten slawischer und baltischer sakraler Dichtung |year=2003 |publisher=PETER LANG |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=3-631-50896-4 |url=http://www.peterlang.com/detail/buch/35057/5/50896/ |ref=Katičić 2003 |pages=40 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074137/http://www.peterlang.com/detail/buch/35057/5/50896/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokoš was the only female deity whose idol was erected by [[Vladimir the Great]] in his [[Kiev]] sanctuary along with statues of other major gods ([[Perun]], [[Hors]], [[Dažbog]], [[Stribog]], and [[Simargl]]).

==Etymology and origin==
Mokosh probably means [[moisture]]. According to [[Max Vasmer]], her name is derived from the same root as Slavic words  ''mokry'', 'wet', and ''moknut(i)'', 'get wet'. Or to dive deeply into something. She may have originated in the northern  [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric tribes]] of the [[Vogul]], who still have the divinity ''Moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture|last=Hubbs|first=Joanna|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=Sep 22, 1993|isbn=0253115787|location=Indiana|pages=20|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Myth==
[[File:Makosh-XIX Lob.png|thumb|150px|Mokosh.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Embroidery pattern ca 19th century.]]
Mokoš was one of the most popular Slavic deities and the great earth [[Mother Goddess]] of [[East Slavs]] and [[Polans (eastern)|Eastern Polans]]. She is a [[Nomad|wanderer]] and a [[Spinning (textiles)|spinner]]. Her consorts are probably both the god of thunder [[Perun]] and his opponent [[Veles (god)|Veles]]. In saying, the former Katičić follows Ivanov and Toporov (1983) without further corroborating their claim.&lt;ref name=katicic2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Gazdarica na vratima: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2010 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-59-3 |url=http://www.matica.hr/knjige/816/ |ref=Katičić 2010 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katičić also points to the possibility that as goddess Vela she is the consort of Veles, and might even be interpreted as another form of the polymorph god Veles himself.&lt;ref name=katicic2010/&gt;{{rp| 167–198}} Mokosh is also the mother of the twin siblings [[Jarilo]] and [[Marzanna|Morana]]{{fact|date=July 2018}}.

Archeological evidence of Mokosh dates back to the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haarmann (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jr8SglurL90C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJOAVKXfMMiZNu-ngTg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mokosh&amp;f=false]''". Introducing the Mythological Crescent: Ancient Beliefs and Imagery p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 19th century, she was worshipped as a force of fertility and the ruler of death. Worshipers prayed to Mokosh-stones or [[Kurgan stelae|breast-shaped boulders]] that held power over the land and its people.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan (2010). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8zHxlL8my-YC&amp;pg=PA516&amp;lpg=PA516&amp;dq=mokosh+in+embroidery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZUEHYOCHX9&amp;sig=WLqcg1DyrQ9Jx-iKspakhKltSAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6VxeUZ6zBI-I9QSip4CwAw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20in%20embroidery&amp;f=false]''". Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], Mokosh is still popular as a powerful life giving force and protector of women. Villages are named after her. She shows up in embroidery, represented as a woman with uplifted hands and flanked by two plow horses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=mokosh+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xMpdUfj8BYm68ATRgoHICg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20&amp;f=false Russian folk belief]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes she is shown with male sexual organs, as the deity in charge of male potency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVQz3I4FCWUC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=57j1UejGNpLU8wSx04HYDQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh&amp;f=false Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture By Joanna Hubbs p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key myth in [[Slavic mythology]], is the [[Perun#Myth|divine battle]] between the thunder god [[Perun]] and his opponent the god [[Veles (god)|Veles]]. Some authors and the original researchers Ivanov and Toporov believe, the abduction of Mokosh causes the struggle,&lt;ref&gt; although Ivanov and Toporov nowhere quote original sources indicating that fact. Compare: Katičić (2010){{rp|210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ha2hlK0volAC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=Mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJOAVKXfMMiZNu-ngTg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mokosh&amp;f=false Pushkin's Historical Imagination by Svetlana Evdokimova p. 216]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Boris Rybakov]], in his 1987 work ''Paganism of Ancient Rus'',&lt;ref name="Rybakov"&gt;{{cite book | author =Boris Rybakov | title =Язычество Древней Руси (Paganism of Ancient Rus) | year =1987 | editor = | pages = | chapter =Святилища, идолы и игрища | chapterurl =http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/st003.shtml | publisher =Nauka | location =Moscow | id = | url =http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/ | format = | accessdate = |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mokosh is represented on one of the sides of the [[Zbruch Idol]].

==Christianization==
[[File:Mokosh-1 (SCHLEUSING).jpg|thumb|Warning from the Christian church against worshipping Mokosh]]
During [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] there were warnings issued against worshipping Mokoš. She was replaced by the cult of the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Paraskevi of Iconium|St. Paraskevia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]]'', ''[[Vladimir Toporov]]''. Mokoš./ ''В. В. Иванов, В. Н. Топоров'' - «Мокошь». Мифы народов мира, т. II. М.:Российская энциклопедия, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traces of Mokosh in place names ==
Traces of Mokosh are today well preserved in the various toponyms of Slavic countries. In Slovenia her name has been preserved in a village called Makoše in the vicinity of Ribnica, historically known as Makoša or Makoš, and also in the River Mokoš in the Prekmurje region. In Croatia, near the Rieka lies the village of Mokošica, and near Dubrovnik the village Makoše, and also the suburb areas of Nova and Stara Mokošica. A village near Zagreb is also called Mokos. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, near the village Ravno is located a hill called Mukušina. South of Mostar lies the hill Mukoša.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Češarek|first=Domen|date=2016|title=Mala gora pri Ribnici – mitološko izročilo v prostoru (Mala Gora (Little Mountain) by Ribnica – Cosmic myth in mythical landscape)|url=http://sms.zrc-sazu.si/pdf/19/SMS_19_06_Cesarek.pdf|journal=Studia mythologica Slavica|volume=19|pages=135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Patriotic Party''' ('''NPP''') is a [[political party]] in [[Liberia]]. It was formed in 1997 by members of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] following the end of the [[First Liberian Civil War]].

==History==
The party contested the [[Liberian general election, 1997|1997 general election]], with the NPFL's leader, [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], serving as the party's presidential candidate. Taylor won the presidential election with 75% of the vote. The party also won 49 of 64 seats in the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]] and 21 of 26 in the [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]]. Due to domestic and international pressure as a result of the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], Taylor stepped down as president in August 2003. In October of that year, Taylor's successor, [[Moses Blah]], and the members of the [[Legislature of Liberia|Legislature]] resigned and ceded power to the National Transitional Government of Liberia.

The party later contested the [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. The party's presidential candidate was [[Roland Massaquoi]], who earned 4.1% of the vote. The NPP also won four seats in the House of Representatives and another four in the Senate.

In 2017 it was found that Charles Taylor was continuing to guide the party via phone calls from prison.&lt;ref name=phone&gt;{{cite magazine |date=24 February 2017 |title=Phone a Fiend |magazine=Private eye |publisher=Pressdram Ltd |issue=1438 |page=18  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''National Treasure''''' is a 2004 American [[adventure film|adventure film]] produced and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It was written by [[Jim Kouf]] and the [[Cormac and Marianne Wibberley|Wibberleys]], produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and directed by [[Jon Turteltaub]]. It is the first film in the [[National Treasure (franchise)|''National Treasure'' film series]] and stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Diane Kruger]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Justin Bartha]] and [[Christopher Plummer]].

Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptologist searching for a lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork and other artifacts that was accumulated into a single massive stockpile by looters and warriors over many [[Millennium|millennia]] starting in [[Ancient Egypt]], later rediscovered by warriors who form themselves into the [[Knights Templar]] to protect the treasure, eventually hidden by American [[Freemasons]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. A coded map on the back of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] points to the location of the "[[national treasure]]," but Gates is not alone in his quest. Whoever can steal the Declaration and decode it first will find the greatest treasure in history.

''National Treasure'' was released worldwide on November 19, 2004. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing over $347 million worldwide.

A sequel, titled ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'', was released in December 2007.

==Plot==
Benjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, [[cryptographer|cryptologist]], and treasure hunter. As a child, his grandfather, John Adams Gates, told him of a story that [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] passed on a secret to their ancestor in 1832 of a fabled treasure taken from ancient empires throughout history that was discovered by the [[Knights Templar]] and later protected by the [[Freemasons]]. The treasure would eventually be hidden in America by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. The clue leading to the treasure is the phrase "The secret lies with Charlotte". While Ben is convinced by the story, his skeptical father dismisses it as nonsense.

Thirty years later, Ben leads an expedition with Ian Howe, and his friend, Riley Poole, a computer expert, to find the ''Charlotte'', a ship lost in the [[Arctic]], which holds the first clue to finding the national treasure. After hard fought efforts, they find a [[meerschaum pipe]], which has a clue in the form of a riddle, implying that the next clue is on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. When Ian suggests they steal the it, Ben opposes, causing a fight to ensue, resulting in a massive fire fueled by gunpowder, and the group split in two. Ian and his men escape the ship while Ben and Riley take cover just before the ship explodes.

Ben and Riley return to [[Washington D.C.]] and report the potential theft of the Declaration to the [[FBI]] and Dr. Abigail Chase of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], but both dismiss their claim. Ben decides to steal the document himself from the Archives' preservation room during a gala event. Obtaining Abigail's fingerprints, Ben successfully obtains the Declaration, but is spotted by Ian's group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the [[gift shop]], but has to buy the Declaration when the clerk mistakes it for a souvenir copy; having not enough cash in hand at the time, Ben pays for it with a credit card. Abigail, suspecting something is astray, pursues Ben and takes back the document. Ian kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a souvenir copy of Declaration. FBI Agent Sadusky begins tracking Ben down, using Ben's credit card information.

Unable to return home, the trio go to Patrick's house. Patrick tries to convince Ben that the treasure is a myth, but Ben dismisses this. The trio then study the Declaration and discover an [[book cipher|Ottendorf cipher]] written in invisible ink. With the help of lemon juice and some heat from the hair dryer, they find out that the hidden cypher refers to the [[Silence Dogood]] letters written by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Patrick formerly owned them, but donated them to the [[Franklin Institute]]. Using a school boy to acquire the letters' key words, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of [[Independence Hall]], where the [[Liberty Bell]] once stood. Unfortunately, Ian and his men question the school boy and pursue the new lead. Following the point on the opposite wall of the bell house where the shadow casted at exactly 2:22 pm on the same day, Ben finds a hidden cache containing a pair of glasses with multiple colored lenses invented by Benjamin Franklin, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveals a clue pointing to the symbol of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] which is located on Wall Street and Broadway in New York City.

The group is chased by Ian's associates. Ben is arrested by the FBI, while Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian. However, Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, arranging a meeting at the [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|USS Intrepid]], where they help Ben evade the FBI.

Ian returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has kidnapped Patrick as a hostage. They go inside Trinity Church where they sit and study the back of the Declaration of Independence using the different lenses resulting in the discovery of an underground passage known as Parkington Lane but it appears to lead to a dead end lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is referencing the Midnight Ride of [[Paul Revere]], pointing Ian to the [[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]]. Ian leaves Gates trapped in the chamber to die, heading for Boston. Patrick reveals the clue was a fake, then enters the treasure room using the clues they gathered on their journey, but it seems looted. After a heart to heart between Ben and Patrick, they find a notch which the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, then escape through a back exit. Ben contacts Sadusky, who is actually a Freemason, surrendering the Declaration and the treasure's location in exchange for [[clemency]]. Ian is later arrested when Ben tips the FBI off.

Later, Ben and Abigail have started a relationship. Meanwhile, Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder's fee for the treasure but accepted a much smaller amount of only 1%, which still has netted them all significant wealth. At the end, Riley drives away in a [[Ferrari]] .

==Home video releases==

===Collector's Edition DVD===
A special collector's edition, two-disc DVD set of the movie was released on December 18, 2007. The set features deleted scenes and bonus content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/nationaltreasurece.shtml|title=Collectors Edition|publisher=dvdmg.com|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blu-ray Disc===
[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] released [[Blu-ray Disc]] versions of ''National Treasure'' and its sequel, ''National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets'', on May 20, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/pressrelease_disney2008bluray.html | title= Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Announces the Disney Blu-Ray Title Wave Coming 2008 | date= August 17, 2007 | publisher= High-Def Digest | accessdate= September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
Although the DVD commentary stated that there were no plans for a sequel, the film's box office gross of an unexpected $347.5 million worldwide warranted a second film, which was given the green light in 2005. ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' was released on December 21, 2007.

In 2008, director Jon Turteltaub said that the filmmaking team will take its time on another ''National Treasure'' sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Canoe | place = [[Canada|CA]] | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Video/DVD_Column/2008/05/30/5721241-sun.html | title = 'National Treasure 3' in works | first = Bruce | last = Kirkland | work = Jam! | date = May 30, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120717143342/http://jam.canoe.ca/Video/DVD_Column/2008/05/30/5721241-sun.html | archivedate = July 17, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Turteltaub confirmed that the studio, himself, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the actors all want to do the third film, saying: "We want to do the movie, Disney wants to do the movie. We're just having the damnedest time writing it. I'll bet that within two years, we'll be shooting that movie. I'd say we're about half-way there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/29299/a-national-treasure-3-is-on-the-way|title=A "National Treasure 3" Is On The Way?|last=Franklin|first=Garth|website=Dark Horizons|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Nicolas Cage confirmed the film was still in the writing process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/national-treasure-3-nicolas-cage/|title='National Treasure 3': Nic Cage Says the Writers Are Still Fact-Checking|date=May 25, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2018, Turtletaub reiterated that a script for a possible third film was "close" but Disney still wasn't completely sold by the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/national-treasure-3-delay-explained/|title=The Director Of ‘National Treasure’ Explains Why We Haven’t Gotten A Third Movie Yet|date=July 30, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018|author=Alyssa Fikse|publisher=[[Uproxx]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oromo''' (&lt;small&gt;pron.&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒr|əm|oʊ}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt;  {{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|r|oʊ|m|oʊ}}&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Dictionary.com|Dictionary Reference]]''': [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Oromo Oromo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Dictionary]]''': [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Oromo Oromo]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Afroasiatic language]] spoken in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is the most widely spoken language in the family's [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch. Forms of Oromo are spoken as a first language by more than 40 million [[Oromo people]] and neighbouring peoples in [[Ethiopia]] and by an additional half million in parts of northern and eastern [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/oromo-1&lt;/ref&gt; It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries such as [[South Africa]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. Oromo is a [[dialect continuum]]; not all varieties are [[mutually intelligible]].

The native name for the Oromo language is ''Afaan Oromoo'', which translates to "mouth (language) of Oromo" and ``afaan oromoo´´ is an official language in Ethiopia.

== Varieties ==
[[File:Map of Oromo language varieties and dialects.svg|left|thumb|331x331px|Varieties and dialects of Oromo]]
''Ethnologue'' (2015) divides the Oromo [[macrolanguage]] into four languages
:*[[Borana–Arsi–Guji Oromo language|Boranaa–Arsii–Gujii Oromo]] (Southern Oromo, incl. Gabra and Sakuye dialects), ISO code [gax]
:*[[Eastern Oromo language|Eastern Oromo]] (Harar), ISO code [hae]
:*[[Orma language|Orma]] (Munyo, Orma, Waata/Sanye), ISO code [orc]
:*[[West Central Oromo language|West–Central Oromo]] (Western Oromo and Central Oromo, incl. Mecha/Wollega, Raya, Wello(Kemise), Tulema/Shewa) ISO code [gaz]

It is divided into five languages in the [[ISO 639-3]] listing:
*[gax] – Borana–Arsi–Guji–Walagaa Oromo
*[hae] – Eastern Oromo
*[orc] – Orma
*[gaz] – West Central Oromo
*[ssn] – Waata

Blench (2006) concurs, dividing Oromo into four languages:
:*Western Oromo (Maca)
:*Shewa (Tuulama, Arsi)
:*Eastern Oromo (Harar)
:*Southern Oromo (Ajuran, Borana, Gabra, Garreh, Munyo, Orma, Sakuye, Waata)

Some of the varieties of Oromo have been examined and classified.&lt;ref&gt;Kebede Hordofa Janko, Towards the Genetic Classification of the Afaan Oromoo Dialects, Cushitic and Omotic Studies, 2 (Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==
About 85 percent of Oromo speakers live in [[Ethiopia]], mainly in [[Oromia Region]]. In addition, in [[Somalia]] there are also some speakers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SO |title=Languages of Somalia |publisher=ethnologue.com|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kenya]], the Ethnologue also lists 722,000 speakers of Borana and Orma, two languages closely related to Ethiopian Oromo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=KE |title=Languages of Kenya |publisher=ethnologue.com |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Ethiopia, Oromo is the language with the largest number of native speakers.

Within Africa, Oromo is the language with the fourth most speakers, after Arabic (if one counts the mutually unintelligible spoken forms of Arabic as a single language and assumes the same for the varieties of Oromo), [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].

Besides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language. See, for example, the [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]-speaking [[Bambassi language|Bambassi]] and the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Kwama people|Kwama]] in northwestern Oromiyaa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethnologue |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET |title=Languages of Ethiopia |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language policy ==
Before the [[Derg|Ethiopian Revolution]] of 1974, publishing or broadcasting in Oromo was very limited. The few works that had been published, most notably [[Onesimos Nesib]]'s and [[Aster Ganno]]'s translation of the [[Bible]] from the late nineteenth century, were written in the [[Ge'ez alphabet]], as was the 1875 New Testament produced by [[Johann Ludwig Krapf|Krapf]].  Following the 1974 Revolution, the government undertook a literacy campaign in several languages, including Oromo, and publishing and radio broadcasts began in the language.  All Oromo materials printed in Ethiopia at that time, such as the newspaper ''Bariisaa, Urjii'' and many others, were written in the traditional script.

Plans to introduce Oromo language instruction in the schools, however, were not realized until the government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] was overthrown in 1991, except in regions controlled by the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF).  With the creation of the regional [[Oromia Region|state of Oromia]] under the new system of [[ethnic federalism]] in Ethiopia, it has been possible to introduce Oromo as the medium of instruction in elementary schools throughout the region (including areas where other ethnic groups live speaking their languages) and as a language of administration within the region. Since the OLF left the transitional Ethiopian government in the early 1990s, the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) continued developing Oromo in Ethiopia.

Oromo is written with a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] called Qubee which was formally adopted in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Hornet/Afaan_Oromo_19777.html |title=Afaan Oromo |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]], School of African Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the Latin-based orthography had been used previously, mostly by Oromos outside of Ethiopia and by the OLF by the late 1970s (Heine 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oromia.org/Letter_to_UN.htm |title=Letter from the Oromo Communities in North America to H.E. Mr. Kofi Anan, Secretary-General of the United Nations |date=April 17, 2000 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905203327/http://www.oromia.org/Letter_to_UN.htm |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the adoption of Qubee, it is believed more texts were written in the Oromo language between 1991 and 1997 than in the previous 100 years. In Kenya, the [[Borana Oromo people|Borana]] and [[Waata language|Waata]] also use Roman letters but with different systems.

The Sapalo script was an indigenous Oromo script invented by Sheikh [[Bakri Sapalo]] (also known by his birth name, Abubaker Usman Odaa) in the years following Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and used underground afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. J. Hayward and Mohammed Hassan |year=1981 |title=The Oromo Orthography of Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō |publisher=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |volume=44|issue=3|pages=550–566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abyssiniacybergateway.net/fidel/ShaykhBakriSapalo/ |title=The Oromo Orthography of Shaykh Bakri Sapalo |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709074520/http://www.abyssiniacybergateway.net/fidel/ShaykhBakriSapalo/ |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic script]] has also been used intermittently in areas with Muslim populations.

Within Kenya there has been radio broadcasting in Oromo (in the Borana dialect) on the [[Voice of Kenya]] since at least the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stroomer, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Borana Bible in Kenya was printed in 1995 using the Latin alphabet, but not using the same spelling rules as in Ethiopian Qubee. The first comprehensive online Afaon Oromo dictionary was developed by the Jimma Times Oromiffa Group (JTOG) in cooperation with SelamSoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmatimes.com/article/ARTS/ARTS/Ethiopia_Online_Afaan_Oromoo_English_Dictionary/32153 |title=Online Afaan Oromoo–English Dictionary |publisher=Jimmatimes.com |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615082250/http://jimmatimes.com/article/ARTS/ARTS/Ethiopia_Online_Afaan_Oromoo_English_Dictionary/32153 |archivedate=2012-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice of America]] also broadcasts in Oromo alongside its other horn of Africa programs. Oromo and Qubee are currently utilized by the Ethiopian government's state radios, TV stations and regional government newspaper.

== Phonology and orthography ==

=== Consonant and vowel phonemes ===
Like most other Ethiopian languages, whether Semitic, Cushitic, or Omotic, Oromo has a set of [[ejective consonant]]s, that is, voiceless stops or affricates that are accompanied by [[glottalization]] and an explosive burst of air. Oromo has another glottalized phone that is more unusual, an [[voiced retroflex implosive|implosive retroflex stop]], "dh" in Oromo orthography, a sound that is like an English "d" produced with the tongue curled back slightly and with the air drawn in so that a glottal stop is heard before the following vowel begins. It is retroflex in most dialects, though it is not strongly implosive and may reduce to a flap between vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Lloret 1997:500&lt;/ref&gt; One source describes it as voiceless {{IPA|[ᶑ̥]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dissassa 1980: 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Oromo has the typical Eastern Cushitic set of five short and five long vowels, indicated in the orthography by doubling the five vowel letters.  The difference in length is contrastive, for example, ''hara'' 'lake', ''haaraa'' 'new'.  [[Gemination]] is also significant in Oromo.  That is, [[consonant]] length can distinguish words from one another, for example, ''badaa'' 'bad', ''baddaa'' 'highland'.

In the Qubee alphabet, letters include the digraphs ''ch, dh, ny, ph, sh.'' Gemination is not obligatorily marked for digraphs, though some writers indicate it by doubling the first element: ''qopphaa'uu'' 'be prepared'.  In the charts below, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] symbol for a phoneme is shown in brackets where it differs from the Oromo letter.  The phonemes {{IPA|/p v z/}} appear in parentheses because they are only found in recently adopted words.  Note that there have been minor changes in the orthography since it was first adopted: {{angle bracket|x}} ({{IPAblink|tʼ}}) was originally rendered {{angle bracket|th}}, and there has been some confusion among authors in the use of {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|ch}} in representing the phonemes {{IPAslink|tʃʼ}} and {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, with some early works using {{angle bracket|c}} for {{IPAslink|tʃ}} and {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{IPAslink|tʃʼ}} and even {{angle bracket|c}} for different phonemes depending on where it appears in a word.  This article uses {{angle bracket|c}} consistently for {{IPAslink|tʃʼ}} and {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{IPAslink|tʃ}}.

Only the penultimate or final syllable of a root can have a high tone, and if the penultimate is high, the final must also be high;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Owens, ''A Grammar of Harar Oromo'' (Buske Verlag, 1985; {{ISBN|3-87118-717-8}}), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; this implies that Oromo has a pitch-accent system (in which the tone need be specified only on one syllable, the others being predictable) rather than a tone system (in which each syllable must have its tone specified),&lt;ref&gt;Owens, ''A Grammar of Harar Oromo'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; although the rules are complex (each morpheme can contribute its own tone pattern to the word), so that "one can call Oromo a pitch-accent system in terms of the basic lexical representation of pitch, and a tone system in terms of its surface realization."&lt;ref&gt;Owens, ''A Grammar of Harar Oromo'', pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The stressed syllable is perceived as the first syllable of a word with high pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, ''A Grammar of Harar Oromo'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===

==== Gender ====
Like most other [[Afroasiatic languages]], Oromo has two [[grammatical gender]]s,
masculine and feminine, and all nouns belong to either one or the other.
Grammatical gender in Oromo enters into the grammar in the following ways:
*Verbs (except for the copula ''be'') agree with their subjects in gender when the subject is third person singular (''he'' or ''she'').
*Third person singular [[personal pronoun]]s (''he'', ''she'', ''it'', etc., in English) have the gender of the noun they refer to.
*Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender.
*Some possessive adjectives ("my", "your") agree with the nouns they modify in some dialects.

Except in some southern dialects, there is nothing in the form of most nouns that indicates their gender.  A small number of nouns pairs for people, however, end in ''-eessa'' (m.) and ''-eettii'' (f.), as do adjectives when they are used as nouns: ''obboleessa'' 'brother', ''obboleettii'' 'sister', ''dureessa'' 'the rich one (m.)', ''hiyyeettii'' 'the poor one (f.)'.  Grammatical gender normally agrees with natural gender for people and animals; thus nouns such as ''Abbaa'' 'father', ''Ilma'' 'son', and ''sangaa'' 'ox' are masculine, while nouns such as ''haadha'' 'mother' and ''intala'' 'girl, daughter' are feminine.  However, most names for animals do not specify biological gender.

Names of astronomical bodies are feminine: ''aduu'' 'sun', ''urjii'' 'star'.  The gender of other inanimate nouns varies somewhat among dialects. &lt;!-- It is possible to switch the gender of an animate noun for pragmatic effect. In these cases a noun that is normally masculine may be treated as feminine to indicate cowardice or stupidity, and a noun that is normally feminine may be treated as masculine to indicate bravery or cunning.
--&gt;

==== Number ====
Oromo has singular and plural [[grammatical number|number]], but nouns that refer to multiple entities are not obligatorily plural.: ''nama'' "man" ''namoota'' "people", ''nama shan'' "five men" ''namoota shan'' "five people".  Another way of looking at this is to treat the "singular" form as unspecified for number.

When it is important to make the plurality of a referent clear, the plural form of a noun is used.  Noun plurals are formed through the addition of [[suffix]]es.  The most common plural suffix is ''-oota''; a final vowel is dropped before the suffix, and in the western dialects, the suffix becomes -ota following a [[syllable]] with a long vowel: ''mana'' 'house', ''manoota'' 'houses', ''hiriyaa'' 'friend', ''hiriyoota'' 'friends', ''barsiisaa'' 'teacher', ''barsiiso(o)ta'' 'teachers'.  Among the other common plural suffixes are ''-(w)wan'', ''-een'', and ''-(a)an''; the latter two may cause a preceding consonant to be doubled: ''waggaa'' 'year', ''waggaawwan'' 'years', ''laga'' 'river', ''laggeen'' 'rivers', ''ilma'' 'son', ''ilmaan'' 'sons'.

==== Definiteness ====
Oromo has no indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]] (corresponding to English ''a'', ''some''), but (except in the southern dialects) it indicates [[definiteness]] (English ''the'') with suffixes on the noun: ''-(t)icha'' for masculine nouns (the ''ch'' is [[geminated]] though this is not normally indicated in writing) and ''-(t)ittii'' for feminine nouns.  Vowel endings of nouns are dropped before these suffixes: ''karaa'' 'road', ''karicha'' 'the road', ''nama'' 'man', ''namicha''/''namticha'' 'the man', ''haroo'' 'lake', ''harittii'' 'the lake'.  Note that for animate nouns that can take either gender, the definite suffix may indicate the intended gender: ''qaalluu'' 'priest', ''qaallicha'' 'the priest (m.)', ''qallittii'' 'the priest (f.)'.  The definite suffixes appear to be used less often than ''the'' in English, and they seem not to co-occur with the plural suffixes.

==== Case ====
Oromo noun has a '''[[citation form]]''' or '''base form''' that is used when the noun is the object of a verb, the object of a preposition or postposition, or a [[predicative (adjectival or nominal)|nominal predicative]].
* ''mana'' 'house', ''mana binne'' 'we bought a house'
* ''hamma'' 'until', ''dhuma'' 'end', ''hamma dhumaatti'' 'until (the) end'
* ''mana keessa'', 'inside (a/the) house'
* ''inni'' 'he', ''barsiisaa'' 'teacher' 
* ''inni barsiisaa (dha)'' 'he is a teacher'

A noun may also appear in one of six other [[grammatical case]]s, each indicated by a suffix or the lengthening of the noun's final vowel.  The case endings follow plural or definite suffixes if these appear.  For some of the cases, there is a range of forms possible, some covering more than one case, and the differences in meaning among these alternatives may be quite subtle.
; [[Nominative]]
: The nominative is used for nouns that are the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] of clauses.
:* ''Ibsaa'' (a name), ''Ibsaan'' 'Ibsaa (nom.)', ''konkolaataa'' '(a) car', ''qaba'' 'he has':
:* ''Ibsaan konkolaataa qaba'' 'Ibsaa has a car'.
: Most nouns ending in short vowels with a preceding single consonant drop the final vowel and add ''-ni'' to form the nominative.  Following certain consonants, [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] changes either the ''n'' or that consonant (the details depend on the dialect).
:* ''nama'' 'man', ''namni'' 'man (nom.)'
:* ''namoota'' 'men'; ''namootni'', ''namoonni'' 'men (nom.)' (''t'' + ''n'' may assimilate to ''nn'')
: If a final short vowel is preceded by two consonants or a geminated consonant, ''-i'' is suffixed.
:* ''ibsa'' 'statement', ''ibsi'' 'statement (nom.)'
:* ''namicha'' 'the man', ''namichi'' 'the man (nom.)' (the ''ch'' in the definite suffix ''-icha'' is actually geminated, though not normally written as such)
: If the noun ends in a long vowel, ''-n'' is suffixed to this.  This pattern applies to infinitives, which end in ''-uu''.
:* ''maqaa'' 'name', ''maqaan'' 'name (nom.)'
:* ''nyachuu'' 'to eat, eating', ''nyachuun'' 'to eat, eating (nom.)'
: If the noun ends in ''n'', the nominative is identical to the base form.
:* ''afaan'' 'mouth, language (base form or nom.)'
: Some feminine nouns ending in a short vowel add ''-ti''.  Again assimilation occurs in some cases.
:* ''haadha'' 'mother', ''haati'' (''dh'' + ''t'' assimilates to ''t'')
:* ''lafa'' 'earth', ''lafti''
; [[Genitive]]
: The genitive is used for possession or "belonging"; it corresponds roughly to English ''of'' or ''-'s''.  The genitive is usually formed by lengthening a final short vowel, by adding ''-ii'' to a final consonant, and by leaving a final long vowel unchanged.  The possessor noun follows the possessed noun in a genitive phrase.  Many such phrases with specific technical meanings have been added to the Oromo lexicon in recent years.
:* ''obboleetti'' 'sister', ''namicha'' 'the man', ''obboleetti namichaa'' 'the man's sister'
:* ''hojii'' 'job', ''Caaltuu'', woman's name, ''hojii Caaltuu'', 'Caaltuu's job'
:* ''barumsa'' 'field of study', ''afaan'' 'mouth, language', ''barumsa afaanii'' 'linguistics'
: In place of the genitive it is also possible to use the relative marker ''kan'' (m.) / ''tan'' (f.) preceding the possessor.
:* ''obboleetti kan namicha'' 'the man's sister'
; [[Dative]]
: The dative is used for nouns that represent the recipient (''to'') or the benefactor (''for'') of an event.  The dative form of a verb [[infinitive]] (which acts like a noun in Oromo) indicates purpose.  The dative takes one of the following forms:
:* Lengthening of a final short vowel (ambiguously also signifying the genitive)
::* ''namicha'' 'the man', ''namichaa'' 'to the man, of the man'
:* ''-f'' following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel; ''-iif'' following a consonant
::* ''intala'' 'girl, daughter', ''intalaaf'' 'to a girl, daughter'
::* ''saree'' 'dog', ''sareef'' 'to a dog'
::* ''baruu'' 'to learn', ''baruuf'' 'in order to learn'
::* ''bishaan'' 'water', ''bishaaniif'' 'for water'
:* ''-dhaa'' or ''-dhaaf'' following a long vowel
::* ''saree'' 'dog'; ''sareedhaa, sareedhaaf'' 'to a dog'
:* ''-tti'' (with no change to a preceding vowel), especially with verbs of speaking
::* ''Caaltuu'' woman's name, ''himi'' 'tell, say (imperative)', ''Caaltuutti himi'' 'tell Caaltuu'
; [[instrumental case|Instrumental]]
: The instrumental is used for nouns that represent the instrument ("with"), the means ("by"), the agent ("by"), the reason, or the time of an event.  The formation of the instrumental parallels that of the dative to some extent:
:* ''-n'' following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel; ''-iin'' following a consonant
::* ''harka'' 'hand', ''harkaan'' 'by hand, with a hand'
::* ''halkan'' 'night', ''halkaniin'' 'at night'
:* ''-tiin'' following a long vowel or a lengthened short vowel
::* ''Afaan Oromo'' 'Oromo (language)', ''Afaan Oromootiin'' 'in Oromo'
:* ''-dhaan'' following a long vowel
::* ''yeroo'' 'time', ''yeroodhaan'' 'on time'
::* ''bawuu'' 'to come out, coming out', ''bawuudhaan'' 'by coming out'
; [[Locative]]
: The locative is used for nouns that represent general locations of events or states, roughly ''at''.  For more specific locations, Oromo uses prepositions or postpositions.  Postpositions may also take the locative suffix.  The locative also seems to overlap somewhat with the instrumental, sometimes having a temporal function.  The locative is formed with the suffix ''-tti''.
:* ''Arsiitti'' 'in Arsii'
:* ''harka'' 'hand', ''harkatti'' 'in hand'
:* ''guyyaa'' 'day', ''guyyaatti'' 'per day'
:* ''jala, jalatti'' 'under'
; [[Ablative]]
: The ablative is used to represent the source of an event; it corresponds closely to English ''from''.  The ablative, applied to postpositions and locative adverbs as well as nouns proper, is formed in the following ways:
:* When the word ends in a short vowel, this vowel is lengthened (as for the genitive).
::* ''biyya'' 'country', ''biyyaa'' 'from country'
::* ''keessa'' 'inside, in', ''keessaa'' 'from inside'
:* When the word ends in a long vowel, ''-dhaa'' is added (as for one alternative for the dative).
::* ''Finfinneedhaa'' 'from Finfinnee (Addis Ababa)'
::* ''gabaa'' 'market', ''gabaadhaa'' 'from market'
:* When the word ends in a consonant, ''-ii'' is added (as for the genitive).
::* ''Hararii'' 'from Harar'
:* Following a noun in the genitive, ''-tii'' is added.
::* ''mana'' 'house', ''buna'' 'coffee', ''mana bunaa'' 'cafe', ''mana bunaatii'' 'from cafe'
: An alternative to the ablative is the postposition ''irraa'' 'from' whose initial vowel may be dropped in the process:
:* ''gabaa'' 'market', ''gabaa irraa, gabaarraa'' 'from market'

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
In most languages, there is a small number of basic distinctions of [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]], and often [[grammatical gender|gender]] that play a role within the grammar of the language. Oromo and English are such languages.  We see these distinctions within the basic set of '''independent personal pronouns''', for example, English ''I'', Oromo ''ani''; English ''they'', Oromo ''isaani'' and the set of '''[[possessive adjective]]s''' and '''[[possessive pronoun|pronouns]]''', for example, English ''my'', Oromo ''koo''; English ''mine'', Oromo ''kan koo''. In Oromo, the same distinctions are also reflected in subject–verb agreement: Oromo verbs (with a few exceptions) [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]; that is, the person, number, and (singular third person) gender of the subject of the verb are marked by [[affix|suffixes]] on the verb.  Because these suffixes vary greatly with the particular verb [[grammatical tense|tense]]/[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]/[[grammatical mood|mood]], they are normally not considered to be pronouns and are discussed elsewhere in this article under verb [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]].

In all of these areas of the grammar—independent pronouns, possessive adjectives, possessive pronouns, and subject–verb agreement—Oromo distinguishes seven combinations of person, number, and gender. For first and second persons, there is a two-way distinction between singular ('I', 'you sg.') and plural ('we', 'you pl.'), whereas for third person, there is a two-way distinction in the singular ('he', 'she') and a single form for the plural ('they').  Because Oromo has only two genders, there is no pronoun corresponding to English ''it''; the masculine or feminine pronoun is used according to the gender of the noun referred to.

Oromo is a subject [[pro-drop language]]. That is, neutral sentences in which the subject is not emphasized do not require independent subject pronouns: ''kaleessa dhufne'' 'we came yesterday'.
The Oromo word that translates 'we' does not appear in this sentence, though the person and number are marked on the verb ''dhufne'' ('we came') by the suffix ''-ne''. When the subject in such sentences needs to be given prominence for some reason, an independent pronoun can be used: '''''nuti''' kaleessa dhufne'' ''''we''' came yesterday'.

The table below gives forms of the personal pronouns in the different cases, as well as the possessive adjectives.  For the first person plural and third person singular feminine categories, there is considerable variation across dialects; only some of the possibilities are shown.

The possessive adjectives, treated as separate words here, are sometimes written as noun suffixes.  In most dialects there is a distinction between masculine and feminine possessive adjectives for first and second person (the form agreeing with the gender of the modified noun).  However, in the western dialects, the masculine forms (those beginning with ''k-'') are used in all cases.  Possessive adjectives may take the case endings for the nouns they modify: ''ganda kootti'' 'to my village' (''-tti'': locative case).

As in languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the Oromo second person plural is also used as a polite singular form, for reference to people that the speaker wishes to show respect towards.  This usage is an example of the so-called [[T-V distinction]] that is made in many languages.  In addition, the third person plural may be used for polite reference to a single third person (either 'he' or 'she').

For possessive pronouns ('mine', 'yours', etc.), Oromo adds the possessive adjectives to ''kan'' 'of': ''kan koo'' 'mine', ''kan kee'' 'yours', etc.

==== Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns ====
Oromo has two ways of expressing [[reflexive pronoun]]s ('myself', 'yourself', etc.). One is to use the noun meaning 'self': ''of(i)'' or ''if(i)''.  This noun is inflected for case but, unless it is being emphasized, not for person, number, or gender: ''isheen of laalti'' 'she looks at herself' (base form of ''of''), ''isheen ofiif makiinaa bitte'' 'she bought herself a car' (dative of ''of'').

The other possibility is to use the noun meaning 'head', ''mataa'', with possessive suffixes: ''mataa koo'' 'myself', ''mataa kee'' 'yourself (s.)', etc.

Oromo has a [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal pronoun]] ''wal'' (English 'each other') that is used like ''of/if''.  That is, it is inflected for case but not person, number, or gender: ''wal jaalatu'' 'they like each other' (base form of ''wal''), ''kennaa walii bitan'' 'they bought each other gifts' (dative of ''wal'').

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
Like English, Oromo makes a two-way distinction between proximal ('this, these') and distal ('that, those') [[demonstrative pronoun]]s and adjectives.  Some dialects distinguish masculine and feminine for the proximal pronouns; in the western dialects the masculine forms (beginning with ''k-'') are used for both genders.  Unlike in English, singular and plural demonstratives are not distinguished, but, as for nouns and personal pronouns in the language, case is distinguished.  Only the base and nominative forms are shown in the table below; the other cases are formed from the base form as for nouns, for example, ''sanatti'' 'at/on/in that' (locative case).

=== Verbs ===
An Oromo verb consists minimally of a [[Stem (linguistics)|stem]], representing the [[lexicon|lexical]] meaning of the verb, and a [[affixes|suffix]], representing [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[subject (grammar)|subject]] agreement. For example, in ''dhufne'' 'we came', ''dhuf-'' is the stem ('come') and ''-ne'' indicates that the tense is past and that the subject of the verb is first person plural.

As in many other [[Afroasiatic languages]], Oromo makes a basic two-way distinction in its verb system between the two tensed forms, past (or "perfect") and present (or "imperfect" or "non-past").  Each of these has its own set of tense/agreement suffixes.  There is a third conjugation based on the present which has three functions: it is used in place of the present in [[subordinate clause]]s, for the [[jussive]] ('let me/us/him, etc. V', together with the particle ''haa''), and for the [[negation|negative]] of the present (together with the particle ''hin'').  For example, ''deemne'' 'we went', ''deemna'' 'we go', ''akka deemnu'' 'that we go', ''haa deemnu'' 'let's go', ''hin deemnu'' 'we don't go'. There is also a separate [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form: ''deemi'' 'go (sg.)!'.

==== Conjugation ====
The table below shows the conjugation in the affirmative and negative of the verb ''beek-'' 'know'.  The first person singular present and past affirmative forms require the suffix ''-n'' to appear on the word preceding the verb or the word ''nan'' before the verb.  The negative particle ''hin'', shown as a separate word in the table, is sometimes written as a prefix on the verb.

For verbs with stems ending in certain consonants and suffixes beginning with consonants (that is, ''t'' or ''n''), there are predictable changes to one or the other of the consonants. The dialects vary a lot in the details, but the following changes are common.

|}
Verbs whose stems end in two consonants and whose suffix begins with a consonant must insert a vowel to break up the consonants since the language does not permit sequences of three consonants. There are two ways this can happen: either the vowel ''i'' is inserted between the stem and the suffix, or the final stem consonants are switched (an example of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]) and the vowel ''a'' is inserted between them. For example, ''arg-'' 'see', ''arga'' 'he sees', ''argina'' or ''agarra'' (from ''agar-na'') 'we see'; ''kolf-'' 'laugh', ''kolfe'' 'he laughed', ''kolfite'' or ''kofalte'' 'you (sg.) laughed'.

Verbs whose stems end in the consonant ' (which may appear as ''h'', ''w'', or ''y'' in some words, depending on the dialect) belong to three different conjugation classes; the class is not predictable from the verb stem.  It is the forms that precede suffixes beginning with consonants (''t'' and ''n'') that differ from the usual pattern.  The third person masculine singular, second person singular, and first person plural present forms are shown for an example verb in each class.
# ''du'-'' 'die': ''du'a'' 'he dies', ''duuta'' 'you (sg.) die', ''duuna'' 'we die'
# ''beela'-'', 'be hungry': ''beela'a'' 'he is hungry', ''beelofta'' 'you (sg.) are hungry', ''beelofna'' 'we are hungry'
# ''dhaga'-'' 'hear': ''dhaga'a'' 'he hears', ''dhageessa'' 'you (sg.) hear', ''dhageenya'' 'we hear' (note that the suffix consonants change)

The common verbs ''fedh-'' 'want' and ''godh-'' 'do' deviate from the basic conjugation pattern in that long vowels replace the geminated consonants that would result when suffixes beginning with ''t'' or ''n'' are added: ''fedha'' 'he wants', ''feeta'' 'you (sg.) want', ''feena'' 'we want', ''feetu'' 'you (pl.) want', ''hin feene'' 'didn't want', etc.

The verb ''dhuf-'' 'come' has the irregular imperatives ''koottu'', ''koottaa''.  The verb ''deem-'' 'go' has, alongside regular imperative forms, the irregular imperatives ''beenu'', ''beenaa''.

==== Derivation ====
An Oromo verb root can be the basis for three derived voices, passive, causative, and autobenefactive, each formed with addition of a suffix to the root, yielding the stem that the inflectional suffixes are added to.
; [[Passive voice]]
: The Oromo passive corresponds closely to the English passive in function. It is formed by adding ''-am'' to the verb root. The resulting stem is conjugated regularly. Examples: ''beek-'' 'know', ''beekam-'' 'be known', ''beekamani'' 'they were known'; ''jedh-'' 'say', ''jedham-'' 'be said', ''jedhama'' 'it is said'
; [[Causative voice]]
: The Oromo causative of a verb V corresponds to English expressions such as 'cause V', 'make V', 'let V'. With intransitive verbs, it has a transitivizing function. It is formed by adding ''-s'', ''-sis'', or ''-siis'' to the verb root, except that roots ending in ''-l'' add ''-ch''. Verbs whose roots end in ' drop this consonant and may lengthen the preceding vowel before adding ''-s''.  Examples: ''beek-'' 'know', ''beeksis-'' 'cause to know, inform', ''beeksifne'' 'we informed'; ''ka'-'' 'go up, get up', ''kaas-'' 'pick up', ''kaasi'' 'pick up (sing.)!'; ''gal-'' 'enter', ''galch-'' 'put in', ''galchiti'' 'she puts in'; ''bar-'' 'learn', ''barsiis-'' 'teach', ''nan barsiisa'' 'I teach'.
; Autobenefactive voice
: The Oromo [[Benefactive case|autobenefactive]] (or "middle" or "reflexive-middle") voice of a verb V corresponds roughly to English expressions such as 'V for oneself' or 'V on one's own', though the precise meaning may be somewhat unpredictable for many verbs.  It is formed by adding ''-adh'' to the verb root. The conjugation of a middle verb is irregular in the third person singular masculine of the present and past (''-dh'' in the stem changes to ''-t'') and in the singular imperative (the suffix is ''-u'' rather than ''-i''). Examples: ''bit-'' 'buy', ''bitadh-'' 'buy for oneself', ''bitate'' 'he bought (something) for himself', ''bitadhu'' 'buy for yourself (sing.)!'; ''qab-'' 'have', ''qabadh-'' 'seize, hold (for oneself)', ''qabanna'' 'we hold'. Some autobenefactives are derived from nouns rather than verbs, for example, ''hojjadh-'' 'work' from the noun ''hojii'' 'work'.

The voice suffixes can be combined in various ways. Two causative suffixes are possible: ''ka'-'' 'go up', ''kaas-'' 'pick up', ''kaasis-'' 'cause to pick up'. The causative may be followed by the passive or the autobenefactive; in this case the ''s'' of the causative is replaced by ''f'': ''deebi'-'' 'return (intransitive)', ''deebis-'' 'return (transitive), answer', ''deebifam-'' 'be returned, be answered', ''deebifadh-'' 'get back for oneself'.

Another derived verbal [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]] is the [[frequentative]] or "intensive," formed by copying the first consonant and vowel of the verb root and geminating the second occurrence of the initial consonant. The resulting stem indicates the repetition or intensive performance of the action of the verb.  Examples: ''bul-'' 'spend the night', ''bubbul-'' 'spend several nights', ''cab-'' 'break', ''caccab-'' 'break to pieces, break completely'; ''dhiib-'' 'push, apply pressure', ''dhiddhiib-'' 'massage'.

The infinitive is formed from a verb stem with the addition of the suffix ''-uu''.  Verbs whose stems end in ''-dh'' (in particular all autobenefactive verbs) change this to ''ch'' before the suffix.  Examples: ''dhug-'' 'drink', ''dhuguu'' 'to drink'; ''ga'-'' 'reach', ''ga'uu'' 'to reach'; ''jedh-'' 'say', ''jechu'' 'to say'.  The verb ''fedh-'' is exceptional; its infinitive is ''fedhuu'' rather than the expected ''fechuu''.  The infinitive behaves like a noun; that is, it can take any of the case suffixes.  Examples: ''ga'uu'' 'to reach', ''ga'uuf'' 'in order to reach' (dative case); ''dhug-'' 'drink', ''dhugam-'' 'be drunk', ''dhugamuu'' to be drunk', ''dhugamuudhaan'' 'by being drunk' (instrumental case).

Perhaps the most commonly agreed-upon "overclass" consists of leaders in [[international business]], [[International finance|finance]] and the [[war industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[David Rothkopf|Rothkopf, David J.]] | title = Superclass: the global power elite and the world they are making | publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-374-27210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the actions by the overclass have been rigorously studied, particularly with regards to notions of intersections between the overclass and specific races.  Most notable of these racial overclasses is the [[NEWBO]], or NEW Black Overclass in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29413966/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/cnbc-special-report-new-black-overclass/ |title=CNBC Special Report: The New Black Overclass |last1=Hawkins |first1=Lee |date=February 26, 2009 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=[[NBCNews.com]] |access-date=September 7, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pasquale Tola''' (30 November 1800 in [[Sassari]] – 25 August 1874 in [[Genoa]]) was an Italian judge, politician and historian.

Issue of an ancient and noble Sardinian family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.araldicasardegna.org/indice.htm by entering and clicking on ''Statuto e Elenco Nobiliare Sardo'', then on ''Elenco nobiliare sardo (edizione del 1902)'' and then on the letter ''T'': the first Tola family is represented by Cosimo, Pasquale's son.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He bore the titles of hereditary knight and nobleman and was styled Don Pasquale: ''ibidem''.&lt;/ref&gt; he studied in Sassari, where he obtained a degree in [[theology]] and law and also followed courses in [[philosophy]] and [[fine arts]]. In 1848 he was part of the ministerial working group in Sardinia. He was in favour of the [[abolition of feudalism]] in Sardinia. He wrote many works on historical-political topics, particularly about Sardinia, and there is extensive literary coverage of him. Tola was also an encyclopedian, and authored a Dictionary of Sardinian Biography in 1837-38.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ME1bAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pasquale+Tola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mCyS2rgvT4&amp;sig=GzrumvCt0pIQtzadx6whjn62z8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2eKdTLPREo2OjAfb8v2xDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dizionario biografico degli uomini illustri di Sardegna, Volume 3 By Pasquale Tola]&lt;/ref&gt; He was then chancellor of the [[University of Sassari]]. Later he worked in the judiciary at the [[court of appeal|courts of appeal]] in [[Nice]] and [[Genoa]]. He was a member of the Sardinian parliament in [[Turin]] from 1848, and then the national one.

In Sassari the [[Piazza Tola]] in the historical centre is named after him. In Rome, Via Pasquale Tola is located in a central area near the [[Via Appia]], while in [[Cagliari]] the Via Pasquale Tola is located near the central Via P. Paoli and the Via Dante.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22086">In [[computing]], '''performance per watt''' is a measure of the [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of a particular [[computer architecture]] or [[computer hardware]]. Literally, it measures the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every [[watt]] of power consumed. This rate is typically measured by performance on the [[LINPACK]] benchmark when trying to compare between computing systems.

System designers building [[parallel computing|parallel computers]], such as [[Google search technology#Production hardware|Google's hardware]], pick CPUs based on their (other than Green500) performance per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Power+could+cost+more+than+servers,+Google+warns/2100-1010_3-5988090.html Power could cost more than servers, Google warns], CNET, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The performance and power consumption metrics used depend on the definition; reasonable measures of performance are [[FLOPS]], [[Instructions per second|MIPS]], or the score for any [[Benchmark (computing)|performance benchmark]].  Several measures of power usage may be employed, depending on the purposes of the metric; for example, a metric might only consider the electrical power delivered to a machine directly, while another might include all power necessary to run a computer, such as cooling and monitoring systems. The power measurement is often the average power used while running the benchmark, but other measures of power usage may be employed (e.g. peak power, idle power).

For example, the early [[UNIVAC I]] computer performed approximately 0.015 operations per watt-second (performing 1,905 operations per second (OPS), while consuming 125&amp;nbsp;kW). The [[Fujitsu]] [[FR-V]] [[VLIW]]/[[vector processor]] [[system on a chip]] in the 4 FR550 core variant released 2005 performs 51 Giga-OPS with 3 watts of power consumption resulting in 17 billion operations per watt-second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2005/20050207-01.html Fujitsu Develops Multi-core Processor for High-Performance Digital Consumer Products] Fujitsu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/MAG/vol42-2/paper03.pdf FR-V Single-Chip Multicore Processor:FR1000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150434/http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/MAG/vol42-2/paper03.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }} Fujitsu&lt;/ref&gt; This is an improvement by over a trillion times in 54 years.

Most of the power a computer uses is converted into heat, so a system that takes fewer watts to do a job will require less cooling to maintain a given [[operating temperature]].  Reduced cooling demands makes it easier to [[quiet PC|quiet a computer]]. Lower energy consumption can also make it less costly to run, and reduce the environmental impact of powering the computer (see [[green computing]]).
If installed where there is limited [[climate control]], a lower power computer will operate at a lower temperature, which may make it more reliable.  In a climate controlled environment, reductions in direct power use may also create savings in climate control energy.

Computing energy consumption is sometimes also measured by reporting the energy required to run a particular benchmark, for instance [[EEMBC]] EnergyBench.  Energy consumption figures for a standard workload may make it easier to judge the effect of an improvement in [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]].

Performance (in operations/second) per watt can also be written as operations/watt-second, or operations/joule, since 1 watt = 1 joule/second.

==FLOPS per watt==
{{anchor|MFLOPS PER WATT|GFLOPS PER WATT}}
[[File:Green500 evolution.svg|thumb|400px|Exponential growth of supercomputer performance per watt based on data from the Green500 list. The red crosses denote the most power efficient computer, while the blue ones denote the computer ranked#500.]]
'''FLOPS per watt''' is a common measure. Like the [[FLOPS]] ([[floating point|Floating Point]] Operations Per Second) metric it is based on, the metric is usually applied to [[scientific computing]] and simulations involving many [[floating point]] calculations.

===Examples===

==GPU efficiency==
[[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) have continued to increase in energy usage, while CPUs designers have recently focused on improving performance per watt.  High performance GPUs may draw large amount of power and hence, intelligent techniques are required to manage GPU power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Mittal et al.,  "[https://www.academia.edu/6644474/A_Survey_of_Methods_For_Analyzing_and_Improving_GPU_Energy_Efficiency A Survey of Methods for Analyzing and Improving GPU Energy Efficiency]", ACM Computing Surveys, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures like [[3DMark|3DMark2006 score]] per watt can help identify more efficient GPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000662.html | title=Video Card Power Consumption | first=Jeff |last=Atwood | date=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use, where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html | title = Video card power consumption | work = Xbit Labs | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110904054636/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html | archivedate = 2011-09-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With modern GPUs, energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved. GPU designs are usually highly scalable, allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card, or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel. Peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate. Consequently, performance per watt of a GPU design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design.

Since GPUs may also be used for some [[GPGPU|general purpose computation]], sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to CPUs, such as FLOPS per watt.

==Challenges==
While performance per watt is useful, absolute power requirements are also important.  Claims of improved performance per watt may be used to mask increasing power demands.  For instance, though newer generation GPU architectures may provide better performance per watt, continued performance increases can negate the gains in efficiency, and the GPUs continue to consume large amounts of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/columns/2007/05/20/performance_per_what/1 | title = Performance per What? | author = Tim Smalley | work = Bit Tech | accessdate = 2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benchmarks that measure power under heavy load may not adequately reflect typical efficiency.  For instance, 3DMark stresses the 3D performance of a GPU, but many computers spend most of their time doing less intense display tasks (idle, 2D tasks, displaying video).  So the 2D or idle efficiency of the graphics system may be at least as significant for overall energy efficiency.  Likewise, systems that spend much of their time in standby or [[standby power|soft off]] are not adequately characterized by just efficiency under load.  To help address this some benchmarks, like [[SPECpower]], include measurements at a series of load levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=927 | work = ZDNet | title = SPEC launches standardized energy efficiency benchmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of some electrical components, such as [[voltage regulator]]s, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power used may increase with temperature.  Power supplies, motherboards, and some video cards are some of the subsystems affected by this.  So their power draw  may depend on temperature, and the temperature or temperature dependence should be noted when measuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article821-page5.html | title = Asus EN9600GT Silent Edition Graphics Card | author = Mike Chin | page = 5 | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPCRNewLevels"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article814-page1.html | title = 80 Plus expands podium for Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold | author = MIke Chin | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance per watt also typically does not include full [[Life cycle assessment|life-cycle costs]].  Since computer manufacturing is energy intensive, and computers often have a relatively short lifespan, energy and materials involved in production, distribution, [[electronic waste|disposal]] and [[computer recycling|recycling]] often make up significant portions of their cost, energy use, and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ecopcreview.com/LCA_and_ECPR | title=Life Cycle Analysis and Eco PC Review | work=Eco PC Review | author=Mike Chin | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304062508/http://www.ecopcreview.com/LCA_and_ECPR | archivedate=2008-03-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Environ.

==Other energy efficiency measures==
SWaP (space, wattage and performance) is a [[Sun Microsystems]] metric for [[data center]]s, incorporating energy and space:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SWaP} = \frac{\mathrm{Performance}}{\mathrm{Space} \cdot \mathrm{Power}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where performance is measured by any appropriate benchmark, and space is size of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenhill|first=David|title=SWaP Space Watts and Power|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/downloads/Greenhill_Pres.pdf|work=US EPA Energystar|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phi Kong Koi'''  ({{lang-th|ผีกองกอย}}) is a [[Thai ghost|Thai jungle ghost]]. Their appearance is not easily characterized, but often described as a phantom with one leg. They move by hopping with one leg and shout ''"Koi, Koi, Koi"''; Some people believe it has a fly-like tube mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/346560|title=เรื่องผีของไทย (3)|first=คุณนิติ|last=นวรัตน์|date=24 May 2013|work=[[Thairath]]|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others describe it as looking like [[monkey]] or [[langur]], Most agree this ghost is ugly and cannot climb trees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gun.in.th/2012/index.php?topic=91617.0|title=โป่งค่าง|language=Thai|work=gun.in.th}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is unusual in nature. It is believed that the ''Phi Kong Koi'' will suck blood from the toes of the sleeping traveler in the jungle; travelers should keep the feet together or cross their feet when sleeping to protect themselves.

The name ''Phi Kong Koi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Thairath|title=พิสูจน์แล้ว! โลกโซเชียลฮือฮา สัตว์ประหลาด-ผีกองกอย แค่หมีป่วยในมาเลย์ |url= https://www.thairath.co.th/content/494014|language=Thai|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has several sources. ''Phi'' means ghost in [[Thai language]]; some people use the term ''Phi Pong'' (ผีโป่ง) or ''Phi Pong Kang'' (ผีโป่งค่าง; Mineral lick ghost.) The word ''"Koi"'' or ''"Koy"'' (กอย), as defined by the [[Royal Institute Dictionary]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; means, ''"An ethnic group have black skin, curly hair is in the [[Malay Peninsula]], also known as [[Sakai people|Sakai]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Thai|title=กอย|url=http://dictionary.sanook.com/search/dict-th-th-royal-institute/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2|work=พจนานุกรมแปล ไทย-ไทย ราชบัณฑิตยสถาน}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luang Pu Waen Suciṇṇo]] (former abbot of [[Wat Doi Mae Pang]], Chiang Mai province) said that when he traveled in the jungle in [[Khammouane]], [[Laos]], with Luang Pu Tue Ajala Thamฺmo, they fought with many Phi Kong Koi at night. He described the ''Phi Kong Koi'' as being shaped like children of about 13–14 years old. They were thin with a bulging belly, dark brown skin, dark hair, and a chubby nose. They were armed with a small crossbows or arrows and shouted ''"Koi"''. Luang and fellow travelers were mediating, which protected them from the ''Phi Kong Koi''. At dawn, the ''Phi Kong Koi'' surrendered and invited both of them to their home. 

Some have suggested, based on this story, that the ''Phi Kong Koi'' are really the ''Kha Ra Dae'' (ข่าระแด) an ethnic group. This indicates that in the above story, they were hunting and possibly killing intruding humans and [[cannibalism|taking the meat to eat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnews.co.th/contents/202793|work=T-news|language=Thai|title=ขนพองสยองเกล้า!! ... อสุรกายในป่าดิบเขตลาวที่พยายามทำร้ายหลวงปู่แหวนก็คือ "ผีกองกอย"!!|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the faith of [[Tai Dam people]] in [[Nong Sung District]], Mukdahan province, they believe that ''Phi Kong Koi'' is a long-haired, very small (childlike) woman with a backwards foot. They speak the opposite of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langrevival.mahidol.ac.th/Research/website/re003.html|title=ผีกองกอยเดอะซีรีย์ : เรื่องเล่าหลายตอนจบของชาวไทดำ|language=Thai|work=langrevival.mahidol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, strange footprint were found at a cave in the forest in [[Loei province]]. Believed to be the footprints of ''Phi Kong Koi'', the director of a local cultural agency said ''Phi Kong Koi'' are real and that they are ethnic group whose has not been seen for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationtv.tv/main/content/social/378518307/|work=[[Nation TV (Thailand)|Nation TV]]|date=26 September 2016|language=Thai|title="ผอ.วัฒนธรรม ยัน!รอยเท้าผีกองกอย จ.เลย เป็นเรื่องเข้าใจผิด!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Declaration of Independence''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Pilipinas'') was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 in Cavite II el Viejo (present-day [[Kawit, Cavite]]), [[Philippines]]. With the public reading of the ''Act of the Proclamation of Independence of the Filipino People'' ({{lang-es|Acta de la proclamación de independencia del pueblo Filipino}}; {{lang-fil|Paggawa ng Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Sambayanang Pilipino}}), Filipino revolutionary forces under General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] proclaimed the sovereignty and independence of the Philippine Islands from the colonial rule of Spain.

==History==
{{main|History of the Philippines (1898–1946)}}

In 1896, the [[Philippine Revolution]] began. In December 1897, the Spanish government and the revolutionaries signed a truce, the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]], requiring that the Spanish pay the revolutionaries 800,000 pesos and that Aguinaldo and other leaders go into exile in [[Hong Kong]]. In April 1898, at the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], Commodore [[George Dewey]] aboard the [[U.S.S. Olympia|U.S.S. ''Olympia'']] sailed into [[Manila Bay]] leading the [[Asiatic Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].  On May 1, 1898, the United States defeated the Spanish in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]]. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] decided to return to the Philippines to help American forces defeat the Spaniards. The U.S. Navy agreed to transport him back aboard the [[USS McCulloch (1897)|USS ''McCulloch'']], and on May 19, he arrived in Cavite.&lt;ref&gt;Agoncillo, page 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Proclamation on June 12===
Independence was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 between four and five in the afternoon in Cavite at the ancestral home of General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] some {{conver|30|km}} south of [[Manila]]. The event saw the unfurling of the [[Flag of the Philippines]], made in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herboza, and the performance of the ''Marcha Filipina Magdalo'', as the [[national anthem]], now known as ''[[Lupang Hinirang]]'', which was composed by Julián Felipe and played by the ''San Francisco de Malabon'' marching band.

The Act of the Declaration of Independence was prepared, written, and read by [[Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista]] in Spanish. The Declaration was signed by 98 people, among them a [[United States Army]] officer who witnessed the proclamation. The final paragraph states that there was a "stranger" (''stranger'' in English translation—''extranjero'' in the original Spanish, meaning ''foreigner'') who attended the proceedings, Mr. L. M. Johnson, described as "a citizen of the U.S.A, a Colonel of Artillery". &lt;ref&gt;[[Dean Conant Worcester]], in his 1914 book ''The Philippines: Past and Present'' {{Harv|Worcester|1914}}, says:
:"Invitations to the ceremony of the declaration of independence were sent to [[Admiral Dewey]]; but neither he nor any of his officers were present. It was, however, important to Aguinaldo that some American should be there whom the assembled people would consider a representative of the United States. 'Colonel' Johnson, ex-hotel keeper of Shanghai, who was in the Philippines exhibiting a cinematograph, kindly consented to appear on this occasion as Aguinaldo's Chief of Artillery and the representative of the North American nation. His name does not appear subsequently among the papers of Aguinaldo. It is possible that his position as colonel and chief of artillery was a merely temporary one which enabled him to appear in a uniform which would befit the character of the representative of a great people upon so solemn an occasion!"
Worcester attributes this to "Taylor, 26 A J.", referring to Major
J. R. M. Taylor, who translated and compiled Insurgent records&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his prior military experience, Johnson had no official role in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=T_alCgAAQBAJ|title=America, Sea Power, and the World|first=James C.|last=Bradford|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=T_alCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Johnson 150]|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=9781118927922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ratification====
The proclamation of Philippine independence was, however, promulgated on 1 August, when many towns had already been organized under the rules laid down by the [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Dictatorial Government]] of General Aguinaldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter-url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=philamer;cc=philamer;rgn=full%20text;idno=aab1246.0001.001;didno=aab1246.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000221|chapter=Philippine Declaration of Independence|title=The Laws of the First Philippine Republic (The Laws of Malolos) 1898-1899.|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=philamer;iel=1;view=toc;idno=aab1246.0001.001|location=Manila|publisher=National Historical Commission|editor-last=Guevara|editor-first=Sulpicio|year=1972|accessdate=2008-03-26}}.

(Original handwritten Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; 190 municipal presidents of different towns from 16 provinces—[[Manila]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Bataan]], [[Infanta, Quezon|Infanta]], [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Tayabas]], [[Pampanga]], [[Pangasinan]], [[Mindoro]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Tarlac]], [[La Union]] and [[Zambales]]—ratified the Proclamation of Independence in [[Bacoor, Cavite]]. 

Later at [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]], the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] modified the declaration upon the insistence of [[Apolinario Mabini]] who objected to that the original proclamation essentially placed the Philippines under the protection of the United States.

===Struggle for independence===
The declaration was never recognized by either the [[United States]] or [[Spain]].  Later in 1898, Spain [[cession|ceded]] the Philippines to the United States in the [[1898 Treaty of Paris]] that ended the Spanish–American War.

The Philippine Revolutionary Government did not recognize the treaty or American sovereignty, and subsequently fought and lost a conflict with the United States originally referred to by the Americans as the "Philippine Insurrection" but now generally and officially called the [[Philippine–American War]], which ended when Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by U.S. forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&amp;pageno=175 175]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a statement acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|pp=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&amp;pageno=175 175–176]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was then followed on July 2, 1902, by [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Elihu Root]] telegraphing that the insurrection the United States had come to an end and that provincial civil governments had been established everywhere except those areas inhabited by [[Moro people|Moro]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&amp;pageno=180 180]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pockets of resistance continued for several years.

Following the end of World War II, the United States granted independence to the Philippines on 4 July 1946 via the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/1/6/00000254.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326035729/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/1/6/00000254.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-26|title=TREATY OF GENERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES. SIGNED AT MANILA, ON 4 JULY 1946|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 4 was observed in the Philippines as ''Independence Day'' until August 4, 1964 when, upon the advice of historians and the urging of nationalists, President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] signed into law Republic Act No. 4166 designating June 12 as the country's ''Independence Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno4166.html|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 4166 - AN ACT CHANGING THE DATE OF PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE DAY FROM JULY FOUR TO JUNE TWELVE, AND DECLARING JULY FOUR AS PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC DAY, FURTHER AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE SECTION TWENTY-NINE OF THE REVISED ADMINISTRATIVE CODE|date=August 4, 1964|publisher=Chanrobles law library|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 12 had previously been observed as ''Flag Day'' and many government buildings are urged to display the Philippine Flag in their offices.

===Current location of the Declaration===
The Declaration is currently housed in the [[National Library of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=ABSCBN /&gt; It is not on public display but can be viewed with permission like any other document held by the National Library.

During the Philippine–American War, the American government captured and sent to the United States about 400,000 historical documents.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; In 1958, the documents were given to the Philippine government along with two sets of microfilm of the entire collection, with the U.S. Federal Government keeping one set.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

Sometime in the 1980s or 1990s the Declaration was stolen from the National Library.&lt;ref name=ABSCBN /&gt; As part of a larger investigation into the widespread theft of historical documents and a subsequent public appeal for the return of stolen documents, the Declaration was returned to the National Library in 1994 by historian and  [[University of the Philippines]] professor Milagros Guerrero, who mediated the return of the documents.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Asiaweek|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-08-31/world/96_0830_nat9_1_philippine-independence-filipinos-batangas?_s=PM:ASIANOW|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215174535/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-08-31/world/96_0830_nat9_1_philippine-independence-filipinos-batangas?_s=PM:ASIANOW|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 15, 2013|accessdate=29 January 2013|publisher=CNN|date=August 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of the Proclamation of the Independence of the Filipino People ({{lang-es|Acta de la proclamación de independencia del pueblo Filipino}}; {{lang-fil|Paggawa ng Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Sambayanang Pilipino}}) is part of a long line of [[declarations of independence]] including the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].  It includes a list of grievances against the Spanish government stretching back to [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s arrival in 1521 and confers upon "our famous Dictator Don Emilio Aguinaldo all the powers necessary to enable him to discharge the duties of Government, including the prerogatives of granting pardon and amnesty."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Philippine Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial opinions}}
A '''plurality opinion''' is in certain legal systems the [[Legal opinion | opinion]] from a group of [[judge]]s, often in an [[appellate court]], in which no single opinion supports a [[majority]] of the court.  The plurality opinion did not receive the support of more than half the justices, but received more support than any other opinion, excluding those dissenting from the holding of the court.

In ''[[Marks v. United States]]'', 430 U.S. 188 (1977), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] explained how the holding of a case should be viewed where there is no majority supporting the rationale of any opinion: “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” ''Marks'', 430 U.S. at 193.

That requires lower courts to look at all opinions to determine which is the most narrow compared to others. This opinion will be called the '''controlling opinion''', and can be a mere concurrence, not the plurality.&lt;ref&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' (1976) "the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Marks Rule'' has raised the following schools of thought regarding the appropriate basis for determining the holding in such fractured cases: (a) the narrowest analysis essential to the result derived from a combination of all concurring opinions, (''Pedcor Mgmt. Co. Welfare Benefit Plan v. Nations Pers. of Tex., Inc.'', 343 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir. 2003)); (b) the concurring opinion offering the narrowest rationale, (''e.g. Horn v. Thoratec Corp.'', 376 F.3d 163, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2004)); or (c) only those parts of the concurring opinions which overlap and arrive at the same result. For example, if one follows the first interpretation, then the holding in the case should be viewed as the narrowest rationale supported by all of the concurring opinions read together as though it were a single majority opinion, and where there is a conflict, the opinion based on the narrowest ground governs. Followers of the second rationale would find the concurring opinion offering the narrowest analysis to be the holding. Whereas, under the third interpretation, only the rationale(s) common to all concurring opinions which arrive at the same result(s) (and to the exclusion of all other rationales) is considered the holding.

A good example of a plurality opinion can be found in the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board]]'', 553 U.S. 181 (2008). In considering whether Indiana's voter identification law passed constitutional muster, three justices believed the proper analysis was to apply the balancing approach laid down in ''[[Anderson v. Celebrezze]]'', 460 U.S. 780 (1983). Three other justices agreed with the outcome of the ''Anderson'' approach, but believed the proper analysis was to apply the rule in ''Burdick v. Takushi'', 504 U.S. 428 (1992), which "forged ''Anderson'''s amorphous 'flexible standard' into something resembling an administrable rule." Regardless of the approach used, a reading of the opinions together results in a holding that "neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure" is constitutional so long as the burden imposed by the regulation is minimal or not severe.

[[File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739.jpg|thumb|250px|Poor Richard's Almanack|300px|right|1739 Edition of ''Poor Richard's Almanack'']]
'''''Poor Richard's Almanack''''' (sometimes ''Almanac'') was a yearly [[almanac]] published by [[Benjamin Franklin]], who adopted the [[pseudonym]] of "Poor Richard" or "Richard Saunders" for this purpose. The publication appeared continually from 1732 to 1758. It sold exceptionally well for a pamphlet published in the American colonies; print runs reached 10,000 per year.&lt;ref name="Goodrich1829"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles A. Goodrich|title=Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djYEAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=1829|publisher=W. Reed &amp; Company|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TQ"&gt;Oracle ThinkQuest (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin, the American [[inventor]], [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], and [[publisher]], achieved success with ''Poor Richard's Almanack''. Almanacks were very popular books in [[History of the United States (1776–89)#Declaration of Independence|colonial America]], offering a mixture of seasonal weather forecasts, practical household hints, puzzles, and other amusements.&lt;ref&gt;The History Place (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poor Richard's Almanack'' was also popular for its extensive use of [[wordplay]], and some of the witty phrases coined in the work survive in the contemporary American [[vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;Innovation Philadelphia (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Almanack'' contained the [[calendar]], [[weather]], [[poem]]s, [[sayings]] and [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[astrology|astrological]] information that a typical almanac of the period would contain. Franklin also included the occasional [[mathematical exercise]], and the ''Almanack'' from 1750 features an early example of [[demographics]]. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's [[aphorism]]s and [[proverb]]s, many of which live on in [[American English]]. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, with a dash of cynicism.&lt;ref&gt;Pasles (2001), pp. 492–493&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spaces that occurred between noted calendar days, Franklin included proverbial sentences about industry and frugality. Several of these sayings were borrowed from an earlier writer, [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], many of whose aphorisms sprang from, "... [a] basic skepticism directed against the motives of men, manners, and the age."&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb (1955), pp. 535–536&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, Franklin made a selection of these and prefixed them to the almanac as the address of an old man to the people attending an auction. This was later published as ''[[The Way to Wealth]]'', and was popular in both America and England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poor Richard==
Franklin borrowed the name "Richard Saunders" from the seventeenth-century author of ''[[Rider's British Merlin]]'', a popular London almanac which continued to be published throughout the eighteenth century. Franklin created the Poor Richard persona based in part on [[Jonathan Swift]]'s pseudonymous character, "[[Isaac Bickerstaff]]". In a series of three letters in 1708 and 1709, known as the Bickerstaff papers, "Bickerstaff" predicted the imminent death of astrologer and almanac maker [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]]. Franklin's Poor Richard, like Bickerstaff, claimed to be a [[philomath]] and [[astrologer]] and, like Bickerstaff, predicted the deaths of actual astrologers who wrote traditional almanacs. In the early editions of ''Poor Richard's Almanack'', predicting and falsely reporting the deaths of these astrologers—much to their dismay—was something of a running joke. However, Franklin's endearing character of "Poor" Richard Saunders, along with his wife Bridget, was ultimately used to frame (if comically) what was intended as a serious resource that people would buy year after year. To that end, the satirical edge of Swift's character is largely absent in Poor Richard. Richard was presented as distinct from Franklin himself, occasionally referring to the latter as his printer.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1940), pp. 785–791&lt;/ref&gt;

In later editions, the original Richard Saunders character gradually disappeared, replaced by a Poor Richard, who largely stood in for Franklin and his own practical scientific and business perspectives. By 1758, the original character was even more distant from the practical advice and proverbs of the almanac, which Franklin presented as coming from "Father Abraham," who in turn got his sayings from Poor Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1940), pp. 791–794&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Oliver Pelton - Benjamin Franklin - Poor Richard's Almanac Illustrated.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A nineteenth-century print based on ''Poor Richard's Almanack'', showing the author surrounded by twenty-four illustrations of many of his best-known sayings.]]
Franklin published the first ''Poor Richard's Almanack'' on December 28, 1732,&lt;ref name="IHA"&gt;Independence Hall Association (1999–2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to publish new editions for 25 years, bringing him much economic success and popularity. The almanack sold as many as 10,000 copies a year.&lt;ref name="TQ"&gt;Oracle ThinkQuest (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1735, upon the death of Franklin's brother, James, Franklin sent 500 copies of ''Poor Richard's'' to his widow for free, so that she could make money selling them.&lt;ref name="IHA"/&gt;

==Serialization==
One of the appeals of the ''Almanack'' was that it contained various "news stories" in [[Serial (literature)|serial]] format, so that readers would purchase it year after year to find out what happened to the [[protagonists]]. One of the earliest of these was the "prediction" that the author's "good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. [[Titan Leeds]]" would die on October 17 of that year, followed by the rebuttal of Mr. Leeds himself that he would die, not on the 17th, but on October 26. Appealing to his readers, Franklin urged them to purchase the next year or two or three or four editions to show their support for his prediction. The following year, Franklin expressed his regret that he was too ill to learn whether he or Leeds was correct. Nevertheless, the ruse had its desired effect: people purchased the ''Almanack'' to find out who was correct.&lt;ref&gt;Laughter (1999–2003)&lt;/ref&gt; (Later editions of the ''Almanack'' would claim that Leeds had died and that the person claiming to be Leeds was an impostor; Leeds, in fact, died in 1738, which prompted Franklin to applaud the supposed impostor for ending his ruse.)

==Criticism==
For some writers the content of the ''Almanack'' became inextricably linked with Franklin's character—and not always to favorable effect. Both [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Herman Melville]] caricatured the ''Almanack''—and Franklin by extension—in their writings, while [[James Russell Lowell]], reflecting on the public unveiling in [[Boston]] of a statue to honor Franklin, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... we shall find out that Franklin was born in Boston, and invented being struck with lightning and printing and the Franklin medal, and that he had to move to [[Philadelphia]] because great men were so plenty in Boston that he had no chance, and that he revenged himself on his native town by saddling it with the [[Franklin stove]], and that he discovered the almanac, and that a penny saved is a penny lost, or something of the kind.&lt;ref&gt;Miles (1957), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Almanack'' was also a reflection of the norms and social mores of his times, rather than a philosophical document setting a path for new-freedoms, as the works of Franklin's contemporaries, [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[John Adams|Adams]], or [[Thomas Paine|Paine]] were. Historian [[Howard Zinn]] offers, as an example, the adage "Let thy maidservant be faithful, strong, and homely" as indication of Franklin's belief in the legitimacy of controlling the sexual lives of servants for the economic benefit of their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, 1980, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one modern biographer has published the claim that Franklin "stole", not borrowed, the name of Richard Saunders from the deceased astrologer-doctor. Franklin also "borrowed—apparently without asking—and adapted the title of an almanac his brother [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] was publishing at Newport: ''Poor Robin's Almanack'' (itself appropriated from a seventeenth-century almanac published under the same title in London)".&lt;ref&gt;Brands, H. W. (2000) ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' First Anchor Books Edition, March 2002. {{ISBN|0-385-49540-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
[[Louis XVI of France]] gave a ship to [[John Paul Jones]] who renamed her after the ''Almanack's'' author—''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]'', or "Good man Richard" (the first of [[USS Bonhomme Richard|several US warships]] so named).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/lhd6/Pages/history.aspx#.WYXqAoGQif0 The Frigate BonHomme Richard,  United States Navy Website, History]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] considered the ''Almanack'' significant enough to translate it into Italian, along with the [[Pennsylvania Constitution|Pennsylvania State Constitution]] (which Franklin helped draft), when he established the [[Cisalpine Republic]] in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;Dauer (1976), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Almanack'' was also twice translated into French, reprinted in Great Britain in [[broadside (printing)|broadside]] for ease of posting, and was distributed by members of the [[clergy]] to poor parishioners. It was the first work of English literature to be translated into [[Slovene language|Slovene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2003/v48/n1-2/006972ar.html|title=Domestication and Foreignization in Translating American Prose for Slovenian Children|journal=Meta: Translator's Journal|volume=48|issue=1–2|date=May 2003|pages=250–265|issn=1492-1421|first=Darja|last=Mazi-Leskovar|publisher=Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal|doi=10.7202/006972ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated in 1812 by [[Janez Nepomuk Primic]] (1785–1823).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.srl.si/arhiv/2002-01/pdf/sumrada.pdf|title=Janez Nepomuk Primic in ustanovitev stolice za slovenski jezik na liceju v Gradcu 1811|language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Janez Nepomuk Primic and the Establishment of the Chair of Slovene at the ''Lyzeum'' in Graz in 1811|journal=Slavistična revija [Journal of Slavic Linguistics]|volume=50|date=January–March 2002|issue=1|issn=1855-7570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Almanack'' also had a strong cultural and economic impact in the years following publication.  In [[Pennsylvania]], changes in monetary policy in regard to foreign expenses were evident for years after the issuing of the ''Almanack''. Later writers such as [[Noah Webster]] were inspired by the almanac, and it went on to influence other publications of this type such as ''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kneeland ''et al.'' (1891), pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[American almanacs|farmer's almanacs]] trace their format and tradition to ''Poor Richard's Almanack;'' the [[Old Farmer's Almanac]], for instance, has included a picture of Franklin on its cover since 1851.

The '''Proclamation Declaring the Establishment of the Commonwealth''' was a [[royal proclamation]] made by [[Queen Victoria]] on 17 September 1900 federating the six separate [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Crown colony|colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] under the name of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. The authority to issue the proclamation was granted by the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900]]'', an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and was effective from 1 January 1901.

==Text of the proclamation==
&lt;blockquote style="border:1px dotted gray; padding-left:20px"&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt;

'''PROCLAMATION UNITING THE PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, QUEENSLAND, TASMANIA, AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA IN A FEDERAL COMMONWEALTH.'''

''(Imperial Statutory Rules and Orders, revised 1948, Vol. II., Australia, p.&amp;nbsp;1027.)&lt;br /&gt;
1900 No. 722.''

'''At the Court at Balmoral,'''&lt;br /&gt;
The 17th day of September, 1900.

'''Present:'''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The following Draft Proclamation was this day read at the Board and approved: – A. W. FITZROY.''

'''By The Queen'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''PROCLAMATION'''&lt;br /&gt;
WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament passed in the sixty-third and sixty-fourth years of Our Reign intituled, "An Act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia," it is enacted that it shall be lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council, to declare by proclamation that, on and after a day appointed, not being later than one year after the  passing of this Act, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, and also, if Her Majesty is satisfied that the people of Western Australia have agreed thereto, of Western Australia, shall be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia:&lt;br /&gt;
And whereas We are satisfied that the people of Western Australia have agreed thereto accordingly:&lt;br /&gt;
We, therefore, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council, have thought fit to issue this Our Royal Proclamation, and We do hereby declare that on and after the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and one, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia shall be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
Given at Our Court at Balmoral, this seventeenth day of September, in the year of Our Lord One thousand nine hundred and in the sixty-fourth year of Our Reign.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1074">'''''R v Mabula'''''&lt;ref&gt;1927 AD 159.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law. It was heard in the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein in October 1926. The judges were Innes CJ, De Villiers JA, Kotz JA, Wessels JA and Gardiner AJA.

== Facts ==
The case turned on whether a thatch-roofed structure, used as a dwelling for the accommodation of six or seven persons, and whose walls were built of sods resting directly upon the ground, there being no foundations or other attachment, constituted immovable property.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the structure was indeed immovable property, and so warranted a charge and conviction for arson.

{{Socialism sidebar|Variants}}
'''Revolutionary socialism''' is the [[Socialism|socialist]] doctrine that [[social revolution]] is necessary in order to bring about structural changes to society. More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from [[capitalism]] to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the [[working class]] so that the [[State (polity)|state]] is directly controlled or abolished by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests.&lt;ref name=sdvrds&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1903/1000-thompson-whatrevsoc.pdf What Revolutionary Socialism Means] by Carl D. Thompson.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] believe that it is inevitable but not predetermined.

Revolutionary socialism encompasses multiple political and social movements that may define "revolution" differently from one another. These include movements based on orthodox Marxist theory, such as [[De Leonism]], [[impossibilism]], and [[Luxemburgism]]; as well as movements based on [[Leninism]] and the theory of [[Vanguardism|vanguardist]]-led revolution, such as [[Maoism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], and [[Trotskyism]]. Revolutionary socialism also includes non-Marxist movements, such as those found in [[anarchism]], revolutionary [[syndicalism]], and [[democratic socialism]].

It is used in contrast to the [[reformism]] of [[social democracy]] and other evolutionary approaches to socialism. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform. Revolutionary socialism also exists in contrast to the concept of small revolutionary groups seizing power without first achieving mass support, termed [[Blanquism]].

==Origins==
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], 1875]]
In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air. Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie. In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. (...) The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; (...) The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.|Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto'', 1848}}

Twenty-four years after ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx and Engels admitted that in developed countries "labour may attain its goal by peaceful means".&lt;ref&gt;"... we do not deny that there are countries like England and America... where labour may attain its goal by peaceful means." Marx, 18 September 1872, at the Hague Congress of the International, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/08.htm, K. Marx and F. Engels, On Britain, Foreign Languages Press, Moscow, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist scholar [[Adam Schaff]] argued that Marx, Engels and Lenin have expressed such view "on many occasions".&lt;ref&gt;"Both Marx and Engels and, later, Lenin on many occasions referred to a ''peaceful'' revolution, that is, one attained by a class struggle, but not by violence." Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no.2 (Apr-Jun 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Blanquist view emphasised the overthrow by force of the ruling elite in government by an active minority of revolutionaries, who then proceed to implement socialist change, disregarding the state of readiness of society as a whole and the mass of the population in particular for revolutionary change.

In 1875, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) published a somewhat reformist [[Gotha Program]], which was attacked by Marx in ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', where he reiterated the need for [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The reformist viewpoint was introduced into Marxist thought by [[Eduard Bernstein]], one of the leaders of the SPD. From 1896 to 1898, Bernstein published a series of articles entitled "Probleme des Sozialismus" ("Problems of Socialism"). These articles led to a debate on [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] in the SPD and can be seen as the origins of a reformist trend within Marxism.

In 1900, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] wrote ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]'', a [[polemic]] against Bernstein's position. The work of reforms, Luxemburg argued, could only be carried on "in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution". In order to advance society to socialism from the capitalist 'social form', a social revolution will be necessary:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch08.htm Luxemburg, Rosa, ''Social Reform or Revolution'', Chapter 8, ''Conquest of Political Power''], accessed 1 July 2007.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] attacked Bernstein's position in his ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' When Bernstein first put forward his ideas, the majority of the SPD rejected them. The 1899 Congress of the SPD reaffirmed the Erfurt programme as did the 1901 congress. The 1903 congress denounced "revisionist efforts".

==World War I and Zimmerwald==
On 4 August 1914, the SPD members of the Reichstag voted for the government's war budget while the French and Belgium socialists publicly supported and joined their governments. The [[Zimmerwald Conference]] in September 1915, attended by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], saw the beginning of the end of the uneasy coexistence of revolutionary socialists and reformist socialists in the parties of [[Second International]]. The conference adopted a proposal by Trotsky to avoid an immediate split with the Second International. At first opposed to it, in the end Lenin voted&lt;ref&gt;See Christian Rakovsky's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog2.htm biography] by Gus Fagan for details&lt;/ref&gt; for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.

In December, 1915 and March, 1916, eighteen Social Democratic representatives, the [[Hugo Haase|Haase]]-[[Georg Ledebour|Ledebour]] Group, voted against war credits and were expelled from the Social Democratic Party. Liebknecht wrote ''Revolutionary Socialism in Germany'' in 1916, arguing that this group was not a revolutionary socialist group despite their refusal to vote for war credits, further defining in his view what was meant by a revolutionary socialist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/liebknecht-k/works/1916/misc/revolutionary-socialism-germany.htm Liebknecht, Karl, ''Revolutionary Socialism in Germany'', 1916], accessed 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Revolution and after==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
Many revolutionary socialists argue that the [[Russian Revolution]] of October 1917 led by Lenin and Trotsky follows the revolutionary socialist model of a revolutionary movement of the immense majority. By contrast, the October revolution is {{citation needed span|text=popularly|date=August 2012}} portrayed as a putsch or coup d'état along the lines of Blanquism.

Revolutionary socialists, particularly Trotskyists, argue that the [[Bolsheviks]] only seized power as the expression of the mass of workers and peasants, whose desires are brought into being by an organised force—the revolutionary party. Marxists such as Trotskyists argue that Lenin did not advocate seizing of power until he felt that the majority of the population, represented in the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], demanded revolutionary change and no longer supported the reformist government of [[Alexander Kerensky]] established in the earlier revolution of February 1917: {{quote|Lenin, after the experience of the reconnoiter, withdrew the slogan of the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. But he did not withdraw it for any set period of time, for so many weeks or months, but strictly in dependence upon how quickly the revolt of the masses against the conciliationists would grow.|Leon Trotsky, ''[[Lessons of October]]'', Chapter Four: "The April Conference"|source=}}

For these Marxists, the fact that the Bolsheviks won a majority (in alliance with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries|Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]]) in the second all-Russian congress of Soviets—democratically elected bodies—which convened at the time of the October revolution, shows that they had popular support of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the vast majority of Russian society.

In his pamphlet ''Lessons of October'', first published in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxist.net/trotsky/russia/lessons.htm LeonTrotsky's "Lessons of October"].&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky argued that military power lay in the hands of the Bolsheviks before the October Revolution was carried out, but this power was not used against the government until the Bolsheviks gained mass support.

The mass of the soldiers began to be led by the Bolshevik party after the July days of 1917 and followed only the orders of the [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] under the leadership of Trotsky in October (also termed the Revolutionary Military Committee in Lenin's collected works).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxist.net/trotsky/russia/lessons.htm#6 Trotsky, Leon, ''Lessons of October'']: "On October 16th the Military Revolutionary Committee was created, the legal Soviet organ of insurrection." Accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Trotsky only mobilised the Military Revolutionary Committee to seize power on the advent of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on 25 October 1917.

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Communist International]] (also known as the Third International) was founded. This International became widely identified with [[communism]], but also defined itself in terms of revolutionary socialism. However, in 1938 Trotskyists formed the [[Fourth International]] because they thought that the Third International was lost to [[Stalinism]]—this latter International became identified with revolutionary socialism.

Emerging from the Communist International, but critical of the post-1924 [[Soviet Union]], the Trotskyist tradition in Western Europe and elsewhere uses the term "revolutionary socialism". For instance, in 1932 the first issue of the first Canadian Trotskyist newspaper, ''The Vanguard'', published an editorial intitled "Revolutionary Socialism vs Reformism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/TrotOrigin/VanguardEdits32.htm ''Socialist History Project''], accessed 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Trotskyist groups advocate "revolutionary socialism" as opposed to reformism and are considered—and consider themselves—"revolutionary socialists".&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the Committee for a Workers International states, "We campaign for new workers’ parties and for them to adopt a socialist programme. At the same time, the CWI builds support for the ideas of revolutionary socialism" [http://www.socialistworld.net/z/bin/kw.cgi/show?id=2771]{{Dead link|date=October 2018}} and the UK Socialist Workers Party’s Alex Callinicos argues ''The Case for Revolutionary Socialism'', [http://www.swp.org.uk/swp_archive.php?article_id=5039]{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Luxemburgism is another revolutionary socialist tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="963">A '''self-enforcing agreement''' is an agreement that is enforced only by the parties to it; no external party can enforce or interfere with the agreement.  (In this respect it differs from an enforceable [[contract]].)  The agreement will stand so long as the parties believe it is mutually beneficial and it is not breached by any party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2352355 ''A Theory of Self-Enforcing Agreements'' L.G. Tesler, University of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[game theory]], games in which cooperative behaviour can only be enforced through self-enforcing agreements are called [[Non-cooperative game theory|non-cooperative games]], whereas games allowing strategies relying on external enforcement are called [[Cooperative game theory|cooperative games]]. [[Nash equilibrium]] is the most common kind of self-enforcing agreement.

The '''''Shahnameh''''' ({{lang-fa|شاهنامه}} ''Šāhnāmah'' {{IPA-fa|ʃɒːhnɒːˈme|pron}}, "The Book of Kings",  also transliterated ''Shahnama''), is a long [[epic poem]] written by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]] between c. 977 and 1010 CE and is the [[national epic]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Consisting of some 50,000 "[[distich]]s" or couplets (two-line verses),&lt;ref name="TIO20100513"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lalani|first=Farah|title=A thousand years of Firdawsi’s Shahnama is celebrated|url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/998/A-thousand-years-of-Firdawsis-Shahnama-is-celebrated|work=The Ismaili|accessdate=24 May 2010|date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Shahnameh'' is the world's longest epic poem written by a single poet. It tells mainly the [[Persian mythology|mythical]] and to some extent the historical past of the [[Persian Empire]] from the creation of the world until the [[Arab conquest of Iran]] in the 7th century. Modern [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Afghanistan]] and the greater [[Greater Iran|region]] influenced by the [[Persian culture]] (such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Dagestan]]) celebrate this national epic.

The work is of central importance in [[Persian culture]] and [[Persian language]], regarded as a literary masterpiece, and definitive of the ethno-national cultural identity of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashraf|first=Ahmad|title=Iranian Identity iii. Medieval Islamic Period|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=April 2010|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to the contemporary adherents of [[Zoroastrianism]], in that it traces the historical links between the beginnings of the religion and the death of the [[Fall of the Sassanid Empire|last Sassanid ruler]] of Persia during the Muslim conquest which brought an end to the Zoroastrian influence in Iran.

== Composition ==

[[Image:The assassination of Chosroës Parvez.jpg|270px|thumb|left|The assassination of [[Khosrau II]] in a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]] made by [[Abd al-Samad]] in 1535]]

[[Ferdowsi]] started writing the ''Shahnameh'' in 977 AD and completed it on 8 March 1010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khaleghi-Motlagh|first=Djalal|title=Ferdowsi, Abu'l Qāsem i. Life|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ferdowsi-i|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=26 January 2012|quote=the poet refers... to the date of the ''Šāh-nāma''’s completion as the day of Ard (i.e., 25th) of Esfand in the year 378 Š. (400 Lunar)/8 March 1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shahnameh'' is a monument of poetry and [[historiography]], being mainly the poetical recast of what Ferdowsi, his contemporaries, and his predecessors regarded as the account of [[Iran]]'s ancient history. Many such accounts already existed in prose, an example being the [[Abu-Mansuri Shahnameh]]. A small portion of Ferdowsi's work, in passages scattered throughout the ''Shahnameh'', is entirely of his own conception.

The ''Shahnameh'' is an epic poem of over 50,000 [[couplet]]s, written in early [[Modern Persian]]. It is based mainly on a prose work of the same name compiled in Ferdowsi's earlier life in his native [[Tus, Iran|Tus]]. This prose ''Shahnameh'' was in turn and for the most part the translation of a Pahlavi ([[Middle Persian]]) work, known as the ''[[Khwaday-Namag|X&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;adāynāmag]]'' ("Book of Kings"), a late [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] compilation of the history of the kings and heroes of Persia from mythical times down to the reign of [[Khosrau II]] (590–628). The ''X&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;adāynāmag'' contained historical information on the later Sassanid period, but it does not appear to have drawn on any historical sources for the earlier Sassanid period (3rd to 4th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaehner|first=Robert Charles|title=Zurvan: a Zoroastrian Dilemma|year=1955|publisher=Biblo and Tannen|isbn=0819602809|authorlink=Robert Charles Zaehner|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdowsi added material continuing the story to the overthrow of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the middle of the 7th century.

The first to undertake the versification of the Pahlavi chronicle was [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi]], a contemporary of Ferdowsi, poet at the court of the [[Samanids]], who came to a violent end after completing only 1,000 verses. These verses, which deal with the rise of the prophet [[Zoroaster]], were afterward incorporated by Ferdowsi, with acknowledgment, in his own poem. The style of the ''Shahnameh'' shows characteristics of both written and oral literature.  Some claim that Ferdowsi also used Zoroastrian ''nasks'', such as the now-lost ''[[Chihrdad]],'' as sources as well.&lt;ref&gt;"A possible predecessor to the Khvatay-Namak could be the Chihrdad, one of the destroyed books of the Avesta (known to us because of its listing and description in the Middle Persian Zoroastrian text, the Dinkard 8.13)." K.E. Eduljee, ''Zoroastrian Heritage'', "Ferdowsi's Shahnameh," http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] sources were used in composing the epic, prominent being the [[Kārnāmag-ī Ardaxšīr-ī Pābagān]], which was originally written during the late Sassanid era and gave accounts of how [[Ardashir I]] came to power which, because of its historical proximity, is thought to be highly accurate. The text is written in the late Middle Persian, which was the immediate ancestor of [[Persian language|Modern Persian]]. A great portion of the historical chronicles given in ''Shahnameh'' is based on this epic and there are in fact various phrases and words which can be matched between Ferdowsi's poem and this source, according to [[Zabihollah Safa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safa|first=Zabihollah|title=Hamase-sarâ’i dar Iran, Tehran 1945|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one account of the sources, a Persian named Dehqan in the court of King [[Khosrau I|Anushehrawan]] Dadgar had composed a voluminous book in prose form, known as ''Khoday Nameh''. After the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire|Iranian Empire]], ''Khoday Nameh'' came into the possession of King [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari|Yaqub Lais]] and then the [[Samani]] king [[Nuh I|Nuh]] ordered the poet Daqiqi to complete it, but Daqiqi was killed by his slave. Ferdowsi obtained the book through a friend.

[[File:Kai Khusrau Shahnameh Met 34.24.5.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Kai Khorso enthroned holding the sword with which he will execute Afrasiyab for the murder of Siyavash]]

The ''Shahnameh'' provides a poetic account of the prehistory and [[history of Iran]], beginning with the creation of the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law), and ending with the [[Islamic Conquest of Persia]]. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years but most have normal life spans. There are many ''[[Shah|shāh]]s'' who come and go, as well as heroes and villains, who also come and go. The only lasting images are those of [[Greater Persia]] itself, and of a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet illustrative of the passage of time.

The work is divided into three successive parts: the "mythical", "heroic", and "historical" ages.

Father Time, a Saturn-like image, is a reminder of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, [[evil]] is external (the [[devil]]). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh [[Fereydun|Fereydūn]]'s two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]-like story of Shāh [[Kay Kāvus]], his wife [[Sudabeh|Sūdābeh]], and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, [[Siyavash|Sīyāvash]].

It is only in the characterizations of the work's many figures, both male and female, that Zoroaster's original view of the human condition comes through. Zoroaster emphasized human [[free will]]. All of Ferdowsi's characters are complex; none is an archetype or a puppet. {{Clarify|date=January 2010}} The best characters have flaws, and the worst have moments of humanity.

Traditional historiography in Iran has claimed that Ferdowsi was grieved by the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]] and its subsequent rule by "Arabs" and "Turks". The ''Shahnameh'', the argument goes, is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Persia's golden days and transmit it to a new generation so that they could learn and try to build a better world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahbazi|first=A. Shapur|title=Ferdowsī: A Critical Biography|year=1991|publisher=Mazda Publishers|location=Costa Mesa, Calif.|isbn=0939214830|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most scholars have contended that Ferdowsi's main concern was the preservation of the pre-Islamic legacy of myth and history, a number of authors have formally challenged this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khatibi|first=Abolfazl|title=Anti-Arab verses in the Shahnameh|year=1384/2005|publisher=Nashr Danesh|location=21, 3, Autumn 1384/2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mythical age ===

[[File:Tus shahnameh.jpg|thumb|right|Scenes from the ''Shahnameh'' carved into reliefs at Ferdowsi's mausoleum in Tus, Iran]]

This portion of the ''Shahnameh'' is relatively short, amounting to some 2,100 verses or four percent of the entire book, and it narrates events with the simplicity, predictability, and swiftness of a historical work.

After an opening in praise of [[God]] and Wisdom, the ''Shahnameh'' gives an account of the creation of the world and of man as believed by the [[Sassanians]]. This introduction is followed by the story of the first man, [[Keyumars]], who also became the first king after a period of mountain dwelling. His grandson [[Hushang]], son of [[Siamak|Sīyāmak]], accidentally discovered fire and established the [[Sadeh]] Feast in its honor. Stories of [[Tahmuras]], [[Jamshid]], [[Zahhak|Zahhāk]], [[Kaveh the blacksmith|Kawa]] or [[Kaveh the blacksmith|Kaveh]], [[Fereydun|Fereydūn]] and his three sons [[Salm (son of Fereydun)|Salm]], [[Tur (son of Fereydun)|Tur]], and [[Iraj]], and his grandson [[Manuchehr]] are related in this section.

=== Heroic age ===
Almost two-thirds of the ''Shahnameh'' is devoted to the age of heroes, extending from Manuchehr's reign until the conquest of [[Alexander the Great]] (Eskandar). This age is also identified as the kingdom of Keyaniyan, which established a long history of heroic age in which myth and legend are combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iran: Politics, History and Literature|last=Katouzian|first=Homa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415636896|location=Oxon|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature of this period is the major role played by the [[Saka]] or [[Sistan|Sistānī]] heroes who appear as the backbone of the Persian Empire. [[Garshasp|Garshāsp]] is briefly mentioned with his son [[Nariman (father of Sām)|Narimān]], whose own son [[Saam|Sām]] acted as the leading paladin of Manuchehr while reigning in Sistān in his own right. His successors were his son [[Zal|Zāl]] and Zal's son [[Rostam]], the bravest of the brave, and then Farāmarz.

Among the stories described in this section are the romance of Zal and [[Rudaba|Rudāba]], the Seven Stages (or Labors) of [[Rostam]], [[Rostam and Sohrab]], [[Siyavash|Sīyāvash]] and [[Sudabeh|Sudāba]], Rostam and Akvān Dīv, the romance of [[Bijan and Manijeh]], the wars with [[Afrasiab|Afrāsīyāb]], [[Daqiqi]]'s account of the story of Goshtāsp and Arjāsp, and Rostam and [[Esfandyar|Esfandyār]].

[[File:Bayasanghori Shahnameh 5.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Courtiers of Bayasanghori playing chess]]

=== Historical age ===
A brief mention of the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid dynasty]] follows the history of Alexander and precedes that of [[Ardashir I]], founder of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. After this, Sassanid history is related with a good deal of accuracy. The fall of the Sassanids and the Arab conquest of Persia are narrated romantically.

Ferdowsi did not expect his readers to pass over historical events indifferently, but asked them to think carefully, to see the grounds for the rise and fall of individuals and nations; and to learn from the past in order to improve the present, and to better shape the future. {{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} Ferdowsi stresses his belief that since the world is transient, and since everyone is merely a passerby, one is wise to avoid cruelty, lying, avarice, and other evils; instead one should strive for justice, honor, truth, order, and other virtues. {{Original research inline|date=June 2010}}

The singular message{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} that the ''Shahnameh'' of Ferdowsi strives to convey is the idea that the history of the Sassanid Empire was a complete and immutable whole: it started with [[Keyumars]], the first man, and ended with his fiftieth scion and successor, [[Yazdegerd III]], six thousand years of history of Iran. The task of Ferdowsi was to prevent this history from being lost to future Persian generations.

According to Jalal Khaleghi Mutlaq, the ''Shahnameh'' teaches a wide variety of moral virtues, like worship of one God; religious uprightness; patriotism; love of wife, family and children; and helping the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mutlaq|first=Jalal Khaleqi|title=Iran Garai dar Shahnameh|journal=Hasti Magazine|year=1993|volume=4|trans-title=Iran-centrism in the Shahnameh|publisher=Bahman Publishers|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are themes in the Shahnameh that were viewed with suspicion by the succession of Iranian regimes. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah, the epic was largely ignored in favor of the more obtuse, esoteric and dryly intellectual Persian literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Nationalism in Modern Iran|last=Ansari|first=Ali|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780521867627|location=Cambridge|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians note that the theme of [[regicide]] and the incompetence of kings embedded in the epic did not sit well with the Iranian monarchy. Later, there were Muslim figures such as [[Ali Shariati|Dr. Ali Shariati]], the hero of Islamic reformist youth of the 1970s, who were also antagonistic towards the contents of the Shahnameh since it included verses critical of Islam.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mute Dreams, Blind Owls, and Dispersed Knowledges: Persian Poesis in the Transnational Circuitry|last=Fischer|first=Michael|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780822385516|location=Durham|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the line: ''tofu bar to, ey charkh-i gardun, tofu!'' (spit on your face, oh heavens spit!), which Ferdowsi used as a reference to the Muslim invaders who despoiled Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;       

== Influence on Persian language ==

[[File:Rustam Kills the Turanian Hero Alkus with his Lance.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rustam]] kills the [[Turan]]ian hero Alkus with his lance]]

After the ''Shahnameh'', a number of other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere of the Persian language. Without exception, all such works were based in style and method on the ''Shahnameh'', but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity.

Some experts{{who|date=May 2012}} believe the main reason the [[Persian language|Modern Persian language]] today is more or less the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like the ''Shahnameh'', which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the ''Shahnameh'' itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the ''Shahnameh'' in their works.

It is claimed that Ferdowsi went to great lengths to avoid any words drawn from the [[Arabic language]], words which had increasingly infiltrated the Persian language following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Language|Arab conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century. Ferdowsi is even quoted:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|lang=fa|
بسی رنج بردم در این سال سی؛
‌عجم زنده کردم بدین پارسی
|
I have struggled much these thirty years
in order to keep Persian {{lang|fa-Latn|ajam}} (meaning non-Arabic, or specifically Iranian).}}

Ferdowsi followed this path not only to preserve and purify the Persian language, but also as a stark political statement against the Arab conquest of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdowsi's "Shahnameh": The Book of Kings|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17036475|work=[[The Economist]]|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion has been called into question by Mohammed Moinfar, who has noted that there are numerous examples of Arabic words in the ''Shahnameh'' which are effectively synonyms for Persian words previously used in the text. This calls into question the idea of Ferdowsi's deliberate eschewing of Arabic words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=John|title=Šāh-nāma v. Arabic Words|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sah-nama-v-arabic-words|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shahnameh'' has 62 stories, 990 chapters, and some 50,000 rhyming couplets, making it more than three times the length of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', and more than twelve times the length of the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. According to Ferdowsi himself, the final edition of the ''Shahnameh'' contained some sixty thousand distichs. But this is a round figure; most of the relatively reliable manuscripts have preserved a little over fifty thousand distichs. [[Nizami Arudhi Samarqandi|Nezami-e Aruzi]] reports that the final edition of the ''Shahnameh'' sent to the court of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] was prepared in seven volumes.

== Cultural influence ==

[[File:Baysonghori Shahnameh battle-scene.jpg|right|thumb|A battle scene from the Baysonghori ''Shahnameh'']]

The [[Shirvanshah]] dynasty adopted many of their names from the ''Shahnameh''. The relationship between Shirwanshah and his son, Manuchihr, is mentioned in chapter eight of [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''Leili o Majnoon''. Nizami advises the king's son to read the ''Shahnameh'' and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seyed-Gohrab|first=Ali Ashgar|title=Laylī and Majnūn: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing in Niẓāmī's Epic Romance|year=2003|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004129421|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Turkish historian [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]]:

{{quote|Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question that Persian influence was paramount among the [[Seljuks]] of [[Anatolia]]. This is clearly revealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after [[Kaykhusraw I|Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusraw I]] assumed titles taken from ancient [[Persian mythology]], like [[Kai Khosrow]], [[Kay Kāvus]], and [[Kai Kobad]]; and that [[Kayqubad I|Ala' al-Din Kai-Qubad I]] had some passages from the Shahname inscribed on the walls of [[Konya]] and [[Sivas]]. When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and the sincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persian literature, then this fact (i.e. the importance of Persian influence) is undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad (2006). ''Early Mystics in Turkish Literature''. Translated by Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff. London: Routledge. p. 149. {{ISBN|0415366860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shah [[Ismail I]] (d.1524), the founder of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran, was also deeply influenced by the [[Persian literature|Persian literary tradition]], particularly by the ''Shahnameh'', which probably explains the fact that he named all of his sons after ''Shahnameh'' characters. Dickson and Welch suggest that Ismail's ''Shāhnāmaye Shāhī'' was intended as a present to the young [[Tahmasp I|Tahmāsp]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, M.B.; and Welch, S.C. (1981). ''The Houghton Shahnameh''. ''Volume I''. Cambridge, MA and London. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating [[Muhammad Shaybani|Muhammad Shaybāni]]'s [[Uzbeks]], Ismāil asked [[Hatefi (poet)|Hātefī]], a famous poet from [[Ghor Province|Jam (Khorasan)]], to write a ''Shahnameh''-like epic about his victories and his newly established dynasty. Although the epic was left unfinished, it was an example of ''[[mathnawi]]s'' in the heroic style of the ''Shahnameh'' written later on for the Safavid kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Savory|first=R. M|title=Safavids|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shahnameh''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s influence has extended beyond the Persian sphere. Professor Victoria Arakelova of Yerevan University states:

{{quote|During the ten centuries passed after Firdausi composed his monumental work, heroic legends and stories of Shahnameh have remained the main source of the storytelling for the peoples of this region: Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds, Gurans, Talishis, Armenians, Georgians, North Caucasian peoples, etc.&lt;ref name="farhangiran1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Arakelova|first=Victoria|title=Shahnameh in the Kurdish and Armenian Oral Tradition (abridged)|url=http://www.azargoshnasp.net/famous/ferdowsi/shahkurdarmen.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== On Georgian identity ===

[[File:Georgian manuscript (Shahname).jpg|thumb|Georgian manuscript of Shahnameh written in the [[Georgian script]].]]

[[Jamshid Giunashvili|Jamshid Sh. Giunashvili]] remarks on the connection of [[Georgian culture]] with that of ''Shahnameh'':

{{quote|The names of many ''Šāh-nāma'' heroes, such as [[Rostam|Rostom-i]], Thehmine, [[Sām|Sam-i]], or [[Zal|Zaal-i]], are found in 11th- and 12th-century Georgian literature. They are indirect evidence for an Old Georgian translation of the ''Šāh-nāma'' that is no longer extant. ...}}

{{quote|The ''Šāh-nāma'' was translated, not only to satisfy the literary and aesthetic needs of readers and listeners, but also to inspire the young with the spirit of heroism and Georgian patriotism. Georgian ideology, customs, and worldview often informed these translations because they were oriented toward Georgian poetic culture. Conversely, Georgians consider these translations works of their native literature. Georgian versions of the ''Šāh-nāma'' are quite popular, and the stories of [[Rostam and Sohrab|Rostam and Sohrāb]], or [[Bijan and Manijeh|Bījan and Maniža]] became part of Georgian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giunshvili|first=Jamshid Sh.|title=Šāh-nāma Translations ii.

Farmanfarmaian in the ''[[Journal of Persianate Studies]]'':

{{quote|Distinguished scholars of Persian such as Gvakharia and Todua are well aware that the inspiration derived from the Persian classics of the ninth to the twelfth centuries produced a ‘cultural synthesis’ which saw, in the earliest stages of written secular literature in Georgia, the resumption of literary contacts with Iran, “much stronger than before” (Gvakharia, 2001, p. 481). Ferdowsi’s ''Shahnama'' was a never-ending source of inspiration, not only for high literature, but for folklore as well. “Almost every page of Georgian literary works and chronicles [...] contains names of Iranian heroes borrowed from the ''Shahnama''” (ibid). Ferdowsi, together with [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezāmi]], may have left the most enduring imprint on Georgian literature (...){{sfn|Farmanfarmaian|2009|page=24}}}}

=== On Turkic identity ===
Despite some popular belief, the [[Turan]]ians of ''Shahnameh'' (whose sources are based on [[Avesta]] and [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] texts) have no relationship with the ethno-linguistic group [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] today.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"/&gt; The Turanians of ''Shahnameh'' are an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]] representing Iranian nomads of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s and have no relationship to the culture of the Turks.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth, C.E.

Hence as Kowalski has pointed out, a Turkologist seeking for information in the Shahnama on the primitive culture of the Turks would definitely be disappointed. "&lt;/ref&gt; Turan, which is the Persian name for the areas of Central Asia beyond the Oxus up to the 7th century (where the story of the ''Shahnameh'' ends), was generally an Iranian-speaking land.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, C.E.

"Central Asia in the early seventh century, was ethnically, still largely an Iranian land whose people used various Middle Iranian languages."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Frye]], "The extent of influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own ancient history as well as that of [[Iran]]...  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the [[Qarakhanid]] dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=The Heritage of Persia: The Pre-Islamic History of One of the World's Great Civilizations|year=1963|publisher=World Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turks, as an ethno-linguistic group, have been influenced by the ''Shahnameh'' since advent of [[Saljuqs]].&lt;ref name="IranicaT"&gt;{{cite web|last=Özgüdenli|first=Osman G.|title=Šāh-nāma Translations i.

"In fact as much as early rulers felt themselves to be Turks, they connected their Turkish origin not with Turkish tribal history but rather with the Turan of Shahnameh: in the second generation their children bear the name of Firdosi’s heroes, and their Turkish lineage is invariably traced back to Afrasiyab—whether we read Barani in the fourteenth century or the Urdu master poet Ghalib in the nineteenth century. The poets, and through them probably most of the educated class, felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of Iranianism. The imagery of poetry remained exclusively Persian. "&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in India, through the ''Shahnameh'', they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of [[Iranianism]].&lt;ref name="Schimmel"/&gt;

Ferdowsi concludes the ''Shahnameh'' by writing:

{{quote|
I've reached the end of this great history&lt;br/&gt;
And all the land will talk of me:&lt;br/&gt;
I shall not die, these seeds I've sown will save&lt;br/&gt;
My name and reputation from the grave,&lt;br/&gt;
And men of sense and wisdom will proclaim&lt;br/&gt;
When I have gone, my praises and my fame.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdowsi (2006). ''Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings''. Translated by Dick Davis. New York: Viking. {{ISBN|0670034851}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another translation of by Reza Jamshidi Safa: 
{{quote|
Much I have suffered in these thirty years,&lt;br/&gt;
I have revived the Ajam with my verse.&lt;br/&gt;
I will not die then alive in the world,&lt;br/&gt;
For I have spread the seed of the word.&lt;br/&gt;
Whoever has sense, path and faith,&lt;br/&gt;
After my death will send me praise.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdowsi's poet, (2010). ''Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings''. Translated by Reza Jamshidi Safa. Tehran, Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This prediction of Ferdowsi has come true and many Persian literary figures, historians and biographers have praised him and the ''Shahnameh''.  The ''Shahnameh'' is considered by many to be the most important piece of work in [[Persian literature]].

Western writers have also praised the ''Shahnameh'' and Persian literature in general. Persian literature has been considered by such thinkers as [[Goethe]] as one of the four main bodies of world literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia|year=2002|editor1-first=Karen|editor1-last=Christensen|editor2-first=David|editor2-last=Levinson|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=0684806177|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe was inspired by Persian literature, which moved him to write his ''[[West–östlicher Divan|West-Eastern Divan]]''. Goethe wrote:

{{quote|When we turn our attention to a peaceful, civilized people, the Persians, we must—since it was actually their poetry that inspired this work—go back to the earliest period to be able to understand more recent times. It will always seem strange to the historians that no matter how many times a country has been conquered, subjugated and even destroyed by enemies, there is always a certain national core preserved in its character, and before you know it, there re-emerges a long-familiar native phenomenon.  In this sense, it would be pleasant to learn about the most ancient Persians and quickly follow them up to the present day at an all the more free and steady pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azodi|first=Wiesehöfer|title=Ancient Persia: From 550 BC to 650 AD|date=August 18, 2001|publisher=I.

=== Biographies ===
''Sargozasht-Nameh'' or biography of important poets and writers has long been a Persian tradition. Some of the biographies of Ferdowsi are now considered apocryphal, nevertheless this shows the important impact he had in the Persian world. Among the famous biographies are:&lt;ref name="Nurian 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nurian|first=Mahdi|title=Afarin Ferdowsi az Zaban Pishinian|journal=Hasti Magazine|year=1993|volume='''4'''|trans-title=Praises of Ferdowsi from the Tongue of the Ancients|publisher=Bahman Publishers|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bizhan Shahnameh Met 1970.301.42 n01.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Bizhane receives an invitation through Manizheh's nurse]]

Famous poets of [[Persia]] and the Persian tradition have praised and eulogized Ferdowsi.  Many of them were heavily influenced by his writing and used his genre and stories to develop their own Persian epics, stories and poems:&lt;ref name="Nurian 1993"/&gt;

* [[Anvari]] remarked about the eloquence of the ''Shahnameh'', "He was not just a Teacher and we his students. He was like a God and we are his slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "آفرين بر روان فردوسی / آن همايون نهاد و فرخنده / او نه استاد بود و ما شاگرد / او خداوند بود و ما بنده"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Asadi Tusi]] was born in the same city as Ferdowsi. His ''Garshaspnama'' was inspired by the ''Shahnameh'' as he attests in the introduction. He praises Ferdowsi in the introduction&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "که فردوسی طوسی پاک مغز / بدادست داد سخنهای نغز / به شهنامه گیتی بیاراستست / بدان نامه نام نکو خواستست"&lt;/ref&gt; and considers Ferdowsi the greatest poet of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "که از پیش گویندگان برد گوی"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Masud Sa'd Salman|Masud Sa'ad Salman]] showed the influence of the ''Shahnameh'' only 80 years after its composition by reciting its poems in the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid]] court of India.
* [[Uthman Mukhetari|Othman Mokhtari]], another poet at the Ghaznavid court of India, remarked, "Alive is Rustam through the epic of Ferdowsi, else there would not be a trace of him in this World".&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "زنده رستم به شعر فردوسی است / ور نه زو در جهان نشانه کجاست؟"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sanai]] believed that the foundation of poetry was really established by Ferdowsi.&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "چه نکو گفت آن بزرگ استاد / که وی افکند نظم را بنیاد"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]] was influenced greatly by Ferdowsi and three of his five "treasures" had to do with pre-Islamic Persia.  His ''Khosro-o-Shirin'', ''[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|Haft Peykar]]'' and ''Eskandar-nameh'' used the ''Shahnameh'' as a major source. Nizami remarks that Ferdowsi is "the wise sage of Tus" who beautified and decorated words like a new bride.&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "سخن گوی دانای پیشین طوسکه آراست روی سخن چون عروس"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Khaghani]], the court poet of the [[Shirvanshah]], wrote of Ferdowsi: {{quote|"The candle of the wise in this darkness of sorrow,&lt;br/&gt;The pure words of Ferdowsi of the Tusi are such,&lt;br/&gt;His pure sense is an angelic birth,&lt;br/&gt;Angelic born is anyone who's like Ferdowsi."&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "شمع جمع هوشمندان است در دیجور غم / نکته ای کز خاطر فردوسی طوسی بود / زادگاه طبع پاکش جملگی حوراوش اند / زاده حوراوش بود چون مرد فردوسی بود"&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] wrote about the poetry of Ferdowsi: "Open eyes and through the sweet poetry see the heavenly eden of Ferdowsi."&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "باز کن چشم و ز شعر چون شکر / در بهشت عدن فردوسی نگر"&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a famous poem, [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'adi]] wrote: {{quote|"How sweetly has conveyed the pure-natured Ferdowsi,&lt;br/&gt;May blessing be upon his pure resting place,&lt;br/&gt;Do not harass the ant that's dragging a seed,&lt;br/&gt;because it has life and sweet life is dear."&lt;ref&gt;Persian: "چه خوش گفت فردوسی پاکزاد / که رحمت بر آن تربت پاک باد / میازار موری که دانه کش است / که جان دارد و جان شیرین خوش است"&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the ''Baharestan'', [[Jami]] wrote, "He came from Tus and his excellence, renown and perfection are well known. Yes, what need is there of the panegyrics of others to that man who has composed verses as those of the Shah-nameh?"

Many other poets, e.g. [[Hafez]], [[Rumi]] and other mystical poets, have used imageries of ''Shahnameh'' heroes in their poetry.

=== Persian historiography ===

The ''Shahnameh''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s impact on Persian historiography was immediate and some historians decorated their books with the verses of Shahnameh. Below is sample of ten important historians who have praised the ''Shahnameh'' and Ferdowsi:&lt;ref name="Nurian 1993"/&gt;

# The unknown writer of the ''Tarikh Sistan'' ("History of [[Sistan]]") written around 1053
# The unknown writer of ''[[Majmal al-tawarikh|Majmal al-Tawarikh wa Al-Qasas]]'' (c. 1126)
# Mohammad Ali Ravandi, the writer of the ''Rahat al-Sodur wa Ayat al-Sorur'' (c. 1206)
# [[Ibn Bibi]], the writer of the history book, ''Al-Awamir al-'Alaiyah'', written during the era of [[Kayqubad I|'Ala ad-din KayGhobad]]
# Ibn Esfandyar, the writer of the ''Tarikh-e Tabarestan''
# [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Muhammad Juwayni]], the early historian of the Mongol era in the ''Tarikh-e Jahan Gushay'' ([[Ilkhanid]] era)
# [[Hamdollah Mostowfi|Hamdollah Mostowfi Qazwini]] also paid much attention to the ''Shahnameh'' and wrote the ''[[Zafarnamah (Mustawfi)|Zafarnamah]]'' based on the same style in the Ilkhanid era
# [[Hafiz-i Abru|Hafez-e Abru]] (1430) in the ''Majma' al-Tawarikh''
# [[Muhammad Khwandamir|Khwand Mir]] in the ''[[Habib al-Siyar|Habab al-Siyar]]'' (c. 1523) praised Ferdowsi and gave an extensive biography on Ferdowsi
# The Arab historian [[Ibn Athir]] remarks in his book, ''[[The Complete History|Al-Kamil]]'', that, "If we name it the Quran of 'Ajam, we have not said something in vain.  If a poet writes poetry and the poems have many verses, or if someone writes many compositions, it will always be the case that some of their writings might not be excellent.  But in the case of Shahnameh, despite having more than 40 thousand couplets, all its verses are excellent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qudsdaily.com/archive/1384/html/2/1384-02-25/page2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025851/http://www.qudsdaily.com/archive/1384/html/2/1384-02-25/page2.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Timurids]] continued the tradition of manuscript production.  For them, it was considered ''de rigueur'' for the members of the family to have personal copies of the epic poem.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Marianna Shreve Simpson|title=Šāh-nāma iv. Illustrations|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sah-nama-iv-illustrations|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, three of [[Timur]]’s grandsons—[[Baysonqor|Bāysonḡor]], [[Sultan Ibrahim (Timurid)|Ebrāhim Solṭān]], and Moḥammad Juki—each commissioned such a volume.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt; Among these, the [[Baysonghor Shahnameh]] commissioned by [[Baysonqor|Ḡīāṯ-al-Dīn Bāysonḡor]] is one of the most voluminous and artistic ''Shahnameh'' manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Motlagh|first=Khaleghi|title=Bāysonḡorī Šāh-nāma|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baysongori-sah-nama|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|author2=T. Lentz |date=15 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of illustrated ''Shahnameh'' manuscripts in the 15th century remained vigorous&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt; during the [[Kara Koyunlu|Qarā-Qoyunlu]] or Black Sheep (1380–1468) and [[Aq Qoyunlu|Āq Qoyunlu]] or White Sheep (1378–1508) Turkman dynasties.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt; Many of the extant illustrated copies, with more than seventy or more paintings, are attributable to [[Tabriz]], [[Shiraz]], and [[Baghdad]] beginning in about the 1450s–60s and continuing to the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt;

The [[Safavid]] era saw a resurgence of ''Shahnameh'' productions.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt; Shah [[Ismail I]] used the epic for propaganda purposes: as a gesture of Persian patriotism, as a celebration of renewed Persian rule, and as a reassertion of Persian royal authority.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt; The Safavids commissioned elaborate copies of the ''Shahnameh'' to support their legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford History of Islam|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195107993|editor=John L.

In honour of the ''Shahnameh''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s millennial anniversary, in 2010 the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge hosted a major exhibition, called "Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi’s ''Shahnameh''", which ran from September 2010 to January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition: Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi’s ''Shahnameh''|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/shahnameh/|work=The Fitzwilliam Museum|accessdate=29 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411014418/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/shahnameh/|archivedate=11 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arthur M.

== Modern editions ==

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Single Page with an Illustration from a Shahnamah.jpg|220px|thumb|right|An illustration from the ''Shahnameh'']]

=== Scholarly editions ===
Scholarly editions have been prepared of the ''Shahnameh''. An early edition was prepared in 1829 in [[India]] by T. Macan. It was based on a comparison of 17 manuscript copies. Between 1838 and 1878, an edition appeared in [[Paris]] by [[French people|French]] scholar J. Mohl, which was based on a comparison of 30 manuscripts. Both editions lacked critical apparatuses and were based on secondary manuscripts dated after the 15th century; much later than the original work. Between 1877 and 1884, the [[Germans|German]] scholar J. A. Vullers prepared a synthesized text of the Macan and Mohl editions, but only three of its expected nine volumes were published. The Vullers edition was later completed in Tehran by the Iranian scholars S. Nafisi, Iqbal, and M. Minowi for the millennial jubilee of Ferdowsi, held between 1934 and 1936.

The first modern critical edition of the ''Shahnameh'' was prepared by a [[Russian language|Russian]] team led by E. E. Bertels, using the oldest known manuscripts at the time, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, with heavy reliance on the 1276 manuscript from the [[British Museum]] and the 1333 Leningrad manuscript, the latter of which has now been considered a secondary manuscript. In addition, two other manuscripts used in this edition have been so demoted. It was published in [[Moscow]] by the Institute of Oriental Studies of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] in nine volumes between 1960 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osmanov|first=M. N. O.|title=Ferdowsi, Abul Qasim|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Abul+Qasim+Ferdowsi|work=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the Moscow edition was the standard text. In 1977, an early 1217 manuscript was rediscovered in Florence. The 1217 Florence manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the ''Shahnameh'', predating the Moghul invasion and the following destruction of important libraries and manuscript collections. Using it as the chief text, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh began the preparation of a new critical edition in 1990. The number of manuscripts that were consulted during the preparation of Khaleghi-Motlagh edition goes beyond anything attempted by the Moscow team. The critical apparatus is extensive and a large number of variants for many parts of the poem were recorded. The last volume was published in 2008, bringing the eight-volume enterprise to a completion. According to [[Dick Davis (translator)|Dick Davis]], professor of Persian at Ohio State University, it is "by far the best edition of the ''Shahnameh'' available, and it is surely likely to remain such for a very long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Dick|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|title=Review: The Shahnameh by Abul-Qasem Ferdowsi, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh|date=Aug 1995|volume='''27'''|issue=3|pages=393–395|publisher=Cambridge University Press|jstor=176284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabic translation ===

The only known Arabic translation of the Shahnameh was done in c. 1220 by [[Bondari Esfahani|al-Fath bin Ali al-Bondari]], a Persian scholar from [[Isfahan]] and at the request of the [[Ayyubid]] ruler of Damascus [[Al-Mu'azzam Isa]]. The translation is ''Nathr'' (unrhyming) and was largely forgotten until it was republished in full in 1932 in Egypt, by historian [[Abdelwahhab Azzam]]. This modern edition was based on incomplete and largely imprecise fragmented copies found in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Paris, Astana, Cairo and Berlin. The latter had the most complete, least inaccurate and well-preserved Arabic version of the original translation by al-Bondari.

=== English translations ===

There have been a number of English translations, almost all abridged. [[James Atkinson (Persian scholar)|James Atkinson]] of the [[East India Company]]'s medical service undertook a translation into English in his 1832 publication for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland, now part of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]].  Between 1905 and 1925, the brothers Arthur and Edmond Warner published a translation of the complete work in nine volumes, now out of print.  There are also modern incomplete translations of the ''Shahnameh'': [[Reuben Levy]]'s 1967 prose version (later revised by Amin Banani), and another by Dick Davis in a mixture of poetry and prose which appeared in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sah-nama-translations-iii-English |title=Šāh-Nāma Translations iii. Into English |last1=Loloi |first1=Parvin |date=2014 |website=Encyclopedia Iranica |access-date=8 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a new English translation of the book in prose by [[Ahmad Sadri]] was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyden|first1=Jacki|title='Heart' Of Iranian Identity Reimagined For A New Generation|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/25/214831942/heart-of-iranian-identity-reimagined-for-a-new-generation|website=NPR|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsis|The Parsis]], Zoroastrians, whose ancestors had migrated to India in the 8th or 10th century so they could continue practice of their religion in peace, have also kept the ''Shahnameh'' traditions alive. Dr. Bahman Sohrabji Surti, assisted by Marzban Giara, published between 1986 and 1988 the first detailed and complete translation of the ''Shahnameh'' from the original Persian verse into English prose, in seven volumes. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Other languages ===
There are various translations in French and German.  An [[Italian language|Italian]] translation has been published in 8 volumes by [[Italo Pizzi]] with the title: ''Il libro dei re.'' Poema epico recato dal persiano in versi italiani da Italo Pizzi, 8 voll., Torino, Vincenzo Bona, 1886-88 (later reissued in 2 volumes with a compendium, from [[UTET]], [[Turin]], 1915).

Dastur Faramroz Kutar and his brother Ervad Mahiyar Kutar translated the Shahnameh into [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] verse and prose and published 10 volumes between 1914 and 1918.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

A Spanish translation has been published in 2 volumes by the Islamic Research Institute of the Tehran Branch of McGill University.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''SloTop50''' is the official [[Slovenia]]n singles chart provider founded in 2013. It presents weekly, monthly and yearly singles charts. SAZAS (The association of composers and authors for protection of copyright of Slovenia) follows 61 various radio stations across Slovenia. It publishes weekly charts once a week, every Sunday. Chart contain data generated by the SloTop50 system according to any song played during the period starting the previous Monday morning at time 00:00:00 and ending Sunday night at 23:59:59.

The first number one song of the SloTop50 was "Srečno novo leto" by Rok'n'Band, on 6 January 2013. As of the issue for the week ending on 2 December 2018, the SloTop50 has had 72 different number one hits in 309 weeks. The current number one is "[[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|In My Mind]]" by [[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|Dynoro ft. Gigi D'Agostino]].

== History ==

From 1997-2012 year-end singles chart existed for Slovenian artists only. Sazas measured songs that were most played on Slovenian radio stations. That was a different kind of measuring, no weekly charts, just the total number of repeats at the end of the year. In 2013 a new technology by international standards was introduced, measuring both Slovenian and international music with weekly singles charts.

== Charts published ==

Presently three charts are published:
*'''SloTop50 Singles''' - weekly
*'''SloTop50 Singles''' - monthly
*'''SloTop50 Singles''' - yearly

== Song of the year ==
In three categories: year-end number-one song, year-end best charted domestic song and number-one (pre)xmas week song.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11545">'''Structural induction''' is a [[proof method]] that is used in [[mathematical logic]] (e.g., in the proof of [[Ultraproduct#Łoś' theorem|Łoś' theorem]]), [[computer science]], [[graph theory]], and some other mathematical fields.  It is a generalization of [[mathematical induction|mathematical induction over natural numbers]], and can be further generalized to arbitrary [[Noetherian induction]].  '''Structural recursion''' is a [[recursion]] method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary [[mathematical induction]].

Structural induction is used to prove that some proposition ''P''(''x'') holds [[for all]] ''x'' of some sort of [[recursive definition|recursively defined]] structure, such as
[[First-order logic#Formulas|formulas]], [[List (computer science)|list]]s, or [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]s.  A [[well-founded]] [[partial order]] is defined on the structures ("subformula" for formulas, "sublist" for lists, and "subtree" for trees).  The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the [[minimal element|minimal]] structures, and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure ''S'', then it must hold for ''S'' also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of [[well-founded induction]], which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all ''x''.)

A structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: "base cases" handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion.  Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out.  The ''length'' and ++ functions in the example below are structurally recursive.

For example, if the structures are lists, one usually introduces the partial order '&lt;' in which ''L'' &lt; ''M'' whenever list ''L'' is the tail of list ''M''.  Under this ordering, the empty list [] is the unique minimal element.  A structural induction proof of some proposition {{math|''P''(''l'')}} then consists of two parts:  A proof that ''P''([]) is true, and a proof that if ''P''(''L'') is true for some list ''L'', and if ''L'' is the tail of list ''M'', then ''P''(''M'') must also be true.

Eventually, there may exist more than one base case, and/or more than one inductive case, depending on how the function or structure was constructed. In those cases, a structural induction proof of some proposition {{math|''P''(''l'')}} then consists of: 
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-alpha

|a proof that ''P''(''BC'') is true for each base case ''BC'', and 
|a proof that if {{math|''P''(''I'')}} is true for some instance {{mvar|I}}, and ''M'' can be obtained from {{mvar|I}} by applying any one recursive rule once, then ''P''(''M'') must also be true.}}

==Examples==

[[File:Waldburg Ahnentafel.jpg|thumb|Ancient ancestor tree, showing 31 persons in 5 generations.]]
An [[family tree|ancestor tree]] is a commonly known data structure, showing the parents, grandparents, etc. of a person as far as known (see picture for an example). It is recursively defined:
* in the simplest case, an ancestor tree shows just one person (if nothing is known about their parents);
* alternatively, an ancestor tree shows one person and, connected by branches, the two ancestor subtrees of their parents (using for brevity of proof the simplifying assumption that if one of them is known, both are).

As an example, the property "An ancestor tree extending over ''g'' generations shows at most {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} persons" can be proven by structural induction as follows:
* In the simplest case, the tree shows just one person and hence one generation; the property is true for such a tree, since {{math|1 ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}.
* Alternatively, the tree shows one person and their parents' trees. Since each of the latter is a substructure of the whole tree, it can be assumed to satisfy the property to be proven (a.k.a. the ''induction hypothesis''). That is, {{math|''p'' ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} and {{math|''q'' ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} can be assumed, where ''g'' and ''h'' denotes the number of generations the father's and the mother's subtree extends over, respectively, and ''p'' and ''q'' denote the numbers of persons they show.
** In case {{math|''g''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''h''}}, the whole tree extends over {{math|1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''}} generations and shows {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} persons, and {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤ (2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) + (2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;1+''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property.
** In case {{math|1=''h''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''g''}}, the whole tree extends over {{math|1=1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''}} generations and shows {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} persons by similar reasoning, i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property in this case also.
Hence, by structural induction, each ancestor tree satisfies the property.

As another, more formal example, consider the following property of lists:

     length (L ++ M) = length L + length M          [EQ]

Here ++ denotes the list concatenation operation, and L and M are lists.

In order to prove this, we need definitions for length and for the concatenation operation. Let (h:t) denote a list whose head (first element) is ''h'' and whose tail (list of remaining elements) is ''t'', and let [] denote the empty list. The definitions for length and the concatenation operation are:

     length []     = 0                  [LEN1]
     length (h:t)  = 1 + length t       [LEN2]

     []    ++ list = list               [APP1]
     (h:t) ++ list = h : (t ++ list)    [APP2]

Our proposition {{math|1=''P''(''l'')}} is that  EQ is true for all lists ''M'' when ''L'' is {{mvar|l}}.  We want to show that {{math|1=''P''(''l'')}} is true for all lists {{mvar|l}}.    We will prove this by structural induction on lists.

First we will prove that ''P''([]) is true; that is, EQ is true for all lists ''M'' when ''L'' happens to be the empty list []. Consider EQ:

       length (L ++ M)  = length ([] ++ M)
                        = length M                     (by APP1)
                        = 0 + length M
                        = length [] + length M         (by LEN1)
                        = length L  + length M

So this part of the theorem is proved; EQ is true for all ''M'', when ''L'' is [], because the left-hand side and the right-hand side  are equal.

Next, consider any nonempty list {{mvar|I}}. Since {{mvar|I}} is nonempty, it has a head item, x, and a tail list, xs, so we can express it as (x:xs).  The induction hypothesis is that EQ is true for all values of ''M'' when ''L'' is ''xs'':

     length (xs ++ M) = length xs + length M    (hypothesis)

We would like to show that if this is the case, then EQ is also true for all values of ''M'' when {{math|1=''L'' = ''I''}} = (x:xs). We proceed as before:

     length L  + length M      = length (x:xs) + length M
                               = 1 + length xs + length M     (by LEN2)
                               = 1 + length (xs ++ M)         (by hypothesis)
                               = length (x: (xs ++ M))        (by LEN2)
                               = length ((x:xs) ++ M)         (by APP2)
                               = length (L ++ M)

Thus, from structural induction, we obtain that P(L) is true for all lists L.

==Well-ordering==

Just as standard [[mathematical induction]] is equivalent to the [[well-ordering principle]], structural induction is also equivalent to a well-ordering principle.  If the set of all structures of a certain kind admits a well-founded partial order, then every nonempty subset must have a minimal element.  (This is the definition of "[[well-founded]]".)  The significance of the lemma in this context is that it allows us to deduce that if there are any counterexamples to the theorem we want to prove, then there must be a minimal counterexample.  If we can show the existence of the minimal counterexample implies an even smaller counterexample, we have a contradiction (since the minimal counterexample isn't minimal) and so the set of counterexamples must be empty.

As an example of this type of argument, consider the set of all [[binary tree]]s.  We will show that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of interior nodes.  Suppose there is a counterexample; then there must exist one with the minimal possible number of interior nodes.  This counterexample, ''C'', has ''n'' interior nodes and {{mvar|l}} leaves, where {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≠&amp;nbsp;''l''}}.   Moreover, ''C'' must be nontrivial, because the trivial tree has {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|1=''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}} and is therefore not a counterexample. ''C'' therefore has at least one leaf whose parent node is an interior node.  Delete this leaf and its parent from the tree, promoting the leaf's sibling node to the position formerly occupied by its parent.  This  reduces both ''n'' and {{mvar|l}} by 1, so the new tree also has {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≠&amp;nbsp;''l''}} and is therefore a smaller counterexample.  But by hypothesis, ''C'' was already the smallest counterexample; therefore, the supposition that there were any counterexamples to begin with must have been false.  The  partial ordering implied by 'smaller' here is the one that says that ''S'' &lt; ''T'' whenever ''S'' has fewer nodes than ''T''.

The garden materials were shipped to [[Staten Island]] in the spring of 1998 and the garden opened in June 1999.  A team of 40 Chinese artists and artisans from [[Suzhou]] constructed the garden.

[[File:New York Chinese Scholar's Garden.JPG|thumb|A view overlooking the koi pond within the New York Chinese Scholar's Garden in Staten Island.]]

The president of the botanical garden, Frances Paulo Huber, recognized the need for an authentic [[Chinese garden]] in 1984.  The garden was finally constructed with the support of many partners, including the Staten Island Botanical Garden, [[New York City|the City of New York]], the Landscape Architecture Company of China, the Metropolitan Chinese American Community, various private foundations, and hundreds of individuals and corporate donors.  After a long series of collaborations a contract was signed with the Landscape Architecture Corporation of China.  Mr. Zou Gongwu was appointed as chief project designer.

==Design==
The garden is designed with elegance (''ya'', 雅) in mind.  The garden is traditionally entered through a narrow passage where meditation takes place, prior to entering the main garden.  The design of the garden produces harmony through its views and concepts.  The garden creates an infinite space within an enclosed area.

*The ''borrowed view'' extends space beyond the border of the garden.
*The ''hidden view'' creates suspense and excitement as one moves deeper into the garden.
*The ''opposite view'' is framed by a moon gate or floral window.

==Elements==
[[Image:Staten Island Chinese Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Chinese Scholar's Garden]]

*''Wood'' - Nails or glue are not used in a Chinese garden.  Wooden elements are joined together using traditional Chinese construction techniques.
*''Rocks'' - In Chinese literature, rocks are described as the "bones of the earth."
*''Water'' - The garden contains three ponds and one waterfall.  Water is thought of as the arteries of the world.
*''Plantings'' - China has contributed the rose, lilac, daphne, species of rhododendron, and the peony to the rest of the world.  Trees, shrubs, and flowers are selected for shape, seasonal character, and symbolic meaning.
*''Furniture'' - The furniture of the garden is called the "internal organs."
*''Walls'' - Walls are strategically placed in the garden for design purposes.
*''Walkways'' - The curvature of the walkways offer many views and angles.
*''Pavilions'' - There are two pavilion in the garden.  One is for the scholar's study and the other provides visual access to various other scenes.
*''Xie'' - A Xie is a building one half hovering over a lake.  The designs makes it seem that the building is floating in the water.
*''Bridge'' - Bridges are often curvy, providing visitors a better view of the surroundings.
*''Painting and Calligraphy'' - Paintings and calligraphy represent the garden owner's knowledge of literature and art.

'''USAction''' was a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] federation of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] community organizing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamieson|first1=Dave|title=Fred Azcarate Leaves AFL-CIO To Head Community Organizing Network USAction|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/16/fred-azcarate-afl-cio-us-action_n_3282811.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1999. Its [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] counterpart was the '''USAction Education Fund'''.

In September 2007, '''[[TrueMajority]]''' and its related organization '''TrueMajorityACTION''' merged with USAction.&lt;ref&gt;USAction website, "History and Achievements," {{cite web |url=http://usaction.org/about-us/history-achievements/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630182438/http://usaction.org/about-us/history-achievements/ |archivedate=2017-06-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In 2008, USAction joined [[Health Care for America Now]], a coalition of labor unions and liberal advocacy groups pushing for affordable health care and stricter regulation of the health insurance industry. USAction committed at least $500,000 to the group's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Will|title=Profile: Health Care for America Now|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94482532|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=NPR|date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, USAction launched a campaign to "Dog the Blue Dogs." The [[Blue Dog Coalition]] is a caucus of United States Congressional Representatives from the Democratic Party who identify themselves as moderates and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ben|title='Common Purpose'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0409/Common_Purpose.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=Politico|date=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, USAction was part of a coalition of liberal advocacy groups that announced that companies making direct corporate contributions to influence elections would face consumer boycotts, campaigns to divest pension fund money, stockholder lawsuits, actions at stockholder meetings and widespread social media exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Froomkin|first1=Dan|title=Secret Campaign Spending Under Attack By Reform Groups|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/campaign-spending-secret-donations-ceos_n_1339491.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
