'''''101 Philosophy Problems''''' (1999) is a philosophy book for a general audiences by [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] published by Routledge.

==Format and summary==
The format of the book was unique and later copied by other authors. For example, in [[Julian Baggini]]'s ''The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten'' it was observed that the books "format is essentially the same as that first successfully introduced by Martin Cohen's ''101 Philosophy Problems''."&lt;ref&gt;Law, Stephen. "Saturday Review: Science &amp; philosophy: Food for thought: Stephen Law on moral dilemmas: The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten, and Ninety-Nine Other Thought Experiments by [[Julian Baggini]] 256pp, Granta, pounds 14.99". ''The Guardian'' [London (UK)] 03 Sep 2005: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' (London),&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gensler, ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', February 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Gensler, Professor of philosophy, at John Carroll University, Cleveland, describes the book:

:"The book has 101 humorous little stories, each with a philosophical  problem (not however, necessarily, the usual [[Unsolved problems in philosophy]]). For example, problem 54 is about Mr Megasoft, who dies leaving  his fortune to his favourite computer. Megasoft's children take the matter to court, contending that the computer cannot think and so cannot inherit money. Mr Megasoft's lawyers claim that the computer can think. But on what grounds can we say that computers can or cannot think?"

Other stories deal with [[paradoxes]], ethics, aesthetics, perception, time, God, physics, and knowledge and include  problems from Zeno, Descartes, Russell, Nelson Goodman, Edmund Gettier and others. The  problems are  followed by a discussion section  and a glossary.

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[The Philosopher]]'', Dr. Zenon Stavrinides says that:

:"Both in regard to its structure and the style in which it is written, it is very unconventional. The first part of the book consists of a series of very short stories or narrative texts, grouped by subject-matter, setting out problems or puzzles of philosophical interest. Some of these problems are well-known in philosophical literature, e.g. the [[Epimenides paradox|paradox of Epimenides the Cretan]], who said: 'All Cretans are liars'. In the second part of the book, entitled 'Discussions', Cohen provides explanations and analyses of the issues raised by each of the problems, with some references to the treatment offered by particular historical philosophers. These discussions are intelligent and balanced, if (in most cases at least) inevitably inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/reviews/202revs.htm |title=Philosophy Problems, official website |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031045351/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/reviews/202revs.htm |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1038">'''Antoine-François Botot''', known as '''Dangeville''' (26 May 1681 - c.1737) was a French dancing master, dancer and ballet teacher.

He was born in Paris. His brother was the actor [[Charles Botot Dangeville]]. He made his début at the [[Académie royale de musique]] in 1701 and retired in 1748, although he remained a member of the [[Académie royale de danse]] until his death. Campardon lists Dangeville's roles&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Émile Campardon, ''L'Académie royale de musique au xviiie siècle'', Paris, Berger-Levrault, 1884, vol. I, pp. 162-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married the actress [[Anne-Catherine Desmares]] in 1707, with whom he had two sons and a daughter, who all became actors - the most notable was the daughter [[Marie-Anne Botot Dangeville]].

'''Apple University''' is a [[training]] facility of [[Apple Inc.]], located in [[Cupertino, California]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by Apple in the various aspects of Apple's technology and corporate culture.

==History==
[[Steve Jobs]] established Apple University in 2008 as a way to inculcate employees into Apple’s business culture and educate them about its history, particularly as the company grew. The program was devised by Joel Podolny, then the dean of Yale School of Management. Jobs selected him when the program was founded, and Podolny remains head of the program and effectively serves as dean of the university. He also is a vice president at Apple.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses are not required, only recommended. Employees sign up for courses tailored to their positions and backgrounds on an internal website available only to Apple staff members.

It is highly secretive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/11/apple-university-employees-staff-steve-jobs|title=Apple University: where employees are not born, but made|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely written about.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Employees are strongly discouraged from talking about the company in general, including Apple University. No pictures of the classrooms have surfaced publicly.

Apple has strenuously pursued the vision that function and beauty come from simplicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-university-preaches-mantra-of-simplicity-to-employees/|title=Apple University preaches mantra of simplicity to employees|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers in its internal training program sometimes point to a collection of Picasso lithographs that illustrate the drive to boil down ideas to their most essential components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/10/5989837/at-apple-university-studying-picasso-helps-with-product-design|title=At Apple University, studying Picasso helps with product design|author=Sam Byford|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff and instructors==
The full-time members of the faculty design and teach the courses. Faculty members include professors from universities like [[Yale]]; [[Harvard]]; the [[University of California-Berkeley]]; [[Stanford]]; and [[M.I.T.]] Some of the faculty continue to hold positions at their universities while also working for Apple.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/02/13/apple-university-hires-another-high-profile-academic/|title=Apple University hires another high-profile academic|work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructors include:
*[[Tim Cook]], CEO.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/why-apple-university-matters-more-than-ever|title=Why Apple University Matters More Than Ever|author=Peter Burrows|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joel Podolny]], formerly the dean of Yale School of Management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stxavier.org/page.cfm?p=1&amp;newsid=2947|title=The Jesuit High School in Cincinnati: Keeper of the Apple Culture|work=stxavier.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Richard S. Tedlow|Richard Tedlow]], a Harvard University business historian.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;
*Randy Nelson who came from the animation studios Pixar&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html&lt;/ref&gt; and DreamWorks Animation
*[[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a Stanford professor&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
*Morten Hansen, of Berkeley &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Courses==
Some of the courses teach case studies about important business decisions that Apple made. These strategic decisions include the one to make the iPod and its iTunes software compatible with Microsoft’s Windows system. This was a topic of fierce debate internally at Apple with Steve Jobs strongly opposing the notion of sharing the iPod with Windows. Jobs eventually gave in to his lieutenants. It turned out that opening the iPod to Windows users led to explosive growth of the music player and the iTunes Store, and this in turn would later be critical to the success of the iPhone.

''' “Communicating at Apple.” ''' This course focuses on clear communication for making products intuitive, sharing ideas within Apple, and marketing products.

''' “Project Management.” ''' No information provided, Course is confidential

''' “Vendor Management.” '''

'''“What Makes Apple, Apple.”''' Focuses on one of Jobs's goals: to make complex computer technologies feel understandable and natural. In the course an instructor showed a slide of the remote control for the Google TV. The remote had 78 buttons. Then the instructor, Nelson, showed a photo of the Apple TV remote, a thin rod with three buttons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Campus==
The classes are taught on Apple’s corporate campus in Cupertino, California. Apple University is in a section of buildings called City Center. The rooms are built in a trapezoid shape. Occasionally, classes are offered in Apple’s offices overseas, and the professors travel there to teach.

In 2014, Apple planned an expansion of Apple University to China, to include a Dean to run Apple University China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/03/apple-plans-apple-university-in-china-bringing-jobs-vision-to-asia/|title=Apple plans Apple University in China, bringing Jobs’ vision to Asia|work=9to5Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxford University==
Audrey Butt studied at Oxford under [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]], and carried out fieldwork among the [[Akawaio people]] in [[Guyana]] in 1951-1952 and in 1957, later broadening her study to include other [[Pemon]] and Kapon groups in Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. She obtained the Diploma in Ethnology in 1949, the B.Litt. degree in 1950, and the D.Phil. in 1955. She then spent a year in Spain to learn Spanish in preparation for further fieldwork in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Annual Report of the Curator of the Pitt Rlvers Museum (Department of Ethnology) for the year ending 31 July 1955 |url= http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/sma/index.php/museum-annual-reports/255-1954-55-annual-report.html |publisher=The invention of museum anthropology, 1850-1920, University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 she lectured on South American societies at Oxford's [[Pitt Rivers Museum|Department of Ethnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rival | first1 = Laura | title = Peter Rivière's contributions to Amazonian and Social Anthropology |journal= Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford |date=1999 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages= 213–218 |url =https://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/ISCA/JASO/Archive_1999/30_3_Rival.pdf | format=pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pitt Rivers Museum==
The South American collections of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] contain 310 Amerindian objects donated by Butt Colson as a result of her fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Rivière | first1 = Peter | title = South American Tropical Forest Material |url = http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/South_America.html | publisher = [[Pitt Rivers Museum|Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also holds two reels of 16mm film shot by [[Bassett Maguire]] in 1952 and a [[BBC]] recording of Akawaio music and songs made in 1961, all produced with Butt Colson’s assistance.

==Amerindian land disputes==
In 2012 a judge in the Demerara High Court ruled that Dr Colson could not appear as an expert witness in a land suit brought by Akawaio and Arekuna Amerindian communities because of her prior support of the plaintiffs' position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge in Amerindian communities landmark case rules anthropologist Dr. Colson cannot be deemed an expert | url= http://guyanachronicle.com/judge-in-amerindian-communities-landmark-case-rules/|publisher=[[Guyana Chronicle]] | date = 7 May 2012 | accessdate = 28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 [[Survival International]] published her report, ''Dug out, dried out or flooded out? Hydro Power and Mining Threats to the Indigenous Peoples of the Upper Mazaruni District, Guyana'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butt Colson | first = Audrey | title =Dug out, dried out or flooded out?

'''Burrhus Frederic Skinner''' (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as '''B. F. Skinner''', was an American [[psychologist]], [[behaviorist]], author, inventor, and [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]].&lt;ref name = "Smith_Woodward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=L.

Skinner considered [[free will]] an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the probability of the action being repeated becomes stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., and Gilbert Daniel. (2011). Psychology. (2 ed.). New York, 2011. Web. March 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|origyear=2009|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To strengthen behavior, Skinner used [[operant conditioning]], and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning, he invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], also known as the Skinner Box,&lt;ref&gt;Schacter D, L., Gilbert D, T., &amp; Wegner D, M. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure rate he invented the ''cumulative recorder''. Using these tools, he and [[C. B. Ferster]] produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in their book ''Schedules of Reinforcement'' (1957).&lt;ref name="BO"&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1938) ''The Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;C. B. Ferster &amp; B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner developed [[Applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]], the philosophy of that science he called [[radical behaviorism]],&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;B. F. Skinner, ''About Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the [[experimental analysis of behavior]].  He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel, ''[[Walden Two]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work, ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1958) Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Skinner was a prolific author who published 21&amp;nbsp;books and 180&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~allanr/biblio.html Lafayette.edu], accessed on 5-20-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf BFSkinner.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414011557/http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf |date=April 14, 2008 }}, Smith Morris Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism, along with [[John B.

== Biography ==
[[File:BF Skinner Grave.JPG|thumb|The gravestone of B.F. Skinner and his wife Eve at Mount Auburn Cemetery]]

Skinner was born in [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]], to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an [[atheism|atheist]] after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his grandmother described.&lt;ref&gt;"Within a year I had gone to Miss Graves to tell her that I no longer believed in God. 'I know,' she said, 'I have been through that myself.' But her strategy misfired: I never went through it." B.F. Skinner, pp. 387-413, E.G. Boring and G. Lindzey's ''A History of Psychology in Autobiography'' (Vol. 5), New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

Skinner's closest friend as a young boy was Raphael Miller, whom he called Doc because his father was a doctor.  Doc and Skinner became friends due to their parents’ religiousness and both had an interest in contraptions and gadgets.  They had set up a telegraph line between their houses to send messages to each other, although they had to call each other on the telephone due to the confusing messages sent back and forth.  During one summer, Doc and Skinner started an elderberry business to gather berries and sell them door to door.  They had found out that when they picked the ripe berries, the unripe ones came off the branches too, so they built a device that was able to separate them.  The device was a bent piece of metal to form a trough. They would pour water down the trough into a bucket, and the ripe berries would sink into the bucket and the unripe ones would be pushed over the edge to be thrown away.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"&gt;Skinner, B. (1976). Particulars of my life (1st ed.). New York, NY: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013"&gt;''B.F. Skinner: A Life'' [Paperback]. by Daniel W. Bjork, {{ISBN|9781557984166}}: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending, he joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. Hamilton was known for being a strong fraternity college.  Skinner had thought that his fraternity brothers were respectful and did not haze or mistreat the newcomers, instead, they helped out the other boys with courses or other activities.  Freshmen were called “‘slimers’” who had to wear small green knit hats and greet everyone that they passed for punishment.  The year before Skinner entered Hamilton, there was a hazing accident that caused the death of a student.  The freshman was asleep in his bed when he was pushed onto the floor, where he smashed his head, resulting in his death.  Skinner had a similar incident where two freshmen captured him and tied him to a pole, where he should have stayed all night, but he had a razor blade in his shoe for emergency and managed to cut himself free.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"/&gt; He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the traditional mores of his college. After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an [[experimental science]] from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the [[Skinner Box]] and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet [[Robert Frost]], concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with [[John B. Watson]]'s ''Behaviorism'' led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=B. F. Skinner: a Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] at Minneapolis and later at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973, Skinner was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne (Eve) Blue. The couple had two daughters, [[Julie Vargas|Julie]] (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. [[Barry Buzan|Buzan]]).&lt;ref name="Deborah Skinner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsesbyskinner.com/?page_id=12|title=About|last=Skinner|first=Deborah|work=Horses by Skinner|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|title=I was not a lab rat|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|date=March 12, 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Skinner died in 1997,&lt;ref name="Papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Yvonne, 1911-1997.

(1993). B.F. Skinner, A Life. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner's public exposure had increased in the 1970s, he remained active even after his retirement in 1974, until his death.  In 1989, Skinner was diagnosed with leukemia and died on August 18, 1990 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Ten days before his death, he was given the lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and gave a talk in an auditorium concerning his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Famous People. (2017). B. F. Skinner biography&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.

== Contributions to psychological theory ==

===Behaviorism===
{{Main|Behaviorism|Radical behaviorism}}
Skinner called his approach to the study of behavior [[radical behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behavior'' § 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 {{ISBN|0-394-71618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see [[Applied behavior analysis]]). In contrast to the approach of [[cognitive science]], behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other "private events" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.
&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
In this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. pp. 18−20 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theoretical structure===
Skinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, ''Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=B.F.|title=Behavior of Organisms|date=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways.  ''Respondent'' behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called "Pavlovian conditioning" or "[[classical conditioning]]", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. ''Operant'' behaviors, in contrast, are "emitted", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called "instrumental conditioning", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlov|first1=I. P.|title=Conditioned Reflexes|date=1927|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operants by Thorndike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=E. L.|title=Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies|date=1911|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H.M. "Animal Learning and Behavior", Ch. 5, in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology" (1979) Erlbaum: Hillsdale, N. J.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.

The idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions.  Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place?  (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled?  (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=great questions, but were they raised by Skinner, and, if so, a source/reference should be given. If not, were they simply put here by a WP editor?}}

====Origin of operant behavior====
Skinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. "Shaping" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that "superstitious" behavior can arise when a response{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=not really needing "clarification" but is the best word here?}} happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.

====Control of operant behavior====
The second question, "how is operant behavior controlled?" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is "emitted" without reference to any particular stimulus.  Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not.  For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [[three-term contingency]] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

====Explaining complex behavior====
Most behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of "chaining."  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer." For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food." Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

However, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1966) Contingencies of Reinforcement, New York; Appleton-Century-Crofts. reprinted 2013, B. F. Skinner Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to "jump", "open the book", and so on.  After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"/&gt;

===Reinforcement===
{{Main|Reinforcement}}
Reinforcement, a key concept of [[behaviorism]], is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, "positive" and "negative."  In ''The Behavior of Organisms'' (1938), Skinner defined "negative reinforcement" to be synonymous with [[punishment]], that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in ''Science and Human Behavior'' (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied ([[positive reinforcement]]) or something removed or avoided ([[negative reinforcement]]). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus ([[negative punishment]] or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. Science and Human Behavior (1953) New York: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.

Writing in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, "selection by consequences." Though, as he said, natural selection has now "made its case", he regretted that essentially the same process, "reinforcement", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=July 31, 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==== Schedules of reinforcement ====
{{Main|Schedules of reinforcement}}
Skinner recognized that behavior is typically reinforced more than once, and, together with C. B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called "[[schedules of reinforcement]]."&lt;ref name="Schedules"&gt;Ferster, C. B. and Skinner, B. F.  Schedules of Reinforcement.  New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in [[operant conditioning]].

* '''Continuous reinforcement (CRF)''' — each time a specific action is performed the subject receives a reinforcement. This method is effective when teaching a new behavior because it quickly establishes an association between the target behavior and the reinforcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Reinforcement Scedules|url=http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/Reinforcement-Table1.pdf|website=autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu|publisher=National Professional Development Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interval Schedules''' — based on the time intervals between reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"&gt;Psychology 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Fixed Interval Schedule (FI)''': A procedure in which reinforcements are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response is made. This schedule yields a response rate that is low just after reinforcement and becomes rapid just before the next reinforcement is scheduled.
**'''Variable Interval Schedule (VI)''': A procedure in which behavior is reinforced after random time durations following the last reinforcement. This schedule yields steady responding at a rate that varies with the average frequency of reinforcement.
*'''Ratio Schedules''' — based on the ratio of responses to reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"/&gt;
**'''Fixed Ratio Schedule (FR)''':  A procedure in which reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made.
**'''Variable Ratio Schedule (VR)''': A procedure in which reinforcement comes after a number of responses that is randomized from one reinforcement to the next (ex. slot machines). The lower the number of responses required, the higher the response rate tends to be. Ratio schedules tend to produce very rapid responding, often with breaks of no responding just after reinforcement if a large number of responses is required for reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner. (2011). Schedules of Reinforcement. Psychology second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific inventions==

=== Operant conditioning chamber ===
{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
An [[operant conditioning chamber]] (also known as a ''Skinner Box'') is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior.  It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]]. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this "manipulandum" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

=== Cumulative recorder ===

The cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the [[Operant chamber]] as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck.  In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder.  Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}}  Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, ''Schedules of Reinforcement'', is full of cumulative records produced by this device.&lt;ref name="Schedules"/&gt;

=== Air crib ===
The air crib is an easily cleaned, temperature- and humidity-controlled enclosure intended to replace the standard infant [[Infant bed|crib]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/what-man-can-make-of-man/308973/ Air-crib photograph] in "What Man Can Make of Man", by [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]]. ''[[The Atlantic]],'' June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Skinner invented the device to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while allowing the baby to be more mobile and comfortable, and less prone to cry. Reportedly it had some success in these goals.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

The air crib was a controversial invention. It was popularly mischaracterized as a cruel pen, and it was often compared to Skinner's [[operant conditioning chamber]], commonly called the "Skinner Box." This association with laboratory animal experimentation discouraged its commercial success, though several companies attempted production.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp "One Man and a Baby Box"], accessed on 12-29-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burrhus Fredrick Skinner|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Skinner, Burrhus Frederic (1904 - 1990)|publisher=Gale, Credo Reference|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 book by [[Lauren Slater]], entitled ''[[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century]]''&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;Slater, L. (2004) [[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century|Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century]], London, Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt; caused a stir by mentioning the rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, in some of his experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book stated that the rumors were false, a reviewer in ''[[The Observer]]'' in March 2004 misquoted Slater's book as supporting the rumors. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who wrote a vehement riposte in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|title=I was not a lab rat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching machine ===
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|The teaching machine, a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed learning]]]]

The [[teaching machine]] was a [[mechanical device]] whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of [[programmed learning]]. The machine embodies key elements of Skinner's theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=Why we need teaching machines|journal=Harvard Educational Review|year=1961|volume=31|pages=377–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/1950.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. "Unison" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.F. | year = 1961 | title = Teaching machines | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 90–112 | doi = 10.2307/1926170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, "learning by doing."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. and Holland, J. "The Analysis of Behavior: A Program for Self Instruction", 1961, p.387&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.

Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.

Skinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philmcrae.com/2/post/2013/04/rebirth-of-the-teaching-maching-through-the-seduction-of-data-analytics-this-time-its-personal1.html|title=Rebirth of the Teaching Machine through the Seduction of Data Analytics: This Time It's Personal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pigeon-guided missile ===
{{Main|Project Pigeon}}
During World War II, the [[US Navy]] required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' class]] battleships. Although [[missile]] and [[Television guidance|TV]] technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated [[Project Pigeon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.

New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353|title=Nose Cone, Pigeon-Guided Missile|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516215806/http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353| archivedate= May 16, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an effective demonstration, the project was abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available.

=== Verbal summator ===

Early in his career Skinner became interested in "latent speech" and experimented with a device he called the "verbal summator."&lt;ref name="doi_9917445"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B. F. |year=1936 |title=The Verbal Summator and a Method for the Study of Latent Speech |journal=[[Journal of Psychology]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=71–107 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1936.9917445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This device can be thought of as an auditory version  of the Rorschach inkblots.&lt;ref name="doi_9917445" /&gt; When using the device, human participants listened to incomprehensible auditory "garbage" but often read meaning into what they heard. Thus, as with the Rorschach blots, the device was intended to yield overt behavior that projected subconscious thoughts.  Skinner's interest in projective testing was brief, but he later used observations with the summator in creating his theory of verbal behavior.  The device also led other researchers to invent new tests such as the tautophone test, the auditory apperception test, and the Azzageddi{{Definition|date=May 2016}} test.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, A., B.

Challenged by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior,&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Verbal Behavior''. The account in the appendix is that he asked Skinner to explain why he said "No black scorpion, Carter is falling upon this table."&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Burrhus Frederick(1904 - 1990).|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Credo Reference, Gale|publisher=Credo Reference, Gale|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of ''Verbal Behavior'', he conceded that Skinner's "S-R psychology" was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the "S-R" characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).&lt;ref name="RVB"&gt;A.

''Verbal Behavior'' had an uncharacteristically cool reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Richelle, M. (1993). ''B. F. Skinner: A reappraisal''.

== Influence on education ==
{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}
&lt;!--Good idea to have this section, but it needs to be written in an encyclopedic style, with references--&gt;
&lt;!--A possible source might be The Technology of Teaching, as well as Keller's PSM and so on and so on--&gt;
Skinner's views influenced [[education]] as well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" can be an effective reinforcer &lt;!-- What is this a citation from? --&gt;. Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;389).

Skinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, J. (1992). B.F Skinner. Pittsburgh: American Psychologist&lt;/ref&gt;

Because teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In ''The Technology of Teaching'', Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]]. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:
:* using aversive techniques (which produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects);
:* relying on telling and explaining ("Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told." p.&amp;nbsp;103);
:* failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level;
:* failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are
#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn.
#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.
#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions.
#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached.
#Shift to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance.
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. They are also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley]]'s ''[[Precision teaching|Precision Teaching]]''.

== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==
Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]],'' (for which he made the cover of ''[[TIME]]'' Magazine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B.F.

F. Skinner, (1968). "The Design of Experimental Communities", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.

''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI.

F. Skinner's Behaviorist Utopia and Experimental Communities|author=Hilke Kuhlman|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date= Oct 1, 2010|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

== Political views ==
Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.&lt;ref&gt;see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example&lt;/ref&gt; He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of control, citing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of literature that "did not fear the power of positive reinforcement."&lt;ref name="W2"/&gt;

Skinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 30, 1996 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&amp;hw=spanking+debate&amp;sn=009&amp;sc=334 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Skinner's [[utopia]] is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In ''Walden Two'', Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – "What is the Good Life?" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption.

== Superstition in the pigeon ==
One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon "at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior." He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.&lt;ref name=superstition&gt;Skinner, B. F. "'Superstition' in the Pigeon", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Skinner (1948)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their "rituals", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing—or, more strictly speaking, did something else.&lt;ref name=superstition /&gt;}}

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's "superstition" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's "adventitious reinforcement" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their "autoshaping" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The basis of superstitious behavior: chance contingency, stimulus substitution, or appetitive behavior?|first1=W|last1=Timberlake|first2=G A|last2=Lucas|date=November 1, 1985|publisher=|journal=J Exp Anal Behav|volume=44|issue=3|pages=279–299|doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.44-279|pmid=4086972|pmc=1348192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== J. E. R. Staddon ===
As understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say "Skinner is brilliant" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition'', 2014) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]]; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. (1995) On responsibility and punishment. ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88−94. Staddon, J. (1999) On responsibility in science and law. ''Social Philosophy and Policy'', 16, 146-174. Reprinted in ''Responsibility''. E. F. Paul, F. D. Miller, &amp; J. Paul (eds.), 1999. Cambridge University Press, pp. 146−174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noam Chomsky ===
[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent critic of Skinner, published a [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|review]] of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'' two years after it was published.&lt;ref name="Chomsky review"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|year=1959|title=Reviews: ''Verbal behavior'' by B. F. Skinner|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=35|issue=1|pages=26–58|jstor=411334|doi=10.2307/411334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky argued that Skinner's attempt to use behaviorism to explain human language amounted to little more than word games. Conditioned responses could not account for a child's ability to create or understand an infinite variety of novel sentences. Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology and other disciplines&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;see Chomsky page for citation&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]]'s reply was endorsed by Skinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacCorquodale|first=Kenneth|date=1970-01-01|title=ON CHOMSKY'S REVIEW OF SKINNER'S VERBAL BEHAVIOR|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83/abstract|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=83–99|doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83|issn=1938-3711|pmc=1333660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', using the same basic motives as his ''Verbal Behavior'' review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1972) "The Case Against B. F. Skinner."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychodynamic psychology ===
Skinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards [[Sigmund Freud]], [[psychoanalysis]], and [[psychodynamic psychology]]. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of [[defense mechanisms]], such as [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toates |first=F. |year=2009 |title=Burrhus F. Skinner: The shaping of behavior |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, England |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overskeid|first=Geir|date=September 2007|title=Looking for Skinner and Finding Freud|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b56/9a618b68f3f3b56738ce3f2d081adda0fa45.pdf|journal=American Psychologist|volume=62|pages=590–595|via=|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.6.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; To study such phenomena, Skinner even designed his own [[projective test]], the "verbal summator" described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rutherford |first=A. |year=2003 |title=B.

===Origin of the company name===
ByWater Solutions is named after a village in [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J. R. R. Tolkien's]] epic trilogy [[The Lord of the Rings]]. [[Bywater (Middle-earth)#Westfarthing|Bywater]] is a village which is situated in close proximity to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], the home of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]], who are the two main characters in the story. [[Bywater (Middle-earth)|Bywater]] was known primarily for the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#The Green Dragon|Inn of the Green Dragon]], a central meeting place for travelers and adventurers in the story. The Inn was a hub for the collaboration and exchange of news and ideas in the world of Middle Earth, and thus resembles the environment found in Koha and [[Open-source software|Open Source Software]] in general. Because of the company's primary dealings with libraries worldwide, the founders thought that it was important to incorporate a literary reference to the name of the company, and being lifelong childhood friends, this literary work has personal value to them both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|work=ByWater Solutions|url=http://bywatersolutions.com/about-us/history/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
In March 2015, EBSCO Information Services and ByWater Solutions partnered together to allow libraries that use Koha ILS to easily integrate EBSCO Discovery Service™.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ebsco.com/news-center/press-releases/ebscos-partnership-with-bywater-solutions-enables-interoperability&lt;/ref&gt; Since then ByWater has expressed their commitment to support the FOLIO project in partnership with Ebsco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ebsco.com/news-center/press-releases/folio-to-benefit-from-agreement-between-ebsco-and-bywater-solutions|title=FOLIO Library Services Platform to Benefit from Services Agreement Between EBSCO Information Services and ByWater Solutions|work=EBSCO|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Honors===
In 2015, ByWater Solutions was recognized by Inc. Magazine as being one of the top 5,000 fastest growing business in the United States.

It is based in [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], and its current president is Eric C. Heins.

==History==
[[Image:CTAMainOffice.jpg|left|thumb| ''CTA's Governmental Affairs Office (Sacramento, CA)'']]
CTA was founded in 1863, during the Civil War, in response to a call in 1863 from the California Superintendent of Public Instruction, [[John Swett]], for a "teachers' institute", about one hundred teachers gathered in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], resulting in the formation of the California Educational Society.  In 1875, the organization changed its name to the California Teachers Association.

CTA won its first major legislative victory in 1866 with a law providing free public schools to California children. A year later, public funding was secured for schools that educated nonwhite students. More early victories established bans on using public school funding for sectarian religious purposes (1878-79); free textbooks for all students in grades 1-8 (1911); the first teacher tenure and due process law (1912); and a statewide pension, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (1913).

CTA led efforts to outlaw child labor in the state and enact other protections for children (1915), and to strengthen the teacher due process law (1921). In the 1940s, the union was the only major organization in California to protest against the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.

While the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 made collective bargaining a lawful, protected activity in the private sector, it did not include public workers or teachers. Wisconsin passed the nation's first public employee bargaining law (1959), and several large, urban affiliates of NEA or the American Federation of Teachers started winning bargaining rights (New York in 1961, Denver in 1962, Chicago in 1966). After a decade of school strikes and teacher organizing, California K-14 educators at last won the right to bargain collectively in 1975 when the CTA-sponsored Educational Employment Relations Act, also known as the Rodda Act, was signed into law by Gov. [[Jerry Brown]]. 

A turning point in CTA's history came in 1988. That was the year teachers fought to pass Proposition 98, the landmark state law guaranteeing about 40 percent of the state's general fund for schools and community colleges. 

In 2005, CTA ran numerous ads criticizing Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] for refusing to pay back $2 billion that the Governor had "borrowed" from the education budget. CTA strongly opposed propositions [[California Proposition 74 (2005)|74]], [[California Proposition 75 (2005)|75]], [[California Proposition 76 (2005)|76]], which were advanced by Schwarzenegger.  None of the initiatives were approved by voters. CTA also criticized Governor Schwarzenegger for spending nearly $80 million on the special election.

CTA strongly opposed [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] and donated a total of $1.25 million to help fight the measure that would ban gay marriage, stating that the proposition would violate civil rights and that proponents' advertising made false claims about the effect the proposition would have on public school curricula.

'''Class rank''' is a measure of how a student's performance compares to other students in his or her [[class (education)|class]]. It is commonly also expressed as a [[percentile]]. For instance, a student may have a [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] better than 750 of his or her classmates in a graduating class of 800.

== Use in high schools ==
The use of class rank is currently in practice at about less than half of [[United States|American]] [[high school]]s.&lt;ref name=CollegeBoard/&gt; Large [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s are more likely to rank their students than small [[private school]]s.&lt;ref name=CollegeBoard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prof/counselors/apply/14.html |title=Counselor's Connection - Apply to College: Class Rank and College Admissions |accessdate=July 5, 2007 |publisher=The [[College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many admissions officers were frustrated that many applications did not contain a rank, some colleges are using other information provided by high schools, in combination with a student's GPA to estimate a student's class rank. Many colleges{{weasel-inline|date=May 2015}} say that the absence of a class rank forces them to put more weight on [[standardized test]] scores.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news | last=Finder | first=Alex | date=March 5, 2003 | title=Schools Avoid Class Ranking, Vexing Colleges 
 | periodical=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/education/05rank.html |accessdate=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in college admissions ==
Colleges often use class rank as a factor in [[college admissions]], although because of differences in grading standards between schools, admissions officers have begun to attach less weight to this factor, both for granting admission, and for awarding [[scholarships]]. Class rank is more likely to be used at large schools that are more formulaic in their admissions programs.&lt;ref name=CollegeBoard /&gt;

=== Percent plans ===
Some [[U.S. states]] guarantee that students who achieve a high enough class rank at their high school will be admitted into a [[State university system (United States)|state university]], in a practice known as ''percent plans''. Students in [[California]] who are in the top nine percent of their graduating class,&lt;ref&gt;http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/freshman/california-residents/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and students in [[Florida]] who are in the top twenty percent of their graduating class are guaranteed admission to some state school, but not necessarily any particular institution. The [[University of Alaska system]] awards an $11,000 scholarship for four years to students in the top 10% of their graduating class at Alaskan high schools. The top ten percent of students in [[Texas]] high schools are guaranteed admission to the [[List of colleges and universities in Texas#State universities|state school]] of their choice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">'''Claude Bessy''' (born in Paris, October 20, 1932) is a French ballerina, [[ballet master]] of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] (1970-1971) and director of the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera Ballet School]] (1972–2004).

Mlle. Bessy trained at the Paris Opera Ballet School from the age of ten, the youngest student ever admitted, and joined the Paris Opera Ballet at age 13, the youngest ''danseuse'' ever admitted. In 1956 she was promoted to ''[[Paris Opera Ballet|étoile]]'', the Ballet's highest rank. Bessy was closely associated with [[Serge Lifar]] and created leading roles in his 1951 ''Snow White'', 1955 ''Noces fantastiques''  and 1958 ''Daphnis and Chloe''. She worked with [[John Cranko]], who made his 1955  ''La Belle Hêlène'' on her, and [[George Skibine]], who made a second ''Daphnis and Chloe'' on Bessy in 1959.

Bessy was featured in [[Gene Kelly]]'s film ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' (1956), and four years later he created ''Pas de dieux'' at the Paris Opera for her. She also made many television appearances. Bessy has staged ballets for the [[Comédie Française]] and [[Opéra Comique]], dances for the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1984) and continues to stage the ballets of Lifar throughout Europe.

As director of the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera Ballet School]] she introduced profound reforms to the teaching regime which led to the birth of a new generation of highly technical dancers like [[Sylvie Guillem]], [[Patrick Dupond]], [[Élisabeth Platel]], [[Marie-Claude Pietragalla]], and succeeded in organising the construction of a new school building in [[Nanterre]] inaugurated in 1987.

[[Poverty]] is rife in Honduras, with the poverty headcount ratio at national [[poverty line]] standing at 60% as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/honduras|title=Honduras Data|publisher=World Bank |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical situations, children have to quit school permanently to work at an early age to help support their families. Even though school is fully state-subsidized up till the 5th grade, many children are still unable to attend school because their families can not afford to buy uniforms and school supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armenianow.com/economy/30861/forbes_report_worst_economy_armenia  |title=Armenia The Second Worse Economy in the World|publisher=Forbes |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 2006 by [[National Institute of Statistics (Honduras)|National Institute of Statistics]] estimated that as many as 368,000 of the 1.7 million children ages five to 12 did not receive schooling in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100644.htm  |title=Honduras|publisher=US Department of State |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender inequality ==
Honduras is a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and males are favoured over females when it comes to [[education]]. While parents may send both genders to primary school; the females are likely the first to be withdrawn to help at home and made to work to provide income. This is further supported by the belief that occupational opportunities resulting from education are greater for males, as females have greater difficulty in finding jobs that match their academic credentials even if they have the same education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honduras.com/honduras-constitution-english.html |title=Female Education in Honduras: The Creation of a Community of Congruence for Women |publisher=Cinthia Navin |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both genders have equal access to the limited available educational facilities; however, attendance rates for females were slightly lower than for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100644.htm  |title=Honduras|publisher=US Department of State |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education infrastructure ==
The quality of the [[curriculum]] in Honduran public schools is poor, evidenced by the fact that for much of the last century, Honduran students were required to memorize useless or impractical data at the expense of sharpening their reasoning powers and [[critical thinking]] skills. Teachers are paid low wages, they do not have access to effective teaching materials, and they are not trained in the latest technologies and current teaching methods.
In addition, there is a scarcity of teachers, with a teacher:student ratio of 1:33 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=3336&amp;IF_Language=eng|title=Beyond 20/20 WDS - Table View -|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of over 3000 schools nationwide caused by [[Hurricane Mitch]] further weakened the country’s poor education infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/honduras.htm#_ftnref1206|title=Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) - U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=United States Department of Labor|date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English language in the Netherlands''' refers to the use of the [[English language]] in the [[Netherlands]].  Research states that between 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=EUROPEANS AND THEIR LANGUAGES|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alisonedwardsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/phd-thesis_edwards.pdf|title="English in the Netherlands: Functions, forms and attitudes" p. 316 and onwards|website=Alisonedwardsdotcom.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Dutch population claims to be able to converse in English. According to some, the main reasons for the high degree of English speakers is the country's small size, dependency on international trade, and the use of [[subtitles]] for foreign languages on [[television]] rather than [[dubbing (filmmaking)|audio dubbing]]. Dutch's genealogical proximity to English is also noted as a significant factor; both languages are closely related [[West Germanic languages]].&lt;ref name="English in Europe"&gt;{{cite book |title=English in Europe: The acquisition of a third language |year=2000 |publisher=Multilingual Matters, Ltd.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iaEGdFnQDJcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=English+language+in+the+Netherlands&amp;ots=av9-zsVtXG&amp;sig=5MfgtIiKM_asNihtUH2S3fpyPXo#v=onepage&amp;q=English%20language%20in%20the%20Netherlands&amp;f=false|author=Cenoz J., Jessner U.|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupations which require a complex knowledge of the English language, such as those in aviation and the sciences, are also abundant in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it is an official and the majority language in the Caribbean municipalities of [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0028063/|title=Regeling - Invoeringswet openbare lichamen Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba - BWBR0028063|website=Wetten.overheid.nl|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Various explanations contribute to the popularity of English in the Netherlands.  Due to the small size and population of the Netherlands, and hundreds of years of having a trade and commerce economy, particularly between mainland Europe and the United Kingdom, the Dutch put strong emphasis on learning English and other foreign languages, especially German.  The Netherlands was also liberated from the Germans by English speaking troops, boosting the status of the English language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In the following decades, with American-dominated globalization, English gradually increased in importance as a [[lingua franca]], at the expense of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], both losing popularity as secondary languages in the latter part of the 20th century. This is in spite of the fact that German is linguistically much closer to Dutch than English, and that Germany is the most important trade partner of the Netherlands. Nevertheless, knowledge of more than one foreign language is still widespread compared to other states of the European Union.

In Amsterdam, in particular, visitors may get the impression that it is possible to live in the Netherlands for a long time without learning Dutch. A substantial number of the inhabitants of Amsterdam have English as their native language (mostly British and North American immigrants), however most of them make an effort to learn at least some Dutch. Nevertheless, in and around Amsterdam one may find announcements, traffic signs and advertisements in both Dutch and English, or even in English only (as in [[Schiphol Airport]]). Amsterdam however already has had an English speaking community for hundreds of years. A church worshipping in English, the [[English Reformed Church, Amsterdam|English Reformed Church]] was reopened for worship in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercadam.nl/about-us/history/|title=History - English Reformed Church Amsterdam|website=Ercadam.nl|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, most important scholarly and scientific publications in the Netherlands are in English with the exception of government related and legal publications.

==English language education in the Netherlands==
English is compulsory on all levels of [[Education in the Netherlands|the Dutch secondary education system]]. In addition:
* Many [[elementary school]]s teach English in the upper grades.
* A student has to score at least a 5.5/10 for English Language appoond Literature for their high school finals, or they will not graduate. 
Pupils learn Received Pronunciation/ Queen's English.
Since high schools in the Netherlands have different levels of education (preparatory mid-level professional, higher general continued education , pre-university college/preparatory scientific education. A test from elementary school together with the advice of the teacher will determine which level a pupil will attend.)
Where the first one will teach a pupil enough English to have simple conversations.
The second will be focused on achieving the ability to speak formally and in a professional setting.
The third is focused on understanding the most difficult kinds texts and communicating on a university/scientific level, which is a little bit more than a master in English needed for British universities would ask. Though without the proverbs and or sayings.
* Around 100 schools offer [[bilingual education]] (Dutch / English). This concept was first introduced in several high schools, but has found its way to primary schools. The aim of bilingual education is for the students to obtain the same level of English as the native speakers of Great Britain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* The first university professor of English, Jan Beckering Vinckers, was appointed at the [[University of Groningen]] in 1885.
* Most [[university]] [[master's degree]]s are in English, and an increasing number of [[bachelor's degree]]s are as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2187638.ece/English_takes_over_at_Dutch_universities|title=NRC|website=Nrc.nl|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even the first degrees of community college given in English have made their way into existence. In addition, many degrees that are taught in Dutch utilise English language materials (e.g. books) and names.
* Students are often taught to perform Internet searches in English, as the results of these obtain a far higher variety and extent of information compared to the Dutch equivalent.

==English language television in the Netherlands==
In addition to the availability of the [[United Kingdom|British]] channels [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two|Two]] and [[BBC World|World]], the [[United States|American]] [[CNN]] and the English edition of [[Al Jazeera]], many programmes broadcast on Dutch channels are broadcast in English with Dutch [[subtitles]].&lt;ref name="English in Europe"/&gt; English language children's programmes, however, are usually [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]].
Dubbed commercials, films and TV programmes (apart from animations and cartoons) have often come to be disliked by the Dutch public. People very much prefer these to be broadcast with subtitles, or even with no form of translation whatsoever.

Apart from this, there are a few television stations broadcasting in English, targeting the English speaking community of the Netherlands, such as [[AF-TV]], or dedicating large portions of airtime to programming in English, such as [[RTV7]] and Amsterdam local TV channel Salto 1. (See also: [[Television in the Netherlands#Television in other languages|Television in the Netherlands]])

==Dunglish==
{{main|Dunglish}}
Dunglish (called ''steenkolenengels'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translating to ''coal English'') is a portmanteau of ''Dutch'' and ''English'' and a term often used pejoratively to refer to the mistakes native Dutch speakers make when speaking English.

==Linguistic anglophobia and the English disease==
[[Anglophobia]], or more accurately linguistic anglophobia, within the European Dutch language area (i.e. the Netherlands and [[Flemish Community|Flanders]]) has evolved out of schools and companies switching to English as medium of communication and a large number of English [[loanword]]s in the Dutch language. Consequentially this has led to some anglophobia with some groups advocating to dispose of all English loanwords.

English disease (Dutch: ''Engelse ziekte'') is a pejorative term for the effect of the English language on the use of [[compound (linguistics)|linguistic compounds]] in written Dutch. The [[anglicism]]s (and sometimes [[American English|Americanisms]]) enter the written language as a result of being exposed to English words and expressions.

''''' G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement''''' is a 2013 book by [[Robert Plomin]], Professor of Behavioral Genetics at the Kings College London and [[Kathryn Ashbury]], lecturer in the Centre for Psychology and Education at the University of York. The book summarizes findings of behavioural genetics that are relevant to education and offers policy recommendations. It is written for a wide audience including parents, educators and policy makers.

==Part One: In theory==
Part one consists of 11 chapters that present the field of behavioural genetics and what implications some findings have on education. It addresses issues such as twin studies, sex differences and socio-economic status. Part one is summarized in 7 "big ideas" which are the following:

===Achievement and Ability Vary, Partly for Genetic Reasons===
Average school performance doesn’t change the fact that half of the students will fall above and the other half below the average. Seeing those scoring below average as ‘failing’ wastes resources on approaches that have little or no effect. Instead of making pupils identical, the diversity should be embraced after providing a certain level of common education.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Abnormal is Normal===
Students that are high performing or low performing are no more likely to be more genetically exceptional than an average student and same genes influence performance all across the distribution of performance. In other words, a math professor and a student struggling with mathematics are using the same genes when they perform mathematical tasks. There are many genes with small effect which are working together in an interplay with many environmental experiences and the same genes can have allelic differences. This is why turning on or off genes is unlikely to have large effects.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21590881-genes-count-lot-schooling-whether-schools-can-adapt-knowledge-less&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuity is Genetic and Change is Environmental===
School performance is influenced by the same genes across life span and dramatic fluctuations in performance are likely to be caused by environment, not biology. Even though it’s likely that emerging biotechnology will make it possible to have predictive genetic information relevant to learning, the predictions can never reach full accuracy because of environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genes are Generalists and Environments are Specialists===
Genes that influence one cognitive ability are likely to influence others as well; for example high performance on a reading test predicts high performance on math test. Education, on the other hand, is more specific and increasing performance in one area doesn’t transmit to other areas to the same extent.&lt;ref&gt;''G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement'', Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environments are Influenced by Genes===
Genetics influence individuals as they select their environment.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Environments that Matter the Most are Unique to Individuals===
Identical twins raised in same households and who are taught by the same teachers still differ from each other. The differences not explained by shared genes or family household, the "non-shared environment", accounts for most of the environmental influence.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality of Opportunity Requires Diversity of Opportunity===
Perfect equality of opportunity would still result in differences between individuals, but these differences would be more due to genetics. There is a need to introduce more choice so different natures can be nurtured to full potential.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part Two: In Practice==

The part two consists of eleven practical policy recommendations and their genetic basis.

===Minimize the Core Curriculum and Test Basic skills===
The mandatory learning should be minimized to the skills that are required to succeed in society, such as reading and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increase Choice===
Pupils should be able to choose from a large variety of subject options according to their own interests, particularly as they get older.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forget About Labels===
Extra help should be given to those who need it as quickly as possible with as little labels and bureaucracy as possible.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teach the Child As Well As the Class===
Pupils should have an Individual Education Plan that would be reviewed and revised each year and would serve as the basis for their school-leaving certificate.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teach Children How To Succeed===
IQ and self-confidence have a positive impact on education and both can be improved with coaching. Such coaching is described as "Thinking Skills Sessions" and should be provided for an hour every week for every student.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promote Equal Opportunities from an Early Age as Foundation for Social Mobility in the Future===
Disadvantaged children from age 2 should be offered free high-quality preschool education. All children aged 3 – 4 should be offered high quality preschool education tailored according to their needs and extra support should be provided to all low-SES families from birth.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
===Equalize Extracurricular Opportunities at School===
The playing field for extracurricular activities should be made more equal by providing poor families with vouchers that can be exchanged to extracurricular activities based in schools or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Create a Two Stage PE System===
Pupils should first have a standardized PE program where they would be exposed to different activities. The next stage would be choice-driven and pupils would be given the opportunity to choose from the activities introduced to them in the earlier stage.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change the Destination===
Make apprenticeships more attractive and affordable to employers and increase the number and variety of options available for work and college based vocational training.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train New Teachers in Genetics and Give Them Tools to Put it Into Practice===
Include a course on genetics of learning in teacher training and make useful information about personalization of education available to all schools.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Is Beautiful===
Make the schools bigger to increase capability to provide larger variety of options. Make the links between different levels of schooling stronger.&lt;ref&gt;G is for Genes: The Impact of Genetics on Education and Achievement, Wiley Blackwell, 2013, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book sparked public debate and was for example featured in BBC radio programme [[The Moral Maze]]. [[Steven Pinker]] wrote in his review of the book "This may be the most important book about educational theory and practice in the new millennium, giving educators, policy-makers, and parents much to think about."&lt;ref&gt;http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118482786,subjectCd-ED05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Don't mess with this line! --&gt;'''Gamey'a''' (As known in middle east) is very common in over 89 countries and communities around the world. They call it Chit funds in [[India]] and Tandas in [[Mexico]].

How it works:

1- Group of friends joins together to contribute a fixed monthly installment into a common pot.

2- Every month one of the users takes the whole pot as a payout.

3- Circle ends when all circle participants gets his/her payout once.

4- Circle is then usually repeated with the same group of people over again.

== Biography ==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, where his father, a graduate from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] worked as an educator. Previts obtained his BA from [[John Carroll University]], under the guidance of Professor of Accounting [[Francis J. McGurr]], in 1963. In 1964 he obtained his MA in accountancy at the [[Ohio State University]], and in 1972 his PhD at the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref name="AHoF 2015"&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/gary-john-previts/ Gary John Previts] at ''fisher.osu.edu.''

''Accounting, organizations and society'' 31.4 (2006): 415-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previts served in the US Army in the [[Vietnam War]], where he was stationed in Thailand from 1965 to 1967. Back in the States he worked at [[Haskins &amp; Sells]], now [[Deloitte]], before continuing his graduate study. After graduation Previts started his academic career at [[University of Alabama]] in 1973.  During the first year of his academic career, Previts was instrumental in generating interest in and in the formation of the [[Academy of Accounting Historians]], devoted to the study of accounting history.&lt;ref name&gt;[[Edward N. Coffman]], [[Alfred R. Roberts]] and Gary John Previts, [http://www.accountingin.com/accounting-historians-journal/volume-16-number-2/a-history-of-the-academy-of-accounting-historians/ A history of the Academy of Accounting Historians 1973-1988].

'''Gofer''' (''Good for equational reasoning'') is an implementation of the programming language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] intended for educational purposes and supporting a language based on version 1.2 of the Haskell report. It was replaced by [[Hugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haskell.org/hugs/pages/users_guide/faq.html#AEN1870|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Hugs|website=www.haskell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its syntax is closer to the earlier commercial language [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] than the subsequently standardized Haskell.  It lacks some of features of Haskell (such as the deriving clause in data type definitions) but includes a number of features which were not adopted by Haskell (although some were later incorporated into GHC, such as generalizing the [[list comprehension]] syntax to support any monad, which is now available using the MonadComprehensions extension).

'''HeHalutz''' or '''Hechalutz ''' ({{lang-he-n|החלוץ}}, ''lit.'' The Pioneer) was a Jewish youth movement that trained young people for agricultural settlement in the [[Land of Israel]]. It became an umbrella organization of the pioneering [[Zionist youth movement]]s.

==History==
HeHalutz was founded by Eliezer Joffe in America in 1905, and about the same time in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ritov | first1 = Israel | first2 = Yehuda | last2 = Slutsky | chapter = He-Ḥalutz | title = Encyclopaedia Judaica | editor = Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik | edition = 2 | volume = 8 | place = Detroit | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | year = 2007 | pages = 756–761 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587508655&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=imcpl1111&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=377191611c4ffc8f4281aa4d532302f7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], HeHalutz branches opened across Europe (including Russia), America and Canada. Leaders of the organization included [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] (later the second president of the [[State of Israel]]),  and [[David Ben-Gurion]] (later  the first Prime Minister of Israel) in America, and [[Joseph Trumpeldor]] in Russia.

Ben-Gurion was living in [[Jerusalem]] at the start of the First World War, where he and Ben Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army. Despite this, he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, where he remained for three years. On his arrival, he and Ben Zvi went on a tour of 35 cities in an attempt to raise a Hechalutz "pioneer army" of 10,000 men to fight on Turkey's side.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, Shabtai (1985) ''Ben-Gurion and the Palestinian Arabs. From Peace to War.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-503562-3}}. pp. 25, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of November 1917, the situation changed dramatically and Ben-Gurion, with the interest of Zionism in mind, switched sides and joined the newly formed [[Jewish Legion]] of the [[British Army]], leaving to fight the Turks in Palestine.

At its peak, between 1930 and 1935, HeHalutz operated in 25 countries throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Northern South America. In 1932-1934, [[Golda Meir]], later the prime minister of Israel, was the secretary of the women's chapter of HeHalutz in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishdestiny.com/destinys-projects/faith-fate/a-new-beginning/biographies/golda-meir/ Golda Meir]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932,  the organization established headquarters in New York and twenty branches in cities and towns throughout the United States and Canada. Farms were then established to train members for agricultural work in Palestine. Such farms operated in Creamridge, New Jersey, Heightstown, New Jersey, Poughkeepsie, New York, Smithville, Ontario., and Colton, California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08655.html Jewish Virtual Library: HeHalutz]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1933, after Jews were expelled from the workforce in Nazi Germany, HeHalutz farms became the primary framework for vocational training and preparation for emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=eKwyyGrTSvAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=hehalutz+farms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OsPHXXeAW8&amp;sig=7D0044HkPtIwcfhXPXci-lzAF50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKmfn5xMzUAhXFXhoKHfnuAsMQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hehalutz%20farms&amp;f=true Before Catastrophe: The Distinctive Path of German Zionism, Hagit Lavsky]&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the eve of [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, HeHalutz numbered 100,000 members worldwide, with approximately 60,000 having already emigrated (''[[aliyah]]'') to [[Mandate Palestine]], and with 16,000 members in training centers (''[[Hakhshara|hakhsharot]]'') for the pioneering life in the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007240 Resistance in the Smaller Ghettos of Eastern Europe] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt; During the war and German occupation, Jews in some ghettos in Europe established Hechalutz units, as in Lithuania's [[Šiauliai Ghetto]].&lt;ref name=ALJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lithuanianjews.org.il/htmls/article_list4.aspx?C2014=14288&amp;BSP=14059&amp;BSS59=14055 |title=The Shavli Ghetto |publisher=Association of Lithuanian Jews in Israel |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950's HeHalutz"... was absorbed by [[Hashomer Hatzair]], which had always maintained a large degree of autonomy.

'''Henriëtte Mayer-van den Bergh''' (1838 – 1920) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] museum founder, known for commissioning the building and establishing [[Museum Mayer van den Bergh]], which she curated until her death.

She was the daughter of the [[Antwerp]] senator Jean Félix Van den Bergh who ran the “La Cloche” brewery with his brother Maximilien.&lt;ref name=erfgoed&gt;[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/5329 Hotel Mayer-van den Bergh] in erfgoed Vlaanderen&lt;/ref&gt; Henriette married the Cologne businessman Emil Mayer in 1857, who had moved to Antwerp to open a franchise for his family's pharmacy and spice business.&lt;ref name=erfgoed/&gt; The Mayer-Van den Berghs purchased the 'Hof van Arenberg' on the corner of Lange Gasthuisstraat and Arenbergstraat in 1861 and renovated it to suit their taste.&lt;ref name=erfgoed/&gt; They had two sons, Fritz and Oscar. After the death of her husband Emil in 1879, Henriette withdrew from society but turned to the study of art. Her oldest son Fritz broke off his studies to move back in with her and Oscar took over the family business. In 1887 Fritz took her name, and in 1888 both sons were granted noble titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museummayervandenbergh.be/en/page/henri%C3%ABtte-van-den-bergh-fritz%E2%80%99s-mother Henriëtte van den Bergh, Fritz’s mother] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz became thereafter known in the art world as 'Chev. Mayer-van den Bergh'.

==Founding a museum==
During the years her husband was alive, Henriette was probably already active as a collector, as the archives of her museum have provenance notes by her son Fritz indicating "Maman" for works purchased by her. After her son returned to live with her, he first spent time on his own numismatic collection and then turned his attention to cataloguing the family's art. In 1892, mother and son sold a large part of their collection, presumably to enable Fritz to make serious acquisitions with an eye for founding a museum. During the next nine years he became a dealer in his own right, making sales and purchases to augment his growing collection. After his untimely death, Henriette fulfilled his dream, hiring the architect Joseph Hertogs to build an adjacent building in Gothic style, and hiring advisors to help her oversee her son's estate, while securing his papers regarding the core collection that was destined for the museum. She curated the museum herself until she died, leaving a legacy that has survived to the present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8408">The '''History of early childhood care and education''' (ECCE) refers to the development of care and education of children between birth and eight years old throughout history. ECCE has a global scope, and caring for and educating young children has always been an integral part of human societies. Arrangements for fulfilling these societal roles have evolved over time and remain varied across cultures, often reflecting [[family]] and [[community]] structures as well as the social and economic roles of women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147794e.pdf|title=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2007: Strong Foundations - Early Childhood Care and Education|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, such arrangements have largely been informal, involving family, household and community members. The formalization of these arrangements emerged in the [[Nineteenth Century|nineteenth century]] with the establishment of [[kindergarten]]s for educational purposes and day nurseries for care in much of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kamerman, S.

State-led expansion of ECCE services first emerged in the [[Russian Federation]] in the early twentieth century as part of the [[Socialism|socialist]] project to foster equal participation of women and men in production and in public life, and to publicly provide education from the youngest possible age.&lt;ref&gt;Taratukhina, M. S., Polyakova, M. N., Berezina, T. A., Notkina, N. A., Sheraizina, R. M., Borovkov, M. I. 2006.

[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001279/127983e.pdf An Integrated Approach to Early Childhood Education and Care]. UNESCO Early Childhood and Family Policy Series, No. 3. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]] was another early starter having integrated [[Preschool|pre-school]] into its education system as early as 1886 and expanded its provision in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In real terms, the significant expansion of ECCE services began in the 1960s with the considerable growth in women's participation in the [[Labour Market|labour market]] and extensive developments in child and family policies in Europe and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== ECCE development in 1990s ==
The 1990s opened a new page in the history of the development of ECCE catalysed mainly by the rapid and successive ratification of the 1989 [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC). By its explicit mention of 'the child' – meaning every human being under the age of eighteen or majority – the CRC reinforced the 1960 [[UNESCO]] [[Convention and Recommendation against Discrimination in Education]] which should have covered young children in any case. With its moral force and near universal ratification, the CRC formally recognized children as holders of rights to survival and development, to be heard and to participate in decisions affecting them in accordance with their evolving capacities with their best interests and non-discrimination as overarching principles. While the CRC in Article 18 also recognizes the primary role of parents and legal guardians in the upbringing and development of children, it obliges States Parties to help them carry out these duties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second boost to the development of ECCE was the adoption of the World Declaration on [[Education For All|Education for All]] (EFA) in March 1990 in [[Jomtien Beach|Jomtien, Thailand]]. Reflecting General Comment 7, the Jomtien Declaration explicitly stated that 'learning begins at birth', and called for 'early childhood care and initial education' (Article 5). This novel recognition of ECCE as an integral part of basic education featured again in the major goals adopted at the 1990 UN World Summit for Children. Ten years later, in 2000, this expanded vision of basic education was rearmed in the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA, adopted at the World Education Forum as the first of the six EFA goals: 'Expanding and improving comprehensive ECCE especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children'. Regrettably, unlike other EFA goals, this was stated as a broad and aspirational goal without numerical targets or clear benchmarks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== ECCE Development in the 21st century ==
ECCE was further reinforced by the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), albeit only partially. Adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, two of the MDGs had direct relevance to early childhood development: (i) improving [[maternal health]], with the targets of reducing the [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] rates by three-quarters and providing universal access to [[reproductive health]] (MDG4), and (ii) reducing the [[Child mortality|under-five mortality]] rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 (MDG5). Thus, the child and maternal health aspects of ECCE became part and parcel of a global 'effort to meet the needs of the [[Poverty threshold|world's poorest]]' while childcare and early education aspects were left out.

In recent decades, ECCE has further received attention from diverse stakeholders including research communities, [[civil society]] and [[intergovernmental organization]]s which furthered understanding of its holistic and multisectoral nature. Research continues to document the multifaceted development benefits of ECCE for health, education, social and [[emotional well-being]], [[social equity]] and cohesion, the economy, employment and earnings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement''' (IDEA.org) is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization working in the area of scientific and cultural literacy. The organization was established in 1998 and incorporated in 2002, and has collaborated with museums, schools, nonprofit organizations, and public service projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=01-0702612|title=GuideStar Exchange Reports for Institute For Dynamic Education Advancement Inc|work=guidestar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lii.org/cs/lii/view/item/27964|title=ipl2: Information You Can Trust|author=ipl2|work=lii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundationcenter.org/pnd/ontheweb/otw.jhtml?id=263800010|title=Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement|author=Foundation Center|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
* '''[[WebExhibits]]''' "virtual museum" – in 1999, IDEA founded the [[WebExhibits]] [[virtual museum]], an interactive, [[virtual museum]] of science, humanities, and culture that uses information, virtual experiments, and hands-on activities that prompt visitors to think, to formulate questions, and to explore topics from a variety of angles. IDEA published research on exhibit design and usability, and advocated for the format as an effective approach to draw in visitors to complex, multidisciplinary topics.
* '''[[SpicyNodes]]''' - is a presentation method for visually browsing hierarchical information, similar to [[concept mapping]]. Several implementations of SpicyNodes have been developed by IDEA, including a web-based version built on [[Adobe Flash]] which is available as a [[Software as a service]] web site with [[Freemium|both free and paid]] versions; and as [[multitouch]] version for the [[iPad]]  released in Spring 2011 as part of the "WikiNodes" app. The web-based implementation received a "Best Website for Teaching and Learning" award in 2011 from [[American Association of School Librarians| American Association of School Librarians (AASL)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/bestlist/bestwebsitestop25.cfm|title=Best Websites for Teaching &amp; Learning 2013|work=ala.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713093151/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/bestlist/bestwebsitestop25.cfm|archivedate=2011-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted #edchat's 35 Best Web 2.0 Classroom Tools in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edudemic.com/2010/07/the-35-best-web-2-0-classroom-tools-chosen-by-you/|title=The 35 Best Web 2.0 Classroom Tools Chosen By You|work=edudemic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827104013/http://edudemic.com/2010/07/the-35-best-web-2-0-classroom-tools-chosen-by-you/|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a subject of instruction in several schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma/ECS272/readings.html|title=Winter 2010 -- ECS272|work=ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Library/Help/Courses/HU3900/HU3900tools.html|title=Gordon Library: Ask Us - WPI|work=wpi.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720155502/http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Library/Help/Courses/HU3900/HU3900tools.html|archivedate=2008-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://innovations.oise.utoronto.ca/edtech/index.php/Spicynodes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720235327/http://innovations.oise.utoronto.ca/edtech/index.php/Spicynodes |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* '''[[WikiNodes]]''' - is an app for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] which uses the [[SpicyNodes]] visualization method. It is the first tablet app for browsing Wikipedia using a [[radial tree]]  approach to visualize how articles and subsections of articles are interrelated. ([[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2011-06-13/In the news|Wikipedia's 'The Signpost']], 13 June 2011)
* '''ColoRotate''' - is a project started in January 2006 to explain to the public, students, and graphic professionals the three-dimensional nature of [[color vision]] in the eye and mind. It is related to the color-related exhibits in the WebExhibit museum. It consists of a 3D [[color space]] within which users can see color points, and manipulate them. There are several implementations of the ColoRotate approach, including a free web site, a Photoshop plugin, a web widget, and an iPad app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appappeal.com/app/colorotate/|title=ColoRotate|work=appappeal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2009/05/15/colorotate-3d-color-palette-creator-and-cs4-plugin/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707215742/http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2009/05/15/colorotate-3d-color-palette-creator-and-cs4-plugin/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-07|title=Engadget - Technology News, Advice and Features|work=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singlefunction.com/colorotateorg/|title=ColoRotate.org|work=singlefunction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo.it-enquirer.com/2010/03/21/colorotate-a-colour-picker-based-on-human-perception-of-colours/|title=ColoRotate, a colour picker based on human perception of colours|author=Erik Vlietinck|work=IT Enquirer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110223333/http://photo.it-enquirer.com/2010/03/21/colorotate-a-colour-picker-based-on-human-perception-of-colours/|archivedate=2011-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;magazine.

'''Karl Giese''' (1898 - March 1938) was a German archivist, museum curator and life partner of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magnus-hirschfeld.de/institute-for-sexual-science-1919-1933/personnel/institute-employees-and-domestic-personnel/ |title=Institute Employees and Domestic Personnel |website=www.magnus-hirschfeld.de |access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
He was the youngest of six children of a working-class family and had three brothers and two sisters. His family lived in Schulstraße 17, not far from today's subway station [[Leopoldplatz]].&lt;ref name="stolpersteine"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stolpersteine-berlin.de/biografie/7552 |title=Karl Giese |website=stolpersteine-berlin.de |access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] ===
When he was a student he met [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] after a lecture in [[Munich]] around 1918-1920.&lt;ref name="Magnus_Hirschfeld_book_gay_liberation"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Magnus Hirschfeld : the origins of the gay liberation movement |last=Dose |first=Ralf  |publisher=Verlag Hentrich &amp; Hentrich |year=2014 |isbn=9781583674376  |location=New York |translator-last=Willis |translator-first=Edward H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Giese became an employee in [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] and finally a lover of Hirschfeld. He took over the management of the archive of [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]. Hirschfeld described their relationship as a "physical-mental connection". Giese also gave lectures, curated exhibitions and wrote articles.&lt;ref name="gayberlin"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kwWjAwAAQBAJ |title=Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity |last=Beachy |first=Robert |date=18 Nov 2014 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |isbn=978-0307473134 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Giese met the British archaeologist [[Francis Turville-Petre]] and the French author and later Nobel Prize laureate [[André Gide]]. British-American writer [[Christopher Isherwood]], who lived for some months in the neighboring building, wrote about himself and Karl Giese:&lt;ref name="stolpersteine" /&gt; {{quote|Christopher saw in him the sturdy peasant youth with a girl’s heart, who long ago had fallen in love with Hirschfeld, his father-image. Karl still referred to Hirschfeld as "Papa".}}

Ellen Bækgaard, a dentist from [[Copenhagen]] and [[World League for Sexual Reform]] committee member, describes Giese in her memoirs as "woman of the house". According to Bækgaard, Giese enjoyed decorating the place and doing needlework, as well as looking after Hirschfeld's wardrobe.&lt;ref name="Magnus_Hirschfeld_book_gay_liberation" /&gt;

Karl Giese was interested in theater and acting. He was part of a theater group ''Theater der Eigenen''. Giese also had a role as the young violinist Paul Körner in [[Richard Oswald]]'s film [[Different from the Others]] &lt;ref name="stolpersteine" /&gt;

When [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] traveled on world tour in 1930, he entrusted Giese to run the affairs of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement |last=Mancini  |first=Elena  |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=9780230114395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exile in Paris ===
Hirschfeld did not return to Germany from his world journey in 1932, and Giese went to meet him in Paris. He found Hirschfeld living with another partner, 23 year old Chinese medical student Li Shiu Tong. Despite some initial jealousy, they all lived together in Paris in a ''[[menage a trois]]''.

After the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin fell victim to the Nazi Regime with books from its library burned, Giese spent several months in Brno in 1933 trying to purchase surviving literature from the Institut's archives.  He also made contact with the magazine, ''Nový Hlas: list pro sexuální reformu'' (''New Voice: Journal of Sexual Reform''), arranging the publication of some articles by both Hirschfeld and himself.

=== Later years ===
In 1934, Karl Giese was caught having sex with another man in a public bathhouse and sentenced to three months in prison on charges of "arousal of public annoyance". As a result of his imprisonment, Giese's residence permit was not extended and he was forcibly required to leave France in October 1934.&lt;ref name="stolpersteine" /&gt; He then went to Vienna and lived there for a year, studying for matriculation exams. Hirschfeld, Bækgaard and [[Norman Haire]] provided him with money for living and studying. Hirschfeld and other Giese benefactors hoped for him to study medicine in London after completing exams in Vienna.&lt;ref name="Haire_book"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Norman Haire and the Study of Sex |last=Wyndham |first=Diana  |publisher=Sydney University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9781743320068 |location=Sydney  |pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hirschfeld's death in 1935, Giese managed to return to [[Nice, France|Nice]] for the funeral. Two months before his death, Hirschfeld had named his two lovers, Li Shiu Tong and Karl Giese, as his sole heirs. However, Hirschfeld stipulated in his will that both men use their inheritance for the purposes of sexual science and not for personal use. Karl Giese was awarded the library and the objects that had been saved from the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]. Eventually he wasn't able to use his inheritance. [[Norman Haire]] privately provided Giese with financial help in the hopes he'd settle in Britain as per Hirschfeld's wishes. However, Giese moved to [[Brno]] in 1936 and lived with Karel Fein for several months before moving into his own flat.&lt;ref name="Haire_book_2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Norman Haire and the Study of Sex |last=Wyndham |first=Diana  |publisher=Sydney University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9781743320068 |location=Sydney  |pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1938 Karl Giese committed suicide in Brno. His heir, the lawyer Karl Fein, was deported and murdered by the Nazi regime in 1942. All of Giese's possessions, including his inheritance from Hirschenfeld, have since been lost.

A memorial plaque was laid in front of his former residence in Berlin-Tiergarten, John-Foster-Dulles-Allee 10 on February 9, 2016.

The '''Law Students in Action Project (LSAP)''' is the Equal Justice Works AmeriCorps project of '''Legal Assistance of Western New York''' (LAWNY). It is an [[AmeriCorps]] program administered by [[Equal Justice Works]]. Nationally, there are 18 of these projects. Individual programs vary greatly; however, all seek to engage law students in the delivery of legal services. 

== Goals ==
The goal of LSAP is twofold. First, it provides law students with pro bono opportunities with non-profit public interest law firms throughout the LAWNY service area and beyond. Secondly, by placing student volunteers at these firms, it helps the firms deliver services to their clients more effectively. In addition, LSAP is designed to encourage law students to continue engaging in public service and ''[[pro bono]]'' activities as attorneys. 

To accomplish these goals, LSAP works with public interest law firms in Western and Central New York to create placement opportunities and projects for students and to encourage the use of law students as a regular part of the delivery of legal services. LSAP also works with area law schools to promote student interest in public interest law and pro bono activities both while in law school and in the future. In addition, LSAP works to encourage area law schools to create lasting partnerships in the public interest community, create programs which promote public interest and ''pro bono'' work, and create programs and systemic changes which seek to ease the difficulties associated with such work.

== LSAP Volunteer Opportunities ==
LSAP provides numerous opportunities for [[law student]]s to volunteer both during the school year and during the summer. The Volunteer Research Assistance Team, Spanish Translation and Interpretation Assistance Team, and the [[Pro Bono]] Assistance Project are primarily remote projects in which law students can volunteer their time from home or school. Students are rarely required to work at the requesting office. Semester and winter/spring break internships offer law students the ability to get some hands-on experience in a public interest law office setting while taking classes or during their breaks. 

LSAP has a ''[[pro se]]'' divorce clinic and a re-entry clinic through its Tompkins/Tioga Neighborhood Legal Services office in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The pro se divorce clinic allows law students to assist clients with "do-it-yourself" divorces. The second clinic allows law students to provide advice to clients on prisoner re-entry issues in a supervised setting. This clinic focuses on issues such as cleaning up [[rap sheet]]s.

== Summer Associate Program ==
The Summer Associate Program is LSAP’s signature internship opportunity of the year, with SAP recruitment lasting from late summer through the winter months.

LSAP’s Summer Associate Program (SAP) combines a legal internship with substantive legal trainings, lunch discussions and social activities. The program is designed to provide students with a comprehensive experience, similar to that provided by a big firm [[summer associate]] program. For rising 3Ls, the Summer Associate Program provides them with the opportunity to seek sponsorship in the fellowship process with one of the LAWNY offices. The LAWNY offices currently have particular projects which they are interested in sponsoring, but all project applications are considered.

LSAP begins recruiting for the Summer Associate Program in the prior fall as part of the general fall recruiting season. Recruiters post the program announcement at numerous law schools across the country, which will then collect any resumes and forward them to the recruiters for review. Interested law students may also apply directly.

The 2007 program included a two-day orientation in May, a mandatory substantive training in June, and a number of social events capped off by the Summer Social in late July.

Orientation training includes discussion of the Student Handbook/LSAP Policies and Procedures, Housing, Public Benefits, [[Domestic Violence]], [[Customer|Client]] [[Interviewing]] Skills, [[Cultural Competency]], and [[Ethics]].  Substantive training has included [[Family Law]], [[Consumer Law]], Disability Advocacy (SSI/SSD), and [[Elder law (United States)|Elder Law]].

== 2008 Summer Program ==

LSAP has 35-40 openings in its Summer Associate Program. Internships are available in the following substantive areas: consumer rights, disability, domestic violence, education, elder law, employment, family law, farmworker rights, health law, housing, immigration, prisoner re-entry, and public benefits. Applications must be received no later than Friday, February 1, 2008. Because LSAP will be interviewing at a number of career fairs, the deadline for submission may be earlier for these interviewing opportunities. 

LSAP seeks dedicated, hardworking and public interest-minded students for its Summer Associate Program. Summer Associates are expected to work an average of 30 hours per week for at least 10 weeks in a given 12-week timeframe. Some placements may allow for part-time work and are indicated as such. The Summer Associate Program begins in May with a two-day mandatory orientation program. This orientation will provide summer associates with an introduction to the Law Students in Action Project and their placements, as well as the practice of public interest law. The goal of the LSAP Summer Associate Program is to provide law students with an exciting and challenging introduction to public interest law and a career in the legal profession.  

Due to programming and funding restraints, LSAP Summer Associate positions are unpaid.

Many, or perhaps most, [[law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]] grade on a [[grading curve|curve]]. The process generally works within each class, where the instructor grades each exam, and then ranks the exams against each other, adding to and subtracting from the initial grades so that the overall grade distribution matches the school's specified curve (usually a bell curve).  "The curve" is the permitted range of each letter grade that can be awarded, for example, 0-3% A+, 3-7% A, etc.  Curves vary between different law schools, as do the rules for when the curve is mandatory versus suggestive.  It is common for the curve to be mandatory for first year ("1L") courses, and for classes above a certain size.

Grading on a curve contributes to the notoriously competitive atmosphere within law schools. "The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://calis_pre-law_blog.classcaster.org/blog/archives/2006/04/18 Competition and the Mandatory Curve in Law School]," Apr. 18, 2006, CALI's Pre-Law Blog ("The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship.")    See also, Barbara Glesner Fines, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, "[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/profiles/glesnerfines/competition.htm Competition and the Curve]&lt;/ref&gt; Some law schools set their curve lower to retain scholarship funding; others set their curve higher to make their students more competitive in the job market.

The following list shows where law schools set the 50% mark for an individual class subject to the curve.  Because not all classes are curved and because professors still have discretion within the curve's ranges, where a law school sets its curve is not necessarily revealing of that school's average student GPA (whether after 1L or upon graduation).

==Irregular grading systems==
The following law schools have adopted a grading system which does not allow for the calculation of a comparable median GPA on a 4.0 scale, if any GPA is recorded at all:
* [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley Law (aka Boalt Hall)]], University of California, Berkeley, Law School – pass/no pass system with 10% of first-years receiving pass with high honors and 30% of first-year students receiving pass with honors in each class; for upper division classes (2L and 3L years) up to 15% of in a class may receive high honors and up to 45% may receive either honors or high honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/career_services/foremployers/grading.html Grading Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524011202/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/career_services/foremployers/grading.html |date=2007-05-24 }}, law.berkeley.edu, accessed June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the top student in a course may be awarded the American Jurisprudence Award. The second-highest performing student in a course may be awarded the Prosser Prize.
* [[Campbell Law School]] – mandatory median (82, or a C)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.campbell.edu/employers/class-rank-percentages.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712180724/http://law.campbell.edu/employers/class-rank-percentages.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard Law School]] – The current grading system of dean's scholar, honors, pass, low pass, and fail had at one time a recommended curve of 37% honors, 55% pass, and 8% low pass in classes with over 30 JD and LLM students,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law School Handbook of Academic Policies 2009–2010&lt;/ref&gt; but the curve is no longer enforced. Between 1970 and 2008 Harvard established a GPA cut-off required in order to obtain the summa cum laude distinction.  During that time, only 5 students achieved the GPA required for the distinction of summa cum laude (33 out of the 38 years, the top student only managed to obtain the magna cum laude distinction, for example, there was a 15-year hiatus until Lisa Ann Grow managed to obtain summa cum laude).

The '''Los Angeles Conservancy''' is a [[historic preservation]] organization in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It works to document, rescue and revitalize [[historic building]]s, places and neighborhoods in the city. The Conservancy is the largest membership based historic preservation organization in the country. The group was formed in 1978 to preserve [[Los Angeles Central Library]], which was threatened with demolition. The organization has over 7000 members and 400 volunteers. There is a volunteer Modern Committee, dedicated to the preservation of [[postwar]] architecture as well as a Historic Theaters Committee that produces the annual "Last Remaining Seats" film series of classic films in the historic [[movie palaces]] in [[downtown Los Angeles]]. The executive director since 1992 has been Linda Dishman. The Conservancy hosts an annual preservation awards ceremony at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel]] and works closely with the business, political and development communities to find preservation solutions for historic buildings.

Some of the Conservancy's biggest success stories have included [[Bullocks Wilshire]], the [[Cathedral of Saint Vibiana]], the [[Wiltern Theater]] and the [[oldest operating McDonald's]] in [[Downey, California|Downey]], CA.

In 2006, the L.A.

An '''academic minor''' is a [[college]] or [[university]] [[student]]'s declared secondary [[academic discipline]] during their [[undergraduate]] studies. As with a [[Major (academic)|major]], the college or university in question lays out a framework of required classes or class types a student must complete to earn the minor—although the latitude the student is given changes from college to college. Academic minors and majors differ in that the former is subordinate to the latter. To obtain an academic minor, a total of three years of study at a university in a selected subject is the usual requirement.

[[File:Diploma-licenciatura-ciencias-sociais-universidade-aberta.jpg|thumb|Example of a [[Bachelor's degree]] [[diploma]] in [[Social Sciences]] with Minor in Political and Administrative Science]]

Some students will prepare for their intended career with their major, while pursuing personal interests with a minor, for example, majoring in [[civil engineering]] while minoring in a [[foreign language]] or [[performing arts]]. Other students may pursue a minor to provide specific specialization and thus make themselves more attractive to employers. It is not infrequent for a [[physics]] major to minor in [[computer science]], or an [[engineering]] or [[economics]] student to minor in [[mathematics]]. Students intending to become [[secondary education]] teachers often major in their teaching subject area (for example, [[history]] or [[chemistry]]) and minor in [[education]].

==Graduate minors==
While academic minors are usually associated with undergraduate degrees as a student's secondary focus, academic minors also exist at the graduate level, particularly in U.S. institutions. Sometimes this can refer to a student's minor or secondary field within their discipline, such as a Political Science PhD student pursuing a major field in American Politics and a minor field in Political Theory, or a Religious Studies PhD student pursuing a major field in Theology and a minor field in History of Religion. 
 
However, as in undergraduate courses of study, outside graduate study minors also exist at many universities - sometimes officially and sometimes unofficially. For example, at [[Oregon State University]], Master's and PhD students are able to pursue an official graduate minor in addition to the discipline of their degree. At [[Florida State University]], graduate minors exist on an unofficial basis on the grounds that a Master's or Doctoral student takes at least 9 and at most 18 credit hours in a secondary field outside of his or her academic discipline.
Typically, an outside minor at the maximum allowed credit hours or quarter credit units (typically 18 credit hours in many public universities, or 24 credit units at others) fulfills a qualifying requirement to teach the discipline as an [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] at a [[community college]] or [[state university|state college]], and the research experience and connections from an outside minor can also be tailored toward pursuing a non-academic career related to the minor field. 
Some PhD students, pursuing an outside graduate minor, choose to integrate the minor field into their dissertation with a scholar from their minor field serving as an outside committee member on their dissertation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19864">The '''Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative''' is a program started by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] (GCI). It began in 2007 in response to the variety of new materials and technologies being used by contemporary artists in their work, and the lack of known conservation treatments for these new materials. This area was seen as a gap in the field of conservation, but also posed unique challenges when considering the intention of the artist and the physical aging that his or her materials might endure. According to Thomas F. Reese, "Conservators...must enter into the critical spirit of the works themselves if they are to save and transmit not merely decontextualized fragments but their essence to the future." &lt;ref&gt; Reese, T. F. (1999). Andy Goldsworthy's New Ruins. In Corzo, M. A. (Ed.), ''Mortality/Immortality: The Legacy of 20th-Century Art'' (pp. 25-34). Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

This program consists of various individual research projects that are looking to the conservation issue surrounding modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture, among other areas as well. The Getty Conservation Institute works collaboratively with other cultural institutions and conservation institutes on these projects, and states its goal for the program as being to making "significant and lasting impact on the field in this area." &lt;ref&gt;Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. (October 2013). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu.conservation/our_projects/science/modcon/overview.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI is able to take on this project thanks to its role within the larger J. Paul Getty Trust - the Institute has access to its broader resources, and has the opportunity to choose projects that best serve its mission: "to advance conservation practice in the visual arts, including objects, collections, architecture and sites."&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, E. (2015 September 11). The Getty: 30 years of changing the world. ''The Art Newspaper.''

==Why research modern and contemporary art?==

# Because contemporary artists are now using a countless number of different materials, there is a need for research into how these materials will age and change with climate and temperature fluctuations. Since artists are constantly creating their work in new ways, research is required to keep up with determining treatment for all of these new materials.
# Many artists today (and in the recent past) have used products that are commercially produced, and therefore, their formulas are carefully protected by the manufacturers. Conservators have a unique task in determining the nature of these materials, and also collecting samples to have available for when the product is no longer available. An example of this: house paint. 
# It has been determined that a number of modern materials are essentially unstable and show signs of deterioration much sooner than more traditional materials have. Some works have degraded so much that they are deemed worthy of storage only, and after a relatively short period of time. For this reason, there is a bit of a rush on figuring out how to best prevent this degradation, and to better track the changes that occur. 
# Time based media art: works of art that include electronics pose a particular challenge to conservators in that there is the impending threat that equipment or software will become obsolete. Conservators need to determine the best way to update the works of art to continue to make them viewable, while still maintaining the artist's intention for the work.
# Many contemporary works of art are based more on a concept than on the physical object itself. Like the other challenges conservators are facing, this factor, more so than earlier works, forces the conservator to take the artist's intentions into account when determining the best course of treatment for a work.
# Building off of the previous point, there is serious debate about whether or not the artist and/or the artist's estate should be included in conservation decisions. The issue poses ethical and legal implications, and the Getty has deemed this as a topic that needs further discussion and clarification. &lt;ref&gt;Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. (October 2013). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu.conservation/our_projects/science/modcon/overview.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Goals of the Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative==

According to the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), those participating in this research initiative are intending to address the aforementioned concerns surrounding the conservation of modern and contemporary art in the following ways:
# Conducting in-depth scientific studies into the synthetic materials being used today in an effort to better the understanding of how these modern materials behave. 
# Using a combination of scientific testing and critical assessment to develop and evaluate approaches to scientific conservation treatments. 
# Utilizing case studies that draw on collections of the collaborating institutions to gain a better understanding of the materials and methods of particular artists. 
# Organizing workshops for conservators to facilitate the transfer of scientific data into applicable conservation knowledge. 
# By organizing symposium meetings, debates, and publications, to continue the discussion on ethical and legal issues facing many conservators of contemporary art. 
# Using publications and web-based distribution, bettering the sharing of research ad information in this area with others in the field. &lt;ref&gt;Ibid. Retrieved from

==Current major research projects==

Though there are several challenges that face conservators with regard to modern and contemporary art, the CGI has focused its resources on three major areas that are in need of further research and information sharing. Because these materials and types of art objects are still rather new to the field, conservators have worked to identify the areas that require the most immediate attention. Currently, the three major projects focus on modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. (2013) The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modcon/overview.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Modern Paints Project===


The Modern Paints Project is a collaborative research project that began in response to the various new materials that contemporary artists are using in their work. Major collaborators include the Tate London, The National Gallery in Washington, DC, the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute, and several other international and domestic museums and cultural institutions. After 1920, cellulose nitrate was successfully converted into a form that could be used as a paint binder. Following this, the paints that artists were using were constantly changing and were composed of synthetic binders. While these various paints were utilized by several artists in the 20th century and up to the present day, the knowledge regarding how well any of these modern paints would withstand the passing of time is still extremely limited. Research is needed to determine the extent of the probable deterioration. &lt;ref&gt;Learner, T., Schilling, M. &amp; de la Rie, R. (2002). Modern Paints: A New Collaborative Research Project. ''Conservation Perspectives'', ''17''(3). Retrieved from http://www.getty/edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/17_3/news_in_cons1.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Thomas Learner, a senior conservation scientist at the Tate, London, published the findings of his research into the types of techniques currently being used to test and learn more about the synthetic resins and materials used in many modern commercial paints. &lt;ref&gt;Learner, T. (2004). Analysis of Modern Paints. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goals====

This project intends to increase in a significant and valuable way the amount of information available to conservators on modern paints, so that those working on objects of this sort are able to make informed decisions with regard to their treatments. This in-depth research will help conservators who study the techniques of modern painters. It also aims to assist them with determining the best storage and display conditions, and also contribute significantly to the development of safe and effective cleaning methods and other treatments. In order to do this, researchers monitor the behavior of actual art objects and conduct extensive analytical testing on materials.  &lt;ref&gt;Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Areas of focus====


'''1.''' '''Assessment of analytical methods for modern paints''':
At the beginning of this project, there were very few methods established for identifying any of the components of modern paints, but by using several analytical techniques and scientific tests, conservators have been successful in being able to identify the binding agent, types of pigments, and additives in modern paints. Through this testing, the researchers have been able to select a number of testing techniques that are commonly used to make these identifications, giving them a better idea of how to move forward with future testing on objects. &lt;ref&gt;Modern Paints: An Assessment of Analytical Methods for Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component1.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2.''' '''Study of the physical and surface properties of modern paints''':
Because these paints are still being identified, their physical characteristics are still somewhat unknown. This area of the project intends to determine how the newer materials will respond to changes in temperature and relative humidity. The methods for measuring these properties in changing environments are thermal analysis, mechanical analysis, and surface characterization. The main challenge here, despite the fact that almost all of the materials used are completely new, is keeping track of the huge amount of variation between paints and their physical makeups. &lt;ref&gt;Modern Paints: A Study of the Physical Characteristics of Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty/edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component2.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3.''' '''Evaluation of cleaning methods for modern paintings''':
This main area of focus stems from the goal to develop an established method for cleaning modern paintings. Like the analysis of the environment responses, this area of focus consists of analytical testing to monitor any potential changes that could occur with cleaning treatments. The Tate London has worked closely with the Getty on each of these components of the project, but has played a leading role in this aspect in particular. &lt;ref&gt;Modern Paints: An Evaluation of Cleaning Methods for Modern Paints. (January 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www,getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component3.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preservation of Plastics Project====

Like the Modern Paints Project, plastics are a new medium for conservators to deal with. The composition of the material is largely unknown, and the Preservation of Plastics project aims to help conservators understand why some plastics are more unstable than others. Research is required in this area because while degradation of plastics has been an ongoing issue in museums for several years, the main cause for concern is the rapid deterioration o the material with no obvious warning sign. &lt;ref&gt;Preservation of Plastics. (March 2010). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/plastics/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Goals=====
The main goal of this project is to develop strategies that improve the preservation and maintenance of objects in museum collections. Its aim is to coordinate scientific studies with the projects multiple collaborators to establish recommended practices for risks associated with handling these artifacts. &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Areas of focus=====
The larger POPART project involves five steps:
# Identification of polymer artifacts
# Collection survey
# Polymer degradation assessment
# Conservation
# Dissemination

The Getty Conservation Institute's project, the Preservation of Plastics, focuses specifically on coordinating the comparison of a wide range of analytical techniques for plastics identification and to participate in a details study into the physical and aging properties of a few key classes of polymer specifically. As with the Modern Paints project, if the conservators can learn more about these new materials being used, they can develop a procedure for how to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outdoor Sculpture Research Project====

This project stems from the recognition that outdoor sculpture is by nature particularly prone to damage but that research in this area was lacking. Conservation of outdoor painted sculpture works is especially challenging, given the uncontrolled, and often harsh, environments to which works are constantly exposed. Collaborators on the project took a step back and looked at current interests, needs, and practices in the conservation of modern and contemporary outdoor painted sculpture. 

=====Goals=====
The goals of this project, according to the Getty Conservation Institute are as follows:
• Facilitate dialogue between professionals involved in the conservation of outdoor painted sculpture (conservators, paint chemists, paint industry, artists' estates, foundations, and studios, curators, and caretakers). 
• Create guidelines for the production of paint swatches, for the documentation of paint surfaces (gloss, color and texture), and for the sharing of such information among those involved in the preservation of outdoor painted sculpture
• Collaborate with artists', estates, foundations, and studios (EFS) to develop guidelines on original paint surfaces related to their respective artists and best practices for production of EFS-approved coupons.
• Develop paints specifically formulated for the field, with improved durability and suitable working and optical properties in collaboration with the [[United_States_Army_Research_Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] and the paint industry, and in consultation with conservators and EFS
• Explore the possibility of carrying out local retouching to increase the duration between costly and invasive stripping and repainting campaigns
• Carry out a number of case studies on outdoor painted sculpture and sculpture parks to explore bridges between theory and practice

Over the long term the project seeks to build a repository of paint swatches documenting original paints and/or paints approved by EFS; to build bridges between industry and the conservation profession, and to disseminate the knowledge gained through courses and online publications. &lt;ref&gt;Outdoor Sculpture. (January 2015). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/outdoor/index.html. &lt;/ref&gt;

=====Areas of Focus=====

'''1. Documenting original paint sources:'''
Outdoor painted sculpture is unique in that the paint is an important visual element of the object itself, but the paint also serves as a protection to the metal substrate of the object. The paint layer can also work to prevent corrosion of the metal underneath. As a result, when the paint chips or peels off, the sculptures are often repainted to both improve their appearance and protect them from the elements that they are exposed to. This proves to be an issue when the sculpture is repainted an incorrect color or finish, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and the work is changed from its originally intended appearance. For this reason, documenting the original paint source for a contemporary outdoor sculpture is considered a main area of focus of this project - this would give the conservators something to refer back to before conducting any further treatments.

'''2. Analyzing and understanding paint composition:'''
Much like the Modern Paints Project, the type of paints used on outdoor sculptures are mainly commercial produced automotive or industrial paints, meaning that the complete composition of the paint is usually unknown to the conservators. For this reason, conducting testing on the paints used has been deemed essential in figuring out how to best treat these types of works.

'''3. Developing new paint systems:'''
Although good paints with excellent performance characteristics are commercially available, they may not match all the requirements necessary for conservation treatment. To address these issues the GCI has partnered with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), which has been working to investigate new paint formulations suitable for conservation—the project builds off of previous work on matte black paints for Calder carried out by the ARL in collaboration with the National Gallery, Washington DC.

'''4. Collaborating with artists' estates, foundations, and studios:'''
This area of focus is more of an ethical or philosophical discussion surrounding the involvement of artists' studios  and estates in determining guidelines for repainting outdoor sculpture.

==Impact==
From its launch, the Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative has taken an expansive approach to its research efforts regarding modern and contemporary works of art. While focusing on learning about the behaviors of new materials, specifically polymers, resins, plastics, modern paints, etc., the GCI has also considered how to best share its discoveries with conservators working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Learner, T. &amp; Coddington, J. (2015). The Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/30_2/research_initiative.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its several collaborators, the Getty Conservation Institute has organized several conferences to disseminate its findings and continue to discuss the questions and issues surrounding modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture conservation. In addition to meetings such as the Modern Paints Uncovered Symposium, hosted by the Tate Modern in May 2006, and the Object in Transition Conference held in January 2008, those involved with each project publish their findings in the Getty Conservation Institute's newsletters, as well as other conservation publications.&lt;ref&gt; Conservation Perspectives, The GCI Newsletter.

The '''National Ocean Sciences Bowl''' (NOSB) is a national, high-school science competition managed by the [http://www.oceanleadership.org/ Consortium for Ocean Leadership] (COL) which started in the 1970s (formerly the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education). It uses a quiz-bowl format, with lockout buzzers and extended team challenge questions to test students on their knowledge of [[oceanography]]. This includes the subjects of biology, chemistry, geology, geography, social science, technology, and physics. The annual competition was started in 1998, the International Year of the Ocean. The current director of NOSB is Kristen Yarincik, who is based out of Washington, DC. Currently there are [http://www.nosb.org/competitions-2/regional-competition-map/ 25 regions] in the U.S. that compete in the NOSB, each with their own regional competitions. The regional competitions are coordinated by the Regional Coordinators, who are typically affiliated with a university in their region. Each year approximately 2,000 students from 300 schools across the nation compete for prizes and a trip to the national competition. The goal of this organization is to increase knowledge of the ocean among high school students and, ultimately, magnify the public understanding of ocean research. Students who participate are eligible to apply for the National Ocean Scholar Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Ocean Scholar Program {{!}} NOSB|url = http://nosb.org/opportunities/national-ocean-scholar-program/|website = National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB)|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and scoring==
===Types of questions===
* '''Toss-up''': These are multiple choice questions that can be answered by any of the 4 active players on either team in play. Teams have 5 seconds to buzz in and answer the question. If the first team's answer is incorrect, the opposing team will get another 5 seconds to answer. The team that buzzes in first gets to answer the question. A correct answer wins the team 4 points and the right to attempt a bonus question. No conferring is allowed on toss-ups. If a player buzzes in before a moderator finishes reading the question, the buzz is called an interrupt. An incorrect answer will cause the team to lose 4 points and the question to be re-read to the opposing team. This is the only situation in which a team can lose points. However, no points are lost for incorrect answers that are not interrupts. If a player begins an answer before being verbally recognized by the moderator, this is called a blurt. The answer is ignored (not indicated correct or incorrect by the moderator) and the question is re-read to the opposing team. There is no point penalty for a blurt, but the team that blurted is disqualified from answering that question.
* '''Bonus''': These are short answer questions that only the team that correctly answered the previous toss-up may answer. Teams have 20 seconds to confer and answer this question. The team captain must begin the team's answer before time is called. A correct response is awarded with an additional 6 points.
* '''Team Challenge Question (TCQ)''': Each Team Challenge Question is an essay-type question worth up to 20 points, with partial credit awarded if necessary. Time ranges from 2 to 5 minutes for a challenge question, and the topics can be anything related to oceanography.

A single NOSB match consists of two 6-minute buzzer rounds with two Team Challenge Questions in between. Each round is made up of 20 questions pairs. After the break, the second half begins with the first toss-up that was not read in the first half and continues until time expires or all questions have been read. The most points a team can earn each round is 240 points (20 toss-ups and bonuses each plus full-credit on the two TCQs), but earning 100 or more points is considered very impressive. Teams may make substitutions only during the break.

With the exception of articles such as "a","an", and "the", answers to multiple-choice questions must be exactly as those on the written page. Prefacing answers with phrases such as "My answer is" is not acceptable.

===Science Expert Briefing (SEB)===
The SEB is a mock congressional hearing where students present science recommendations on a piece of legislation, enhancing the critical thinking elements of the competition and focusing on real-world skills. Regional bowl winners must participate in the SEB to be eligible for the national finals.

===Roles of officials===
* Moderator: Reads questions and interprets responses by comparing with the answer sheet.
* Science Judge: If the official answer is challenged by a team, the moderator may consult the Science Judge to come to a verdict.
* Rules Judge: Oversees activity in the event room and addresses any issues or misbehavior.
* Scorekeeper: Records the current score of a progressing match, including rewards and penalties. Generally a copy is saved for later reference.
* Timekeeper: Tracks the time throughout the round. In charge of stopping, starting, and resetting the clock. Also notifies teams of time benchmarks (such as 5 seconds left to answer a bonus or 45 and 15 seconds left to answer a Team Challenge Question).
* Runner: Primarily used for retrieving documents, such as the official testing material. Also brings Team Challenge Questions to and from the grading center for official scoring.

==Locations==
The National competition is held in one of the participating colleges that hold the regional bowls. These colleges draw from high schools in their area and run the regional competitions, often naming the regional according to the characteristics of the region.

The '''National Orthodox School-Shmaisani (NOS)''' is a private, non-profit, co-educational day school in Amman, Jordan. NOS recently became a candidate school for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme which it plans to start offering for Grades 11 and 12 students starting the academic year 2018/2019.

NOS was founded by – and operates under the umbrella of – the Orthodox Educational Society (OES), a national not-profit, charitable organization which has among its philanthropic aims the establishment and administration of schools and other educational institutions throughout Jordan.

Established in 1957, NOS was the first co-educational school in the country. Operating out of a rented building in the Jabal Amman, they began with only 70 students and four teachers in three grades (KG1 - Grade One). In 1965, they moved to their permanent premises in the Shmaisani area of West Amman, and they continued to grow until they celebrated their first graduating class in 1972. Today, the school’s population has grown to around 2400 students (from KG1 – Grade 12), with more than 360 staff members.

The school is an accredited member of the Council of International Schools (CIS).

NOS has also been accredited by the Healthy Schools National Accreditation Project, since 2014. The Health Schools project was initiated by The Royal Health Awareness Society in cooperation with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education (MOE).

On the academic front, NOS is an Certified Examination Centre for Edexcel Programmes and Cambridge International Programme. In April 2016, NOS became a Candidate School for the International Baccalaureate Programme.

==Academic sections==

There are five academic stages at NOS:
*  Kindergarten (KG1 and KG2) – known as Whabeh Tamari Kindergarten, in a separate but nearby location.
Stages at the NOS-Shmaisani Campus
* ·   Lower Primary Stage (Grades 1-3)
* ·    Upper Primary Stage (Grades 4-5)
* ·    Middle Stage (Grades 6-8)
* ·    High school Stage (Grades 9-12)

[[File:NSF CAREER.png|thumbnail]]
The '''National Science Foundation CAREER awards''' are the [[National Science Foundation]]'s most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through research, education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5262|title=Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SO YOU WANT TO WIN A CAREER AWARD|url = http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Columns/Career-Award.html|website = www4.ncsu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award comes with a federal grant for research and education activities for five consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Support for NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award Proposal Preparation  {{!}} STEM Initiatives|url = https://steminitiatives.osu.edu/funding/opportunities/nsf-faculty|website = steminitiatives.osu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSF grants these awards once a year. The reviewing, award and selection process is one of the most competitive within the NSF.

NSF CAREER awards support promising and talented researchers in building a foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. NSF encourages submission of CAREER proposals from junior faculty members at all CAREER-eligible organizations.

== History ==

In 1983 the [[Presidential Young Investigators]] (PYI) program was initiated. It remained active until the NSF New Young Investigators (NYI) program replaced it in 1992. Both programs were research-oriented and funded an average of 200 faculty per year. Another, more selective program began in 1992, when the [[White House]] asked NSF to institute the Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) program. The PFF awarded young faculty up to $100,000 per year for five years with no matching-fund option. The PFF also put more emphasis on education and outreach activities. In 1994, the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program was approved by NSF's [[National Science Board]]. The first awards were made in FY 1995. Several programs were terminated and their objectives incorporated into CAREER.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf01134/nsf01134.pdf|title=Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent shift occurred in 1996, when the [[Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE) program was instituted, replacing the PFF awards. Beginning in FY 1997, nominees were selected by the NSF from among the "most meritorious first year CAREER awardees supported by the CAREER program." In the same year, the CAREER program announcement termed CAREER "a premier program." When a CAREER awardee is granted a PECASE award, the funding level is adjusted to the maximum amount of $500,000 over a five-year period. A maximum of 20 PECASE awards are granted per year to NSF nominees (and 40 more to nominees of other federal agencies).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation"/&gt;

[[File:Lord Ashcroft presents Zulu at the Policy Exchange-Crossbench Film Society cropped.JPG|thumb|Michael Ashcroft]]

"'''Piggate'''" refers to an uncorroborated anecdote that during his university years former [[British prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] put a "private part of his anatomy" into a dead pig's mouth as part of an [[hazing|initiation ceremony]] for the [[Piers Gaveston Society]]. The anecdote was reported by [[Michael Ashcroft]] and [[Isabel Oakeshott]] in their unauthorised biography of Cameron, ''[[Call Me Dave]]'', attributing the story to an anonymous Member of Parliament who was a "distinguished Oxford contemporary" of Cameron's.  Extracts from the book were published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 21 September 2015, prior to its publication.

[[Downing Street]] sources responded by saying that Cameron would not dignify the anecdote with a response while friends reported him saying that it was "utter nonsense".  Cameron said later that "a very specific denial was made a week ago".

Ashcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of a photograph of the alleged incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has as yet been produced to support the anecdote.

In an interview, [[Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne#Children|Valentine Guinness]], one of the [[Piers Gaveston Society]] founders, said that Cameron "may well have attended one of their parties" but as far as he knew he was never a member.

==Anecdote==
It was alleged that, as a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], former [[British prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] inserted "a private part of his anatomy" into the mouth of a dead pig, as part of an initiation ceremony for the [[Piers Gaveston Society]]. The pig's head is said to have been resting on the lap of another society member during the act.&lt;ref name="mail"/&gt;

In their unauthorised biography of Cameron, ''[[Call Me Dave]]'', [[Michael Ashcroft]] and [[Isabel Oakeshott]] recount that a [[Member of Parliament]] and "distinguished Oxford contemporary" told the anecdote "out of the blue" at a business dinner in June 2014. They initially assumed the statement to be a joke, but the MP repeated the anecdote some weeks later, and for a third time with more detail some months after that. The MP claimed to have seen photographic evidence of the event, describing the dimensions of the alleged photograph and naming an individual who he claimed now possessed the image.&lt;ref name="mail"/&gt;

Ashcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of a photograph of the alleged incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has as yet been produced to support the anecdote. In their book, Ashcroft and Oakeshott comment that "Perhaps it is a case of mistaken identity. Yet it is an elaborate story for an otherwise credible figure to invent."&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3242504/Drugs-debauchery-making-extraordinary-Prime-Minister-years-rumours-dogged-truth-shockingly-decadent-Oxford-days-gifted-Bullingdon-boy.html | title=Drugs, debauchery and the making of an extraordinary Prime Minister | work=Daily Mail |location=London | date=20 September 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' in September 2015, Oakeshott said: "We couldn’t get to the bottom of that source’s allegations ... So we merely reported the account that the source gave us … We don’t say whether we believe it to be true".&lt;ref name="GuardianVinerJuly2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Viner|first=Katharine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth | title=How technology disrupted the truth | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=12 July 2016 | accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Channel4YouTube"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm_Bli5h0Ns  | title=David Cameron allegations: Toby Young vs Isabel Oakeshott | work=Channel 4 News | location=London | date=21 September 2015 | accessdate=18 July 2016 | author=Channel 4 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the [[Cheltenham Literature Festival]] in October 2015, Oakeshott said that the source of the allegation "could have been slightly deranged" and said that  "there is no need for burden of proof on a colourful anecdote where we’re quite upfront about our own reservations about whether to take it seriously".&lt;ref name="oakeshottsqueal"&gt;{{cite news |title =Isabel Oakeshott runs squealing from David Cameron #piggate claims |newspaper =[[The Guardian]] |location =London |date =9 October 2015 |url =https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/oct/09/isabel-oakeshott-david-cameron-piggatecall-me-dave |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdote first came to public attention when extracts from the book were published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 20 September 2015, prior to its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-pig-head-lord-ashcroft-unofficial-biography-drug-taking-claims|title=Cameron biography: Ashcroft makes new debauchery claims about student days|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11879859/David-Cameron-claims-Five-things-you-need-to-know.html|title=David Cameron claims: Five things you need to know|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Lord Ashcroft had long been a supporter of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and was its biggest donor, having donated around £10 million, before dropping his support for the party in 2013 due to conflicts with David Cameron, especially his refusal to give Ashcroft a senior role in government despite his donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Ashcroft's Cameron biography bears hallmarks of revenge job|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/lord-ashcrofts-cameron-biography-bears-hallmarks-of-revenge-job|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4043311/david-cameron-pig-gate-scandal/|title=Why David Cameron’s 'Pig-Gate' Scandal Isn't Going Away|work=TIME|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2283926/Lord-Ashcroft-Drops-support-Tories-David-Camerons-gay-marriage-obsession.html|title=I'M still a Tory... but I wonder if Cameron is: Top donor Ashcroft drops his support for the party over PM's gay marriage 'obsession'|work=Daily Mail|location=London|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have interpreted the pig story and other anecdotes in the book as Ashcroft's revenge and reignition of the feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/steerpike/2015/09/lord-ashcroft-gets-his-revenge-on-david-cameron-piggate/

==Response==
After being asked about the anecdote, Downing Street said that it would not "dignify" the claim with a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-refuses-to-comment-on-claims-that-david-cameron-put-his-genitals-in-a-dead-pigs-mouth-at-university-10510692.html|title=David Cameron says he 'will not dignify' claims he put his genitals in the mouth of a dead pig|work=The Independent|location=London|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/downing-street-stays-silent-over-claims-david-cameron-put-genitals-in-a-dead-pigs-mouth-while-at-oxford-university-10510500.html|title=Downing Street stays silent over claims David Cameron put genitals in a dead pig's mouth while at Oxford University|work=The Independent|location=London|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that Cameron had told friends the claim was "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dead-pig-allegations-are-utter-nonsense-david-cameron-tells-friends-10511399.html|title=Dead pig allegations are 'utter nonsense,' David Cameron tells friends|work=The Independent|location=London|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cameron did not post a tweet on his [[Twitter]] account until 23 September, whereupon he received a barrage of pig-sex-related replies.&lt;ref name="nsubuga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/24/david-cameron-tweeted-for-the-first-time-since-piggate-and-it-didnt-go-very-well-5405621/|title=David Cameron tweeted for the first time since #piggate and it didn’t go very well|work=Metro|author=Jimmy Nsubuga|date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allegretti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/23/david-cameron-piggate_n_8184162.html|title=David Cameron Given Searing Reaction By Twitter Users After First Post Since #Piggate|work=The Huffington Post UK|author=Aubrey Allegretti|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron joked about the situation during a talk in Oxford later that week, stating "I've had an interesting week. It's a week in which thousands of trees have died in vain, sales of [[Supertramp]] albums have gone through the roof and one man's reputation lies in ruins. I don't think Michael Ashcroft will ever recover."&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34363685|title=David Cameron jokes about Lord Ashcroft's book|date=25 September 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days after the story broke, Cameron responded to a question about the issue saying: "Everyone can see why the book was written and everyone can see straight through it. As for the specific issue raised, a very specific denial was made a week ago and I've nothing to add to that."&lt;ref name="guardian27"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/david-cameron-denies-lord-ashcroft-allegations-call-me-dave-dead-pig|title=David Cameron publicly denies Lord Ashcroft pig allegation for first time|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=27 September 2015|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the statement, Downing Street had made no on-the-record denial of the anecdote.&lt;ref name="guardian27"/&gt;   Cameron also stated that he was deferring taking action at the present time to sue Ashcroft over the allegations because he was "too busy running the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1559948/pm-says-hes-too-busy-to-sue-lord-ashcroft |title=PM Says He's 'Too Busy' To Sue Lord Ashcroft |work=Sky News |date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the specific detail that the source of the story was a contemporary of Cameron's at Oxford, speculation mounted about which of the limited number of candidates could be the source of the story. [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] vice-chairman and former MP [[Mark Field]] was initially suspected within his own party as having been the source of the anecdote due to having briefed the co-author Isabel Oakeshott. Government sources accused Field of fabricating the anecdote as a part of a leadership plot, an allegation he furiously denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Glen|title='I'm no porkie pie teller,' says MP named as 'Pig-gate' suspect as he vows to track down those who accused him|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3250491/I-m-no-porkie-pie-teller-says-MP-named-Pig-gate-suspect-vows-track-accused-him.html|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other MPs would go on to deny being the source including [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Ed Vaizey]] as Downing Street announced the launch of an investigation into the identity of the MP in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newton Dunn|first1=Tom|title=Downing Street launches ‘Ham Cam’ probe|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6652876/Downing-Street-probe-to-find-source-of-sex-act-claim.html|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Emily|url=https://twitter.com/elashton/status/645903356385472512|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=21 September 2015|title=MPs deny they are piggate source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine Guinness, one of the founders of the Piers Gaveston Society, was quoted by journalist [[Toby Young]] as saying that although David Cameron "may well have attended one of their parties", as far as he knew Cameron "was never a member of the Piers Gaveston Society", so would not have taken part in such an initiation ceremony. Guinness called the story "purely malicious gossip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/09/is-that-really-the-best-lord-ashcroft-could-dig-up/ |title=Is that really the best Lord Ashcroft could dig up? |work=The Spectator |date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young and Cameron attended Oxford together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/27/toby-young-boris-johnson-cameron|title=When Boris Johnson met Dave Cameron|author=ToYoung|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2015, James Kirkup in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "Toby Young, a Telegraph writer, [...] has investigated Mr Cameron’s university antics and found no evidence of the pig incident.

After the anecdote appeared, social media users quickly made connections to "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]", an episode of ''[[Black Mirror]]'' wherein a fictional Prime Minister has sex with a pig under duress. Series creator [[Charlie Brooker]], who wrote the episode, quickly denied any prior knowledge of the allegations, calling the situation "a complete coincidence, albeit a quite bizarre one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/9/21/9365507/piggate-david-cameron-piers-galverston|title=9 questions about David Cameron's #PigGate you were too embarrassed to ask|work=Vox|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/sep/21/pigs-prime-minister-black-mirror-ashcroft-allegation-charlie-brooker|title=Charlie Brooker on Cameron and #piggate: 'I'd have been screaming it into traffic if I'd known'|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzanne Moore]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared the incident to the story related by [[Hunter S. Thompson]] on [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s campaign tactics early in his political career. Johnson supposedly planned to spread a fabricated story that his opponent had a penchant for "[[carnal knowledge]] of his own barnyard sows". Although the story was unbelievable, Johnson's purpose, according to Thompson, was to force his opponent to discuss it even in a refutation: "But let's make the sonofabitch ''deny'' it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Journalist Solomon Hughes has argued that Ashcroft "has an 18th century attitude towards buying a place in government" and says that Ashcroft thought that his donations to the Conservative Party would provide him with a "shortcut" to a ministerial position. He says that when Cameron "didn't let Ashcroft buy a place in government" Ashcroft filled his book with "barely political smears". Hughes argues that this means the book "tells us something about our political world, but not much about David Cameron".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/lord-ashcroft-the-man-behind-call-me-dave-001|title=What the Story of the Billionaire Behind Pig-Gate Tells Us About British Politics|work=Vice|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims were made that the story was deliberately avoided by some media sources. The initial decision not to report on the anecdote by the BBC and some other broadcasters was criticised by the assistant editor of ''The Independent'', Ian Burrell, who described its choice to "dodge" the story of the day as "unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-bbcs-refusal-to-report-the-dead-pig-allegations-against-david-cameron-is-unacceptable-10511162.html|title=The BBC's decision not to report the dead pig allegations against David Cameron is unacceptable|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Ian|last=Burrell|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC covered the story from 21 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Ashcroft 'not settling scores' with David Cameron book|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34312744|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the anecdote elicited responses from other politicians as well as media such as a clip by [[Cassetteboy]] parodying [[Will Smith]]'s song "[[Gettin' Jiggy wit It]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/21/politicians-begin-to-respond-to-david-cameron-pig-gate-allegations_n_8169622.html|title=Politicians Smell Blood As They Begin To Respond To David Cameron #PigGate Allegations|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Councillors-poke-fun-Cameron-piggate-scandal/story-27844221-detail/story.html|title=Councillors poke fun at Cameron piggate scandal|work=Western Morning News|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/21/some-genius-has-mashed-up-david-camerons-speeches-into-gettin-piggy-with-it-5401675/|title=Cassetteboy has mashed up David Cameron’s speeches into ‘Gettin’ Piggy With it’|work=Metro|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an animated enactment from [[Next Media Animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloom|first1=Dan|title=Taiwanese animators take on PigGate&amp;nbsp;— and it's every bit as horrible as you think|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/taiwanese-animators-take-piggate-its-6490625|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HBO]]'s satirical news program, ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'', also covered the published anecdote, saying 'bizarre is a kind way of describing it'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/28/john-oliver-mocks-noted-swine-fellatio-enthusiast-david-cameron.html|title=John Oliver Mocks ‘Noted Swine Fellatio Enthusiast’ David Cameron|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] criticised the media's handling of the accusations, telling [[ITV News]]: "The media treatment of any politician [over] unsubstantiated allegations, be it David Cameron, me or anyone else is wrong, too much of our media is obsessed with personality politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/24/piggate-jeremy-corbyn-real-issues_n_8191464.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn Says Piggate Scandal Risks Distracting From Real Issues And World Peace |work=Huffington Post |date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] referred to the matter in the context of the upcoming British [[European Union]] [[referendum]]. After noting that there was the "In" campaign and the "Out" camp, he reflected: "And then we've got the Prime Minister. Or should I call him, in this context, piggy in the middle".&lt;ref name="dathan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-mocks-david-cameron-with-piggy-in-the-middle-jibe-10516619.html|title=Nigel Farage mocks David Cameron with 'piggy in the middle' jibe|author=Matt Dathan|date=25 September 2015|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicola Sturgeon]] of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] also made reference to the incident, accusing Cameron of being "pig-headed" with regards to the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dathan|first1=Matt|title=Nicola Sturgeon makes 'piggate' joke with accusation that David Cameron is 'pig-headed'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-makes-piggate-joke-with-accusation-that-david-cameron-is-pig-headed-a6698121.html|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=The Independent|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2015, a protest rally outside the Conservative Party conference in [[Manchester]] city centre was attended by a reported 60,000 people. A number of demonstrators carried signs or wore costume items referring to the anecdote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/04/anti-austerity-protestors-march-manchester-demonstration-conservative-party-conference|title=Anti-austerity protesters march on conservative conference|author=Pidd, Helen|date=4 October 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/609868/Manchester-anti-austerity-march-Tory-conference-turns-ugly|date=5 October 2015|title=Tories get egged as anti-austerity protesters taunt Cameron over 'pig-gate'|work=Daily Express|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one of the country's biggest [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire night]] celebrations in [[Lewes]], a large effigy of Cameron with a pig's head was processed through the town and then burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-34731830|title=Lewes Bonfire Society torches David Cameron effigy|publisher=BBC|date=5 November 2015|first=Nathalie|last=Edell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, solicitor [[Myles Jackman]] said that performing a sexual act with a dead animal would not be illegal under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. He noted that possessing a photograph of such an act would be illegal under the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] if it was produced for pornographic purposes, but not if the purpose was "satire, political commentary or simple grossness".&lt;ref name=Jackman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackman|first1=Myles|title=Is it illegal to have sex with a dead pig?

== Intelligence report leak, arrest and sentencing ==
Winner was arrested on June 3, 2017. The U.S. Department of Justice announced her arrest on June 5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Daniella |last2=Grosenick |first2=Kip |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/reality-winner-alleged-nsa-leaker-will-plead-not-guilty-lawyer-n769526 |title=Alleged NSA leaker Reality Winner to plead not guilty |work=NBC News |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after ''The Intercept'' published an article describing Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election by [[Security hacker|hacking]] a U.S. voting software supplier and sending [[Phishing#Spear phishing|spear-phishing]] emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before the November 8 election. ''The Intercept''{{'s}} story was based on a [[top-secret]] May 5, 2017, National Security Agency (NSA) document leaked to them anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Matthew|last2=Esposito|first2=Richard|last3=Biddle|first3=Sam|last4=Grim|first4=Ryan|title=Top-Secret NSA Report Details Russian Hacking Effort Days Before 2016 Election|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/|accessdate=June 6, 2017|work=The Intercept|publisher=First Look Media|date=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' had contacted the NSA on May 30 and sent copies of the documents in order to confirm their veracity. The NSA notified the FBI of the situation on June 1. According to media coverage published in VICE, an official report from the FBI noted the documents "appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=David|title=NSA leak suspect was ratted out by an office printer|url=https://news.vice.com/story/nsa-leak-suspect-was-ratted-out-by-an-office-printer|accessdate=June 6, 2017|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, the NSA did an internal audit, confirming that Winner was one of six workers who had accessed the particular documents on its classified system, but only Winner's computer had been in contact with ''The Intercept'' using a personal email account. On June 3, the FBI obtained a warrant to search Winner's electronic devices, and she was arrested.&lt;ref name=bailbloom/&gt; Both journalists and security experts have suggested that ''The Intercept''{{'s}} handling of the reporting, which included publishing the documents unredacted and including the [[printer tracking dots]], was used to identify Winner as the leaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digg.com/2017/did-intercept-burn-reality-winner|title=Did The Intercept Betray Its NSA Source With Sloppy Reporting?|first=L.V.|last=Anderson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 6, 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/06/did-the-intercept-bungle-nsa-leak/|title=Did the Intercept bungle the NSA leak?|first=Erik|last=Wemple|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 'Affidavit in Support of Application for Arrest Warrant' dated July 5, 2017, FBI Special Agent Justin C. Garrick stated: {{block quote|On June 3, 2017, your affiant spoke to WINNER at her home in Augusta, Georgia. During that conversation, WINNER admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue despite not having a "need to know," and with knowledge that the intelligence reporting was classified. WINNER further admitted removing the classified intelligence reporting from her office space, retaining it, and mailing it from Augusta, Georgia, to the News Outlet, which she knew was not authorized to receive or possess the documents.{{pb}}
WINNER further acknowledged that she was aware of the contents of the intelligence reporting and that she knew the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.{{pb}}
CONCLUSION{{pb}}
Your affiant submits that the facts set forth in this affidavit establish probable cause to believe WINNER committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 793(e). Therefore, your affiant respectfully requests this Court issue an arrest warrant for WINNER.&lt;ref name=USDoJ5Jun2017/&gt;}}

[[Julian Assange]], the founder of [[WikiLeaks]], called on the public to support Winner,&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;"{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/06/who-is-reality-winner-accused-leaker-wanted-to-resist-trump.html|title=Who is Reality Winner?

On August 29, 2017, Winner's attorneys filed a motion in U.S. District Court to suppress her statements to law enforcement, arguing that Winner was not read her [[Miranda warning|"Miranda" rights]] before being interrogated by the FBI on June 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Max|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/348532-reality-winner-moves-to-suppress-confession|title=Accused leaker Reality Winner moves to suppress statements to police|work=The Hill|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 5, 2017, Judge Brian Epps denied a second request from her defense attorneys that bail be set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/10/06/nsa-reality-winner-judge-denies-bail/|title=Judge Denies Bail for Reality Winner, Accepting Prosecutor's Dubious Allegations|first=Trevor|last=Timm|date=October 6, 2017|publisher=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, ''The Intercept'' reported that Winner's defense team is allowed to discuss the case with her, including its classified aspects, in a [[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility|"sensitive compartmented information facility"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/12/05/reality-winner-trial-nsa-russia-election/|title=The Government is trying to make it impossible for Reality Winner to defend herself in court|first=Trevor|last=Timm|date=December 5, 2017|publisher=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2018, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed a lower court order blocking Winner from posting bond, determining that no combination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence at trial, thus ensuring that she remains in jail until her trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=R.

A "Stand with Reality" campaign was formed by representatives from [[Courage to Resist]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] with the goal of "raising public awareness" to ensure that Reality Winner receives a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://standwithreality.org/|title="Stand with Reality" Support Group &amp; Defense Fund|website=Friends of Reality Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie Winner-Davis, mother of Reality Winner, called on members of the public to join this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://standwithreality.org/democracy-now-interviews-reality-winners-mom/|title=Democracy Now! interview with Reality Winner's mom|date=March 2, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2018, at a federal court in Georgia, Winner was sentenced to the agreed-upon five years and three months in prison for violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]].

'''SchoolTool''' is a [[GPL]] licensed, free [[student information system]] for schools around the world. The goals of the project are to create a simple turnkey student information system, including demographics, gradebook, attendance, calendaring and reporting for primary and secondary schools, as well as a framework for building customized applications and configurations for individual schools or states.

SchoolTool is built as a [[free software]]/[[Open-source software|open source]] software stack, licensed under the [[GNU]] [[General Public License]], Version 2, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] using the [[Zope]] 3 framework.

The sub-projects of School Tool are as follows:
* The SchoolTool Calendar and SchoolBell are calendar and resource management tools for schools available as part of the [[Edubuntu]] Linux distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SchoolTool (as included with Edubuntu) |url=http://edubuntu.org/Screenshots}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A SchoolTool student information system is being developed and tested in collaboration with schools
* CanDo is a SchoolTool-based skills tracking program developed by [[Virginia]] students and teachers to track which skills students are acquiring in their classes and at what level of competency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cando Student Competency Tracker |url=http://www.apsva.us/site/Default.aspx?PageID=8793 |accessdate=2011-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dy6e0eF7?url=http://www.apsva.us/site/Default.aspx?PageID=8793 |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SchoolTool is configured by default to act as what is often called a [[student information system]] or SIS. The focus is on tracking information related to students: demographics, enrollment grades, attendance, reporting. It is a subset of a complete “management information system” or MIS for schools, which might also cover systems like accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Basic Use of SchoolTool |url=http://book.schooltool.org/htmlhelp/features.html#basic-use-cases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SchoolTool is not a [[learning management system]], or LMS, such as [[Moodle]], although they share some overlapping feature sets, such as a gradebook. SchoolTool does not contain curriculum or learning objects.

A post on the product news page in October 2016 titled "The Future of SIELibre and SchoolTool" indicates that the primary SchoolTool developers of have moved on to other things.&lt;ref&gt;https://launchpad.net/schooltool-project/+announcements&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by a google document explaining the decision and thanking contributors for their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dI9vQb8R7zRoYpSVvFmjj-Wlptvyld1erT0G8AWRYVw/edit&lt;/ref&gt;

==SchoolTool Features==

* Customizable demographics;
* Student contact management;
* Calendars for the school, groups, and individuals;
* Resource booking;
* Teacher gradebooks;
* Class attendance;
* Report card generation.

'''Social network analysis''' ('''SNA''') is the process of investigating social structures  through the use of [[Network theory|networks]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jis.sagepub.com/content/28/6/441.short|title = Social network analysis: a powerful strategy, also for the information sciences|last = Otte|first = Evelien|date = 2002|journal = Journal of Information Science|doi = 10.1177/016555150202800601|pmid = |access-date = 2015-03-23|last2 = Rousseau|first2 = Ronald|volume=28|issue = 6|pages=441–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; It characterizes networked structures in terms of ''nodes'' (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ''ties'', ''edges'', or ''links'' (relationships or interactions) that connect them.

Social network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern [[sociology]].  It has also gained a significant following in [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[demography]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[political science]], [[social psychology]], [[development studies]], [[sociolinguistics]], and [[computer science]] and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the [[Social network analysis software|list of SNA software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19699776|title=Facebook friends mapped by Wolfram Alpha app|work=BBC News|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/30/wolfram-alpha-launches-personal-analytics-reports-for-facebook/|title=Wolfram Alpha Launches Personal Analytics Reports For Facebook|work=Tech Crunch|date= August 30, 2012|author=Frederic Lardinois|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irh.org/?q=content/terikunda-j%C3%A9kulu-project Institute of Reproductive Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ivaldi M.|author2=Ferreri L.|author3=Daolio F.|author4=Giacobini M.|author5=Tomassini M.|author6=Rainoldi A.|title=We-Sport: from academy spin-off to data-base for complex network analysis; an innovative approach to a new technology|journal=J Sports Med and Phys Fitnes |volume=51|issue=suppl. 1 to issue 3}} The social network analysis was used to analyze properties of the network We-Sport.com allowing a deep interpretation and analysis of the level of aggregation phenomena in the specific context of sport and physical exercise.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], who wrote about the importance of studying patterns of relationships that connect social actors. Social scientists have used the concept of "[[social networks]]" since early in the 20th century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In the 1930s [[Jacob Moreno]] and [[Helen Hall Jennings|Helen Jennings]] introduced basic analytical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freeman, L. C. |year=2004 |title= The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |publicationplace=Vancouver, B. C. |publisher=Empirical Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, [[John Arundel Barnes]] started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded [[Group (sociology)|groups]] (e.g., tribes, families) and social [[Categorization|categories]] (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as [[Ronald Burt]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[David Krackhardt]], [[Edward Laumann]], [[Anatol Rapoport#Social network analysis|Anatol Rapoport]], [[Barry Wellman]], [[Douglas R. White]], and [[Harrison White]] expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; Even in the study of literature, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H.K. | last2 = Gerhards | first2 = J. | last3 = Romo | first3 = F.P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wouter De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = 2003 | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = 5–6| pages = 305–27 | doi=10.1016/s0304-422x(03)00035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burgert Senekal.&lt;ref&gt;Senekal, B. A. 2012. Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA), LitNet Akademies 9(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, social network analysis has found applications in various academic disciplines, as well as practical applications such as countering [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism]].

==Metrics==
[[File:Graph betweenness.svg|right|thumb|Hue (from red=0 to blue=max) indicates each node's [[betweenness centrality]].]]

===Connections===
[[Homophily]]: The extent to which actors form ties with similar versus dissimilar others. Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values or any other salient characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McPherson, N.|author2=Smith-Lovin, L.|author3=Cook, J.M. |year=2001 |title=Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=27 |pages=415–444 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homophily is also referred to as [[assortativity]].

Multiplexity: The number of content-forms contained in a tie.&lt;ref name = "Podo97"/&gt; For example, two people who are friends and also work together would have a multiplexity of 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kilduff, M.|author2=Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplexity has been associated with relationship strength.

Mutuality/Reciprocity: The extent to which two actors reciprocate each other's friendship or other interaction.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

[[Triadic closure|Network Closure]]: A measure of the completeness of relational triads. An individual's assumption of network closure (i.e. that their friends are also friends) is called transitivity. Transitivity is an outcome of the individual or situational trait of [[Closure (psychology)|Need for Cognitive Closure]].&lt;ref name="Flyn10"/&gt;

[[Propinquity]]: The tendency for actors to have more ties with geographically close others.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

===Distributions===
[[Bridge (graph theory)|Bridge]]: An individual whose weak ties fill a [[Structural holes|structural hole]], providing the only link between two individuals or clusters. It also includes the shortest route when a longer one is unfeasible due to a high risk of message distortion or delivery failure.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"&gt;{{cite book | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centrality]]: Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the "importance" or "influence" (in a variety of senses) of a particular node (or group) within a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hansen, Derek|title=Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2010|isbn=978-0-12-382229-1|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbxPm93PRY8C&amp;pg=PA32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liu, Bing|title=Web Data Mining: Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-19459-7|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnCi0Cq1YVkC&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=364–367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tsvetovat, Maksim |author2=Kouznetsov, Alexander|lastauthoramp=y|title=Social Network Analysis for Startups: Finding Connections on the Social Web|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4493-1762-1|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVOxjkoLSiEC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of common methods of measuring "centrality" include [[betweenness centrality]],&lt;ref name="comprehensive"/&gt; [[closeness centrality]], [[eigenvector centrality]], [[alpha centrality]], and [[degree centrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Opsahl | first1 = Tore | last2 = Agneessens | first2 = Filip | last3 = Skvoretz | first3 = John | title = Node centrality in weighted networks: Generalizing degree and shortest paths | doi = 10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.006 | year = 2010 | pages = 245–251 | volume = 32 | journal = Social Networks | url=http://toreopsahl.com/2010/04/21/article-node-centrality-in-weighted-networks-generalizing-degree-and-shortest-paths/ | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dense graph|Density]]: The proportion of direct ties in a network relative to the total number possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Social Network Analysis|title=Field Manual 3-24: Counterinsurgency|publisher=Headquarters, [[Department of the Army]]|pages=B–11 – B–12|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xu, Guandong |title=Web Mining and Social Networking: Techniques and Applications|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7734-2|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXo9zKeYa6cC&amp;pg=PA25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance: The minimum number of ties required to connect two particular actors, as popularized by [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[small world experiment]] and the idea of 'six degrees of separation'.

Structural holes: The absence of ties between two parts of a network.  Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an [[entrepreneur]] a competitive advantage.  This concept was developed by sociologist [[Ronald Stuart Burt|Ronald Burt]], and is sometimes referred to as an alternate conception of social capital.

Tie Strength: Defined by the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocity (i.e. mutuality).&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"/&gt; Strong ties are associated with homophily, propinquity and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridges.

===Segmentation===
Groups are identified as '[[clique]]s' if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, '[[social circle]]s' if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as [[Structural cohesion|structurally cohesive]] blocks if precision is wanted.&lt;ref name="uci"/&gt;

[[Clustering coefficient]]: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater 'cliquishness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=346–347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by [[Social cohesion|cohesive bonds]]. [[Structural cohesion]] refers to the minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.&lt;ref name="asanet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pattillo, Jeffrey|chapter=Clique relaxation models in social network analysis|editor1=Thai, My T.|editor2=Pardalos, Panos M.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Handbook of Optimization in Complex Networks: Communication and Social Networks|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4614-0856-7|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdRdcHxQQLQC&amp;pg=PA149|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modelling and visualization of networks==
Visual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html|author=Linton C. Freeman|title=Visualizing Social Networks|journal=Journal of Social Structure|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamdaqa|first=Mohammad |author2=Tahvildari, Ladan |author3=LaChapelle, Neil |author4=Campbell, Brian|title=Cultural Scene Detection Using Reverse Louvain Optimization|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=2014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000124|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2014.01.006|volume=95|pages=44–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Bacher, R.|year=1995|title=Graphical Interaction and Visualization for the Analysis and Interpretation of Contingency Analysis Result|conference=Proceedings of the 1995 Power Industry Computer Applications|pages=128–134|location=Salt Lake City, USA|publisher=IEEE Power Engineering Society|doi=10.1109/PICA.1995.515175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caschera | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Ferri | first2 = F. | last3 = Grifoni | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = SIM: A dynamic multidimensional visualization method for social networks | url = | journal = PsychNology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 291–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Social network analysis software|analytic software]] have modules for network visualization. Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information, but care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses.&lt;ref name="interpreting"/&gt;

[[Signed graph]]s can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of "balanced" and "unbalanced" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] where the product of all the signs are positive. According to [[balance theory]], balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balanced and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed [[social network graph]]s can be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cartwright, D. |author2=[[Frank Harary]]|year=1956|url=http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cartwright56balance.pdf|title=Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=63|issue=5|pages=277–293|doi=10.1037/h0046049}} Link from [[Stanford University]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change, different approaches of participatory network mapping have proven useful. Here participants / interviewers provide network data by actually mapping out the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. An example of a pen-and-paper network mapping approach, which also includes the collection of some actor attributes (perceived influence and goals of actors) is the * [[Net-map toolbox]]. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.&lt;ref name="visualizing"/&gt;

===Social networking potential===
{{Cleanup|section|reason=More careful cleanup after merge required|date=December 2015}}
Social networking potential (SNP) is a numeric [[coefficient]], derived through [[algorithm]]s&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Anger, I., &amp; Kittl, C. (2011, September). Measuring influence on Twitter. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies (p. 31). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riquelme, F., &amp; González-Cantergiani, P. (2016). Measuring user influence on Twitter: A survey. Information Processing &amp; Management. 52, p. 949-975.&lt;/ref&gt; to represent both the size of an individual's [[social network]] and their ability to influence that network. A close synonym is the [[Social marketing intelligence#Alpha users|Alpha User]], a person with a high SNP.

SNP coefficients have two primary functions:
#the [[categorization|classification]] of individuals based on their social networking potential, and
#the weighting of [[wikt:respondent|respondents]] in quantitative [[marketing research]] studies.

By calculating the SNP of respondents and by [[Behavioral targeting|targeting]] High SNP respondents, the [[Persuasion|strength]] and [[relevance]] of quantitative marketing research used to drive [[viral marketing]] strategies is enhanced.

[[Variable (research)|Variables]] used to calculate an individual's SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym "SNP" and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual's social networking potential were described in the white paper "Advertising Research is Changing" (Gerstley, 2003) See [[Viral Marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(Hrsg.)|first1=Sara Rosengren|title=The Changing Roles of Advertising|date=2013|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658023645|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783658023645|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book&lt;ref&gt;Ahonen, T. T., Kasper, T., &amp; Melkko, S. (2005). 3G marketing: communities and strategic partnerships. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of [[social marketing intelligence]] was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen &amp; Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco ([[University College London|UCL]]) presents at [[TEDx]] the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the [[potential energy]] that users generate and companies should use, stating that "SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMilano-Nicola-Greco-on-math;search%3Atag%3A"technology"|title=Watch "TEDxMilano - Nicola Greco - on math and social network" Video at TEDxTalks|work=TEDxTalks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
{{see also|Social network analysis (criminology)}}
Social network analysis is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines.  Some common network analysis applications include data aggregation and [[data mining|mining]], network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, [[social sharing]] and filtering, [[recommender system]]s development, and [[link prediction]] and entity resolution.&lt;ref name="Golbeck" /&gt; In the private sector, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, [[information system]] development analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aram|first1=Michael|last2=Neumann|first2=Gustaf|title=Multilayered analysis of co-development of business information systems|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015-07-01|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0030-8|url=http://www.jisajournal.com/content/pdf/s13174-015-0030-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing, and [[business intelligence]] needs (see [[social media analytics]]).  Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and [[media use]], and [[Collaborative problem-solving group|community-based problem solving]].

=== Security applications ===
Social network analysis is also used in intelligence, [[counter-intelligence]] and [[law enforcement]] activities. This technique allows the analysts to map a clandestine or covert organization such as a [[espionage]] ring, an organized crime family or a street gang. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) uses its [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[mass surveillance|mass]] [[computer surveillance|electronic surveillance]] programs to generate the data needed to perform this type of analysis on terrorist cells and other networks deemed relevant to national security. The NSA looks up to three nodes deep during this network analysis.&lt;ref name="nsa_degrees"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/nsa-surveillance-house-hearing|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA warned to rein in surveillance as agency reveals even greater scope}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial mapping of the social network is complete, analysis is performed to determine the structure of the network and determine, for example, the leaders within the network.&lt;ref name="nsa_how"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltonto.com/2013/how-the-nsa-uses-social-network-analysis-to-map-terrorist-networks/|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=19 Jul 2013|title=How The NSA Uses Social Network Analysis To Map Terrorist Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows military or law enforcement assets to launch capture-or-kill [[decapitation attack]]s on the [[high-value targets]] in leadership positions to disrupt the functioning of the network.
The NSA has been performing social network analysis on [[call detail record]]s (CDRs), also known as [[metadata]], since shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="NSA_SNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/05/70888|title=NSA Using Social Network Analysis|date=12 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa_usa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_the_nsa_does_social_network_analysis.html|date=11 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textual analysis applications ===
Large textual corpora can be turned into networks and then analysed with the method of social network analysis. In these networks, the nodes are Social Actors, and the links are Actions. The extraction of these networks can be automated, by using parsers. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sudhahar S, De Fazio G, Franzosi R, Cristianini N|year=2013|title=Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora|journal=Natural Language Engineering|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–32|doi=10.1017/S1351324913000247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Internet applications ===
Social network analysis has also been applied to understanding online behavior by individuals, organizations, and between websites. [[Hyperlink]] analysis can be used to analyze the connections between [[website]]s or [[Web page|webpages]] to examine how information flows as individuals navigate the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OSTERBUR|first=MEGAN|last2=KIEL|first2=CHRISTINA|date=2016-05-02|title=A hegemon fighting for equal rights: the dominant role of COC Nederland in the LGBT transnational advocacy network|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/glob.12126|journal=Global Networks|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=234–254|doi=10.1111/glob.12126|issn=1470-2266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between organizations has been analyzed via hyperlink analysis to examine which organizations within an issue community.&lt;ref&gt;Osterbur, Megan E. and Christina Kiel.

==== Social Media Internet Applications ====
Social network analysis has been applied to social media as a tool to understand behavior between individuals or organizations through their linkages on social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Haewoon|last2=Lee|first2=Changhyun|last3=Park|first3=Hosung|last4=Moon|first4=Sue|date=2010-04-26|title=What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772690.1772751|publisher=ACM|pages=591–600|doi=10.1145/1772690.1772751|isbn=9781605587998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer-supported collaborative learning===
One of the most current methods of the application of SNA is to the study of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL). When applied to CSCL, SNA is used to help understand how learners collaborate in terms of amount, frequency, and length, as well as the quality, topic, and strategies of communication.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laat|first=Maarten de|last2=Lally|first2=Vic|last3=Lipponen|first3=Lasse|last4=Simons|first4=Robert-Jan|date=2007-03-08|title=Investigating patterns of interaction in networked learning and computer-supported collaborative learning: A role for Social Network Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4|journal=International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=87–103|doi=10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, SNA can focus on specific aspects of the network connection, or the entire network as a whole. It uses graphical representations, written representations, and data representations to help examine the connections within a CSCL network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When applying SNA to a CSCL environment the interactions of the participants are treated as a social network. The focus of the analysis is on the "connections" made among the participants – how they interact and communicate – as opposed to how each participant behaved on his or her own.

====Key terms====
There are several key terms associated with social network analysis research in computer-supported collaborative learning such as: '''density''', '''centrality''', '''indegree''', '''outdegree''', and '''sociogram'''.

* '''Density''' refers to the "connections" between participants.  Density is defined as the number of connections a participant has, divided by the total possible connections a participant could have.  For example, if there are 20 people participating, each person could potentially connect to 19 other people. A density of 100% (19/19) is the greatest density in the system.  A density of 5% indicates there is only 1 of 19 possible connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centrality''' focuses on the behavior of individual participants within a network.  It measures the extent to which an individual interacts with other individuals in the network.  The more an individual connects to others in a network, the greater their centrality in the network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In-degree and out-degree variables are related to centrality.

* '''In-degree''' centrality concentrates on a specific individual as the point of focus; centrality of all other individuals is based on their relation to the focal point of the "in-degree" individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Out-degree''' is a measure of centrality that still focuses on a single individual, but the analytic is concerned with the out-going interactions of the individual; the measure of out-degree centrality is how many times the focus point individual interacts with others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A '''sociogram''' is a visualization with defined boundaries of connections in the network. For example, a sociogram which shows out-degree centrality points for Participant A would illustrate all outgoing connections Participant A made in the studied network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Unique capabilities====
Researchers employ social network analysis in the study of computer-supported collaborative learning in part due to the unique capabilities it offers. This particular method allows the study of interaction patterns within a [[Networked learning|networked learning community]] and can help illustrate the extent of the participants' interactions with the other members of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The graphics created using SNA tools provide visualizations of the connections among participants and the strategies used to communicate within the group. Some authors also suggest that SNA provides a method of easily analyzing changes in participatory patterns of members over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Palonen, T.|author2= Hakkarainen, K. B.|lastauthoramp=y|editor1=Fishman|editor2=S. O'Connor-Divelbiss|title=Patterns of Interaction in Computer-Supported Learning: A Social Network Analysis|conference=Fourth International Conference of the Learning Sciences|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum|pp=334–339|url=http://www.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Palonen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of research studies have applied SNA to CSCL across a variety of contexts. The findings include the correlation between a network's density and the teacher's presence,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a greater regard for the recommendations of "central" participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martı́nez|first=A.|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Y.|last3=Rubia|first3=B.|last4=Gómez|first4=E.|last5=de la Fuente|first5=P.|date=2003-12-01|title=Combining qualitative evaluation and social network analysis for the study of classroom social interactions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131503000824|journal=Computers &amp; Education|series=Documenting Collaborative Interactions: Issues and Approaches|volume=41|issue=4|pages=353–368|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2003.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; infrequency of cross-gender interaction in a network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Cho, H.|author2=Stefanone, M.|author3=Gay, G|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Social information sharing in a CSCL community|conference=Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|pages=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relatively small role played by an instructor in an [[asynchronous learning]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aviv, R.|author2=Erlich, Z.|author3=Ravid, G.|author4=Geva, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Network analysis of knowledge construction in asynchronous learning networks|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=7|issue=3|pp=1–23|citeseerx=10.1.1.2.9044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other methods used alongside SNA====
Although many studies have demonstrated the value of social network analysis within the computer-supported collaborative learning field,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; researchers have suggested that SNA by itself is not enough for achieving a full understanding of CSCL. The complexity of the interaction processes and the myriad sources of data make it difficult for SNA to provide an in-depth analysis of CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|title=Groupware: Design, Implementation, and Use|last=Daradoumis|first=Thanasis|last2=Martínez-Monés|first2=Alejandra|last3=Xhafa|first3=Fatos|date=2004-09-05|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540230168|editor-last=Vreede|editor-first=Gert-Jan de|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=289–304|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|editor-last2=Guerrero|editor-first2=Luis A.|editor-last3=Raventós|editor-first3=Gabriela Marín}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers indicate that SNA needs to be complemented with other methods of analysis to form a more accurate picture of collaborative learning experiences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

A number of research studies have combined other types of analysis with SNA in the study of CSCL. This can be referred to as a multi-method approach or data [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulation]], which will lead to an increase of evaluation [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] in CSCL studies.

* Qualitative method – The principles of qualitative case study research constitute a solid framework for the integration of SNA methods in the study of CSCL experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Karen E.|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Art of Case Study Research|jstor=329758|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=556–557|doi=10.2307/329758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Understanding by Design''', or '''UbD''', is an educational planning approach. UbD is an example of [[backward design]], the practice of looking at the outcomes in order to design [[curriculum]] units, performance [[Educational assessment|assessments]], and classroom instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, J. (nd) "Education book reviews: McTighe, Jay &amp; Wiggins, Grant (2005). Understanding by Design. Second Edition. Alexandria, Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development." Missouri State University. Retrieved 6/5/07.&lt;/ref&gt; UbD focuses on teaching to achieve understanding. It is advocated by Jay  McTighe and Grant Wiggins in their  ''Understanding by Design'' (1998), published by the [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]].&lt;ref name="GW.org"&gt;(nd) [http://www.grantwiggins.org/ubd.html Authentic Education]. GrantWiggins.Org. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubdexchange.org/web_resources/UbD_Overview/learn_more.cfm Learn More]. Understanding by Design website. Retrieved 6/7/10.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding by Design and UbD are [[registered trademark]]s of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD).

==Backward design==

{{main|Backward design}}
Understanding by Design relies on what Wiggins and McTighe call "backward design" (also known as "backwards planning"). Teachers, according to UbD proponents, traditionally start curriculum planning with activities and textbooks instead of identifying classroom learning goals and planning towards that goal. In backward design, the teacher starts with classroom outcomes and then plans the curriculum, choosing activities and materials that help determine student ability and foster student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, G. (nd) [http://xnet.rrc.mb.ca/glenh/understanding_by_design.htm Multiple methods of assessment]. Red River College. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The backward design approach has three stages.  Stage 1 is identification of desired results for students. This may use content standards, common core or state standards. Stage 1 defines "Students will understand that..." and lists essential questions that will guide the learner to understanding. Stage 2 is assessing learning strategies. Stage 3 is listing the learning activities that will lead students to your desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiggins and McTighe|title=Understanding by Design|year=2006|publisher=Pearson: Merrill Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-195084-3|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching for understanding==
In their article on science education, Smith and Siegel argue "that education aims at the imparting of knowledge: students are educated in part so that they may come to know things".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., &amp; Siegel, H. (2004). Knowing, Believing, and Understanding: What Goals for Science Education? Science &amp; Education, 13(6), 553-582. doi:10.1023/B:SCED.0000042848.14208.bf&lt;/ref&gt; While a student can know a lot about a particular subject, teachers globally are beginning to push their students to go beyond simple recall. This is where understanding plays an important role. The goal of Teaching for Understanding is to give students the tools to take what they know, and what they will eventually know, and make a mindful connection between the ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, G., &amp; McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by Design (Expanded 2nd ed.). Alexandria, Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt; In a world that is filled with data, teachers are only able to help students learn a small number of ideas and facts. As such, it is important that we give students the tools needed to decipher and understand the ideas. This transferability of skills is at the heart of McTighe and Wiggins' technique. If a student is able to transfer the skills they learn in the classroom to unfamiliar situations, whether academic or non-academic, they are said to truly understand.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., &amp; Siegel, H. (2004). Knowing, Believing, and Understanding: What Goals for Science Education? Science &amp; Education, 13(6), 553-582. doi:10.1023/B:SCED.0000042848.14208.bf&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching for Understanding had been used as a framework for developing literacy education for TESOL students, see Pearson and Pellerine (2010) &lt;ref&gt; Pearson and Pellerine (2010) Teaching for Understanding in Higher Education: A Framework for Developing Literacy within a TESOL Context. http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
Since its foundation in 2002, VU has expanded operations to reach more than one hundred cities throughout the country with more than 160 associated institutions providing infrastructure support to students.

Virtual University has two types of campuses. First ones are its own campuses which are called its offices. Its head office is located in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vu.edu.pk/Contact.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Second ones are called private virtual campuses (PVC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vu.edu.pk/pages/PVCRules.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and run by the private organizations (more commonly known as affiliated campuses).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vu.edu.pk/PVCs/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distant teaching method==
VU is one of two Pakistani universities which provide [[distance education]] (the first one is [[Allama Iqbal Open University]]). The students can get lectures without going to the campuses of VU. VU lectures can be seen on VU's cable channels (VTV1, VTV2, VTV3 &amp; VTV4) on daily motion and YouTube.&lt;ref name="Distant Teaching"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distant Learning|url=http://www.vu.edu.pk/|publisher=Virtual University|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''White Stag Leadership Development Program''', founded in 1958, is a summer camp for youth 11-18 led by two California-based [[501(c)3|non-profits]] that sponsor leadership development activities. The teen youth staff of the two programs develop and produce several week-long leadership summer camps every year for several hundred youth from Central and Northern California and a few youth from other states and countries. The outdoors program is based on hands-on learning methods to develop competencies.

The program was founded on the [[Monterey Peninsula]], [[California]], in 1958 by Dr. [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], a Hungarian immigrant who taught at the language school. In the 21st century, there are two programs in California: one in Concord, sponsored by the White Stag Association, and one in Monterey, sponsored by the White Stag Leadership Development Academy. Bánáthy drew from his youth experience at the [[4th World Scout Jamboree|1933 World Jamboree]] in [[Gödöllő]], Hungary; he named the program after the mythological [[white stag]] used as an emblem at the jamboree. Years later, in June 1951 Bánáthy met two other Hungarians teaching at the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]]. They had all escaped Hungary before [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet occupation]], Joe Szentkiralyi and Paul Sujan, who had also attended the 1933 World Jamboree. They were initially assisted by a local American Scouter, Fran Peterson.

As [[Monterey Bay Area Council]] Training Chairman, Bánáthy developed a program to train Scouts in leadership skills. He collaborated with research psychologist Paul Hood, who was leader of Task NCO (Non-Commissioned  Officer), a U.S. Army project that assessed the essential leadership skills of [[non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned leaders]]. As part of his Master's thesis, Bánáthy identified eleven specific [[leadership]] competencies that he taught in the program's summer camp. The efforts of the four men, assisted by Maury Tripp, rapidly gained the attention of the National Council of the  Boy Scouts of America. They conducted extensive research that validated Bánáthy's leadership model and developed its own version for nationwide use. They introduced the leadership competencies during the 1970s into both the adult [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] program and youth-focused [[National Youth Leadership Training]]. These two programs had originally focused primarily on teaching [[Scoutcraft]] skills and the [[Patrol Method]]. The change to teaching leadership was a marked cultural shift for how both adults and youth were trained in the skills of Scouting.

== History ==

Bánáthy and two of his co-founders have claimed their joint experiences at the Fourth World Scout Jamboree (1933)  in [[Gödöllő]], Hungary, were highly influential in their lives. They drew from this in developing the White Stag program.

At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was kneeling by his campfire when three uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count [[Paul Teleki]], the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General [[Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas]], a general staff officer of the [[Military of Hungary|Royal Hungarian Army]]; and [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the British hero of the [[Boer War]] and [[Chief Scout (The Scout Association)|Chief Scout of the World]]. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on a job well done and rode on.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pinebhb"&gt;{{cite web| title=Béla's Story: Scouting in Hungary, 1925 – 1937| url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| first=Lew| last=Orans| accessdate=2008-08-15| publisher=PineTreeWeb.com| date=December 14, 1996| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228062045/http://pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| archivedate=February 28, 2003| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

Bánáthy briefly met fellow scout Joseph Szentkiralyi. Hungarian [[Sea Scouts|Sea Scouter]] Paul Ferenc Sujan's camp was visited by Baden-Powell, who asked to taste some of his soup.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt; American Maury Tripp attended the Jamboree from [[Saratoga, California]]. These four Scouts would later play instrumental roles in forming the White Stag program on the [[Monterey Bay Area|Monterey Peninsula]]. At the conclusion of the Jamboree, Baden-Powell gave a farewell speech in which he challenged the Scouts present to pursue the ideals represented by the White Stag.

{{cquote|Each one of you wears the badge of the White Stag of Hungary. I want you to treasure that badge when you go from here and to remember that, like the Golden Arrow, it also has its message and its meaning for you.

The Hungarian hunters of old pursued the miraculous Stag, not because they expected to kill it, but because it led them on in the joy of the chase to new trails and fresh adventures, and so to capture happiness. You may look on that White Stag as the pure spirit of Scouting, springing forward and upward, ever leading you onward and upward to leap over difficulties, to face new adventures in your active pursuit of the higher aims of Scouting—aims which bring you happiness.

These aims are to do your duty wholeheartedly to God, to your country, and to your fellow man by carrying out the Scout Law. In that way you will, each one of you, help to bring about God's kingdom upon earth—the reign of peace and goodwill.

Therefore, before leaving you, I ask you Scouts this question—Will you do your best to make friendship with others and peace in the world?&lt;ref name="au-revior"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/1933-wj4-news47.htm | title = Au Revoir—Not Goodbye! | first = Lew | last = Orans | date = October 2, 1998 | publisher = PineTreeWeb.com | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120061147/http://www.pinetreeweb.com/1933-wj4-news47.htm | archivedate = November 20, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This challenge and the myth of the White Stag inspired Bánáthy.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; During [[World War II]], he was a junior officer in the [[Military of Hungary|Royal Hungarian Army]].&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/autobio_bela.html|title=Autobiography: Béla H. Bánáthy|year=2002|publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=2010-04-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201151459/http://whitestag.org/history/founders/autobio_bela.html|archivedate=2010-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being seriously wounded during combat in Russia, through the connections he made at the World Jamboree, he was invited by General [[Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas|Farkas]] to join the faculty of the Hungarian Royal Academy. While there he served on the National Council of the [[Magyar Cserkészszövetség|Hungarian Scout Association]] and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory" /&gt; Barely escaping Soviet capture (and likely execution) at the end of World War II, Bánáthy reached the United States in June 1951. He had been hired to teach at the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] at Monterey, California.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory" /&gt; There he became reacquainted with Joe Szentkiralyi, whom he had met at the Fourth World Jamboree.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

Joseph Szentkiralyi had also barely survived World War II.&lt;ref name="stclair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_joseph_szentkiralyi.html|title=Joseph St. Clair|publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=2010-04-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503043643/http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_joseph_szentkiralyi.html|archivedate=2010-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family had previously lived in the United States in 1939, where Szentkiralyi worked in New York City. At the start of World War II, they were deported as [[enemy alien]]s to Hungary. Because he spoke English, Szentkiralyi was assigned to watch over the crew members of the first American [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 bomber]] to crash land in Hungary. When the crew told him sensitive information, he was ordered to reveal the information to his superiors. Citing the [[Geneva Convention]], he refused.&lt;ref name="stclair"/&gt; The authorities prepared to [[court-martial]] him, and Szentkiralyi fled. During a time of frequent Allied aerial bombing raids, he hid in the upper floors of apartment buildings. During one bombing raid a {{convert|500|lb|kg}} bomb crashed through and landed on the floor above him, but it did not explode.&lt;ref name="wshistory" /&gt; Szentkiralyi and his family later narrowly survived the [[Siege of Budapest]].&lt;ref name="stclair"/&gt;

After the war ended, Szentkiralyi as a translator for the American Embassy in [[Budapest]]. However, this put him in a vulnerable position as the [[Communist]]s hardened their [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|grip on power]]. Because he had lived in the United States and spoke English, he knew he would fall under suspicion. People he knew began to disappear, including a friend who worked at the U.S. Embassy. Within a few days he found a note on his desk that read, "You are next."&lt;ref name="stclair"/&gt; With American assistance, he immediately fled Hungary for [[Switzerland]]. He and his family returned to New York City for a few months, and Szentkiralyi applied for a position as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School. The Army hired him in the summer of 1948 and he founded theHungarian Department.&lt;ref name="stclair"/&gt;

Starting in 1951, four men who had been Scouts at the 1933 World Jamboree encountered each other at Monterey. Joseph Szentkiralyi (who later Anglicized his name as St. Clair) hired Bánáthy. In 1956, Hungarian Paul Ferenc Sujan joined them at the School. In Monterey, they joined the Boy Scout movement, meeting F. Maurice Tripp.&lt;ref name="wshistory" /&gt;

=== Growth on the Monterey Peninsula ===

When serving in the Hungarian Army, Bánáthy became interested in leadership development in boys and youth. In Monterey, he became Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the [[Monterey Bay Area Council]]. He gained support for his concept of a leadership camp for boys from the Council Executive and Executive Board.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory" /&gt;

Bánáthy informally recruited one patrol of boys, including his own sons, and took them to summer camp in 1957 to test his idea. John Chiorini, a 17-year-old [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], was working on the waterfront. "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol," Chiorini reported "Béla listened intently as I presented and then he came up after and gave me some tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on."&lt;ref name="founders"/&gt;

During the summer of 1958, Bánáthy recruited two patrols of boys to take part.&lt;ref name="a_report"&gt;{{cite book| title = Report on a Leadership Development Experiment |first= Béla| last=Bánáthy |publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council |year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning there was not much discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were."&lt;ref name="founders"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/white-stag-founders.htm| title=The Four Founders of White Stag| first=Bill| last=Roberts| accessdate=2008-10-05| year=2005| publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102164827/http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/white-stag-founders.htm| archivedate=2008-01-02| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

Drawing from the 1933 World Jamboree, Bánáthy based the program symbol and its spirit on the white stag from Hungarian mythology. On June 8, 1959, the adults adopted this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/adult_staff_meeting%208_june_59.htm|title=Adult Staff Meeting|date=June 8, 1956|publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=2008-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908171334/http://www.whitestag.org/history/adult_staff_meeting%208_june_59.htm|archivedate=September 8, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received," Bánáthy  said.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news | title=Special Leadership Camps Held at Pico Blanco | first= Helene H.| last=Parsons | publisher = Monterey Peninsula Herald | date = September 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During August 1959, the first full-scale program was put on. Bánáthy served as Scoutmaster, Fran Petersen was Assistant Scoutmaster, along with eight other adult staff and 13 youth staff. The training troop consisted of 39 trainees from 24 troops. In the first two years of the program, emphasis was placed on training patrol leaders.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"/&gt; 

During the same year, Bánáthy studied leadership. He learned that the U.S. Army's [[Human Resources Research Organization]] (HumRRO) at the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]] was conducting research into the leadership characteristics of [[non-commissioned officer]]s.&lt;ref name=TR67-12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncohistory.com/files/TR67-12.pdf |title=TR 67-12, Evaluation of Three Experimental Systems for Noncommissioned Officer Training |first=Paul D. |last=Hood |author2=Morris Showel |author3=Edward C.

A HumRRO publication titled, ''A Guide for the Infantry Squad Leader – What the Beginning Squad Leader Should Know About Human Relations'' defined a core set of leadership competencies.&lt;ref name=aitplatoon&gt;{{cite book| title=Leadership Climate for Trainee Leaders: The Army AIT Platoon| publisher=Human Resources Research Office, George Washington University, Alexandria, Virginia| first=Paul D.| last=Hood| year=1963| url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/26/2698/0269826.html| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220220/http://www.stormingmedia.us/26/2698/0269826.html| archivedate=2011-09-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bánáthy found Hood's research useful, identifying characteristics of leadership. With Hood's active encouragement, he decided to emphasize development of those skills in the White Stag program. 

In 1960, the adult staff announced that they would expand the program to offer an additional phase of leadership development for boys 14 – 17 years old, to train "junior trainers and impart leadership skills."&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"/&gt; This phase was christened ''Troop Leadership Development''.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

=== National Council takes notice ===

[[File:White stag founders 1968 fort ord.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joe St. Clair, Fran Peterson, Maury Tripp, and [[Béla H. Bánáthy]] at the White Stag Leadership Development Program [[Indaba]] held at [[Fort Ord]], California, during November 1962. These four men played instrumental roles in developing the experimental [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] course #25-2, held at Fort Ord in January and February 1968.]] With the interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, the program was continually tested and improved. Two men with connections on the National Council, Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council's Engineering Service) and F. Maurice Tripp (a research scientist and member of the National Boy Scout Training Committee), brought the White Stag program to the National Council's attention. In 1962, Tripp formed and chaired an advisory board of educators, psychologists, management specialists, and members of the Scout professional staff.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"/&gt;

During 1962 – 63, Bánáthy focused his research, using it as the basis of his Master's Thesis at [[San Jose State University]]. The Monterey Bay Area Council published Bánáthy's abbreviated version entitled ''A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting.''&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bánáthy| first = Béla| year = 1963| pages = 19| authorlink = Béla H.

The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|United States Wood Badge]] course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of the White Stag Leadership Development Program |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/staghist.htm |first=Joe |last=St. Clair |author2=Béla Bánáthy |author3=Brian Phelps |year=1996 |publisher=PineTreeWeb.com |accessdate=2008-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232824/http://www.pinetreeweb.com/staghist.htm |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the August 1964 summer camp, Bánáthy and Peterson announced that White Stag would begin in 1965 to offer a third phase of leadership development for boys age 11 – 13, called "Patrol Member Development." This enabled all boys 11 – 17 years old to learn leadership skills appropriate to their maturity. If they stayed with scouting, they had the chance to advance in other phases of development.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"/&gt;

=== World Scouting publishes paper ===

In 1969, the World Organization of the Scout Movement published [[Béla H. Bánáthy|Bánáthy]]'s paper titled ''Leadership Development: World Scouting Reference Paper No. 1''. Describing the results of BSA's research and testing of the leadership program, it was presented at the World Scoutings Conference in Helsinki.&lt;ref name="worldref"&gt;{{cite web | title = Leadership Development—World Scouting Reference Papers, No. 1. | url = http://pinetreeweb.com/learning.htm | first = Béla H. | last = Bánáthy | date = May 1969 | publisher = Boy Scouts World Bureau | accessdate = 2008-07-05 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515073122/http://www.pinetreeweb.com/learning.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bánáthy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and guided their national training teams at three Interamerican 'Train the Trainer' events in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

=== Adapted for use in U.S. Wood Badge ===
{{Main|Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)}}

In January 1967, John Larson began work with Bánáthy and Bob Perin to write a new Wood Badge staff guide focusing on leadership. Ken Wells and Perin had participated in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. Despite their long experience with Wood Badge, they saw the benefit of adding leadership skills development to its requirements.&lt;ref name="wbhistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Wood Badge in the United States|location=Irving, Texas|asin=B0013ENRE8|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar" Hillcourt]], Scoutmaster of the first U.S. Wood Badge course in 1948, felt very strongly that the traditional teaching of Scoutcraft skills should be retained. Hillcourt had recently formally retired, but his opinion held considerable weight. Chief Scout [[Joseph Brunton]] approved the changes.&lt;ref name="pinewebhistory"/&gt;

Later that year, the National BSA began to evaluate the revised Wood Badge program using leadership competencies .&lt;ref name="a_report"/&gt; On June 17, 1967, the first experimental Wood Badge course was offered at Philmont. One month later, the Circle Ten Council in Dallas presented its first new Wood Badge course. In September 1967, six councils were approved to pilot-test the new Wood Badge program in 1968: [[Monterey Bay Area Council]], [[Piedmont Council (California)|Piedmont Council]], [[Middle Tennessee Council|Middle Tennessee]], [[Del-Mar-Va Council|Del-Mar-Va]], and [[Hiawatha Seaway Council|Hiawatha]] (formerly Onondago) and [[Circle Ten Council]].&lt;ref name="wbhistory"/&gt;
Among these was an experimental Wood Badge course in Monterey in 1968. Bánáthy was Course Director, Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster, and Fran Petersen was senior patrol leader.&lt;ref name="wbhistory" /&gt; John Larson, National Director of Education, was also present. All attendees were asked to bring their entire troop to a single week of summer camp, allowing the Wood Badge staff to use the summer camp as an application for Wood Badge.&lt;ref name="founders"/&gt;

=== Modified for use in junior leader training ===
{{Main|National Youth Leadership Training}}

Pilot-testing and experimentation continued for three more years. An experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969. It was later known as [[National Youth Leadership Training|Troop Leader Development]]; the final ''Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide'', written by John W. Larson, credited White Stag with its origins.&lt;ref name="tld1974"&gt;{{cite book | title=Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide | publisher=Boy Scouts of America | location=New Brunswick, N.J.|year=1974|quote=Back in 1950s the armed forces of the United States became concerned about the quality of leadership among non-commissioned officers. Experiments were carried out in non-commissioned officer schools at [[Fort Hood]] in California.{{cref|i}} Several Scouters from the [[Scouting in California#Monterey Bay Area Council|Monterey Bay Area Council]] learned of this program and designed a junior leadership training experience using some of the competencies or skills of leadership identified in this Army training, and it was known as the "White Stag" program.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history ===

Through the early 1970s, the White Stag program presented the Monterey Bay Area Council's official junior leader training program; this was revived from 1994 to 2004. In 1975, Bill Roberts, the Phase III Director, invited the first Explorer girls age 14 – 18 to take part in the program and adult women to serve on adult staff. This was the first co-educational leadership development program in the BSA.&lt;ref name="follow" /&gt; The next year White Stag invited girls age 11 – 13 to participate as well.&lt;ref name="follow" /&gt; The program was evaluated in 1978 by a staff member from the Western Region of the BSA. He wrote:
{{cquote|Something that somewhat shocked me was the use of girls as part of the staff and as learners. They are incorporated very smoothly into the program, the only problem being showers. This was easily remedied. The girls and the boys seemed not at all uncomfortable about the coed situation. It had no apparent effect on learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitestag.org/about/characteristics/coeducational_experience.html|title=Coeducational Experience | publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

; White Stag Association incorporated
[[File:White Stag at Camp Cole.jpg|thumb|A White Stag is mounted to the wall of a building at [[Camp Robert L. Cole]] ]]
At the same time, the Monterey Bay Area Council decided to replace the White Stag program with the [[National Youth Leadership Training|Troop Leader Development]] program. The adult volunteer leaders of White Stag, informally known as the White Stag Steering Committee, incorporated in 1982 as the non-profit foundation White Stag Association; it continued to sponsor the program. 

For two years, the Association rented Skylark Ranch Resident Camp in the Santa Cruz Mountains from the [[Scouting in California#Girl Scouts of Northern California|Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County]]. Over the next few years, the Association moved the summer program to [[Pacific Skyline Council|San Mateo County Council]]'s Camp Cutter in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], and later, at different times, to [[Marin Council|Marin Council's Camp Marin-Sierra]] and [[Greater Yosemite Council|Yosemite Council's Camp Mensinger]] in the California [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. They began to attract most youth attendees from the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="follow" /&gt; In 2014, the Association secured use of [[Camp Robert L. Cole]] in the [[Tahoe National Forest]] near [[Cisco Grove, California|Cisco Grove]], California.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

; White Stag Academy formed

When the Monterey Bay Area Council's Junior Leader Training Chairman offered in 1994 to run the Council's junior leader training program using the White Stag methods, the Council Executive agreed. White Stag adult alumni of the now San Francisco Bay Area-based program who lived in the [[Monterey Peninsula]] area recruited a youth staff who planned and presented the White Stag program at [[Camp Pico Blanco]] in 1994. This Monterey-based program continued to present the council's junior leader training program until 2005. That year a new Council Executive decided to adopt the current BSA [[National Youth Leadership Training]] (NYLT) program. 

The adult leadership of the Monterey White Stag group incorporated in 2005 as the [[501(c)3|non-profit]] charity White Stag Leadership Development Academy, Inc. to support the program. Until 2015, they based the summer camp program at camps Cutter and [[Mount Diablo Silverado Council#Camps|Lindblad]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]],&lt;ref name="follow" /&gt; Camp Tamarancho in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], and a custom-built camp in [[Arroyo Seco (Salinas River)|Arroyo Seco]] on private land.&lt;ref name=2015app&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Leadership Camp Using the White Stag Method Presented by Venturing Crew 122|url=http://whitestagcamp.org/forms/2015_Application.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223221230/http://whitestagcamp.org/forms/2015_Application.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the Academy purchased {{convert|160|acres}} for $462,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property Value Notice|url=https://common1.mptsweb.com/megabytecommonsite/(S(ri3wpxzvevr4ht1xuremxrue))/PublicInquiry/Inquiry.aspx?CN=monterey&amp;SITE=Public&amp;DEPT=Asr&amp;PG=AsrMain&amp;Asmt=419-091-002-000|publisher=Monterey County Assessors Office|accessdate=28 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116182259/https://common1.mptsweb.com/megabytecommonsite/(S(rvulfa2012vnikdftpvysh5i))/PublicInquiry/Inquiry.aspx?CN=monterey&amp;SITE=Public&amp;DEPT=Asr&amp;PG=AsrMain&amp;Asmt=419-091-002-000|archivedate=16 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Carmel Valley and renamed the site, formerly a gun club, "Piney Creek Camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarstreettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/06-24-16-reduced-copy.pdf |date=June 14, 2016 |title=White Stag ‘Piney Creek Camp’ Opens near Greenfield |publisher=Cedar Street Times |accessdate=September 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002054526/http://www.cedarstreettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/06-24-16-reduced-copy.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mayberry|first1=Carly|title=Local leadership camp purchases new property|url=http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20160401/NEWS/160409966|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=Monterey Herald|date=May 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001191814/http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20160401/NEWS/160409966|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Girl Scout spin-off

During 2004, some leaders of the White Stag Academy organized a comparable program for the [[Scouting in California#Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast|Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast]]. The program teaches the eleven leadership skills used by White Stag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eleven Skills of Leadership|url=http://www.artemisleads.org/Leadership-Skills.html|publisher=Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223232459/http://www.artemisleads.org/Leadership-Skills.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held at Cutter Scout Reservation for two years and is currently held at Boulder Creek Scout Reservation in the Santa Cruz Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Artemis 2015|url=http://www.artemisleads.org/Contact-Us.html|publisher=Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040754/http://www.artemisleads.org/Contact-Us.html|archivedate=28 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Girl Scouts assumed leadership of the program after 2006 and renamed it Camp Artemis, after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, animals, and the natural environment. The Youth Staff are referred to as members of ALTA (Artemis Leadership Training Adventure). They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11 – 17 each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsomb.org/files/gsccc_realignment_news1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast Realignment News|publisher=Girl Scouts of Monterey Bay|date=March 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105202853/http://www.gsomb.org/files/gsccc_realignment_news1.pdf|archivedate=January 5, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Summer camp programs

Both the organization in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program will observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/whitestag/ |title=White Stag Monterey |accessdate=September 1, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116182258/https://www.facebook.com/groups/whitestag/ |archivedate=November 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.&lt;ref name="twenty-thousand"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.whitestag.org/index.html |title = Twenty Thousand Youth and Fifty Years |date = 2008-05-14 |publisher = White Stag Leadership Development Program |accessdate = July 30, 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828005004/http://www.whitestag.org/index.html |archivedate = August 28, 2008 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core tenets ==

=== Youth ready to learn ===

In his master's thesis, Bánáthy established his reasoning for focusing on developing leadership skills in youth rather than adults. He wrote that adults in leadership development experiences often have "deeply and rigidly established patterns which are difficult to change." He felt leadership development needs to start early in life, when an opportunity exists to give individuals long-term exposure to leadership behavior.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt; Bánáthy formulated the White Stag program to address the needs of youth from 11 to 17 years of age. He did this when defining leadership as a learnable skill was still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/leadership-theories-studies|title=Leadership Theories and Studies, Encyclopedia of Management|first=Tim|last=Barnett|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110055515/http://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/leadership-theories-studies|archivedate=2010-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Youth need leadership development ====

A number of researchers have identified needs of youth for specific kinds of formative experiences. In one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=State Youth Policy: Helping All Youth to Grow up Fully Prepared and Fully Engaged| last1=Ferber| first1=T.| last2=Pittman| first2=K.| last3=Marshall| first3=T.| year=2002| publisher=The Forum for Youth Investment, Impact Strategies| location=Washington, D.C.| url=http://www.forumforyouthinvestment.org/node/106| isbn=1-931902-11-9| accessdate=2010-03-18| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609143613/http://www.forumforyouthinvestment.org/node/106| archivedate=2010-06-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cref|ii}} Ferber, Pittman, and Marshall described five developmental priorities for youth. These were ''learning'' (developing positive basic and applied academic attitudes, skills, and behaviors), ''thriving'' (developing physically healthy attitudes, skills, and behaviors), ''connecting'' (developing positive social attitudes, skills, and behaviors), ''working'' (developing positive vocational attitudes, skills, and behaviors), and ''leading'' (developing positive civic attitudes, skills, and behaviors).&lt;ref name=minnregents/&gt;

Educators report that successful programs use "positive and sustained relations with a caring adult, mentoring in life skills and opportunities to use newly learned skills."&lt;ref name="schemo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/education/edlife/leadership-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Congressional%20Youth%20Leadership%20Council&amp;st=cse|title=Congratulations!

==== Youth-led program ====

The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods address all of the areas the studies identified.&lt;ref name="resources"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitestag.org/files/Resources_For_Leadership.pdf|title=Resources for Leadership|publisher=Phelps TeKnowledge|last=Phelps|first=Brian|date=November 2002|accessdate=2010-03-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201152709/http://whitestag.org/files/Resources_For_Leadership.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and implement the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required to live in a camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community.&lt;ref name="follow"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://whitestag.org/files/Follow_The_White_Stag.pdf|title=Follow the White Stag|publisher=Phelps Teknowledge|last=Phelps|first=Brian|date=October 2000|accessdate=2010-03-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728183007/http://whitestag.org/files/Follow_The_White_Stag.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt;

=== Leadership competencies ===

In his research for his master's thesis, Bánáthy identified 80 characteristics of leadership.&lt;ref name="a_design"&gt;{{cite book
| title = A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting | first= Béla|last=Bánáthy | publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council| year = 1963 | pages = 25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarized them as 11 leadership competencies, which he proposed be taught in a systematic process, using six developmental levels tailored to the various needs of youth at different stages. The White Stag leadership competencies&lt;ref name="worldref" /&gt; are organized into three groups, taught in relation to individual and group readiness.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

==== Four-stage learning approach ====

The group writes down both general [[goal]]s and very specific, [[Educational aims and objectives|measurable objectives]] each year that describe leadership in [[behavior]]al terms. When engaging learners in leadership development learning activities, the youth staff implement a four-phase approach called ''Manager of Learning''.&lt;ref name=slideshare&gt;{{cite web|title=White Stag Leadership Development Camp for Youth|url=http://www.slideshare.net/btphelps/white-stag-leadership-developemtn|accessdate=5 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718134425/http://www.slideshare.net/btphelps/white-stag-leadership-developemtn|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step requires the participant to practice the skill without preparation. The simulation is made as real and practical as possible within the limitations of the training environment. Both the participant and the instructor gain through this ''[[performance test (assessment)|Guided Discovery]]'' an assessment of the learner's current [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s relevant to the learning task.&lt;ref name=mol&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing of Learning|url=http://www.whitestag.org/skills/manager_of_learning.html|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second step is a ''[[Education|Teach/Learn]]'' session where the instructor begins to present information based on what the participants don't already know. This is usually prefixed with a written statement describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking [[Socratic method|questions]].&lt;ref name=mol/&gt;

Once the Teach/Learn is complete, the third step allows participants an opportunity in an ''[[Practice (learning method)|Application]]'' to practice their newly acquired skills. This may or may not be an experience like the Guided Discovery.&lt;ref name=mol/&gt;

The final step is an ''[[Feedback|Evaluation]]'' discussion, during which the participants not only self-assess whether they achieved the stated learning objectives, but to give feedback to the instructor about their success in presenting the information.&lt;ref name="MOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whitestag.org/aims/principles/manager-of-learning.html
| title = The Manager of Learning Method | publisher = White Stag Leadership Development Academy | accessdate= June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Developing group members ====

The first three competencies are essential to forming the group's ability to organize itself and become ready for action.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Getting and Giving Information'' teaches participants about different types of communication and how communication helps establish the group. They learn how to get, store, and retrieve information. Individuals practice communicating to both help get the job done and keep the group together.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Understanding Group Needs and Characteristics'' helps individuals build group morale and unity. They learn about values, norms, needs, and characteristics.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Knowing and Understanding Group Resources'' helps learners to use resources to improve group togetherness, to learn about different kinds of resources, and how as a leader can use the diversity of group members' skills and abilities to help the group succeed. They learn about how resources affect getting the job done and keeping the group together.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

==== Growing group capability ====

[[File:White stag candidates learn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|White Stag candidates at Camp Tamarancho, in Marin County, California in a leadership competency session during an overnight hike.]]
The second group of leadership competencies help the group to develop and implement a plan.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Controlling the Group'' helps individuals to learn how their behavior affects others. Individuals learn the difference between external control of the group and personal control of their own behavior. They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Counseling'' helps individuals to define key counseling ideas, learn simple counseling methods, and identify when simple counseling is appropriate.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Setting the  Example'' helps participants identify what it means to set a good example, why setting an example is important, and describe ways a leader can set a good example.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Planning'' provides learners a chance to learn about problem-solving and its importance to a leader. They learn problem-solving and planning methods and how planning contributes to accomplishing the task and to group success.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Evaluation'' enables the learner to use evaluation improve group focus and get the job done. They learn to balance getting the job done and helping the group, and learn to continually assess their level of success.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

==== Accomplish the task ====

The last group of leadership competencies helps individuals to grow the organization.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Sharing Leadership'' helps participants learn that leadership is something that is shared by all group members depending on the situation and group member's abilities. They learn about what kinds of things affect the leader and the group, and what style of leadership is appropriate. They learn to select a style of leadership based on the job and the group situation.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Representing the Group'' is a way for participants to learn about how groups communicate and how to represent one group to another. They learn how to accurately represent their group to another.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

''Manager of Learning'' is a four-step technique for instructing others. Participants learn how to develop effective learning techniques.  for effectively communicating information; emphasize the learner in the learning process.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

== The program ==

=== Values ===

[[File:4th  World Scout Jamboree.png|thumb|right|250px|The official badge of the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]], illustrating the mythical White  Stag, and the basis for the White Stag program symbol.]]
[[File:White Stag Leadership Development Program 50th anniversary.png|thumb|right|250px|Patch commemorating the 50th anniversary of the White Stag program in 2008.]]
The program has defined a set of values that govern how the program is implemented.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;{{cite book |title = Rationale |first= Bill| last=Roberts |year= 1974|publisher=manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important is ''outdoor learning''. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

In addition, the program utilizes outdoor camping skills to provide opportunities to practice leadership skills. One of the very first challenges a leader-in-training  faces is to plan how to set up of their camp and cook their meals. They learn how to analyze the task, how to plan the task and organize the group, how to use all of the groups' resources, how to implement their plan, and how to evaluate and correct.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

The program teaches participants to cultivate an ''evaluation attitude'', or a predisposition to continually seek improvement. Growth as a leader is dependent on his ability to assess his current skill level and to accept the necessity for change. The leader can only attain his goals if he continuously works to analyze his movement towards achieving his goals and objectives.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

White Stag uses the ''patrol method'' to effectively include all members. Baden-Powell wrote "[t]he Patrol System is the one essential feature in which Scout training differs from that of all other organizations, and where the System is properly applied, it is absolutely bound to bring success. It cannot help itself! The formation of the boys into Patrols or from six to eight and training them as separate units each under its own responsible leader is the key to a good Troop."&lt;ref name="Baden"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last= Baden-Powell|first= Robert
| year = 1943
| publisher = The National Council Boy Scouts of Canada
| title = Aids to Scoutmastership a Guidebook for Scoutmasters on the Theory of Scout Training
| page = 16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important values is a focus on ''hands-on learning''. The program emphasizes use of [[experiential learning]] activities in the context of [[outdoor education]]. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant teams can be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963"/&gt;

Always seeking to engage individuals both physically and mentally, the program uses the ''hurdle method''. The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation for which they have not specifically prepared themselves. The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize themselves to find a solution or to complete a task.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt; The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whitestag.org/aims/principles/hurdle-method.html |title=Hurdle Method |publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program believes leadership can be taught using a ''direct approach'', not by osmosis or example alone. In early leadership development programs,  learning about leadership was not specifically defined with qualified objectives. Learning about leadership was a by-product of other learning activities. The White Stag Method challenges these ''indirect'' methods and focuses the participant's experience using a ''direct approach.'' The White Stag program defines leadership behaviors in specific terms as eleven leadership competencies.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

Youth spend too much time learning what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The ''manager of learning'' value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

The program believes that learning never stops and embraces this as the ''infinity principle''.  According to Bánáthy, leadership behavior cannot be developed "during a few weeks, not even during several months," but must be ongoing.&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

It takes months for individuals to gain proficiency in leadership skills. "The White Stag continues to leap on—upward and forward—in a never-ending journey that leads the joyous followers to the promised land. For us who wear the badge of the White Stag, the White Stag journey symbolizes the idea of becoming the best we can."&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt; The program borrowed words from Baden-Powell's Jamboree farewell, "Forward, Upward, Onward," to define leadership:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitestag.org/community/|title=White Stag portal|publisher=White Stag Leadership Development|accessdate=2010-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201135320/http://whitestag.org/community/|archivedate=2010-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Leadership is the process of influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation to continually move the organization and individual forward, upward, and onward.}}

Individuals are taught to believe that difficult situations are opportunities for growth that must be overcome. Thus, leadership development cannot take place during a single training course. It is a continuous sequence of sequential, structured learning and experience-building opportunities. The program subscribes to the belief that when an individual embraces the infinite challenge to change, he is engaged in the never-ending process of becoming a leader. "The infinity principle of growth in leadership is what the White Stag symbolizes in this leadership development process."&lt;ref name="Bánáthy1963" /&gt;

Avoiding stereotypes and labeling based on personal dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as ''uniforms''. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell at the conclusion of the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt;

=== Phases and levels ===

Based on Béla Bánáthy's original work, the program is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored to the needs of youth at specific ages and maturity levels.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt;

The youth staff develop each summer camp's program during the preceding nine months in a series of leadership development training and planning events. They are ultimately responsible for the entire leadership program's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult and Youth Staff Interviews|url=http://www.whitestag.org/apply/staff_interviews.html|accessdate=5 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103075215/http://www.whitestag.org/apply/staff_interviews.html|archivedate=3 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced Leadership Development ===
{{norefs|section|date=April 2018}}
In 2017, White Stag Monterey started a new exclusive program called Advanced Leadership Development. The program focuses on the real world applications of the leadership competencies in addition to delving deeper into the theory of the skills taught in the lower levels. 

ALD is an extension of the teachings of the earlier phases. To be accepted into the program, applicants must be between the ages of 16 and 21 and have completed Troop Leadership Development, making it the only part of the White Stag program with a mandatory prerequisite. In addition, they must be interviewed by one of the ALD staff members. 

Because of the small number of candidates in ALD, instead of multiple candidates being assigned a single patrol counselor or patrol leader, each individual candidate is assigned a staff member as a "buddy", who they work with one-on-one throughout the week. 

=== Aims ===

The program has four primary aims&lt;ref name="a_design" /&gt;  that are closely aligned with the aims of the Boy Scouts of America&lt;ref name="bs-aims"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/OverviewofBSA.aspx| title = What Is Boy Scouting?| last = Boy Scouts of America| year = 2008| accessdate = 2010-03-18| publisher = Boy Scouts of America| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100402195100/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/OverviewofBSA.aspx| archivedate = 2010-04-02| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of leadership development. The program focuses on ''character development'', which it defines as encouraging people to do what is right, no matter what, and to serve themselves and others. Its second aim is ''personal fitness'', and in its programs it encourages individuals to accept physical and mental challenges, to surpass their own expectations, expand their knowledge, skills and abilities, and strive for continuous personal improvement. Their third aim is  ''citizenship training'', in which it helps individuals to develop a positive attitude, influence those around them, join in and shape their community. The paramount aim however is ''leadership development'', in which it inspires individuals to engage life as an ongoing adventure,  to challenge themselves, and to lead others to pursue excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aims of White Stag|url=http://www.whitestag.org/aims/index.html|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism and mythology ===

Differentiating White Stag from any other leadership program for youth is its ''spirit and traditions'', including campfires, ceremonies, skits, yells, cheers, and emblems, all of which give it a distinctive character. These are used to communicate an ethic of always striving for self-improvement and personal achievement, and values that include characteristics of servant leadership, compassion, enthusiasm, kindness, and selflessness.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt;

The symbolism of the White Stag is described in a story telling the White Stag legend.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt; The legend borrows from the [[4th World Scout Jamboree|Fourth World Jamboree]] held in  Hungary, which in turn was inspired by [[Hungarian mythology]] of the [[white stag]]. The White Stag Legend is used to inspire in the participants a desire for reflection, continuous self-improvement, and pursuit of higher aims and goals. Other traditions include [[woggle]]s, waist ropes, staves, berets, and patrol names.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt; The legend tells a version of a legend honoring [[Hunor and Magor|Hunor and Magyar]], who led their people in pursuit a mythical White Stag, following it over impassable trails to a new home.&lt;ref name=spirit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whitestag.org/program_spirit/legend/index.html |title=The Symbolism of  the         White Stag |publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703011355/http://www.whitestag.org/program_spirit/legend/index.html |archivedate=July 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this story and  other ceremonies, the program challenges individuals to continually strive "onward and upward" and "overcome challenges, continuously evaluate, focus on learning, and always strive to improve".&lt;ref name=spirit/&gt;

The White Stag program is currently offered by two related non-profit groups in Northern and Central California. In northern California, the non-profit White Stag Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitestagassociation.org|title=White Stag Association|accessdate=2015-02-15|publisher=White Stag Association|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219013841/http://www.whitestagassociation.org/|archivedate=2015-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsors three [[Venturing]] crews, a [[Learning for Life]] group, and a [[Boy Scout]] troop that plan and produce the summer camp program in Northern California, in the past at Camp John Mensinger, [[Camp Wolfeboro]], and since 2014 at [[Camp Robert L. Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitestagsierra.org/apply-for-camp/directions-to-camp-cole/ |title=Directions to Camp Cole |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |publisher=White Stag Sierra |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219105945/http://www.whitestagsierra.org/apply-for-camp/directions-to-camp-cole/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In central California, the non-profit White Stag Leadership Development Academy&lt;ref name=academy&gt;{{cite web |publisher=White Stag Academy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421223336/http://www.whitestag.org/about/white_stag_academy.htm | archivedate= April 21, 2013|url=http://whitestag.org/about/white_stag_academy.htm |title= White Stag Leadership Academy|accessdate=April 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsors a [[Learning for Life]] group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the [[Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council]] and the [[Alameda Council]]. These youth plan and put on a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in [[Marin County]] in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at a site in the [[Santa Lucia Range]] near [[Arroyo Seco (Salinas River)|Arroyo Seco]]. Youth staff participants are registered as members of the Boy Scouts or Venturing programs in the [[Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council]] and the [[Alameda Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitestag.org/about/brief_history.htm |title=Brief History |publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both programs adhere to the Youth Protection Standards of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], including background checks of all adult leaders. The Monterey-based program has drawn participants from overseas, including France, China, Martinique, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=wshistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitestag.org/history/history.html#2009|publisher=White Stag Leadership Development Program|title=White Stag History Since 1933|accessdate=2010-03-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301080228/http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html#2009|archivedate=2010-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial support ==

The White Stag program is implemented by two [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)3]] non-profits. The White Stag Leadership Development Academy is located on the [[Monterey Peninsula]] and the White Stag Association is located in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Francisco East Bay]]. Both are financially self-supporting. The programs are administered and managed by part-time adult volunteers. All participants, including youth and adult staff, pay fees to participate. Fees for participants attending the week-long summer camp are US$275–$325 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Stag Crew 122|url=http://www.whitestagcrew122.org/|accessdate=6 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723214842/http://www.whitestagcrew122.org/|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Stag Leadership Development Camp Fees|url=http://www.whitestag.org/apply/camp-fees.htm|accessdate=6 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820061409/http://www.whitestag.org/apply/camp-fees.htm|archivedate=20 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidate attendees to White Stag Sierra pay up to $320, while the Association in Monterey charges $335. {{asof|2014}}, adult and youth staff volunteers paid about US$400 in fees over the course of a year of staff development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult and Youth Staff Interviews|url=http://www.whitestag.org/apply/staff_interviews.html|accessdate=6 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103075215/http://www.whitestag.org/apply/staff_interviews.html |archivedate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==

Since 1960, the program has recognized one or two youth and adults each year by presenting them with a ''Silver Stag'' award. The device, a miniature solid sterling silver stag on a chain or medallion, recognizes the individual's outstanding "contributions and qualities of leadership, spirit and service to the program."&lt;ref name="wshistory"/&gt; One youth staff member from each phase is selected as the outstanding youth staff member. Each graduating participant received a neckerchief unique to each phase that is to be worn only at White Stag functions. Participants may also be recognized with other awards that vary from year to year.&lt;ref name=follow/&gt;

== Other programs that used the White Stag name ==

In 1967, Rex Hatch returned to the  [[Scouting in Indiana|Crossroads of America Council]] after attending a pilot test of the JLT program at Philmont. He founded in 1972 a junior leader training program, previously known  as Silver Bars, which was initially based on the White Stag program's principles. It was later modified to follow the National Youth Leadership Training Course syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwjcra.org/~dboyle/whitestag/|title=About White Stag|last=Boyle|first=Dennis M.|publisher=Dennis Boyle|accessdate=2009-11-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411183436/http://www.nwjcra.org/~dboyle/whitestag/|archivedate=2009-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crossroads&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Crossroads Council|url=http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/FunctionsofScoutingMenu/Training/CouncilTrainingEvents/WhiteStag/tabid/139/Default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327111725/http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/FunctionsofScoutingMenu/Training/CouncilTrainingEvents/WhiteStag/tabid/139/Default.aspx |archivedate=27 March 2010|title=White Stag Junior Leader Training|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scouting in Indiana|Hoosier Trails Council]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]] produced a "National Youth Leadership Training" program based on the national syllabus that was nicknamed "White Stag NYLT" until 2011.&lt;ref name=hoosiers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.troop100-hoosiertrails.org/T100-11292009/form/2011-NYLTinfo.pdf|title=Hoosier Trails Council NYLT White Stag|publisher=Hoosier Trails Council|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the east coast, the [[Narragansett Council]] in Rhode Island nicknamed their national NYLT program as "White Stag NYLT" until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Narragansett Council|url=http://www.narragansettbsa.org/openrosters/ViewOrgPageLink.asp?LinkKey=40031&amp;orgkey=1213|title=White Stag - National Youth Leader Training|accessdate=2012-02-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104140518/http://www.narragansettbsa.org/openrosters/ViewOrgPageLink.asp?LinkKey=40031&amp;orgkey=1213|archivedate=2011-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Creech Sr.''' (1845–1918) was an [[United States|American]] [[philanthropist]]. '''"Uncle" William Creech''' is remembered for his contributions to improve [[Harlan County, Kentucky]].

==Philanthropic efforts==

===Pine Mountain Settlement School===
Uncle William Creech donated {{convert|700|acre|km2}} of land to establish [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]], the first educational institution in the area. The school was co-founded in 1913 by [[Katherine Pettit]] and [[Ethel de Long Zande]] and was designed by architect [[Mary Rockwell Hook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.alphasigmatau.org/alphasigmatau/?page_id=42| title = Pine Mountain Settlement School| publisher =Alpha Sigma Tau | accessdate =2008-03-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pine Mountain Settlement School has served many purposes, though its current foci are [[Appalachia]]n cultural education and [[environmental education]].

As Creech said in a letter from 1915,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heart and cravin' that our people may grow better. I have deeded my land to the Pine Mountain Settlement School to be used for school purposes as long as the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] stands. Hoping it may make bright and intelligent people after I'm dead and gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.umlbetataus.org/service.html| title =An Old Man's Hopes| publisher =Beta Tau Chapter of [[Alpha Sigma Tau]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] | accessdate =2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gaining a post office===
According to [[Ben Lucien Burman]] in ''Children of Noah: Glimpses of Unknown America'',&lt;blockquote&gt;In any [[rural]] community the mail is always a matter of importance, particularly in a region so isolated as the Cumberlands. Uncle William had decided that [[Pine Mountain (ridge)|Pine Mountain]]'s crying need was a [[post office]]."&lt;ref name="app blog"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://appalachianhistory.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-post-office-came-to-pine-mountain.html| title =How the post office came to Pine Mountain KY| publisher =Appalachian History | last = Tabler | first = Dave | accessdate =2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creech's efforts to gain a local post office were a struggle because his rural area would not be allowed to have its own post office until it was deemed able to support enough postal business. To stimulate mail delivery, Creech worked with often [[literacy|illiterate]] residents to request [[mail order|mail-order]] catalogs. Following his initial efforts with a more personal campaign, Creech helped residents write letters to their sons, husbands, and boyfriends who were fighting in [[World War I]]. Although often requiring the help of literate friends, many soldiers responded with letters home.&lt;ref name="app blog"/&gt;

Creech's labor was successful. The [[United States Postal Service]] was impressed by the quantity of mail, and a post office was established in the area.&lt;ref name="app blog"/&gt;
