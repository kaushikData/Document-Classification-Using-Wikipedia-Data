==Preliminary Rounds==
The Preliminary Competition was held on Monday, May 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgeographic.org/newsroom/29th-annual-national-geographic-bee-to-take-place-in-washington-dc-may-14-17/&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of two parts: a written part and an oral part worth 16 points total. In the written part, contestants were asked to write a sentence about why preserving oceans is important, identify places on a map that had been part of National Geographic's "pristine seas" project, and write an paragraph about which place needed to have steps taken for its preservation first: [[Río de la Plata|The Rio de la Plata]] estuary, [[Sundarbans|the Sundarbans]], or [[Great Barrier Reef|the Great Barrier Reef]]. It was graded out of six points total. The oral part consisted of ten rounds about world geography and National Geographic Explorers. All 54 State Champions participated, and after a tiebreaker ten finalists were determined: 
* Ahilan Eraniyan- from California
* Rohan Kanchana- from Delaware
* Max Garon- from District of Columbia
* Nicholas Monahan- from Idaho
* Lucas Eggers- from Minnesota
* Abhinav Govindaraju- from New Hampshire
* Veda Bhattaram- from New Jersey
* Pranay Varada- from Texas
* Anish Susarla- from Virginia
* Thomas Wright- from Wisconsin

==Final Rounds==
The Final Competition was held on Wednesday, May 17, 2017. The top 10 Finalists out of the 54 State Champions participated. Humorist, journalist, and actor [[Mo Rocca]] moderated the Competition for the [[28th National Geographic Bee|second year]] in a row. The Champion was Pranay Varada of Texas. Thomas Wright of Wisconsin came second, and Veda Bhattaram of New Jersey came third. The GeoChallenge for the top three was about a new home country for the [[Maldives|Maldivian]] people if their country becomes flooded after [[Sea level rise|sea level rises.]] The choices were Indonesia, Turkey, and the Solomon Islands, in order of best to worst answer. In fourth place was Nicholas Monaghan from Idaho. The fifth place finisher was Anish Susarla of Virginia, and Lucas Eggers of Minnesota came in sixth. Tying for seventh place were Rohan Kanchana of Delaware, Ahilan Eraniyan of California, and Max Garon of D.C. They were tied with Lucas Eggers, but in the tiebreaker question, asking for the distance between Washington D.C. and London, they were eliminated after Eggers guessed closer to the correct answer than them and he moved on. In tenth place was Abhinav Govindaraju of New Hampshire. The first eliminations took place after round 5, a lightning round, where four left the competition. The next three eliminations were after round 9, another lightning round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21404">{{Academic ranks worldwide}}

The following summarizes basic '''[[academic rank]]s in the [[France|French]] [[higher education]] system'''. Most academic institutions being state-run, people with permanent positions are [[civil servant]]s.

Several parallel career paths exist, depending on the type of institutions. The three paths correspond to teacher-researchers (called ''enseignants-chercheurs'' in French), researchers, and teachers. The three paths are more or less equivalent and it is possible to go from one path to another one when being promoted.

Several ranks exist within each path. Increases in rank (for example, the promotion from assistant professor to associate professor) entails an increase in salary and responsibility and is subject to some conditions, such as the [[habilitation]]. The permanent ranks are commonly called "Rank A" (full professors, senior scientists) and "Rank B" (assistant/associate professor, scientist). In most cases, a complete career requires at least two open recruitment procedures, as there is no individual promotion from rank B to rank A.

Temporary positions would include [[PhD student]]s, [[postdoctoral researcher]]s, and temporary teachers (usually called ''vacataires'' or ''chargé d'enseignement''). There also exist some administrative ranks, held by permanent employees and often elected by their peers, such as university president or dean. Ranks in [[Private university|private schools]] and ''[[grandes écoles]]'' are often organized differently.

==Public institutions==
===Overview===
The following table summarizes the various academic titles used in France, determined by the paths (faculty, research, teaching) and the ranks, together with some equivalent titles in schools with special status. The common abbreviation for the title is presented in parenthesis after the title.

===Faculty position===
Faculty members are called ''enseignants-chercheurs'' (literally, teachers-researchers). In general, their statute is governed by the Decree 84-431 of June 6, 1984&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Décret n°84-431 du 6 juin 1984 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes applicables aux enseignants-chercheurs et portant statut particulier du corps des professeurs des universités et du corps des maîtres de conférences.|date=6 June 1984|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000520453|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with some exceptions: for example, faculty members in public hospitals have a statute governed by another decree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006064374|title=Décret n°84-135 du 24 février 1984 portant statut des personnels enseignants et hospitaliers des centres hospitaliers et universitaires {{!}} Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;). They are [[civil servant]]s, but they benefit from a special statute which guarantees [[academic freedom]]. As an exception to civil service rules, appointments to these positions are made regardless of citizenship.

After gaining a [[doctorate]] from a university, and usually after several years of temporary postdoctoral positions, scholars who wish to enter a more permanent academic career may apply for the position of ''Maître de Conférences'' (MCF). To achieve this, they must first be approved by the National Council of Universities, made up of elected and appointed MCFs and university professors. For candidates who have first been approved in this way, the recruitment to positions is carried out in each individual university, mostly by a selection committee of other MCFs and professors, half from the university where the position is available, half from other universities, rather than by administrators. However, the final decision is made by the Academic Council of the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|Art.9-1}}

The salary scale is national, so pay does not vary from one university to another. A recent reform allows for the possibility of salary modulation in the universities, but for now this remains to be implemented.

After some years in the ''maître de conférences'' position, an MCF may take an "[[habilitation]]" to become a supervisor of doctoral theses before applying for a position of ''professeur des universités'' ("university professor"), whether in their home university or in another institution. Their suitability for such a position will be judged by the National Council of Universities (restricted to full professors). Each individual application is examined by a selection committee, composed exclusively of full professors, mostly on their published original research as well on teaching and administrative duties. In the past, this required a higher doctorate ("state doctorate"). In some fields, such as [[law]], management (''gestion''), and [[economics]], candidates take the competitive examination known as ''[[agrégation#Higher education|agrégation]]''; only those achieving the highest grades are appointed.

Note that in [[French language|French]], the word ''professeur'' is used much more widely than the English "professor", and when used on its own it suggests a schoolteacher in [[secondary education]]. Qualified terms such as ''professeur des universités'' are therefore used to clarify the function of the ''professeur''.

In higher educational establishments outside the university system, such as the [[École polytechnique]], teaching staff follow different hierarchies and career paths. In particular, senior staff at the [[école des hautes études en sciences sociales|EHESS]], [[École pratique des hautes études|EPHE]], [[École des chartes]] and [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] are called directeurs d'études instead of professeurs des universités.

====Permanent positions====
''Maître de conférences'' and ''Professeurs des universités'' are both permanent positions. This is not the same as tenure, strictly speaking, but is instead due to the status of civil servant in public universities. Since all French universities are state-run, faculty members are civil servants and enjoy increasing employment protection compared to the private sector.

* ''' ''Professeur des universités'' '''(PR, Professor) is the highest rank in the faculty path of French academia. In some institutions ([[école des chartes]], [[école des hautes études en sciences sociales]]), professors use the title ''directeur d'études'' (Director of Studies). According to their statute, professors have priority to teach lectures (as opposed to exercise sessions) and to be elected as [[#Administrative ranks|director of research units]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rank has three pay grades: 2nd class, 1st class, and exceptional class.
* ''' ''Maître de conférences'' '''(MCF, Lecturer), is the second rank of the faculty path in French academia. The rank has two pay grades: normal class and outstanding class.

No one can become ''Professeur'' or ''Maître de Conférences'' without a doctorate. The [[habilitation]] (HDR) to direct doctoral theses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid22657/maitres-de-conferences.html Description on the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research website] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; is a necessary step to be promoted from MCF to PR. There exists no internal promotion to go from rank B to rank A: instead, a candidate must participate in the competition for an open position, usually in a different university. Progression from one pay grade to the next (e.g. 2nd class to 1st class) is internal to the university, and entails an increase in salary and responsibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Law, Political Science, and Economics, it is possible to be recruited directly as a full professor by passing the ''agrégation'' (distinct from the secondary school system's ''agrégation'', more widespread). Consequently, some scholars become professors without prior experience as a Maître de conférences. This remains rare however, most of the time the aggregation is a way to accelerate career advancement for the Maîtres de conférences (this is known as the ''voie courte'', or short way, as opposed to the ''voie longue'').

The French Ministry of Higher Education and Research provides a comparative table for faculty ranks in France and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.galaxie.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/ensup/pdf/EC_pays_etrangers/Tableau_comparaison_au_26_septembre_2012.pdf|title=Comparaison des carrières des enseignants-chercheurs de pays étrangers|last=French Ministry of Higher Education and Research|first=|date=10 February 2011|website=galaxie.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr|language=french|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''professeur'' corresponds to [[Full Professor|(full) professor]] in North America and the UK, while ''maître de conférences'' corresponds to ([[Academic tenure|tenured]]) [[associate professor]] in North America, or to lecturer/reader/senior lecturer in the UK depending on pay grade and whether the habilitation was obtained or not.

====Temporary positions====
* ''' ''Attaché temporaire d'enseignement et de recherche'' ''' (ATER, Temporary Research and Teaching [[Attaché]]). They have a one-year contract renewable once, except for civil servants, who may hold an ATER position up to 4 years in total. ATERs have the same responsibilities and compensation as many non tenure-track faculty in North America. They do research work, and they also teach 192 hours/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006066732&amp;dateTexte=vig|title=Décret n°88-654 du 7 mai 1988 relatif au recrutement d'attachés temporaires d'enseignement et de recherche dans les établissements publics d'enseignement supérieur {{!}} Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of position is sometimes used as a "bridge" at the end of a PhD, if the candidate is not able to complete their dissertation in three years and needs an extension.
* ''' ''Doctorant contractuel''''' (Contractual PhD candidate): PhD candidates who have obtained a specific type of grant to fund their PhD. This grant is a 3-years position (non renewable), and the candidate is an employee of the university during that time. They are expected to work on a dissertation and to participate in research activities. In addition, ''doctorants'' are sometimes also ''chargé d'enseignement'', meaning that they teach 64 hours per year, usually at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Décret n° 2009-464 du 23 avril 2009 relatif aux doctorants contractuels des établissements publics d'enseignement supérieur ou de recherche|date=23 April 2009|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020552499&amp;dateTexte=20180728|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Part-time ====
There also exist equivalent ranks as state employees (non civil service) for professors coming from industry and working part-time in a university. These ranks are ''maître de conférences associé'' and ''professeur des universités associé'' (PAST), depending on academic experience. Despite the similarity, "associé" is not synonymous with "associate" (an associate professor is a mid-seniority professor, where a ''professeur associé'' is a part-time professor) and would be closed to [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]].

===Research-only positions===
There also exist permanent, research positions, without teaching duties. They are offered by certain public research institutions, the [[Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment]]s, for instance the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS), the [http://en.ird.fr/ Institute of Research for Development] (IRD), the [[Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale|National Institute of Health and Medical Research]] (INSERM), or the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Inria). Again, people in these positions are civil servants (thus, in this sense, tenured). Their statute is governed by the Decree #83-1260 of December 30, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006064030|title=Décret n°83-1260 du 30 décembre 1983 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes aux corps de fonctionnaires des établissements publics scientifiques et technologiques.|last=|first=|date=|website=Légifrance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two levels, matching those of the teaching-research staff

*'''''Chargé de recherche''''' (CR, Scientist): equivalent to ''maître de conférences.'' It is a permanent, rank B, research-only position. The pay grades are "normal class" and "outstanding class".
*'''''Directeur de recherche''''' (DR, Senior Scientist): equivalent to ''professeur''. It is a permanent, rank A, research-only position. The pay grades are "2nd class", "1st class", and "exceptional class".

The main differences between these research positions and the faculty positions are, of course, the absence of teaching duties, and the ability to move between different labs (for example, a CNRS researcher can request to move to any CNRS lab in France or abroad, whereas a faculty member is employed by a specific university).

Just like for faculty appointments, there are no internal promotion from rank B to rank A. Instead, each year, national competitions are open to fill new positions, and it is necessary to participate in the national competition to move from one rank to the next. It is possible for a ''maître de conférences'' to become ''directeur de recherches'', just like it is possible for a ''chargé de recherches'' to become ''professeurs des universités''.

The complete name of the position usually makes the institution explicit, e.g. : ''directeur de recherche au CNRS'', or ''chargé de recherche à l'INRIA''. It has to be noticed that some of these positions can be located not in a laboratory proper to the [[Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment]], but in a mixed research structure, common with a university (UMR).

These establishments also offer engineer positions that include a research part, besides more technical duties (e.g. preparation of a database, experimental apparatus, etc.) : ''ingénieur d'études'' may include an important research part, ''ingénieur de recherche'' always includes a dominant research part. There also exists some contractual positions (from a few months to a few years).

===Teaching-only positions===
* '''''Professeur agrégé''''' (PRAG): Secondary school teachers who received the ''[[agrégation]]'' (not the similarly named ''agrégation du supérieur'') but who teach at university level.
* '''''Professeur certifié''''' (PRCE): Secondary school teacher teaching at university level. These teachers have a lesser degree than PRAGs, the ''certification''.
* '''''Chargé d’enseignement''''': Title used broadly for every instructor who teach at a regular basis in any university, though not at a full-time position.

==Grandes Écoles==
The [[Grandes Écoles]] is a parallel educational system generally attributed to Napoleon. These institutions of higher education each specialize in a specific domain, such as business, political science, or engineering. Some of them are [[grands établissements]] (for example [[Sciences Po Paris]]) are part of the state university recruitment system. The others – mainly the private schools – follow various guidelines. Among the business schools it is common to follow the North American terminology. That is,
*'''''Chargé d'enseignement''''' or '''''vacataire''''': Instructor, temporary position.
*'''''Professeur affilié''''': Adjunct professor.
*'''''Professeur assistant''''': Assistant professor.
*'''''Professeur associé''''': Associate professor.
*'''''Professeur''''': Full professor.
* Chaired professorships can be given to associate and full professors.

Typically, anyone teaching in a private school will identify themselves publicly as "Professeur" regardless of their internal rank. This is an acceptable practice for tenured or full-time staff (''professeurs permanents'') and permanently employed part-time staff (''professeurs affiliés''). It is considered inappropriate for others who teach a single course (''vacataires'' or ''chargés d'enseignements'').

==Administrative ranks==
Several administrative appointments can be held by academics in France. Most are elected positions, with prerogatives and duties described in the statutes of the relevant organization (university, faculty, research lab...).

*'''''Recteur''''' ([[Rector (academia)|Rector]]): High-level civil servants appointed by the Ministry of education to oversee an educational district called ''académie''. They are also chancellor of the universities in their district, meaning that they administrate the real estate owned by the State and used by the university. They usually are chosen among senior university professors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191|title=Code de l'éducation|last=|first=|date=|website=legifrance.fr|publisher=[[Légifrance]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|L222-2}}
*'''''Président de l'université''''' ([[University President]]): Elected position, usually held by a professor, for four years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|L712-2}} Presides over the ''Conseil d'administration'' (Boad of Directors), an elected body which governs the university. Usually also presides the ''Conseil académique'' (Academic Council), another elected body responsible for defining the University's research policies.
*'''''Doyen''''' ([[Dean (education)|Dean]]) or '''''Directeur d'unité de formation et de recherche''''' (Director of Teaching and Research Unit): Elected position, chairperson of one of the university schools, called ''faculté'' or ''unité de formation et de recherche''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|L713-3}} Presides over the ''Conseil de faculté'' (Faculty Council) or the ''Conseil d'UFR'' (UFR Council), an elected body representing the faculty.

Presides over the ''Conseil de laboratoire'' (Laboratory Council), an elected body representing the research unit. Appoints the ''Responsables d'équipe'' (team leaders) who manage the teams that constitute the research unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.univ-paris5.fr/content/download/35685/198010/version/1/file/Guide+des+directeurs+d%27unit%C3%A9s+de+recherche.pdf|title=Guide des directeurs d'unité de recherche|last=Paris Descartes University|first=|authorlink=Paris Descartes University|date=2017|website=univ-paris5.fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Sexton'''  (November 9, 1928 – October 4, 1974) was an American poet, known for her highly personal, [[confessional poetry|confessional verse]]. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry in 1967 for her book ''[[Live or Die (book)|Live or Die]]''. Her poetry details her long battle with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], suicidal tendencies, and various intimate details from her private life, including relationships with her husband and children whom it was later revealed she physically and sexually assaulted.

==Early life and family==
Anne Sexton was born '''Anne Gray Harvey''' in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] to Mary Gray (Staples) Harvey (1901–1959) and Ralph Churchill Harvey (1900–1959). She had two older sisters, Jane Elizabeth (Harvey) Jealous (1923–1983) and Blanche Dingley (Harvey) Taylor (1925–2011). She spent most of her childhood in Boston. In 1945 she enrolled at Rogers Hall boarding school, [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], later spending a year at [[Garland Junior College|Garland School]].&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; For a time she [[model (person)|modeled]] for Boston's Hart Agency. On August 16, 1948, she married Alfred Muller Sexton II and they remained together until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Cary |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/chrono.htm |title=Anne Sexton Chronology |work=Modern American Poetry website |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219234755/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/chrono.htm |archivedate= 19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morris &gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Tim |title=A Brief Biography of the Life of Anne Sexton |url=http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/poetry/as/bio1.html |date=1999-04-23 |publisher=[[University of Texas at Arlington]] |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton had her first child, [[Linda Gray Sexton]], in 1953. Her second child, Joyce Ladd Sexton, was born two years later.

==Poetry==
Sexton suffered from severe [[mental illness]] for much of her life, her first manic episode taking place in 1954. After a second episode in 1955 she met [[Martin Theodore Orne|Dr. Martin Orne]], who became her long-term therapist at the Glenside Hospital. It was Dr. Orne who encouraged her to write poetry.&lt;ref name="Middlebrook"&gt;Middlebrook&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poetry workshop she attended was led by [[John Holmes (poet)|John Holmes]]. Sexton felt great trepidation about registering for the class, asking a friend to make the phone call and accompany her to the first session. She found early acclaim with her poetry; a number were accepted by ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''. Sexton later studied with [[Robert Lowell]] at [[Boston University]] alongside distinguished poets [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[George Starbuck]].&lt;ref name=morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll |first=James |authorlink=James Carroll (novelist) |url=http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmarticleid=3360 |title=Review: ‘Anne Sexton: A Biography’ |journal=Ploughshares |date=Fall 1992 |issue=58 |volume=18 |accessdate=2009-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104042713/http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmArticleid=3360 |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexton's poetic career was encouraged by her mentor [[W.D. Snodgrass]], whom she met at the Antioch Writer's Conference in 1957. His poem "Heart's Needle" proved inspirational for her in its theme of separation from his three-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, W.D., [http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 "Heart's Needle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919122651/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 |date=2006-09-19 }}, American Academy of Poets&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton first read the poem at a time when her own young daughter was living with her mother-in-law. She, in turn, wrote "The Double Image", a poem which explores the multi-generational relationship between mother and daughter. Sexton began writing letters to Snodgrass and they became friends.

While working with John Holmes, Sexton encountered [[Maxine Kumin]]. They became good friends and remained so for the rest of Sexton's life. Kumin and Sexton rigorously critiqued each other's work and wrote four [[children's book]]s together. In the late 1960s, the manic elements of Sexton's illness began to affect her career, though she still wrote and published work and gave readings of her poetry. She collaborated with musicians, forming a jazz-rock group called Her Kind that added music to her poetry. Her play ''Mercy Street'', starring [[Marian Seldes]], was produced in 1969, after several years of revisions.&lt;ref&gt;(Musician [[Peter Gabriel]] wrote a song inspired by Sexton's work, also titled "[[Mercy Street]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton also collaborated with the artist [[Barbara Swan]], who illustrated several of her books.&lt;ref name=sexton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sexton|first1=Anne|last2=Sexton|first2=Linda Gray|title=Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters|date=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780618492428|pages=374, 436|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_BpgsXOZqgC&amp;pg=PA374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 12 years of writing her first sonnet, she was among the honored poets in the U.S.: a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and the first female member of the [[Harvard]] chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=pollitt-nyt &gt;{{cite news |last=Pollitt |first=Katha |authorlink=Katha Pollitt |title=The Death Is Not the Life |date=1991-08-18 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/18/books/the-death-is-not-the-life.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wagner-Martin |first=Linda |title=Anne Sexton’s Life |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/sexton_life.htm |date=2008-08-27 |work=Modern American Poetry website |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=2009-02-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219234026/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/sexton_life.htm| archivedate= 19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:AnneSextonGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Anne Sexton, located at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]]
On October 4, 1974, Sexton had lunch with Kumin to revise galleys for Sexton's manuscript of ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'', scheduled for publication in March 1975 (Middlebrook 396). On returning home she put on her mother's old fur coat, removed all her rings, poured herself a glass of vodka, locked herself in her garage, and started the engine of her car, ending her life by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Suicide of Anne Sexton |last=Hendin |first=Herbert |journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–62 |date=Fall 1993 |pmid=8249036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview over a year before her death, she explained she had written the first drafts of ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'' in 20 days with "two days out for despair and three days out in a [[mental hospital]]." She went on to say that she would not allow the poems to be published before her death. She is buried at [[Forest Hills Cemetery|Forest Hills Cemetery &amp; Crematory]] in [[Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts]].

==Content and themes of work==
Sexton is seen as the modern model of the [[Confessionalism (poetry)|confessional poet]] due to the intimate and emotional content of her poetry. Sexton often wrote and disclosed her struggles with mental illness through her work. Anne Sexton has also included important yet overlooked topics that touched on the overall experience for a women. Maxine Kumin described Sexton's work: "She wrote openly about menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, and drug addiction at a time when the proprieties embraced none of these as proper topics for poetry."&lt;ref&gt;''Anne Sexton'' (1988) Steven E. Colburn, University of Michigan Press, 1988 p438 {{ISBN|9780472063796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton's work towards the end of the sixties has been criticized as "preening, lazy and flip" by otherwise respectful critics.&lt;ref name="pollitt-nyt" /&gt; Some critics regard her dependence on alcohol as compromising her last work. However, other critics see Sexton as a poet whose writing matured over time. "Starting as a relatively conventional writer, she learned to roughen up her line...to use as an instrument against the 'politesse' of language, politics, religion [and] sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rothenberg |editor1-first=Jerome |editor2-last=Joris |editor2-first=Pierre |editor1-link=Jerome Rothenberg |title=Poems for the Millennium |volume=2 |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |page=330 |isbn=978-0-520-07225-1 |oclc=29702496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0e4lAAAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton was heavily criticized for her poem content and theme, but this is what made her ever so popular. 

Her eighth collection of poetry is entitled ''The Awful Rowing Toward God''. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, unwilling to administer [[last rites]], told her "God is in your typewriter." This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'' and ''[[The Death Notebooks]]'' are among her final works, and both center on the theme of dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne Sexton |work=Poets of Cambridge, U.S.A. |publisher=Harvard Square Library |url=http://harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/sexton.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028145353/http://harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/sexton.php |archivedate=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work started out as being about herself, however as her career progressed she made periodic attempts to reach outside the realm of her own life for poetic themes.&lt;ref name=ostriker &gt;{{cite book |last=Ostriker |first=Alicia |title=Writing like a woman |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-472-06347-5 |quote=Self was the center, self was the perimeter, of her vision... }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ostriker /&gt;  ''Transformations'' (1971), which is a re-visionary re-telling of [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], is one such book.&lt;ref&gt;Del George, Dana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dk9UPLDofsoC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Anne+Sexton+Godfather+death&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Anne%20Sexton%20Godfather%20death&amp;f=false ''The Supernatural in Short Fiction of the Americas: The Other World in the New World''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p. 37. {{ISBN|0-313-31939-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (''Transformations'' was used as the [[libretto]] for the 1973 [[Transformations (opera)|opera of the same name]] by American composer [[Conrad Susa]].)  Later she used [[Christopher Smart]]'s ''Jubilate Agno'' and the [[Bible]] as the basis for some of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Poems of Anne Sexton |last=Sexton |first=Anne |year=2000 |publisher=Mariner Books |location=Boston |editor1-last=Middlebrook |editor1-first=Diane Wood |editor2-last=George |editor2-first=Diana Hume |page=xvii |isbn=978-0-618-05704-7 |url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=682617 |accessdate=2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been made of the tangled threads of her writing, her life and her depression, much in the same way as with [[Sylvia Plath]]'s suicide in 1963. [[Robert Lowell]], [[Adrienne Rich]] and [[Denise Levertov]] commented in separate obituaries on the role of creativity in Sexton's death. Levertov says, "We who are alive must make clear, as she could not, the distinction between creativity and self-destruction."&lt;ref name=carroll /&gt;
&lt;!--She worked and succeeded in a male-dominated field that valued tradition and traditional educations in English literature. In the celebrity-obsessed world of the 1960s that continues today, Sexton's life reverberates with meaning about the implications of celebrity and its effects on the artist's life.{{Original research|date=June 2011}} {{POV|date=June 2011}}--&gt;

==Subsequent controversy==
Following one of many suicide attempts and manic or depressive episodes, Sexton worked with therapist Dr. Martin Orne.&lt;ref name="pollitt-nyt" /&gt; He diagnosed her with what is now described as [[bipolar disorder]], but his competence to do so is called into question by his early use of allegedly unsound psychotherapeutic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, K.R., [http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ISSUEID_CHAR=850C0446-E166-43CE-B484-54DAB90A59E&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=736A3D3A-5223-4B74-8FA9-B1DBF4F6D56 "Manic-depressive illness and creativity"].

During this process, he allegedly used suggestion to uncover memories of having been abused by her father.&lt;ref Name=Daddy&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SFdbcS_A1XEC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=sexton+repressed+memories+orne&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=95m4UryFFMuU7Qaco4BI&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sexton%20repressed%20memories%20orne&amp;f=false ''Imagining Incest: Sexton, Plath, Rich, and Olds on Life with Daddy''] (2003) Gale Swiontkowski, Susquehanna University Press, p26 {{ISBN|9781575910611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abuse was disputed in interviews with her mother and other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, pp. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Orne wrote that hypnosis in an adult frequently does not present accurate memories of childhood; instead, "adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin Orne, 76, Psychiatrist and Expert on Hypnosis, Dies |last=Nagourney |first=Eric |date=2000-02-17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/17/us/martin-orne-72-psychiatrist-and-expert-on-hypnosis-dies.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Orne, Anne Sexton was extremely suggestible and would mimic the symptoms of the patients around her in the mental hospitals to which she was committed. Diane Middlebrook's biography states that a separate personality named Elizabeth emerged in Sexton while under hypnosis. Dr. Orne did not encourage this development and subsequently this "alternate personality" disappeared. Dr. Orne eventually concluded that Anne Sexton was suffering from [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name="Middlebrook" /&gt; During the writing of the Middlebrook biography, her daughter, [[Linda Gray Sexton]], stated that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother.&lt;ref Name=Daddy/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hausman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hausman |first=Ken |journal=The Psychiatric News |date=1991-09-06 |title=Psychiatrist Criticized Over Release Of Poet’s Psychotherapy Tapes |url=http://www.dianemiddlebrook.com/sexton/tpn9-6.html |accessdate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321225256/http://dianemiddlebrook.com/sexton/tpn9-6.html |archivedate=2009-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she published her autobiography ''Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton'', which includes her own accounts of the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Linda Gray (1994) ''Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton''. Little Brown &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0-316-78207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/books/books-of-the-times-a-daughter-revisits-sexton-s-bedlam.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print  ''New York Times article''  ''A Daughter Revisits Sexton's Bedlam'' October 14, 1994]. Accessed 2010-08-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Middlebrook published her controversial biography of Anne Sexton with the approval of daughter Linda, Anne's literary executor.&lt;ref name="Middlebrook" /&gt; For use in the biography, Dr. Orne had given Diane Middlebrook most of the tapes recording the therapy sessions between Orne and Anne Sexton. The use of these tapes was met with, as ''The New York Times'' put it, "thunderous condemnation".&lt;ref name="pollitt-nyt" /&gt; Middlebrook received the tapes after she had written a substantial amount of the first draft of Sexton's biography, and decided to start over. Although Linda Gray Sexton collaborated with the Middlebrook biography, other members of the Sexton family were divided over the book, publishing several editorials and op-ed pieces in ''The New York Times'' and ''The New York Times Book Review''.

Controversy continued with the posthumous public release of the tapes (which had been subject to [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor-patient confidentiality]]). They are said to reveal Sexton's incestuous molesting of her daughter Linda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Poet Told All; Terapist Provides the Record | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/books/poet-told-all-therapist-provides-the-record.html?sec=health}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite news | title=Daughter Revisits Sexton's Bedlam | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/books/books-of-the-times-a-daughter-revisits-sexton-s-bedlam.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print}},&lt;/ref&gt; her physically violent behavior toward both her daughters, and her physical altercations with her husband.&lt;ref name="Hausman" /&gt;

Yet more controversy surrounded allegations that Anne Sexton had an affair with the therapist who replaced Dr. Orne in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Lance |title=Pains of The Poet—And Miracles |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=1991-09-23 |authorlink=Lance Morrow |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973887-1,00.html |accessdate=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No action was taken to censure or discipline the second therapist. Dr. Orne considered the affair with the second therapist (given the pseudonym "Ollie Zweizung" by Middlebrook and Linda Sexton) to be the catalyst that eventually resulted in her suicide.&lt;ref name=carroll /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Peter Gabriel]] dedicated his song "[[Mercy Street]]", from his 1986 album ''[[So (album)|So]]'', to Sexton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/so-19860814 | title= So | work=Rolling Stone | first=Tim | last=Holmes | date=1986-08-14 | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described as a "personal touchstone" for [[Morrissey]], former lead singer and lyricist of [[The Smiths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/morrissey-live-review-cardiff-observer-new-model | title= Morrissey review – in shockingly good voice throughout | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Thompson | date=2015-03-22 | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is commemorated on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back Bay East|url=http://bwht.org/back-bay-east/|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arban Method''' ('''La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn par Arban''') is a complete pedagogical method for students of [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], and other [[brass instrument]]s. The original edition was published by [[Jean-Baptiste Arban]] sometime before 1859 and is currently in print.&lt;ref name="gatesdissertation"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ap:10:0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1302723971 | title=An examination of Jean Maire's edition of J.B. Arban's Grande méthode complète pour cornet à pistons et de saxhorn (c.1859) and its contribution to modern trumpet pedagogy, with suggested augmentations of Maire's edition based on identification of requisite technical skills inherent in trumpet performance | publisher=Ohio State University | author=Gates, Charles R. | year=1992 | location=Columbus | oclc=30720266}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains hundreds of exercises, ranging in difficulty. The method begins with basic exercises and progresses to very advanced compositions, including the famous arrangement of ''[[Carnival of Venice (song)|Carnival of Venice]]''.

==Text==
===Introduction===
In the Introduction J. B. Arban covers the range of the cornet (trumpet). He also details alternate fingerings and describes the use of the tuning slide. Arban states his opinion that the mouthpiece should be two-thirds on the lower lip and one-third on the upper. ([[Herbert Lincoln Clarke]] recommends the mouthpiece to rest half upper lip and half lower lip.) Arban then stresses the proper "attack" technique. He uses the "tu" pronunciation, which in French is said with the tongue in the "tee" position. Arban concludes with proper breathing technique (see [[diaphragmatic breathing]]).&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"&gt;{{cite book | title=Arban's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet Platinum Edition | publisher=Carl Fischer Music | author=Arban, Jean-Baptiste | year=2005 | isbn=9780825858529}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=5–9}}

===I. First Studies===
Arban then begins his method with a focus on tone (Studies 1-10). The next studies (11-50) familiarize the student with fingerings, develop his or her range, and instill a habit of precision in attacking the notes. In the next section, which is devoted to syncopation, goes from a simple quarter-half-quarter rhythm to a sixteenth-eighth-sixteenth repeated rhythm. Next, Arban focuses on the dotted eighth-sixteenth and eighth-double sixteenth rhythms. He ends the First Studies with 10 studies on the 6/8 meter.&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|pages=11–36}}

===II. Playing Methods: Slurring or Legato Playing===
Professor Arban devotes the next section of his vast method to slurring or legato playing. He begins with simple slurs that are accomplished by the variation of valves. He suggests pronouncing "taw-ee" while playing.&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|page=39}} The editor recommends adding little more air on the top note. (Such a technique is also needed to accomplish trills.)&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|page=39}} Arban devotes half of this whole section, though, to lip slurs. He concludes this section with a series of advanced studies combining slurred and staccato playing.

===III. Scales===
[[File:Arbans page 22 chromatic study.png|thumb|A chromatic scale exercise from Arban's Method.]]
Arban's series on scales includes studies of major, minor, and chromatic scales, as well as numerous variations thereof. Arban admits to giving minor scales "limited treatment," but Gordon refutes this by citing the nonexistence of "limits on the use of the Trumpet and Cornet."&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|page=57}}

===IV. Ornaments===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
Next, Arban teaches the student the various ornaments that can be played on a trumpet or cornet. He details the [[Appoggiatura#Appoggiatura|simple appoggiatura]], grace note ([[Ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|short appoggiatura]]), portamento, double appoggiatura, the [[Ornament (music)#Turn|turn]], the [[Ornament (music)#Trill|trill]], and the [[Ornament (music)#Mordent|mordent]]. Arban concludes the fourth section by combining the various ornaments and integrating them into various tunes.

===V. More Advanced Studies===
The "more advanced studies" include studies on intervals; broken octaves and tenths; triplets; the four-sixteenth rhythmic figure; major and minor arpeggios; the dominant seventh arpeggio; and [[cadenza]]s.

===VI. Tonguing===
Next, Arban focuses on triple tonguing, double tonguing, and fanfare tonguing. Arban uses various "tu-ku" pronunciation combinations, and Gordon subsequently replaces these with "tee-kee" combinations.&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|page=153}} In his studies on double tonguing, Arban includes a score of studies in which he combines double tonguing with slurs occurring on various beats and within them.&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|pages=183–187}}

===The Art of Phrasing: 150 Classic and Popular Melodies===
The Art of Phrasing was written by Arban in 1866, but was never added to the original French edition of the Method. These songs and duets first appeared in the American Edition of the Arban Method published by the Jean White Company in 1872. This new version added 28 duets entitled 28 Recreations, 32 Melodies, and 100 Art of the Phrasing songs. Carl Fischer and J.W. Pepper also added the Art of Phrasing to their Arban Methods in the late 1800s.

===68 Duets for Two Cornets===
As in his other sections, Arban progresses from simple pieces to more challenging ones. All of these, however, require their performers to be synchronized with one another.

===14 Characteristic Studies===
Before his final 12 fantasias, Arban provides 14 challenging characteristic studies. His concluding remarks preceding these are as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Those of my readers who…want to attain…perfection, should…try to hear good music well interpreted. They must seek out…the most illustrious models, and…purify their taste, verify their sentiments, and bring themselves as near as possible to that which is beautiful.&lt;ref name="arban2005platinum"/&gt;{{rp|page=283}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These passages are challenging and are longer than all of the previous sections' pieces. Each is a full page long (in the platinum edition), and they crescendo in difficulty as they progress; the fourteenth study is two pages long and the only piece in this section in {{frac|12|8}} time.

===12 Celebrated Fantasies and Airs Varies===
In addition to the eleven fantasias (fantasies) for B-flat cornets, there is one for the A cornet ("Fantasie and Variations on Acteon"). Arban's celebrated composition "Fantasie and Variations on ''The Carnival of Venice''" is the eleventh fantasia in the list. The platinum edition of Arban's Method includes an accompaniment CD for the twelve fantasia. (Each accompaniment includes pauses for the various cadenzas in each song.)

== Certification ==

The ATMAE certification program recognizes individual certified members who have met certain professional standards to become certified and to maintain their certification. ATMAE currently operates four programs, the Certified Technology Manager program, CTM &amp; CSTM (formerly called Certified Industrial Technologist, CIT &amp; CSIT), the Certified Manufacturing Specialist program, CMS &amp; CSMS, the Certified Technical Professional program, CTP &amp; CSTP, and the Certified in Engineering Graphics program, CEG &amp; CEGS.

'''Certified in Engineering Graphics (CEG / CSEG):''' The Certified in Engineering Graphics program is for individuals with a background in the expression of industrial design ideas through engineering graphics, including geometric construction, orthographic views, and standardized annotations. The exam is geared toward the industry standard expression of design ideas as contract documents – used within the industrial enterprise in areas such as manufacturing process planning, quality control, purchasing, and other areas of expertise.

'''Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS / CSMS):''' The Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) program is geared toward programs with a strong manufacturing emphasis and the exam was developed with help from ATMAE members working in such programs.

'''Certified Technology Manager (CTM / CSTM) (Formerly Certified Industrial Technologist, CIT / CSIT):''' The Certified Technology Manager (CTM) program is based on a broad-based multi-subject exam, updated from the old Certified Industrial Technologist exam, which can be used by many technology and technology management programs, regardless of emphasis.

'''Certified Technical Professional (CTP / CSTP):''' The New Certified Technical Professional (CTP) program is designed to serve graduates of both 2-Year and 4-Year Programs. The exam is broad-based, geared to technical programs without a management component that result in either an associate (AS, AAS) degree or a baccalaureate (BS, BA) degree.

'''Initial CEG, CMS, CTM, and CTP Certification Eligibility:''' Individuals meeting the following criteria are eligible to be certified by ATMAE in the Certified in Engineering Graphics (CEG), Certified Technology Manager (CTM), Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS), Certified Technical Professional (CTP) programs:

The '''Association of Texas Small School Bands (ATSSB)''' is a musical organization dedicated to promoting the interests of small school bands in the state of Texas.  The focus of ATSSB is on serving the needs of small school band students, directors, parents, and administrators. ATSSB was created in 1991.

ATSSB Membership is open to any band director and/or assistant director, those high schools which the [[University Interscholastic League]] classifies as class 4A(AAAA) and below (beginning in 2014-15) or middle school that feeds a 4A or smaller high school or a private middle school, with classifications determined by enrollment. The school must be accredited by the Texas Education Agency or an accrediting agency approved by the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission.

The Association of Texas Small School Bands is headquartered in [[Houston, Texas]]. Although, ATSSB was formed out of frustration with the [[Texas Music Educators Association]] (believing it, and especially its All-State Band, to be dominated by the larger AAAA and AAAAA schools), the two organizations regularly work together, (alongside with the Texas Bandmasters Organization), to promote music education in Texas. ATSSB meets twice each year in General Session - once in February and once in July.

In addition, the ATSSB All-State Bands rehearse and perform in San Antonio in February.  Each year, ATSSB hosts an [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] process to select two high school all-state bands and a [[jazz band]].

==History==
At a [[Texas Music Educators Association]] Executive Board meeting in 1981, Region 2 Chairman Lonnie Dooley made a request for a feasibility study to consider designating one of the existing All-State bands for 4A and down students only. This request was based on information that although half of the students in Texas attended schools class 4A and down, less than twelve percent of the students in the All-State Bands were from those classifications. Less than three percent were from 3A schools and down. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 55 to 6 to make the study. Lonnie asked what had to be done to get the issue before the general membership and TMEA President Bill Woods responded by naming a committee to study the proposal. The committee returned a negative report and after some discussion, the measure failed. After 1981, the number of small school bandsmen in the All-State Band continued to decline as the quality and quantity of private lesson programs in 4A and 5A schools increased, in effect eliminating small school students from an allstate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panktraz|first1=Fred|last2=Dooley|first2=Lonnie|last3=Marsh|first3=Mike|last4=Griffin|first4=Kenneth|last5=Stockton|first5=Don|last6=Page|first6=Ronnie|title=A History of the Association of Texas Small School Bands|date=1999|publisher=Association of Texas Small School Bands|url=http://www.atssb.org/execsec/ATSSB.History.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Mike Marsh, from Eldorado High School and TMEA Band Division Chairman of Region VII, sent a letter to small school band directors across the state. In his letter, he called for directors to petition their Region Band Chairs to call for a referendum on the creation of a small-school All-State Band at the TMEA Band Division meeting to be held in February. Scott Taylor (TMEA Band Division  Vice-President) appointed a “Small-School All-State Band Committee” which met in February prior to the Band Division meeting. Because this committee brought a negative report to the Band Division (8 were against, 6 for, and 2 abstained), it was quickly set aside. Before the issue could be dismissed, Kenneth Griffin from Van High School made a motion that a committee be named to “study the feasibility of creating an All-State Band specifically for students from 1A, 2A, and 3A classification schools” and that the findings of this committee be reported to the band division for their consideration at the 1991 convention. The motion was quickly seconded and the motion resoundingly passed, so Taylor subsequently appointed members to the All-State Band Reorganization Study (ASBROS). Mike Marsh (one of the appointees) had sent out a questionnaire asking who in small schools was for or against the creation of a small-school All-State Band. He received 210 responses - 202 for and 8 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Exline|first1=Jimmie|last2=Dye|first2=Keith|last3=Stoune|first3=Michael|title=The association of Texas small school bands: An historical perspective|date=May 2012|publisher=Duraspace|location=Texas Tech University Libraries|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2346/45307|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Coachman took over as Band Division Vice-President (Scott Taylor moved on to TMEA President) and guided the ASBROS committee to come up with the proposal concerning the small school All-State Band. However, Coachman added the inclusion of CCC students - something no one had ever proposed in initial discussions. In the ensuing 1991 Band Division meeting, several directors spoke for and against the proposal. Kenneth Griffin made a motion that the vote be taken to include only A, AA and AAA schools. His motion was ruled out of order by Frank Coachman and ballots were cast. The vote was 554 to 372 against the creation of a small-school All-State Band as presented by the ASBROS committee. The frustration small-school directors experienced at that February meeting inspired John Gibson from Ballinger to immediately write a letter to several small-school directors asking if they would be interested in forming a small-school band association. The positive responses he received led him to invite directors across the state who had expressed an interest in small school bands to meet in Abilene. The meeting was held in the Wylie High School band hall in Abilene, Texas, on Saturday, March 16, 1991.

A long afternoon of discussion centered around several topics, including: 1) the need for such an organization; 2) its purpose; 3) its philosophy; 4) its function - including the possibility of creating and maintaining an A-AA-AAA All-State Band; and 5) the need for immediate funds (it was decided that each one present would contribute $100 to cover the expenses of getting started). It was agreed that the purpose of the association was not in defiance of or opposition to already established organizations, but was to more fully disseminate information to, and educate and refine the unique role of, small school bands in the state of Texas. The organization was named the “Association of Texas Small School Bands.” In discussion regarding the organization of ATSSB, it was decided that a Region Coordinator should be named to represent the association at the region level. These were either named from directors in attendance at that meeting or were to be secured at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMEA/ATSSB Joint Agreement|url=http://www.atssb.org/execsec/TMEA_ATSSB_Alignment_2015.pdf|website=TMEA_ATSSB_Alignment_2015.pdf|publisher=Association of Texas Small Bands and Texas Music Educators Association|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that the Association would make plans to have an All-State Band clinic in San Antonio February 5–8, 1992. After objections about it being in conjunction with the TMEA convention, it was argued that it was also in conjunction with the Fat Stock Show and other lesser conventions, but that it would be difficult for small school directors to take off from school for the two events, and that most would remain as members of TMEA in addition to belonging to and participating in the activities of ATSSB. The consensus was that if at least 100 directors would participate the first year, the organization and the ensuing All-State Band would be successful. Actually, 380 directors joined that first year. In April 1991, a letter was sent to all A, AA, and AAA band directors in Texas inviting them to join the Association. They were told that ATSSB would: be a non-profit organization dedicated to the needs of students in Texas A, AA and AAA programs; support and recognize excellence in A, AA and AAA band programs and the students involved in them; be dedicated to the promotion and advancement of A, AA and AAA band programs; promote music education in Texas A, AA and AAA schools and their supporting communities through their band programs; and make every effort to organize a AAA All-State Band to recognize the individual excellence of A, AA and AAA band members in Texas.

The second meeting of the Association was held in Abilene on June 8, 1991. Mike Marsh and Kenneth Griffin reported on their trip to San Antonio to determine if there was a site for rehearsals and housing for the proposed All-State Band. After checking with area hotels (cost prohibitive and unavailable ballrooms for rehearsals - Beethoven Hall too small and the Majestic Theater booked), they were directed to the Scottish Rite Auditorium. After visiting with the staff and booking space for the rehearsal and performance, they stepped out of the auditorium and noticed the Ramada Emily Morgan Hotel in the next block adjacent to the Alamo. Entering the hotel and visiting with the Sales Manager, they booked rooms for the all-state students during the clinic. Final arrangements were completed regarding the organization of the Association, including the adoption of the Constitution and By-Laws, region alignment, area alignment, audition procedures, color instrument taped audition procedures, selection of the Prescribed Music List for auditions for 1991-92, and the establishment of a quarterly Newsletter.

During the summer and fall of 1991, several meetings were held with the TMEA Executive Committee and officers to discuss: using TMEA region band auditions to certify ATSSB Area students (denied); using the state of Texas for ATSSB All-State Band patches (required no permission); and allowing students to audition for both TMEA and ATSSB at the Area level (it was decided that ATSSB would hold Area auditions on the same date as TMEA but in different locations). Since that summer and fall, continuing discussion with successive leaders in TMEA leadership has: allowed ATSSB All-State students access to TMEA exhibits and clinics for a fee which was dropped in 1999; allowed ATSSB meetings and All-State Band rehearsal schedules and concerts listings in TMEA programs; and given the ATSSB membership the opportunity to hear candidates for TMEA office. ATSSB and TMEA agreed to align their audition processes in 1999-2000, using identical rules and procedures for auditions, but allowing ATSSB to maintain the use of its own Prescribed Audition List and separate funding for all activities.

==The ATSSB All-State Band==
Since its inception, ATSSB has not only kept its ever-increasing number of members informed of small school band activities across the state, it has also sponsored the ATSSB All-State Band: The first ATSSB All-State Band met in rehearsals in San Antonio under the direction of Gary Lewis from the University of Michigan in February 1992. There were 123 students in the first band from at least 76 different A, AA and AAA high schools in Texas. There were initially 380 ATSSB members during the first year. In 1996, One student was recognized for making the ATSSB All-State Band for all four years and was given a $1000 scholarship for the achievement (the fund was started in April 1995 after a proposal by Wayne Smith as the ATSSB 4-Year All-State Band Scholarship – the three students who had made the ATSSB All-State Band all four years in 1995 were also awarded the $1000 scholarship retroactively). In 1997 the addition of a second all-state band for ATSSB: the Symphonic Band was led by Dr. Tim Lautzenheiser and the Concert Band was led by Dr. Gary Garner from West Texas State University. Additionally, the ATSSB State Board of Directors voted to award the $1000 scholarship to the original three students who had made the ATSSB All-State Band all four years. In 2003, the Scholarship program was expanded, increasing the 4-year scholarship to $2000 and adding a $500 scholarship to seniors who made all-state three years. In 2004 the ATSSB All-State Jazz Ensemble was added with Shelly Berg from the University of Southern California as the first clinician. In 2013, The band was divided by vote of the membership into the Concert Band (Class 1A-3A Track) and Symphonic Band (1A-4A Track) with color instruments divided among the band on an open track.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">'''Cecil Augustus Wright''' (July 2, 1904 - April 24, 1967), often called '''Caesar Wright''', was a famous Canadian [[jurist]], law professor, and a prominent figure in the Canadian legal education reform. He was among the first law professors to import the Harvard [[case method]] into Canadian legal education. He was also known for his confrontational and aggressive personality.

He was born in [[London, Ontario]]. He taught at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] from 1927. During this time he championed many reforms of the legal education system, and in particular favoured a greater role for classroom instruction over the existing apprenticeship model. In 1949, the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]] rejected his proposed reforms and Wright left Osgoode to take up the position of Dean at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law]]. Together with other professors, including [[Bora Laskin]],  he shaped the undergraduate law program into a professional law school. He remained with the university until his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6431">[[File:Carl Nicolai Starcke 1897.jpg|thumb|Starcke]]
'''Carl Nicolai Starcke''' (born 29 March 1858 in Copenhagen, died 7 March 1926 in Copenhagen) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[sociologist]], [[politician]], educator and [[philosopher]].  He is buried at [[Holmens Cemetery]]. He was the father of [[Viggo Starcke]], another writer and publisher of books such as ''Denmark in World History''.

==Life==
Starcke graduated in 1883 with a thesis on [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]].&lt;ref name="denstoredanske"&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Samfund%2C_jura_og_politik/Filosofi/Filosofi_i_1800-_og_1900-t./Carl_Nicolai_Starcke Den Store Danske]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he was against the resistance of Harald Høffding, a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="denstoredanske" /&gt; His first political party he joined was [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], a liberal party. In 1905 he co-founded the social-liberal party Venstre Det radicals. He was dissatisfied with the party and therefore started the establishment of [[Danmarks Retsforbund]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henrygeorge.dk/pionererne/ Den Danske Henry George Forenings pionerer]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1913 to 1916 he was chairman of the [[Foreningen Norden|Henry George fora ingen]].

==Education==
In 1899 Starcke founded Det Danske Selskabs Skole ({{lang-en|The Danish Society School}}), the first free high school in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Den Danske Henry George Forening: [http://www.henrygeorge.dk/pionererne/ Den Danske Henry George Forenings pionerer]&lt;/ref&gt; It closed again in 1911, just 12 years after it was opened.

=="The primitive family in its origin and development"==

===Family sociology===
Starcke published a book named ''Die primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung'' in 1888. In it, he examined the social structures of different populations in Africa, Asia and Australia, and compared them with each other.

Starcke wrote about this book:
{{quote|The purpose of my work is to identify the primitive family and the ideas on which it is built, and the germs of moral growth, it contains evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starcke|first=Carl Nikolai|title=Die Primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung.|year=1888|publisher=Brockhaus|pages=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Comparative method===
Starcke speculation turned against the construction of history and wants it by the application of the comparative method to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starcke|first=Carl Nikolai|title=Die Primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung.|year=1888|publisher=Brockhaus|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is against a misunderstanding of this method:

{{quote|Same legends and myths, like Social institutions, customs and traditions, we can not interpret this as testimony to common origin, because such similarities may be due to causes that can occur quite independently in several places and at different times into being.&lt;ref name="Starcke1888"&gt;{{cite book|last=Starcke|first=Carl Nikolai|title=Die Primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung.|year=1888|publisher=Brockhaus|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Starcke, the comparative method can not be a common origin, but close to the same conditions.&lt;ref name="Starcke1888" /&gt;

===Source criticism===
He grappled with the quality of the source material, and explores the question of why authors come from the same sources to different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starcke|first=Carl Nikolai|title=Die Primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung.|year=1888|publisher=Brockhaus|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starcke distinguished four categories of sources:
*direct historical accounts of the development of a particular community during a certain period
*travel stories
*written down old laws and customs
*ancient myths and legends and archaeological reports

He points to the problem circuits to interpolate to periods for which there are no sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starcke|first=Carl Nikolai|title=Die Primitive Familie in ihrer Entstehung und Entwickelung.|year=1888|publisher=Brockhaus|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
''Most of these books were written in his native language [[Danish language|Danish]], but there are French and English translations available for several. Listed chronologically.''

The '''Costa Rica Institute of Technology''', ('''Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica'''), also known as "ITCR" or "TEC", is the top public university specializing in engineering and science in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]], [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="La_Nacion_History_2"/&gt;

The ITCR is a national autonomous institution of higher education, dedicated to the teaching, research and extension in technology and associated sciences. It was created by Law No. 4777 on June 10, 1971. Its main campus is in Cartago, 24&amp;nbsp;km east of the capital [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

The ITCR offers undergraduate and graduate studies in fields including engineering (construction, industrial production, electronics, industrial maintenance, biotechnology, mechatronics), computer science and business management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tec.ac.cr/Paginas/OpcionesAcademicas.aspx Academic options] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023131321/http://www.tec.ac.cr/Paginas/OpcionesAcademicas.aspx |date=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
Rafael Ángel González Chaves a public school teacher from [[San Ramón, Costa Rica|San Ramón]] was one of the first proponents of creating an institute of technology in the country.&lt;ref name="La_Nacion_History_1"&gt;{{cite news

|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later part of the 1960s he was looking for supporters to introduce a bill that would create the institute. His efforts finally paid off when in June 10, 1971 president [[José Figueres Ferrer]] signed a law that mandated the creation of the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (Costa Rica Institute of Technology).&lt;ref name="La_Nacion_History_2"&gt;{{cite news

At the time president Figueres indicated the need to emulate the successful models from other technology schools such as [[Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey|TEC de Monterrey]], from whom he indicated he would request assistance in order to kickstart the project.&lt;ref name="La_Nacion_History_2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The Council for Educational Technology&lt;ref&gt;This text is a summary of a more detailed description here http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/cet.html&lt;/ref&gt; (originally called the National '''Council for Educational Technology''' (NCET) but reformed as the Council for Educational Technology (CET) in 1972) was set up in 1967 by the Department of Education and Science in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/apr/20/national-council-for-educational&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially it consisted of a large council of experts with a small administrative team whose purpose was to "advise educational services and industrial training organisations on the use of audio visual aids and media" but it quickly became more than this, developing projects, producing an academic journal BJET and advising government on setting up major computer aided learning programmes ([[National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning|NDPCAL]] and [[Microelectronics Education Programme|MEP]]).  It was amalgamated with the [[Microelectronics Education Support Unit]] (MESU) in 1989 to form the [[National Council for Educational Technology]] (NCET which later was renamed the British Educational and Communication Technology Agency ([[Becta]]) in 1997).

==Formation==
The original Council (NCET) consisted of a Chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science after consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, 31 members appointed by the former and 4 members appointed by the latter. In addition, assessors from eight government departments and educational bodies attended meetings. In 1973, as a result of the recommendations of the Hudson Working Party&lt;ref&gt;Central Arrangements for promoting Educational Technology in the United Kingdom, HMSO, 1972),&lt;/ref&gt; the Council was a representative body, consisting of 59 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directors==

===Professor Tony Becher 1967-1969 ===
Tony Becher was the first Director appointed&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156&lt;/ref&gt; from the Nuffield Foundation&lt;ref&gt;"Educational Technology Two", Education + Training, Vol. 10 Iss 12 pp. 481 - 481&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoffrey Hubbard 1969-1986 ===
Geoffrey Hubbard  was appointed as Director  in June 1969. He was previously an engineer and then a civil servant at the Ministry of Technology.  He successfully steered the Council through its sometimes difficult relationship with government.  He retired in 1986 but continued his role as Chairman of the [[National Extension College]].

===Richard Fothergill 1987-1988 ===
Richard Fothergill was appointed Director following his role as Director of the Microelectronics Education Programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/15/guardianobituaries.obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;

==The British Journal of Educational Technology ==
The British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) was sponsored and funded by the Council.  It published its first issue in January 1970 and  Professor Norman Mackenzie was its first editor and the prime mover behind its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156&lt;/ref&gt; Although sponsored by the Council it always kept a strong, peer-reviewed, academic approach to its work - as it said in its "Auspices" at the front of each volume.

''Whilst the British Journal of Educational Technology is supported by the Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom, it nevertheless reflects an independent, and not official view, of developments or opinions on educational technology.''

BJET continued through the decades and is now published by Blackwell and continues to publish academic articles on educational technology. Importantly its back numbers chronicle much of the history of educational technology in the UK and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s computers were beginning to make an impact on education and John Duke, the Council's newly appointed assistant Director proposed a major initiative in computer-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1977, Editorial Introduction, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p164&lt;/ref&gt; The Council set up a Working Party to investigate the potential role of the computer and to outline a programme of research and development.  Following a feasibility study the Council set out the case for a 5-year programme in 'computer-based learning' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1960s/orig_NCET.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Government, following much discussion amongst the interested departments and an intervening general election, announced the approval of Mrs Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science to a '[[National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning]]' in a DES press release dated 23 May 1972.

==Developing MEP==
During the late 1970s, with the rapid rise in the use of microelectronics, the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan, is reported to have asked each government department to draw up an action plan to meet the challenge of new technologies and the DES asked CET to create plans for a new programme - the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;Fothergill (1988) Implications of New Technology for the School Curriculum (London, Kogan Page)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Programme was aimed at primary and secondary schools in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Although it was delayed by the change of government in 1979, Keith Joseph as Education Secretary finally approved it in 1980 and in March a four-year programme for schools, costing £9 million.

==Publications==
As well as BJET CET published a range of publications, many the result of projects it set up and funded.  The following is a selection of these publications to give a flavour of the breadth and range of the Council's activity:
* 1972 Educational Technology: The Development, Application and Evaluation of Systems, Techniques and Aids to Improve the Process of Human Learning
* 1974 Copyright and education: a guide to the use of copyright material in educational institutions 
* 1978 Deciding to Individualize Learning: A Study of the Process, Malcolm L. MacKenzie
* 1980 How to write a distance learning course, Roger Lewis and Glyn Jones
* 1981 The Kingdom of Sand: Essays to Salute a World in Process of Being Born, William Gosling
* 1984 Open Learning in Action: Case Studies, Roger Lewis
* 1986 The Magic of the Micro: a resource for children with learning difficulties, Mary Hope

== Biography ==

Hamlin was born in [[Waterford, Maine]] and grew up on his family's farm estate. At sixteen, he entered an apprenticeship as a silversmith and jeweler in [[Portland, Maine]] before deciding to enter the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/mylifetimes00haml |last=Hamlin |first=Cyrus |title=My Life and Times|year= 1893 |page= 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first attended Bridgton Academy before heading to college. He graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1834 and from [[Bangor Theological Seminary]] in 1837.  The Hamlins were a prominent nineteenth-century [[Maine]] family which also produced a [[Vice President of the United States]] ([[Hannibal Hamlin]]) and at least two Civil War generals, one of whom was also named Cyrus Hamlin.

He promptly left the United States in 1838 as a [[missionary]] under the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], arriving in the Ottoman Empire in January 1839. Hamlin helped found [[Bebek Seminary]] in 1840 as part of his outreach to Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 479-484.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamlin established a workshop at Bebek to teach his students marketable trades, to help alleviate their severe poverty.&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; From this workshop sprung a baking business, by which Hamlin became the primary provider of bread to the British Army hospital in Istanbul during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 324-329&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that Hamlin became acquainted with [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 332-336&lt;/ref&gt; While the workshop and bakery were controversial to the American Board, the funds earned by Hamlin's enterprises helped build thirteen Protestant Armenian churches in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, he began the work of establishing [[Robert College]] in [[Constantinople]], [[Ottoman Empire]]. After years of unsuccessfully lobbying the Ottoman authorities for permission to build the school, Hamlin was eventually granted an imperial order granting permission for the school to be built and permitting it to be under American (United States) protection and fly the flag of the [[United States of America]]. The school opened its doors on May 15, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;My Life and Times, p. 448-469&lt;/ref&gt; Hamlin served as its president until an unfortunate conflict in 1876, which forced his return to the United States where he later served as professor of dogmatic theology at [[Bangor Theological Seminary]].

He was elected president of [[Middlebury College]] in [[Vermont]] in 1880. His term was short, lasting only until 1885. However, Hamlin's guidance brought the College back from the brink of collapse and began a recovery process that would ultimately lead to unprecedented growth in the early years of the 20th Century. Hamlin resolved severe disciplinary issues inherited from his predecessor and personally contracted critical upgrades to the physical plant. However, the most significant event of Hamlin's administration—one that would prove key in maintaining Middlebury's stability later on—was the college's decision to accept women in 1883. Hamlin was seventy-four by 1885 when he unsurprisingly retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stameshkin | first=David M. | title=The Town's College: Middlebury College 1800-1915 | publisher= Middlebury College Press | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published ''Among the Turks'' (1878) and ''My Life and Times'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hamlin |first=Cyrus |year=1877 |title=Among the Turks |publisher=American Tract Society |place=New York |edition= 1 |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/amongturks00hamluoft#page/n5/mode/2up|accessdate=20 March 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hamlin |first=Cyrus |year=1893 |title= My Life and Times |publisher=The Pilgrim Press |place=Chicago |edition= 5 |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/mylifetimes1912haml#page/n3/mode/2up|accessdate=20 March 2016}} via Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Hamlin Hall at [[Boğaziçi University]] (formerly part of [[Robert College]]), as well as Hamlin Hall in [[Middlebury College]]'s Freeman International Center are named after him.

For many years, he lived in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. He is buried in Lexington's Munroe Cemetery.

The '''Education Act 1496''' was an act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] (1496 c. 87) that required landowners to send their eldest sons to school to study [[Latin]], [[the arts|arts]] and [[Scots law|law]]. This made [[compulsory education|schooling compulsory]] for the first time in the world.

The [[humanistic education|humanist]] intent was to ensure that [[local government in Scotland|local government]] lay in competent hands and to improve the administration of justice nationwide by making the [[civil law (legal system)|legal system]] more responsive at the local level. The act states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 |publisher=K.M. Brown et al. eds (St Andrews, 2007), 1605/6/39 |url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/ |accessdate=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* all [[barons in Scotland|baron]]s and [[freehold (Scots law)|substantial freeholder]]s shall put their eldest sons and heirs into school from the age of 8 or 9.
* these shall remain in [[grammar school#Origins|grammar school]]s under competent instruction until they have perfect [[Latin]].
* They shall next spend 3 years at the schools of art and law.
* the purpose of this education is:
** that they have knowledge and understanding of the laws, for the benefit of justice throughout the realm.
** that those who become sheriffs or judges will have the knowledge to do justice.
** to eliminate the need of the poor to seek redress from the king's principal auditors for each small injury (see [[Scottish Poor Laws]]).
* anyone who fails to do so without a lawful excuse shall pay the king the sum of [[Pound Scots|£20 Scots]].
The act was passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] at [[Edinburgh]] on 13 June 1496 in the reign of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], and in the 19th century it remained in effect as one of the principal Statutes for the management of schools under [[Scots law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barclay |first=Hugh |title=A Digest of the Law of Scotland |edition=2nd |publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark |date=1855 |location=Edinburgh |pages=907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act is sometimes referred to as the '''Education Act of 1494''', this is due to an error in some editions of the ''Acts of Parliament'' where it is listed as 1494 James IV, c. 54.

'''Eva Gronbach''' (born 1971, [[Cologne, Germany]]) is a German fashion designer.

== Life and career ==

Gronbach grew up in [[Germany]]‘s [[Rhineland]], between Cologne and Bonn. After High-School ([[Waldorf school]]) she started out as a trainee ladies' tailor at [http://www.elly-bk.de/ Elly-Heuss-Knapp Schule] in Düsseldorf before she studied at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130128230159/http://www.lacambre.be/ Institut supérieur des arts visuels La Cambre] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. In 2000, Gronbach received a diploma in "Stylisme et Création de la Mode". As an exchange student at the Paris [http://www.ifm-paris.com/ Institut Français de la Mode] (IFM) she received the Master of Arts. Gronbach lives in Berlin.

===Engagement and Commissioned Work===

During her studies, Gronbach worked for various designers like [[Stephen Jones (milliner)|Stephen Jones]], [[Yohji Yamamoto]], [[John Galliano]] and [[Hermès]].  For the soccer [[World Cup 2006]] she produced the official fan shirt on behalf of the initiative Deutschland – Land der Ideen (“Germany: Land of Ideas”), initiated by the [[Bundesregierung]] (federal government) and the German industry, represented by the Federation of German Industries (BDI). In the same year, Gronbach designed a shoe collection for the sport shoe producer Möbus. In 2008, the [[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]] (Federal Agency for Civic Education) contracted her for the design of accessories for the theater festival „ECHT! - Politik im freien Theater“ ("REAL! - Politics at the Free Theater"). At the same time, Gronbach was commissioned to design uniforms for the international hotel chain [[Novotel]]. She also created the "KölnShirt" in cooperation with ''Köln Tourismus'', which is made of bio cotton and shows the cathedral in Cologne before nightfall.

===Labels and Collections===

Gronbach's [http://www.goethe.de/KUE/des/prj/mod/dsg/abc/en4084364.htm collections] with mostly linear cut and clear forms address current political and social issues such as national identity, femininity, and sustainability. Her work is sold in Europe, Asia, and the USA.

Gronbach has founded the labels „[https://de-de.facebook.com/pages/Eva-Gronbach/95384684770 Eva Gronbach]“ and „[https://de-de.facebook.com/germanjeansatelier german jeans]“. "german jeans" is a basic collection for women and men, offered next to her Couture collection "Eva Gronbach". "german jeans" is inspired by coal miners. The clothes are produced of used coal miners' work wear, which is grey-beige and has obvious stains. The brand mark of Gronbach is a stylized eagle (similar to Germany's national eagle), which is stamped with her name on many of her pieces.

The designer first gained international recognition in 2000 with her collection „Déclaration d’amour à l’Allemagne“. The motif of the stylized eagle, the use of the Germany's national colors black, red and gold and of the letter "D" caused a sensation and evoked heated debates.

===Exhibitions and Fashion Shows===

Gronbach's work is presented internationally. Her fashion is shown at museums, fashion weeks, exhibitions, and public institutions. The designer has also worked as a curator for various institutions.

In 2003, she worked as guest curator for the exhibition „In. Femme Fashion – 1780-2004“ at the [[Museum für Angewandte Kunst (Cologne)|Museum of Applied Arts Cologne]] (MAKK). The subject was the modeling of femininity over time. Afterwards the museum decided to buy some pieces of Gronbach's collection.

In 2004, Gronbach presented her work at [http://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/ber/enindex.htm Goethe Institute Berlin]. A year later, she curated the exhibition "The Fashion Generation" for the Stadtmuseum Düsseldorf. For this exhibition Gronbach travelled to the world's most renowned art schools in over thirty countries and chose from fifty schools the most interesting ideas. The designer visited schools in Tokyo, New York, Paris, and London, but also schools in upcoming fashion cities like Ulan Bator in Mongolia, Tashkent in Uzbekistan, Cape Town, Dakar, Kingston in Jamaika, Caracas, Reykjavik, Shanghai, Auckland etc.

From 2008-2010, Gronbach had opened a fashion store in Cologne's hip Belgian quarter. In 2009, young Belgian designers were invited to present their work at this store for a few weeks. The goal of this event, organized together with the Belgian House in Cologne, was to deepen the relationship between Brussels and Cologne.

Single pieces of Gronbach's collection were bought by the [[Haus der Geschichte]] ("House of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany"). They are presented at the museum in [[Bonn]]. The Museum of Industry (LWL) in Dortmund bought some pieces of Gronbach's "german jeans" collection. In 2011, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]] invited the artist to show her work from the past ten years at the exhibition "how german is it?". In 2012, Gronbach participated in the MANIFESTA 09 [http://manifesta.org/ European Art Biennale].

In September 2015, Gronbach presents her work of the past 15 years at the show "Relight - Best of Eva Gronbach" in the context of the Futur25 Festival. The Futur25 Festival is organized by the [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] and the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] in celebration of the 25th jubilee of the [[German unity]]. It takes place at [[Radialsystem V|Radialysystem V]] in Berlin.

===Fashion Classes at Schools and Universities===

Gronbach works with children and young adults. She initiates and teaches fashion design classes at schools in Germany. She also gives presentations at conferences, e.g. at the [[Berlin Academy of Arts]] and at [http://www.kinderzumolymp.de/ "Kinder zum Olymp!“] and participates in TV shows. Since May 2008, Gronbach is a guest lecturer at the [[Köln International School of Design]] (KISD). Focusing on transformation processes in fashion design she discusses the meaning of fashion with her students. In 2009, she led the designer workshops for students in the [[Ruhr]] area, sponsored by the region [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The developed designs were presented at [[RUHR.2010]]. Since 2014, Gronbach works as a lecturer at the international fashion school ([[ESMOD]]) in Berlin.

In 2004, Gronbach received the "T-com inspire!" award for her collection "Déclaration d'amour à l'Allemagne".

'''George Stuart Gordon''' (1881–1942) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] literary scholar.

Gordon was educated at [[Glasgow University]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he received a First Class in [[Honour Moderations|Classical Moderations]] in 1904, ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'' in 1906, and the [[Stanhope Prize]] in 1905. He was a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from 1907 to 1915.

Gordon was Professor of [[English Literature]] at the [[University of Leeds]] from 1913 to 1922. Later, he was Merton Professor of English Literature at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], from 1922 to 1928;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~dbratman/profs.html |title=Professorships Held by the Inklings}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;He had been a Fellow of Magdalen from 1907; mentioned in [[C. S. Lewis]], ''Letters'' p.208. Gordon tutored Lewis.{{cite web|url=http://www.cslewis.org/resources/chronocsl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206021046/http://www.cslewis.org/resources/chronocsl.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professor of Poetry]] there, and [[Vice-Chancellor]] (1938–1941). He was one of the ''Kolbítar'', [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s group of readers of [[Icelandic saga]]s.[http://www.planet-tolkien.com/modules/tolkien/biography.php]

Gordon famously argued that English Literature was capable of having a widespread and positive influence. In his inaugural lecture for his Merton professorship, he argued that "England is sick, and … English literature must save it. The Churches (as I understand) having failed, and social remedies being slow, English literature has now a triple function: still, I suppose, to delight and instruct us, but also, and above all, to save our souls and heal the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=82 |last=Wheen |first=Francis |date=2004 |title=How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World |publisher=Harper Perennial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[George Gordon (physiologist)|George Gordon]], was a noted [[physiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7370/972/d/DC1 |title=George Gordon |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married the German architect [[Alfred Clauss]] in 1934,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and between 1934 and 1945, they lived in Tennessee, where they collaborated on the design of the prewar "Little Switzerland" suburb of split-level houses outside Knoxville, Tennessee.&lt;ref name=tatman2/&gt; Sponsored by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] as part of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], it is regarded as one of the earliest examples of the International Style in the United States.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=bacon/&gt; Laid out along a ridge of Brown's Mountain six miles southeast of downtown Knoxville, Little Switzerland consists of twenty 120 x 240–foot lots, on which 10 houses were designed by Jane and Alfred.&lt;ref name=lsp/&gt;

In 1945, Clauss and her husband settled in Philadelphia, where she took up a position teaching interior architecture at [[Arcadia University|Beaver College]] (1946-1967).&lt;ref name=tatman/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; During this period, she was a participating associate in Clauss &amp; Nolan, a firm founded by her husband.&lt;ref name=tatman2/&gt; Among the Philadelphia buildings she collaborated on with Alfred are the Federal Courthouse Complex next to Independence Hall and the Riverview Home for the Aged.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

Clauss became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1964.&lt;ref name=tatman/&gt;

On the death of her husband in 1998, Clauss moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where she died in early 2003.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive Evangelical, Thomas Dale (1797–1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London - John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography &gt;&gt; Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Effie Gray painted by [[Thomas Richmond]]. She thought the portrait made her look like "a graceful Doll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07473&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=art |title=NPG 5160; Effie Gray (Lady Millais) – Portrait |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |website=Npg.org.uk |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/vanburd1.html An Introduction to Helen Gill Viljoen's Unpublished Biography of Ruskin by Van Akin Burd]; [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/spates1.html Editor's Introductory Comments on Viljoen's Chapter by James L.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II. Loss of Belief |website=Victorianweb.org |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to Christianity.&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===
{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration.

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/catalogue-of-the-ryuzo-mikimoto-collection-ruskin-library-tokyo-2004/oclc/56923207 |title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |website=WorldCat.org |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the innovator of the modern [[Olympic Games]], used Ruskin's principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be "Ruskinized" to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. 'The masses are much more sensitive to the perfection of the whole than to any separate details': The Influence of John Ruskin's Political Economy on Pierre de Coubertin, in: Olympika, 1996 Vol. V, pp. 25–44. www.library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501c.pdf;[[Arnd Krüger]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum. The Museum has promoted Ruskin's art teaching methods using the collection, using them as the basis for in-person and online drawing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994/ |title=The Elements of Drawing |access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin in the 21st-century===
Admirers and scholars of Ruskin can visit the [[Ruskin Library]] at [[Lancaster University]], also Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and the [[Ruskin Museum]], both in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] in the English [[Lake District]].

[[File:John Ruskin Street in London.JPG|thumb|right|John Ruskin Street in [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], London]]
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010. Stuart Eagles, '' The Economic Symposium. John Ruskin and the Modern World: Art and Economics, 1860–2010'' in ''The Companion'' no. 10 (2010), pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/659657 ''Omnibus.

BBC1, 13 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury]], Raficq Abdulla, [[Jonathon Porritt]] and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]] were among those to contribute to the symposium, ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]] (ed.) ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R. Shapiro]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA657 |title=The Yale Book of Quotations|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=657 |isbn=9780300107982 |accessdate = 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin's authorship.&lt;ref name=Landow2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Landow |first=George P. |title=A Ruskin Quotation? |publisher=VictorianWeb.org |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/quotation.html |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a posting of the ''Ruskin Library News'', a blog associated with the [[Ruskin Library]] (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at [[Lancaster University]]), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, "This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin."&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskinlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/on-the-present-economic-situation/|title=On the present economic situation:|last=Ruskin Library|publisher=Ruskin Library|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter frequency effect''' - the effect of [[letter frequency]] according to which the frequency with which the letter is encountered influences the recognition time of a letter. Letters of high frequency show a significant advantage over letters of low frequency in letter naming,&lt;ref&gt;Cosky, M. J. (1976). The role of letter recognition in word recognition. Memory &amp; Cognition, 4 , 207-214.&lt;/ref&gt; same-different matching,&lt;ref&gt;Egeth, H., &amp; Blecker, D.  (1971). Differential effects of familiarity on judgments of sameness and difference.  Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 9 (4), 321-326.&lt;/ref&gt; and visual search.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, C. R. (1972). Search time as a function of context letter frequency. Perception, 1 , 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of high frequency are recognized faster than letters of low frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Miozo, Michele &amp; Bastiani, Pierluigi de (2002). The Organization of Letter-Form Representations in Written Spelling: Evidence from Acquired Dysgraphia. Brain and Language 80, 366–392&lt;/ref&gt; Appelman and Mayzner (1981) in their re-analysis of the studies concerning letter frequency effect have found that in 3 out of 6 studies using [[mental chronometry|reaction times]] (RTs) as a [[dependent variable]] the letter frequency correlated significantly with RTs.&lt;ref&gt;Appelman, I. B., &amp; Mayzner , M. S. (1981). The letter-frequency effect and the generality of familiarity effects on perception.Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 30, 436 – 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion ==

Majority of studies on letter frequency effect failed to find a significant letter frequency effect.&lt;ref name="frequency"&gt;Boris, New &amp; Grainger, Johnatan (2011). On letter frequency effects. Acta Psychologica 138, 322 –328&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, however, used the [[same-different matching task]]&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; in which the participants see two letters and are to respond if these letters are same or different.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; Therefore, the absence of letter frequency effect in these studies may be due to the participants using the visual form of a letter instead of a letter itself to match the letters.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt;

The '''Master of Library and Information Science''' ('''MLIS''') is the [[master's degree]] that is required for most professional [[librarian]] positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the '''Master of [[Library Science]] (MLS)''', or '''Master of Science in [[Library Science]] (MSLS)''' degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), "The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Information Studies, Master of Information Science, Master of Information, Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq#degree_name_differences|title=Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2006-08-03|website=|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission to MLIS programs normally requires holding a bachelor's degree in any academic discipline, and library schools encourage applications from people with diverse academic backgrounds.

In the [[United Kingdom]] it is more common for a vocational degree in library and information science to bear the standard designation MA or MSc. In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] universities, bachelor's and master's programs have been merged to create the MLIS/MLISc degree. [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]] committees have discussed global standards for librarian credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.academia.edu/28794488/Librarians_Need_Global_Credentials | title=Backtalk: Librarians Need Global Credentials | publisher=[[Library Journal]] | date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The MLIS or MLS degree is usually acquired from an accredited [[library school]]. ALA accredits 63 programs at 58 institutions across the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association website: {{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq|title=Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALA also offers an overview of international degrees in library and information science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/education/paths/international|title=International Degrees in Library and Information Science|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|language=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALA website provides "Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/guidelines-choosing-masters-program-library-and-information-studies|title=Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2008-06-10|website=|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discusses how to decide whether a master's degree or an [http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/careers/librarycareerssite/whatyouneedassociate associate's degree] will best help you meet your career goals. Prospective and current students will find more information on school selection and academic success on websites like LibraryCareers.org&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://librarycareers.org|title=Library Careers|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hack Library School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hacklibraryschool.com|title=Hack Library School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ALA-accredited programs provide distance-learning opportunities for students through a variety of delivery methods (e.g. online courses). In some cases, students can complete the entire program at a distance; in other cases, some on-campus courses or regional residency may be required &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/accreditedprograms/guidelines-choosing-masters-program-library-and-information-studies|title=Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies|first=|last=admin|date=10 June 2008|website=ala.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Curriculum==

The MLIS/MLS curriculum can vary widely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Typically both practical and theoretical components are included, often along with a practicum or internship, and students frequently have an opportunity to specialize in one or more aspects of library and information science. Some schools have stringent course requirements, while others are more flexible and offer a wide variety of electives. Coursework may entail traditional library topics, such as [[library reference desk|reference]] work, [[Library catalog|cataloging]], collection development, school libraries, or archiving. There may also be a focus on [[information science]] and [[computer science]] topics, such as [[database]] design, as well as [[information architecture]]. Other skills taught may include [[management]] or [[pedagogy]]. Students generally complete a research project or thesis during the last semester of their program.

==Careers==
People who earn MLIS degrees take on many different roles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/sjsuischool/so-you-want-to-be-a-librarian-106e794628ef|title=So You Want to Be a Librarian|last=Peters|first=Alison|date=2016-11-01|website=Medium|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many different kinds of environments—in libraries and "beyond the stacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondthestacks.info|title=Beyond the Stacks: Innovative Careers in Library and Information Science|website=Beyond the Stacks: Innovative Careers in Library and Information Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, "Librarians work in museums, hospitals, businesses, and public libraries. In their work, librarians research, instruct, and connect people to technology. Librarians build websites, digitize archives, and manage social media. Librarians work with people of all ages, connecting them to information, learning and the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/libcareers/become|title=Become a Librarian|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2016-07-15|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association's LibraryCareers.org site&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; collects information about library and information science careers, work environments, and more.

Many with MLIS degrees use their professional skills in positions without "librarian" in the job title. The San Jose State University School of Information publishes an annual research report on emerging career trends for information professionals, providing a snapshot of job titles in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ischool.sjsu.edu/about/publications/emerging-career-trends-information-professionals-snapshot-job-titles|title=Emerging Career Trends for Information Professionals: A Snapshot of Job Titles|last=San Jose State University School of Information|first=|date=|website=ischool.sjsu.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Mel''' is a [[Papua New Guinea]]n academic in [[visual arts]] at the [[University of Goroka]], curator, philosopher, musician and playwright. Mel was born in 1959 in Wila near Vulcano Hagan in the [[Western Highlands (Papua New Guinea)|Western Highlands]].&lt;ref name="HtH"&gt;Hailans to Ailans, [http://hailanstoailans.com/art/performance/michael-mel/ biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817071546/http://hailanstoailans.com/art/performance/michael-mel/ |date=2013-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PoC"&gt;De kracht van cultuur, [http://www.powerofculture.nl/en/current/2006/december/mel.html ''Michael Mel: "I had to re-learn my own language"''], Tony Gwyn-Jones (December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

As an artist Mel principally specialized in [[performance]] and [[installation art]] and [[body painting]]. Furthermore, he is known for his ''Chanted Tales'', traditional historic stories of local people that serve for passing social responsibility and morality. Mel exerted himself to it that people obtained access to them again, since they had fallen into oblivion since [[English language]] had become the principal language in the country.&lt;ref name="HtH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PoC" /&gt;

In 2006 Mel was honored with a [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] for his key role in the cultural development of the communities of the highlands of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/243 profile]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/programmes/awards award winners of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michigan Higher Education Assistance Authority''' ('''MHEAA''') was created by the [[State of Michigan]] in 1960 through Public Act 77. One of the major components of MHEAA is the [[Michigan Guaranty Agency]] (MGA), the federally designated guarantor of federal student loans in Michigan. In that capacity, MHEAA-MGA primarily backs Michigan students by insuring lenders who disburse federal student loans that they will be reimbursed for their good faith lending. 

MHEAA is a body corporate and politic within the Michigan Department of Treasury. Its 15 members are appointed by the [[Governor of Michigan]] with advice and consent of the [[Michigan Senate]] and consist of representatives from the Michigan education and lending communities as well as the public at large. 

MHEAA-MGA operates under guidelines established by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and is beholden to all federal guidelines established therein.

Although MHEAA-MGA is a state agency, insurance offered by MHEAA-MGA to back student loan activity in Michigan does not constitute or create any liability on behalf of the State of Michigan. In short, MHEAA-MGA operates with the use of federally designated funds which requires strict compliance with federal laws, rules, and regulations.

Originally Nordic-German in nature, it now includes British universities as well, which gives it a Nordic-German-Anglo profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stenström|authorlink1=Unity and Diversity in Nordic Biblical Scholarship|editor1-last=Boer|editor1-first=Roland|title=The Future of the Biblical Past: Envisioning Biblical Studies on a Global Key|date=2012|publisher=SBL|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization focuses on research into the [[Hebrew Bible]] and promotes the development of young scholars in particular, especially through annual seminars and special lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Together at the OTSEM Meeting in Hamburg {{!}} Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions|url = http://blogs.helsinki.fi/sacredtexts/2014/09/17/learning-together-at-the-otsem-meeting-in-hamburg/|website = blogs.helsinki.fi|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though encompassing theological faculties and using the term [[Old Testament]], OTSEM is non-confessional, with members from Christian (both Protestant and Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, and secular backgrounds.

==Institutions==

Currently, OTSEM consists of sixteen institutions from eight different countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/204017.html|website=OTSEM Research Network|publisher=University of Göttingen|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of OTSEM divides into three distinct periods: Proto-OTSEM, OTSEM I, and OTSEM II (the present iteration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OTSEM History|url=http://www.otsem.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/about-otsem/otsem-history|website=OTSEM|publisher=University of Hamburg|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-OTSEM===

OTSEM's antecedents reach back to the 1970s. At that time, Helsinki and Göttingen had a student and professor exchange between their theological faculties. Beginning in the 1990s, bi- and trilateral doctoral seminars took place among the various institutions that would later become members of OTSEM.

===OTSEM I===

From 2004 through 2008, the Nordic Council (''NordForsk'') co-funded the research network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordic Research Gems: Success stories from NORIA|date=2008|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|pages=26–27|url=http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A707825&amp;dswid=1563|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Granerød|first1=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|date=2010|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, OTSEM saw formalization and expansion. This expansion included an increase in not only the number of members and member institutions but also meetings and individual exchanges. In particular, the now formal organization commenced its annual conferences (Oslo in 2004, Göttingen in 2005, Aarhus in 2006, Helsinki in 2008, and Lund in 2008). With the end of funding from the Nordic Council came the end of OTSEM I and start of OTSEM II.

===OTSEM II===

Since 2009, OTSEM has been financed solely by its associated institutions. Nevertheless, the research network has continued its annual conference and individual exchanges.

==Notable members==

OTSEM members with a high international profile have included the following:

{{hatnote|The term ''opposing force'' is occasionally used to refer to a genuine military foe. This article is concerned only with its use in simulated conflict.}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:OPFOR Soldiers.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|U.S. OPFOR Soldiers at [[Fort Polk]], Louisiana]]
An '''opposing force''' (abbreviated '''OPFOR''' or '''enemy force''') is a [[military unit]] tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in [[War exercise|war game]] scenarios. The related concept of [[aggressor squadron]] is used by some air forces. The United States maintains the [[Fort Irwin National Training Center]] with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] serving in the main OPFOR role. Other major units include the [[First United States Army]] which consists of 16 training brigades that often also serve as OPFOR. [[Fort Polk]]'s Joint  Readiness Training Center is another major training site typically reserved for units that are slated to deploy into conflict areas.

At a basic level, a unit might serve as an opposing force for a single scenario, differing from its 'opponents' only in the objectives it is given. However, major armies commonly maintain specialized groups trained to accurately emulate real-life enemies, to provide a more realistic experience for their training opponents. (To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictionalized versions with different names but similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes.)

==Tactics==
Opposing forces can also coincide with [[red team]]ing activities. Once the Analytic Red Team develops adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) it will be the opposing force that makes use of those TTPs in wargames and exercises.

Some dedicated opposing forces may fight using the likely enemy's doctrine, weapons, and equipment. They may wear uniforms which resemble the likely enemy's, or one dissimilar to "friendly forces". Their vehicles may either be those operated by the likely enemy's, or may be modified to look like those. All these measures help to enhance training realism and provide useful lessons on how to fight this particular enemy.

[[Blank ammunition]], [[smoke grenade]]s, and [[artillery]] simulators are often used by both sides in the exercise to provide the [[fog of war]] caused by the noise and smoke of battle.

In addition, a simulation system such as the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System]] (MILES) may be used. This system is attached to various weapons, and are zeroed to the sights of the weapon. When a blank round is fired, the system sends out a laser beam, which score "kills" or "injuries" on any soldier or vehicle in what would be the path of the weapon's projectile. These laser beams are detected by receivers on harnesses worn by the soldiers, or on the vehicle itself.

Alternatively, [[paintball]] weapons which look like real weapons, or simulation rounds such as [[plastic bullet]]s may be used. Usually, controllers follow the training troops to help score additional kills, such as when a simulated grenade is thrown. They may do so with the MILES system using a controller gun. All these measures help to emphasize the importance of aimed fire, and taking cover. These concepts, while obvious, are often neglected in ordinary one-sided training exercises because the soldier does not suffer the consequences.

==Units==

[[File:OPFOR Training.JPG|thumbnail|OPFOR Training 2012]]
[[File:MT-LB US Marines.jpg|thumb|[[US Marines]] using a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[MT-LB]] vehicle for the OPFOR role during an exercise]]
One of the best-known examples of specialist operations is the [[United States]]' OPFOR. During the [[Cold War]], opposing force units employed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military doctrine and simulated Soviet equipment; since the fall of the USSR, US opposing force units have become more flexible to represent a wider range of opponents. More recently training has focused on Iraq and Afghanistan.

There are three Major Training Centers that utilize home-based OPFOR units for the [[US Army]]:

*The [[National Training Center]] or ''NTC'' at [[Fort Irwin, California]]—home unit is the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] (the ''Blackhorse'')
*The [[Fort Polk#JRTC moves to Polk|Joint Readiness Training Center]] or ''JRTC'' at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]]—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment (the ''Geronimos'')
*The [[Joint Multinational Readiness Center]] or ''JMRC'' (formerly known as the Combat Maneuver Training Center or CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hohenfels.army.mil Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Separate) (the ''Warriors'')

[[File:Operation_force_Surrogate_Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An OSV replicating a Soviet BMP at NTC, Fort Irwin, CA]]
The units at NTC and JMRC were used to replicate a Soviet Motorized Rifle regiment or division. At NTC, [[M551 Sheridan]]s were used to replicate Soviet [[T-80]] tanks until 2003.  [[vismod|Visually Modified]] (VISMOD) [[HMMWV]]s are used to replicate [[BRDM-2]]s, VISMOD [[M113 armored personnel carrier#Basic variants|M113A3]]s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle [OSV]) are used to replicate [[BMP-2]] Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), while VISMOD [[M1 Abrams]] Tanks (known as the Krasnovian Variant Tank [KVT]) and M113A2s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, Tank [OSV-T]) are also used to replicate the [[T-80]]. At JMRC, M113A2s are used to replicate Soviet BMP-2s and [[M60 Patton#M60A3 series|M60A3]] tanks are used to replicate Soviet T-80s.

During the mid-1990s, JMRC was used to train peacekeeping forces for the former [[Yugoslavia]] under low-intensity conflict missions.  Currently, the OpFor mission has since been modified for counter-insurgency training for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

Starting in early 2004, NTC began focusing on training units selected to deploy to [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] in [[Urban Operations|urban operations]] (UO). Towns of ever increasing size and complexity have been constructed throughout the training area to provide battlefield realism and housing for the hundreds of role-playing personnel, many of whom speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] natively, and replicate civilians on the battlefield while wearing Afghan or Iraqi clothing. Cultural awareness and liaison operations with local leaders are emphasized at all times and at all levels.

Various US military installations and/or major units have their own local versions of opposing force used for training exercises. The joint Australian/US military exercise "Crocodile '03" featured an Australian-led opposing force in which soldiers from a range of Australian units worked together with a [[US Marine Corps]] contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exercise Crocodile '03: You win some, you lose some | author = John Wellfare | url = http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1084/features/feature01a.htm | publisher = Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[state defense force]]s have served as OPFOR units when training with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. The [[California State Military Reserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4thmpbnpmo.com/opfor.htm |title=OPFOR |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=1st Battalion (MP), 2nd Brigade (Civil Support), California State Military Reserve |access-date=16 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Georgia State Defense Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seay |first=Howard, WO1 |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Operation Roughrider Cold |url=http://issuu.com/allanhayesgsdf/docs/headsup_june2015 |journal=Heads Up |publisher=Georgia State Defense Force |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi= |access-date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have provided OPFOR services to their respective National Guard counterparts.

The [[British Army]] rotates units through [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] as OPFOR.

The [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] utilizes a regiment-sized OPFOR unit replicating the [[Korean People's Army Ground Force|North Korean Army]] infantry force at the [[Korea Combat Training Center]].

===Private OPFOR companies===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
There are a number of private companies that provide OPFOR services to support the training missions of various military units. As the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close, the use of private training forces are on the rise in the Department of Defense. OPFOR companies supplement the existing training programs in a number of ways.{{which|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9763">{{about|the programming language introduced by Niklaus Wirth|the subset of a programming language from IBM|PL/I}}
'''PL/0''' is a [[programming language]], intended as an [[educational programming language]], that is similar to but much simpler than [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], a [[general-purpose programming language]]. It serves as an example of how to construct a [[compiler]]. It was originally introduced in the book, ''[[Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs]]'', by [[Niklaus Wirth]] in 1976. It features quite limited language constructs: there are no real numbers, very few basic arithmetic operations and no control-flow constructs other than "if" and "while" blocks. While these limitations make writing real applications in this language impractical, it helps the compiler remain compact and simple.

==Grammar==
The following is the syntax rules of the model language defined in [[extended Backus–Naur form|EBNF]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
program = block "." .

block = [ "const" ident "=" number {"," ident "=" number} ";"]
        [ "var" ident {"," ident} ";"]
        { "procedure" ident ";" block ";" } statement .

statement = [ ident ":=" expression | "call" ident 
              | "?" ident | "!" expression 
              | "begin" statement {";" statement } "end" 
              | "if" condition "then" statement 
              | "while" condition "do" statement ].

condition = "odd" expression |
            expression ("="|"#"|"&lt;"|"&lt;="|"&gt;"|"&gt;=") expression .

expression = [ "+"|"-"] term { ("+"|"-") term}.

term = factor {("*"|"/") factor}.

factor = ident | number | "(" expression ")".
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It is rather easy for students to write a [[recursive descent parser]] for such a simple syntax. Therefore, the PL/0 compiler is still widely used in courses on compiler construction throughout the world. Due to the lack of features in the original specification, students usually spend most of their time with extending the language and their compiler. They usually start with introducing &lt;tt&gt;REPEAT .. UNTIL&lt;/tt&gt; and continue with more advanced features like parameter passing to procedures or data structures like arrays, strings or floating point numbers.

==Use in education==
The main article on [[compiler]]s honours PL/0 for introducing several influential concepts (stepwise refinement, recursive descent parsing, EBNF, P-code, T-diagrams) to the field by educating students to use these concepts. Over the last 3 decades, most university courses on compiler construction that used PL/0 have followed Wirth strictly in employing these techniques (see references below). Some years ago university courses dared to deviate from the course set by Wirth with the replacement of the classical recursive descent parsing technique by a (nonetheless classical) Unix-like approach of employing [[Lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]]. Only recently an implementation ([https://programming.dojo.net.nz/study/pl0-language-tools/index PL/0 Language Tools]) along this way has also combined modern concepts like object-orientation and design patterns with a modern scripting language ([[Python (programming language)|Python]]), allowing students to consume the source text of the implementation in a contemporary programming style.

==Compiler construction==
In December 1976, Wirth wrote a small booklet about compiler construction, containing the full source code of the PL/0 compiler. The syntax rules above were taken from this first edition of Wirth's book ''Compilerbau''.&lt;ref name="Wirth, 1986"&gt;Wirth, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In later editions of this book (under the influence of his ongoing research) Wirth changed the syntax of PL/0. He changed the spelling of keywords like &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;procedure&lt;/tt&gt; to uppercase. This change made PL/0 resemble [[Modula-2]] more closely. At the same time, Wirth's friend and collaborator [[C. A. R. Hoare]] was working on his influential [[communicating sequential processes]] concept, which used the exclamation mark ''!'' and the question mark ''?'' to denote communication primitives. Wirth added both symbols to the PL/0 language, but he did not mention their semantics in the book.

==Examples==
The following example is taken from such an extended language called PL/0E.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntecs.de/old-hp/uu9r/lang/html/pl0.en.html PL/0E] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221073635/http://www.ntecs.de/old-hp/uu9r/lang/html/pl0.en.html |date=2012-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This program outputs the squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Most courses in compiler construction today have replaced the exclamation mark with the &lt;tt&gt;WriteLn&lt;/tt&gt; procedure.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
VAR x, squ;

PROCEDURE square;
BEGIN
   squ:= x * x
END;

BEGIN
   x := 1;
   WHILE x &lt;= 10 DO
   BEGIN
      CALL square;
      ! squ;
      x := x + 1
   END
END.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This following program prints the prime numbers from 1 to 100. The write statement corresponds to '!' statement in the EBNF syntax above.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
const max = 100;
var arg, ret;

procedure isprime;
var i;
begin
	ret := 1;
	i := 2;
	while i &lt; arg do
	begin
		if arg / i * i = arg then
		begin
			ret := 0;
			i := arg
		end;
		i := i + 1
	end
end;

procedure primes;
begin
	arg := 2;
	while arg &lt; max do
	begin
		call isprime;
		if ret = 1 then write arg;
		arg := arg + 1
	end
end;

call primes
.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following example was taken from the second edition of Wirth's book Compilerbau,&lt;ref name="Wirth, 1986"/&gt; which appeared in 1986 in Germany.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
VAR x, y, z, q, r, n, f;

PROCEDURE multiply;
VAR a, b;
BEGIN
  a := x;
  b := Y;
  z := 0;
  WHILE b &gt; 0 DO
  BEGIN
    IF ODD b THEN z := z + a;
    a := 2 * a;
    b := b / 2
  END
END;

PROCEDURE divide;
VAR w;
BEGIN
  r := x;
  q := 0;
  w := y;
  WHILE w &lt;= r DO w := 2 * w;
  WHILE w &gt; y DO
  BEGIN
    q := 2 * q;
    w := w / 2;
    IF w &lt;= r THEN
    BEGIN
      r := r - w;
      q := q + 1
    END
  END
END;

PROCEDURE gcd;
VAR f, g;
BEGIN
  f := x;
  g := y;
  WHILE f # g DO
  BEGIN
    IF f &lt; g THEN g := g - f;
    IF g &lt; f THEN f := f - g
  END;
  z := f
END;

PROCEDURE fact;
BEGIN
  IF n &gt; 1 THEN
  BEGIN
    f := n * f;
    n := n - 1;
    CALL fact
  END
END;

BEGIN
  ?x; ?y; CALL multiply; !z;
  ?x; ?y; CALL divide; !q; !r;
  ?x; ?y; CALL gcd; !z;
  ?n; f := 1; CALL fact; !f
END.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Oberon-0==
In the third and last edition of his book on compiler construction, Wirth replaced PL/0 with Oberon-0.  The language Oberon-0 is much more complex than PL/0. For example, Oberon-0 offers arrays, records, type declarations and procedure parameters. The publisher of Wirth's books (Addison-Wesley) has decided to phase out all his books, but Wirth has published revised editions of his book beginning in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf revised third edition] (2005) of ''Compiler Construction'', Niklaus Wirth, 1996, {{ISBN|0-201-40353-6}} has never seen the printing press, but it is available online.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2017|August}}, the most recent revision available is from May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compiler Construction|first=Niklaus|last=Wirth|author-link=Niklaus Wirth|date=2017-05-28|access-date=2017-08-25|url=https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=news.txt|first=Niklaus|last=Wirth|author-link=Niklaus Wirth|date=2017-08-18|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825151832/https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/news.txt|url=https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/news.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''planetarium''' (plural ''planetaria'' or ''planetariums'') is a [[theatre]] built primarily for presenting [[educational entertainment|educational and entertaining]] shows about [[astronomy]] and the [[night sky]], or for training in [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Henry C. "Geared to the Stars; the evolution of planetariums, orreries, and astronomical clocks" University of Toronto Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Planetariums, 2005'', [[International Planetarium Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catalog of New York Planetariums, 1982''&lt;/ref&gt;

A dominant feature of most planetaria is the large [[dome]]-shaped [[celestial sphere|projection screen]] onto which scenes of [[star]]s, [[planets]], and other [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens'. The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies, for example precision-engineered 'star balls' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology, [[slide projector]], [[video]] and [[fulldome]] projector systems, and lasers. Whatever technologies are used, the objective is normally to link them together to simulate an accurate relative motion of the sky. Typical systems can be set to simulate the sky at any point in time, past or present, and often to depict the night sky as it would appear from any point of [[latitude]] on Earth.

Planetariums range in size from the 37 meter dome in St. Petersburg, Russia (called “Planetarium No 1”) to three-meter inflatable portable domes where attendees sit on the floor. The largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere is the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at [[Liberty Science Center]] in [[New Jersey]] (27 meters in diameter). The China Science and Technology Museum Planetarium in [[Beijing]], [[China]] has the largest seating capacity worldwide (442 seats). In North America, the Hayden Planetarium at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]] has the greatest number of seats (423).

The term ''planetarium'' is sometimes used generically to describe other devices which illustrate the solar system, such as a computer simulation or an [[orrery]]. ''[[Planetarium software]]'' refers to a software application that renders a three-dimensional image of the sky onto a two-dimensional computer screen. The term ''planetarian'' is used to describe a member of the professional staff of a planetarium.

==History==
{{for|specific dates and events in the historical influences on and development of planetaria|timeline of planetariums}}

===Early===
[[File:FranekerPlanetarium.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Eise Eisinga Planetarium]]]]
[[File:ZeissMark1.jpg|thumb|right|The Mark I projector installed in the Deutsches Museum in 1923 was the world's first planetarium projector.]]
The [[Hellenistic period|ancient Greek]] [[polymath]] [[Archimedes]] is attributed with creating a primitive planetarium device that could predict the movements of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] and the planets. The discovery of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] proved that such devices already existed during [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though likely after Archimedes' lifetime. [[Campanus of Novara]] (1220–1296) described a planetary [[equatorium]] in his ''Theorica Planetarum'', and included instructions on how to build one. The [[Globe of Gottorf]] built around 1650 had constellations painted on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marche|first=Jordan|title=Theaters of Time and Space: American Planetaria, 1930-1970|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=Rutgers|page=10|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813537665?auth=0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212323/http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813537665?auth=0|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These devices would today usually be referred to as [[Orrery|orreries]] (named for the [[Earl of Orrery]], an Irish peer: an 18th-century Earl of Orrery had one built). In fact, many planetaria today have what are called projection orreries, which project onto the dome a Sun with planets (usually limited to Mercury up to Saturn) going around it in something close to their correct relative periods.

The small size of typical 18th century orreries limited their impact, and towards the end of that century a number of educators attempted some larger scale simulations of the heavens. The efforts of [[Adam Walker (inventor)|Adam Walker]] (1730–1821) and his sons are noteworthy in their attempts to fuse theatrical illusions with educational aspirations. Walker's [[Eidouranion]] was the heart of his public lectures or theatrical presentations. Walker's son describes this "Elaborate Machine" as "twenty feet high, and twenty-seven in diameter: it stands vertically before the spectators, and its globes are so large, that they are distinctly seen in the most distant parts of the Theatre. Every Planet and Satellite seems suspended in space, without any support; performing their annual and diurnal revolutions without any apparent cause". Other lecturers promoted their own devices: R E Lloyd advertised his Dioastrodoxon, or Grand Transparent Orrery, and by 1825 William Kitchener was offering his Ouranologia, which was {{convert|42|ft|m}} in diameter. These devices most probably sacrificed astronomical accuracy for crowd-pleasing spectacle and sensational and awe-provoking imagery.

The [[Eise Eisinga Planetarium|oldest, still working planetarium]] can be found in the Dutch town [[Franeker]]. It was built by [[Eise Eisinga]] (1744–1828) in the living room of his house. It took Eisinga seven years to build his planetarium, which was completed in 1781.

In 1905 [[Oskar von Miller]] (1855–1934) of the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]] commissioned updated versions of a geared orrery and planetarium from M Sendtner, and later worked with Franz Meyer, chief engineer at the Carl [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] optical works in [[Jena]], on the largest mechanical planetarium ever constructed, capable of displaying both [[heliocentric]] and [[geocentric]] motion. This was displayed at the Deutsches Museum in 1924, construction work having been interrupted by the war. The planets travelled along overhead rails, powered by electric motors: the orbit of Saturn was 11.25 m in diameter. 180 stars were projected onto the wall by electric bulbs.

While this was being constructed, von Miller was also working at the Zeiss factory with German astronomer [[Max Wolf]], director of the [[Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl]] observatory of the [[University of Heidelberg]], on a new and novel design, inspired by [[Wallace W. Atwood]]'s work at the [[Chicago Academy of Sciences]] and by the ideas of [[Walther Bauersfeld]] and Rudolf Straubel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=Under the Dome:  The tragic, untold story of the world’s first planetarium|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/planetarium_history_nazis_persecuted_inventor_rudolf_straubel_of_zeiss.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=24 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224122914/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/planetarium_history_nazis_persecuted_inventor_rudolf_straubel_of_zeiss.html|archivedate=24 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]. The result was a planetarium design which would generate all the necessary movements of the stars and planets inside the optical projector, and would be mounted centrally in a room, projecting images onto the white surface of a hemisphere. In August 1923, the first (Model I) Zeiss planetarium projected images of the night sky onto the white plaster lining of a 16 m hemispherical concrete dome, erected on the roof of the Zeiss works. The first official public showing was at the Deutsches Museum in Munich on October 21, 1923.&lt;ref name="twothousand"&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Birla Planetarium, Kolkata.jpg|thumb|The M.P. Birla Planetarium in [[Kolkata]], [[India]] (est. 1962)]]
When Germany was divided into East and West Germany after the war, the Zeiss firm was also split.  Part remained in its traditional headquarters at [[Jena]], in [[East Germany]], and part migrated to [[West Germany]]. The designer of the first planetaria for Zeiss, [[Walther Bauersfeld]], also migrated to West Germany with the other members of the Zeiss management team. There he remained on the Zeiss West management team until his death in 1959.

The West German firm resumed making large planetaria in 1954, and the East German firm started making small planetaria a few years later. Meanwhile, the lack of planetarium manufacturers had led to several attempts at construction of unique models, such as one built by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]], which operated 1952-2003.  The Korkosz brothers built a large projector for the [[Boston Museum of Science]], which was unique in being the first (and for a very long time only) planetarium to project the planet [[Uranus]]. Most planetaria ignore Uranus as being at best marginally visible to the naked eye.

A great boost to the popularity of the planetarium worldwide was provided by the [[Space Race]] of the 1950s and 60s when fears that the United States might miss out on the opportunities of the new frontier in space stimulated a massive program to install over 1,200 planetaria in U.S. high schools.

[[File:Spitz Star Projector.jpg|thumb|left|Early Spitz star projector]]
[[Armand Spitz]] recognized that there was a viable market for small inexpensive planetaria. His first model, the Spitz A, was designed to project stars from a [[dodecahedron]], thus reducing machining expenses in creating a globe.&lt;ref name="ley196502"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planets were not mechanized, but could be shifted by hand.  Several models followed with various upgraded capabilities, until the A3P, which projected well over a thousand stars, had motorized motions for latitude change, daily motion, and annual motion for Sun, Moon (including phases), and planets. This model was installed in hundreds of high schools, colleges, and even small museums from 1964 to the 1980s.

[[File:Goto-E5.jpg|thumb|right|A Goto E-5 projector.]]
[[Japan]] entered the planetarium manufacturing business in the 1960s, with Goto and [[Minolta]] both successfully marketing a number of different models. Goto was particularly successful when the Japanese Ministry of Education put one of their smallest models, the E-3 or E-5 (the numbers refer to the metric diameter of the dome) in every [[elementary school]] in Japan.

Phillip Stern, as former lecturer at [[New York City]]'s [[Hayden Planetarium]], had the idea of creating a small planetarium which could be programmed.  His Apollo model was introduced in 1967 with a plastic program board, recorded lecture, and film strip. Unable to pay for this himself, Stern became the head of the planetarium division of [[Viewlex]], a mid-size audio-visual firm on [[Long Island]]. About thirty canned programs were created for various grade levels and the public, while operators could create their own or run the planetarium live.  Purchasers of the Apollo were given their choice of two canned shows, and could purchase more.  A few hundred were sold, but in the late 1970s Viewlex went bankrupt for reasons unrelated to the planetarium business.

During the 1970s, the [[OmniMax]] [[Film|movie]] system (now known as IMAX Dome) was conceived to operate on planetarium screens. More recently, some planetaria have re-branded themselves as ''dome theaters'', with broader offerings including wide-screen or "wraparound" films, [[fulldome|fulldome video]], and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns.

[[Learning Technologies Inc.]] in [[Massachusetts]] offered the first easily portable planetarium in 1977. Philip Sadler designed this patented system which projected stars, [[constellation]] figures from many [[mythologies]], celestial coordinate systems, and much else, from removable cylinders (Viewlex and others followed with their own portable versions).

When [[German reunification|Germany reunified]] in 1989, the two Zeiss firms did likewise, and expanded their offerings to cover many different size domes.

===Computerized planetaria===

In 1983, [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] installed the first planetarium projector displaying computer graphics (Hansen Planetarium, Salt Lake City, Utah)&amp;mdash;the Digistar I projector used a [[vector graphics|vector graphics system]] to display starfields as well as [[line art]].

The newest generation of planetaria offer a fully [[Digital data|digital]] projection system, using [[fulldome|fulldome video]] technology. This gives the operator great flexibility in showing not only the modern night sky as visible from [[Earth]], but any other image they wish (including the night sky as visible from points far distant in space and time).

[[File:Sega Homestar planetarium cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sega Homestar home planetarium projector]]
A new generation of home planetaria was released in Japan by [[Takayuki Ohira]] in cooperation with [[Sega]]. Ohira is worldwide known as a mastermind for building portable planetaria used at exhibitions and events such as the Aichi World Expo in 2005. Later, the [[Megastar (projector)|Megastar]] star projectors released by Takayuki Ohira were installed in several science museums around the world. Meanwhile, Sega Toys continues to produce the Homestar series intended for home use, however by projecting 10,000 stars on the ceiling makes it semi-professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilian-nakamura.com/blog-english/?p=115|title=Home Planetarium Trend: Sega Toys Homestar Planetarium Pro|first=Sven|last=Kilian|date=2006-09-15|accessdate=2008-10-16|publisher=CScout Japan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212020110/http://www.kilian-nakamura.com/blog-english/?p=115|archivedate=2007-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetarium domes range in size from 3 to 35 m in [[diameter]], accommodating from 1 to 500 people. They can be permanent or portable, depending on the application. 
* Portable [[inflatable]] domes can be inflated in minutes. Such domes are often used for touring planetaria visiting, for example, schools and community centres.
* Temporary structures using [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP) segments bolted together and mounted on a frame are possible. As they may take some hours to construct, they are more suitable for applications such as exhibition stands, where a dome will stay up for a period of at least several days.
* Negative-pressure inflated domes are suitable in some semi-permanent situations. They use a fan to extract air from behind the dome surface, allowing [[atmospheric pressure]] to push it into the correct shape.
* Smaller permanent domes are frequently constructed from glass reinforced plastic. This is inexpensive but, as the projection surface reflects sound as well as light, the [[acoustics]] inside this type of dome can detract from its utility. Such a solid dome also presents issues connected with heating and ventilation in a large-audience planetarium, as air cannot pass through it.
* Older planetarium domes were built using traditional construction materials and surfaced with [[plaster]]. This method is relatively expensive and suffers the same [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] issues as GRP.
* Most modern domes are built from thin [[aluminium]] sections with ribs providing a supporting structure behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESOblog: How to Install a Planetarium A conversation with engineer Max Rößner about his work on the ESO Supernova|url=https://www.eso.org/public/blog/how-to-install-a-planetarium/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=21 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507190501/https://www.eso.org/public/blog/how-to-install-a-planetarium/|archivedate=7 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of aluminium makes it easy to perforate the dome with thousands of tiny holes. This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that seems to come from appropriate directions related to a show), and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.

The realism of the viewing experience in a planetarium depends significantly on the [[dynamic range]] of the image, i.e., the contrast between dark and light. This can be a challenge in any domed projection environment, because a bright image projected on one side of the dome will tend to reflect light across to the opposite side, "lifting" the [[black level]] there and so making the whole image look less realistic. Since traditional planetarium shows consisted mainly of small points of light (i.e., stars) on a black background, this was not a significant issue, but it became an issue as digital projection systems started to fill large portions of the dome with bright objects (e.g., large images of the sun in context). For this reason, modern planetarium domes are often not painted white but rather a mid grey colour, reducing reflection to perhaps 35-50%. This increases the perceived level of contrast.

A major challenge in dome construction is to make seams as invisible as possible. Painting a dome after installation is a major task and, if done properly, the seams can be made almost to disappear.

Traditionally, planetarium domes were mounted horizontally, matching the natural horizon of the real night sky. However, because that configuration requires highly inclined chairs for comfortable viewing "straight up", increasingly domes are being built tilted from the horizontal by between 5 and 30 degrees to provide greater comfort. Tilted domes tend to create a favoured 'sweet spot' for optimum viewing, centrally about a third of the way up the dome from the lowest point. Tilted domes generally have seating arranged 'stadium-style' in straight, tiered rows; horizontal domes usually have seats in circular rows, arranged in concentric (facing center) or epicentric (facing front) arrays.

Planetaria occasionally include controls such as buttons or [[joystick]]s in the arm-rests of seats to allow audience feedback that influences the show in [[Real-time computing|real time]].

Often around the edge of the dome (the 'cove') are:
* [[Silhouette]] models of geography or buildings like those in the area round the planetarium building.
* Lighting to simulate the effect of twilight or urban [[light pollution]].
* In one planetarium the horizon decor included a small model of a [[UFO]] flying.

Traditionally, planetaria needed many [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamps]] around the cove of the dome to help audience entry and exit, to simulate [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], and to provide working light for dome cleaning. More recently, solid-state [[LED]] lighting has become available that significantly decreases power consumption and reduces the maintenance requirement as lamps no longer have to be changed on a regular basis.

The world's largest mechanical planetarium is located in Monico, Wisconsin. The ''Kovac Planetarium''. It is 22 feet in diameter and weighs two tons. The globe is made of wood and is driven with a variable speed motor controller. This is the largest mechanical planetarium in the world, larger than the ''Atwood Globe'' in Chicago (15 feet in diameter) and one third the size of the Hayden.

Some new planetariums now feature a [[glass floor]], which allows spectators to stand near the center of a [[sphere]] surrounded by projected images in all directions, giving the impression of floating in [[outer space]].  For example, a small planetarium at [[AHHAA]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]] features such an installation, with special projectors for images below the feet of the audience, as well as above their heads.&lt;ref name=Aru&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aru|first1=Margus|title=Under One Dome: AHHAA Science Centre Planetarium|journal=Planetarian: Journal of the International Planetarium Society|date=March–June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=37|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ips-planetarium.org/resource/resmgr/planetarian/201206planetarian.pdf|accessdate=2017-06-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002175556/http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ips-planetarium.org/resource/resmgr/planetarian/201206planetarian.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional electromechanical/optical projectors===

Traditional [[planetarium projector|planetarium projection apparatus]] uses a hollow ball with a light inside, and a pinhole for each star, hence the name "star ball". With some of the brightest stars (e.g. [[Sirius]], [[Canopus]], [[Vega]]), the hole must be so big to let enough light through that there must be a small lens in the hole to focus the light to a sharp point on the dome. In later and modern planetarium star balls, the individual bright stars often have individual projectors, shaped like small hand-held torches, with focusing lenses for individual bright stars. Contact breakers prevent the projectors from projecting below the 'horizon'.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The star ball is usually mounted so it can rotate as a whole to simulate the Earth's daily rotation, and to change the simulated latitude on Earth. There is also usually a means of rotating to produce the effect of [[precession of the equinoxes]]. Often, one such ball is attached at its south [[ecliptic]] pole. In that case, the view cannot go so far south that any of the resulting blank area at the south is projected on the dome. Some star projectors have two balls at opposite ends of the projector like a [[dumbbell]]. In that case all stars can be shown and the view can go to either pole or anywhere between. But care must be taken that the projection fields of the two balls match where they meet or overlap.

Smaller planetarium projectors include a set of fixed stars, Sun, Moon, and planets, and various [[nebula]]e. Larger projectors also include [[comet]]s and a far greater selection of stars. Additional projectors can be added to show twilight around the outside of the screen (complete with city or country scenes) as well as the [[Milky Way]]. Others add coordinate lines and [[constellation]]s, photographic slides, [[laser]] displays, and other images.

Each planet is projected by a sharply focused [[Stage lighting instrument#Spotlights|spotlight]] that makes a spot of light on the dome. Planet projectors must have gearing to move their positioning and thereby simulate the planets' movements. These can be of these types:-
*[[Heliocentrism|Copernican]]. The axis represents the Sun. The rotating piece that represents each planet carries a light that must be arranged and guided to swivel so it always faces towards the rotating piece that represents the Earth. This presents mechanical problems including:
*:The planet lights must be powered by wires, which have to bend about as the planets rotate, and repeatedly bending copper wire tends to cause wire breakage through [[metal fatigue]].
*:When a planet is at [[Opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] to the Earth, its light is liable to be blocked by the mechanism's central axle. (If the planet mechanism is set 180° rotated from reality, the lights are carried by the Earth and shine towards each planet, and the blocking risk happens at [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with Earth.)
*[[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic]]. Here the central axis represents the Earth. Each planet light is on a mount which rotates only about the central axis, and is aimed by a guide which is steered by a deferent and an epicycle (or whatever the planetarium maker calls them). Here Ptolemy's number values must be revised to remove the daily rotation, which in a planetarium is catered for otherwise. (In one planetarium, this needed Ptolemaic-type orbital constants for [[Uranus]], which was unknown to Ptolemy.)
*Computer-controlled. Here all the planet lights are on mounts which rotate only about the central axis, and are aimed by a [[computer]].

Despite offering a good viewer experience, traditional star ball projectors suffer several inherent limitations. From a practical point of view, the low light levels require several minutes for the audience to [[Adaptation (eye)|"dark adapt"]] its eyesight. "Star ball" projection is limited in education terms by its inability to move beyond an earth-bound view of the night sky. Finally, in most traditional projectors the various overlaid projection systems are incapable of proper [[occultation]]. This means that a planet image projected on top of a star field (for example) will still show the stars shining through the planet image, degrading the quality of the viewing experience. For related reasons, some planetaria show stars below the horizon projecting on the walls below the dome or on the floor, or (with a bright star or a planet) shining in the eyes of someone in the audience.

However, the new breed of Optical-Mechanical projectors using fiber-optic technology to display the stars show a much more realistic view of the sky.

===Digital projectors===
[[File:ADLIP Jena.JPG|thumb|right|A [[fulldome]] laser projection.]]
An increasing number of planetaria are using [[Digital data|digital]] technology to replace the entire system of interlinked projectors traditionally employed around a star ball to address some of their limitations. Digital planetarium manufacturers claim reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability from such systems compared with traditional "star balls" on the grounds that they employ few moving parts and do not generally require synchronisation of movement across the dome between several separate systems. Some planetaria mix both traditional opto-mechanical projection and digital technologies on the same dome.

In a fully digital planetarium, the dome image is generated by a [[computer]] and then projected onto the dome using a variety of technologies including [[cathode ray tube]], [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] or [[laser]] projectors. Sometimes a single projector mounted near the centre of the dome is employed with a [[fisheye lens]] to spread the light over the whole dome surface, while in other configurations several projectors around the horizon of the dome are arranged to blend together seamlessly.

Digital projection systems all work by creating the image of the night sky as a large array of [[pixels]]. Generally speaking, the more pixels a system can display, the better the viewing experience. While the first generation of digital projectors were unable to generate enough pixels to match the image quality of the best traditional "star ball" projectors, high-end systems now offer a resolution that approaches the limit of human [[visual acuity]].

LCD projectors have fundamental limits on their ability to project true black as well as light, which has tended to limit their use in planetaria. [[LCOS]] and modified LCOS projectors have improved on LCD [[contrast ratio]]s while also eliminating the “screen door” effect of small gaps between LCD pixels. “Dark chip” DLP projectors improve on the standard DLP design and can offer relatively inexpensive solution with bright images, but the black level requires physical baffling of the projectors.  As the technology matures and reduces in price, laser projection looks promising for dome projection as it offers bright images, large dynamic range and a very wide [[color space]].

==Show content==
[[File:Ncp 2.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic representations of the [[constellation]]s projected during a planetarium show.]]
Worldwide, most planetaria provide shows to the general public. Traditionally, shows for these audiences with themes such as "What's in the sky tonight?", or shows which pick up on topical issues such as a religious festival (often the [[Star of Bethlehem|Christmas star]]) linked to the night sky, have been popular. Pre-recorded and live presentation formats are possible. Live format are preferred by many venues because a live expert presenter can answer on-the-spot questions raised by the audience.

Since the early 1990s, fully featured [[3-D computer graphics|3-D]] digital planetaria have added an extra degree of freedom to a presenter giving a show because they allow simulation of the view from any point in space, not only the earth-bound view which we are most familiar with. This new [[virtual reality]] capability to travel through the universe provides important [[education]]al benefits because it vividly conveys that space has depth, helping audiences to leave behind the ancient misconception that the stars are stuck on the inside of a giant [[celestial sphere]] and instead to understand the true layout of the [[solar system]] and beyond. For example, a planetarium can now 'fly' the audience towards one of the familiar constellations such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], revealing that the stars which appear to make up a co-ordinated shape from our earth-bound viewpoint are at vastly different distances from Earth and so not connected, except in human imagination and [[mythology]]. For especially visual or [[kinesthetic|spatially aware]] people, this experience can be more educationally beneficial than other demonstrations.

Music is an important element to fill out the experience of a good planetarium show, often featuring forms of  [[space-themed music]], or music from the genres of [[space music]], [[space rock]], or [[classical music]].

'''Project NEXUS''' is a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) grant funded project based at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and headed by [[Principal investigator|Principal Investigator]] Dr. J. Randy McGinnis. Its purpose is to investigate an innovative model of teacher preparation.

Originally a collaboration among [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (UM), (a large, primarily majority population university); [[Bowie State University]] (BSU), Maryland (a smaller, [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities|historically black university]]); and [[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.]] (a national organization developing and administering informal science education classes for children), it has evolved into a collaborative with [[Coppin State University]] (CSU), (Maryland) and available informal science education internships. The award was made in 2005 and ran until 2012.

The key assumption was that science educational practices require systemic reform within the undergraduate science subject matter and education classes, prospective teachers’ field-based experiences, and professional development during new teachers induction years (NSF, 1993;&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, "Proceedings of the National Science Foundation workshop on the role of faculty from  the scientific disciplines in the undergraduate education of future science and mathematics teachers." (Author, Washington, DC 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; NRC, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, "Improving teacher preparation and credentialling consistent with the National Science Education Standards." (National Academy Press, Washington, DC 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Sunal, Wright, &amp; Day, 2004.)&lt;ref&gt;D. Sunal, E. Wright, and J. Day, Eds., "Reform in undergraduate science teaching for the 21st century" (Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Project NEXUS was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0455752.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0455752"&gt;{{cite web

'''Quipper''' is an [[education technology]] company that provides [[Learning#E-learning and augmented learning|e-Learning]], coaching, tutoring, and assessment services for [[K-12]] in [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Mexico]]. The company’s primary service is an online [[learning management system]] (LMS), which is used in different ways in each country where it operates. The LMS contains locally-developed content and is supplemented with additional services for teachers, students, school administrators, and other stakeholders in each country where it operates.

==Funding==
Quipper raised £400K in its seed round from [[Atomico]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seed Round - Quipper |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/quipper-seed--d2f6ca64#section-overview |website=Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $3.6m (£2.3m) of Series A funding from Globis Capital Partners, [[Atomico]], and [[Benesse]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Butcher |first1=Mike |title=Quipper Raises $3.6M for its Fun Take on E-Learning |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/quipper-raises-3-6m-for-its-fun-take-on-e-learning/ |website=Techcrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company then received funding amounting to US$5.8 million from [[Atomico]], [[Benesse|Benesse Holdings]], and Globis in 2015 before it was acquired 100% by the Japanese corporation [[Recruit (company)|Recruit Holdings]] for $39m in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/quipper-recruit-acquisition|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=[[www.techinasia.com]]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2010, Japanese entrepreneur Masayuki Watanabe established Quipper in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/quipper-series-a2/|title=Atomico-Backed Quipper Gets Another $5.8M To Expand The Reach Of Its E-Learning Platform|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to starting Quipper, he co-founded the social gaming company [[DeNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunsby |first1=Megan |title=Tech Pitch: Quipper |url=https://startups.co.uk/tech-pitch-quipper/ |website=Startups |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Quipper, he and his team developed Quipper School, an e-learning platform for teachers that provides ready-made content, automates administrative tasks, and delivers real-time data on student performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/quipper-school-e-learning-system-to-enhance-education/|title=Quipper School: E-learning system to enhance education|work=BusinessMirror|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform comprises portals for teachers, students, and parents, granting each party different levels of access. The company eventually established operations in [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industri.bisnis.com/read/20170429/105/649223/quipper-platform-edukasi-teknologi-literasi-digital|title=Quipper, Platform Edukasi Teknologi Literasi Digital|website=industri.bisnis.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://2016.mb.com.ph/2016/01/21/1m-studes-enjoy-schooling-more-through-quipper-as-e-learning-boost-to-k-to-12/|title=1M studes enjoy schooling more through Quipper as e-learning boost to K-to-12|last=Bulletin|first=The Manila|work=mb.com.ph|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/sociedad/2015/09/17/usan-plataforma-para-apoyar-estudiantes|title=Usan plataforma para "apoyar" a estudiantes|date=2015-09-17|work=El Universal|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, another Japanese entrepreneur named Fumihiro "Bunyo" Yamaguchi from [[Recruit (company)|Recruit Holdings]] developed Juken Sapuri, an [[Learning#E-learning and augmented learning|e-learning]] platform for examination preparation that streams videos featuring top teachers and also has text-based lessons and quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/10/24/national/study-app-business-brisk-prepping-youths-from-all-walks-for-college/|title=Study app business brisk, prepping youths from all walks for college|last=Toi|first=Satoshi|date=2013-10-24|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamaguchi and Watanabe met in 2014, and in the spring of 2015, Recruit Holdings acquired Quipper, and in April 2017, Yamaguchi became Quipper CEO. Juken Sapuri was then migrated to the Quipper platform, and was renamed Study Sapuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iese.edu/en/about-iese/news-media/news/2016/may/the-next-steve-jobs-wont-save-your-company-but-his-boss-might|title=The Next Steve Jobs Won’t Save Your Company – But his Boss Mig|website=www.iese.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/2368243/indonesia-pasar-pertama-bagi-quipper-video|title=Indonesia, Pasar Pertama bagi Quipper Video|last=Liputan6.com|work=liputan6.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/business/200416/japanese-engineer-transforms-ph-education.html|title=Japanese entrepreneur transforms PH education|last=Dela Cruz|first=Roderick|date=27 February 2016|website=ManilaStandard.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://japan.cnet.com/release/30188005/|title=Mexico city教育委員会と提携。公立中学校でQuipperを採用|website=japan.cnet.com|language=ja|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; also adopted the Study Sapuri content format and called the service Quipper Video.

==Quipper in Various Countries==

===Japan===
Quipper's flagship service in [[Japan]] is called Study Sapuri ("Sapuri" is the Japanese term for "supplement”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201804060001.html|title=College entrance exam reforms open up market for AI tech, apps：The Asahi Shimbun|work=The Asahi Shimbun|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of solutions under the Study Sapuri brand. The first is for students, which provides access to thousands of hours worth of video lessons from the country's top teachers. The second solution is for teachers, which includes an achievement test, a learning management system, and lectures taught step by step by professional tutors from prep schools.

Quipper also offers online coaching, which pairs students' access to Study Sapuri with coaching and tutoring services from teachers from some of the country's top universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biz-journal.jp/2018/08/post_24413.html|title=オンライン学習の見放題「スタディサプリ」がTOEICや難関大学受験で驚異的成果を生む理由 - ビジネスジャーナル/Business Journal {{!}} ビジネスの本音に迫る|website=ビジネスジャーナル/Business Journal {{!}} ビジネスの本音に迫る|language=ja-JP|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the service is to provide the guidance students need to pass the national exams to attend the university of their choice. After providing students with a year-long study plan based on their level, their coach then works with them to assist with the learning process and offer advice on their study habits.

The company also has a service called Sapuri English, which aims to help both students and professionals learn English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/212043|title=リクルート発･挫折知らずのTOEIC対策 オンラインコーチ伴走で過去最高点実現へ {{!}} 英語特集|date=2018-03-23|work=東洋経済オンライン|access-date=2018-08-24|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses range from junior high school English conversation, to [[TOEIC]], to [[business English]].

===Indonesia===
Quipper offers four services in [[Indonesia]]. The first is Quipper School, an [[online]] [[learning management system]] for [[Primary education|elementary]], [[Middle school|junior high]], and [[Secondary school|high schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nu.or.id/post/read/78085/madrasah-aliyah-unggulan-kh-wahab-hasbullah-layani-registrasi-online|title=Madrasah Aliyah Unggulan KH Wahab Hasbullah Layani Registrasi Online {{!}} NU Online|last=Online|first=NU|work=NU Online|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform's main features are Q-Learn and Q-Link. Q-Learn is the student portal where students access their lessons and assignments while Q-Link is the teacher portal where teachers send assignments and access data on student performance. There's also a third portal called Q-Create, which enables teachers to create and upload their own content.

The second service is Quipper Video, an [[e-learning]] solution with [[video streaming]] lessons for junior high and high school students designed to help them to prepare for exams, the national exam, and university enrollment tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://swa.co.id/swa/trends/quipper-kunjungi-lebih-dari-5-000-sekolah-di-indonesia|title=Quipper Kunjungi Lebih dari 5.000 Sekolah di Indonesia|last=Putri|first=Ananda Widhia|date=2 May 2017|website=SWA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students access Quipper Video through [[smart devices]], where they can view videos, answer quizzes, and download notes.

The third service is Quipper Video Masterclass, which has two main features - Ask Tutor and Online Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jawapos.com/teknologi/22/03/2018/quipper-sediakan-fasilitas-bimbel-online-sarana-belajar-kekinian|title=Quipper Sediakan Fasilitas Bimbel Online, Sarana Belajar Kekinian|last=JawaPos.com|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a [[live chat]] service that enables students to ask [[tutor]]s for help with lessons, while the second provides students with a personal mentor to help them with their learning needs.

The fourth is Quipper Campus, an online platform for graduating students that helps them find information about [[higher education]] institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industri.bisnis.com/read/20180124/105/730173/504-kampus-di-indonesia-ada-di-quipper-campus|title=504 Kampus di Indonesia Ada di Quipper Campus|website=industri.bisnis.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform can be accessed for free.

===The Philippines===
Quipper Philippines also offers three services. The three services run on a single online platform, with the difference being the type of content available. They serve as [[learning management system]]s or [[textbook]] replacements for [[K-12]] schools.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The first service is Quipper School,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the same online learning platform as the one provided in [[Indonesia]]. However, in the Philippines, Quipper School is available only to [[state school|public schools]] through the company’s partnership with the local [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://2016.mb.com.ph/2016/02/04/quipper-deped-collaboration-to-boost-k-12-programs/|title=Quipper, DepEd collaboration to boost K-12 programs|last=Bulletin|first=The Manila|work=mb.com.ph|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content on Quipper School consists of lesson slides and quizzes for grades 4 to 10.

The second service is Quipper School Premium, which contains study guides (downloadable PDF-based lessons) and quizzes for grades 4 to 12.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The third service is Quipper Video, which in addition to the study guides and quizzes, also includes video lessons for grades 10 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/from-london-to-tokyo-to-manila-quipper-exec-brings-local-learning-online/|title=From London to Tokyo to Manila: Quipper exec brings local learning online|work=BusinessMirror|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The Quipper Mexico office carries two services. The first is Quipper School, a [[learning management system]] that offers free content for grades 7 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amqueretaro.com/noticias/2015/11/10/quipper-school-la-aplicacion-que-beneficiara-a-un-millon-de-estudiantes-en-mexico|title=Quipper School, la aplicación que beneficiará a un millón de estudiantes en México - AMQueretaro.com|date=2015-11-10|work=AMQueretaro.com|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second service, Quipper Video, is designed to help grade 9 students in Mexico City pass the Comisión Metropolitana de Instituciones Públicas de Educación Medio Superior [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurso_de_Asignaci%C3%B3n_a_la_Educaci%C3%B3n_Media_Superior (COMIPEMS)], a [[State school|public high school]] [[Educational entrance examination|admission test]]. Apart from providing video lessons, study guides, and quizzes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webadictos.com/2016/03/08/quipper-video-plataforma-online-prepara-examen-admision-a-bachillerato/|title=Llega a México Quipper Video, plataforma online que te prepara para el examen de admisión a bachillerato|date=2016-03-08|work=WebAdictos|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quipper Video also comes with a dedicated tutor, a personalized study plan, and a weekly report for parents.

Before subscribing to Quipper Video, students take a mock exam to enable Quipper to assess their level and determine the topics that need more attention.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Recognition==
In August 2018, Study Sapuri and Quipper won the Business Intelligence Group’s Sustainability Service of the Year (Service) for the great contribution of Study Sapuri/Quipper services in providing affordable education to a greater number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bintelligence.com/blog/2018/7/17/43-people-projects-and-organizations-awarded-for-driving-sustainability-efforts|title=43 People, Projects, and Organizations Awarded for Driving Sustainability Efforts|work=Business Intelligence Group|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert L. Hass''' (born  March 1, 1941) is an American poet. He served as [[Poet Laureate of the United States]] from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name="poets.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/194 |title=Robert Hass- Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios &amp; More |publisher=Poets.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the 2007 [[National Book Award]]&lt;ref name=nba2007/&gt; and shared the 2008 [[Pulitzer Prize]]&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; for the collection ''Time and Materials: Poems 1997-2005.''&lt;ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"&gt;Goldman, Justin. [http://www.diablomag.com/Diablo-Magazine/July-2008/Best-of-the-East-Bay-People/ "Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"] Diablo Magazine, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he was awarded the [[List of winners of the Wallace Stevens Award|Wallace Stevens Award]] from the [[Academy of American Poets]].&lt;ref name=Poetryfoundation.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/08/robert-hass-awarded-the-wallace-stevens-award-from-the-academy-of-american-poets/ |title=Robert Hass Awarded the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=2014-08-26 |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Hass's works are well known for their [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] subjects and attitudes. He was born in San Francisco and grew up in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].&lt;ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/&gt; He grew up with an [[alcoholic]] mother, a major topic in the 1996 poem collection, ''Sun Under Wood''. His older brother encouraged him to dedicate himself to his writing. Awe-struck by [[Gary Snyder]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], among others in the 1950s [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] poetry scene, Hass entertained the idea of becoming a [[beatnik]]. He graduated from [[Marin Catholic High School]] in 1958. When the area became influenced by East Asian literary techniques, such as [[haiku]], Hass took many of these influences up in his poetry. He has been hailed as "a lyrical virtuoso who is able to turn even cooking recipes into poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, 'Zwischen Wein und Wüste', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' Nr. 260 (11. November 2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hass is married to the poet and antiwar activist [[Brenda Hillman]], who is a professor at [[Saint Mary's College of California]].&lt;ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/&gt;

==Career==
Hass graduated from [[Saint Mary's College of California|Saint Mary's College]] in [[Moraga, California]] in 1963, and received his [[Master's degree|MA]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in English from [[Stanford University]] in 1965 and 1971 respectively.&lt;ref name="poets.org"/&gt; At Stanford he studied with the poet and critic [[Yvor Winters]], whose ideas influenced his later writing and thinking. His Stanford classmates included the poets [[Robert Pinsky]], [[John Matthias]], and [[James L. McMichael|James McMichael]]. Hass taught literature and writing at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] in 1967. From 1971 to 1989, he taught at his alma mater St. Mary's, at which time he transferred to the faculty of [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He has been a visiting faculty member in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] on several occasions, and was a panelist at the Workshop's 75th anniversary celebration in June 2011.

From 1995-1997, during Hass's two terms as the US Poet Laureate ([[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]]), he became a champion of literacy, poetry, and [[ecology|ecological]] awareness. He criss-crossed the country lecturing in places as diverse as corporate boardrooms and for civic groups, or as he has said, "places where poets don't go." Since his self-described "act of citizenship," he wrote a weekly column on poetry in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', until 2000. He serves as a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]], was a trustee of the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]] (now trustee emeritus), and works actively for literacy and the environment.

As major influences on his poetry, Hass cites [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Lew Welch]], and praises the slogan "Raid Kills Bugs Dead," which Welch crafted while working for an advertising firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/poetryeverywhere/hass.html |title=Robert Hass &amp;#124; Poetry Everywhere |publisher=PBS |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/haas/onlineinterviews.htm |title=Robert Hass: Online Interviews |publisher=English.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he has named Chilean [[Pablo Neruda]], Peruvian [[César Vallejo]], and Polish poets [[Zbigniew Herbert]], [[Wisława Szymborska]], and [[Czesław Miłosz]], whom he regards as the five most important poets of the last 50 years. Of the five, Neruda, Szymborska and Milosz are [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] winners. While at Berkeley, Hass spent 15 to 20 years translating the poetry of his fellow Berkeley professor and neighbor Czesław Miłosz&lt;ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/&gt; as part of a team with [[Robert Pinsky]] and Miłosz.

In 1999, Hass appeared in ''[[Wildflowers (film)|Wildflowers]]'', the debut film by director [[Melissa Painter]]. In the film, Hass plays The Poet, a writer who is dying of an unnamed chronic illness. Excerpts from his poetry are included in the script, primarily read by Hass and by actress [[Daryl Hannah]].

==Poetry==
Hass's poems tend to vary in structure as he alternates between prose-like blocks and free verse. His poems have been described to have a stylistic clarity, seen in his simple, clear language and precise imagery. His collection, "Praise", features running themes of seasons, nature, location, and transformation as well as a running motif of blackberries. Poet Stanley Kunitz said of Hass's work, "Reading a poem by Robert Hass is like stepping into the ocean when the temperature of the water is not much different from that of the air. You scarcely know, until you feel the undertow tug at you, that you have entered into another element."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Hass|url=http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/robert-hass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 2017 "Gift Horse" episode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=456&amp;t=30477|title=03x11 - Gift Horse - Madam Secretary Transcripts - Forever Dreaming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the TV series "Madam Secretary" alludes to Robert Hass. At a presidential inauguration, the poet laureate character ("Roland Hobbs") recites a poem that describes "the privilege of being", an allusion to Hass' 1999 poem with that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/books/bk-7893|title=Privilege of Being, By Robert Hass|date=14 February 1999|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Hass has been actively engaged in promoting [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy]]. In 1995, he began working with writer and environmentalist Pamela Michael on a program that encourages "children to make art and poetry about their watersheds" and fosters interdisciplinary environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Hass: Eight years of activism, writing, and reflection|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2007/11/08_hass.shtml|accessdate=November 27, 2011|newspaper=The Berkeleyan|date=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, when he was poet laureate, he organized a 6-day conference at the Library of Congress that brought together American nature writers to celebrate writing, the natural world and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=River of Words: History|url=http://www.riverofwords.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His watershed program expanded into the non-profit organization River of Words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverofwords.org|title=River Of Words|website=www.riverofwords.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  River of Words provides tools for teaching ecoliteracy and holds an annual poetry and art contest for children and teens.

On November 9, 2011, while participating in an [[Occupy movement]] demonstration at [[UC Berkeley]] called [[Occupy Cal]], Hass was hit in the ribs by a police officer wielding a baton. His wife was shoved to the ground by a police officer.&lt;ref name=hassnyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Hass|first=Robert|title=Poet-Bashing Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/at-occupy-berkeley-beat-poets-has-new-meaning.html|accessdate=November 27, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about their experience in a November 19, 2011, ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion piece entitled "Poet-Bashing Police."

'''Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann''' ({{lang-he|רודי להמן}}) was a German-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] sculptor and [[Wood carving]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/events/the-wood-menagerie-works-by-rudi-lehmann/|title=The Wood Menagerie: Works by Rudi Lehmann|newspaper=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the pioneers of sculpture in the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mq5W3XjrbxUC|title=The Object of Memory: Arab and Jew Narrate the Palestinian Village|first=Susan|last=Slyomovics|date=1 June 1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann (1903-1977), born in Berlin, August 25, 1903 to Elizabeth Sender. In 1919 Rudolf was adopted by the Lehmann family.                                                                   
He was one of the pioneers of wood sculpting in the State of Israel.

==Studies==
In 1912 in Berlin he practiced, wood sculpture with [[:de:Ludwig Vordermayer|Ludwig Vordermayer]].
In 1917-1922, he studied mechanics and worked as a blacksmith's  apprentice. After studying woodcarving and sculpture with sculptor [[Harold Isenstein]], he attended the [[:de:Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißensee]] (Municipal Art School Berlin-Weißensee), majoring in sculpture and ceramics. During his studies there, he met [[Hedwig Grossman Lehmann|Hedwig Grossman]], whom he later married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/artists-yishuv-and-israel-1920-1970|title=Artists: Yishuv and Israel: 1920-1970 - Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Grossman%20Lehmann,%20Hedwig |title=Hedwig Grossman Lehmann |publisher= Information Center for Israeli Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928-1930, Lehmann worked for Holzmann's Stone Mason and Carving company. He became a freelance stonemason and sculptor for museums around Germany, including the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, and worked in terra cotta at Hedwig's ceramics workshop. In the summer of 1933, Lehmann immigrated to Mandate Palestine with his wife and settled in [[Haifa]]. They established a ceramics testing laboratory at the [[Technion]] in  Haifa and settled on [[Kibbutz]] [[Yagur]] in 1935, where they established a flower pot factory.

In 1937, the couple opened a sculpture studio in [[Jerusalem]], where Lehmann produced miniature carvings from olive wood, ivory, horn and gemstones sold as tourist souvenirs. In 1945-1947, Lehmann worked for the [[Haganah]], building models and ballistic implements. In 1947-1948, he joined the [[Jewish Agency]]'s Self-Defense Planning Committee.

In 1953, he helped to found the [[Ein Hod]] Artists' Village, where he taught sculpture. Among his students were [[Yigael Tumarkin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safrai.com/artist_Ygael_Tumarkin_97.html|title=Ygael Tumarkin |publisher=Safrai Fine Art gallery - Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Menashe Kadishman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farkash-gallery.com/homage-to-Menashe-Kadishmans-81st-birthday-1.html|title=The Farkash Gallery - Vintage Israeli Posters - 14th Israeli Independence Day poster 1962|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140813124001/http://www.farkash-gallery.com/homage-to-Menashe-Kadishmans-81st-birthday-1.html|archivedate=2014-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Lehmann and his wife moved to [[Givatayim]] where he established an art school under the auspices of the Givatayim municipality. The school held classes in sculpture, woodcuts and ceramics for young people and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/artcenter/default.asp?artist=280437|title=Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann|work=Information Center for Israeli Art|publisher=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813195201/http://www.imj.org.il/artcenter/default.asp?artist=280437|archivedate=2014-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehmann's work was influenced by the [[Canaanism]] school of Israeli art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://azure.org.il/include/print.php?id=238|title=The Crisis of Israeli Culture |journal=Azure |date=Summer 2003 | number=15| first=Yigal |last=Alon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attempted to create a direct relationship with the [[Land of Israel]] by emphasizing simple shapes and motifs from the sculpture and ritual art of early Middle Eastern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluefineart.com/artist-bio/calman-shemi/|title=Calman Shemi |publisher=Blue Fine Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1977.

'''Rudolf Falb''' (born 14 April 1838 in [[Obdach]] ([[Styria]], [[Austrian Empire]]; died 29 September 1903 in [[Schöneberg]], [[German Empire]]) was an Austrian popularizer of natural history who concerned himself with [[earthquakes]], [[meteorology]], [[astronomy]] and also with [[evolutionary linguistics]]. He developed the ''lunisolar flood hypothesis'' of [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanism]], based on the concept of subterranean lava tides, which the academic community thoroughly refuted even during his lifetime; nevertheless he attained considerable popularity through apparently correct predictions of several seismic events. Falb's lasting legacy is that he popularized the concept of extraterrestrial influences of geophysical phenomena, even though his concepts regarding the origins of earthquakes were wrong.

== Priest and teacher ==

Falb, a miller's son, attended school at [[St. Lambrecht's Abbey]] and then studied theology at the [[University of Graz]]. He was ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] in 1862 and briefly served as a [[chaplain]] in [[Kainach bei Voitsberg]] and then in [[pastoral care]]. However he soon became a teacher for religion and German language at the merchants' academy in [[Graz]] where [[Peter Rosegger]] was one of his pupils. Falb became estranged from Catholicism during this time, renouncing his priesthood in 1866. (He converted to Protestantism in 1872).

== The lunisolar flood theory ==

Falb relocated to [[Prague]] where he obtained a tutor position in a noble family. This supplied him with sufficient funds to study [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] at the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], and later [[geology]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. There is no record of him having obtained an academic degree at either institution.

In 1868 Falb started the popular astronomy magazine, ''Sirius'' and began to develop his "lunisolar flood theory", published in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Grundzüge zu einer Theorie der Erdbeben und Vulkanausbrüche. Ed. J. Pock, Graz 1869&lt;/ref&gt; A central point of this hypothesis stated earthquakes to be caused by [[tidal forces]] acting on subterranean lakes of [[lava]] (causing earthquakes) and its upwelling through the [[Crust (geology)|earth's crust]] (causing volcanic eruptions). The strength of these forces being predictable from the positions of the sun and the moon relative to each  other, Falb proceeded to postulate "Critical Days" during which geophysical disasters should be more likely to occur. Subsequently he extended this hypothesis, which initially had strong connections to ideas put forward by the French mathematician [[Alexis Perrey]], to include long-term [[weather forecasting]]. Falb's hypothesis gained a high public profile when he made predictions that seemed to come true with the [[1873 Belluno earthquake]] and an eruption at [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Gedanken und Studien über den Vulcanismus mit besonderer Beziehung auf das Erdbeben von Belluno am 29. Juni 1873 und die Eruption des Ätna am 29. August 1874. Ed.: Leykam-Josefsthal, Graz 1875&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fundamental flaws of this hypothesis were the typical ones that disqualify it as a [[scientific theory]]—namely, insufficient specificity and precision of the predictions in relation to statistically expected levels, and inherent irrefutability, the combined effect being non-[[falsifiability]]. Falb considered days on which the moon was either full or new or in its [[lunar nodes|nodal positions]] (i.e., four days per month) to be "Critical Days." To this were added the days of the [[equinox]] (2 per year), and the days when Earth was in the [[Apsis|apical positions]] of its orbit (2 per year). Because Falb proceeded to claim each of these days to be preceded and followed by 2–3 days which he also considered critical (though less so), about a third of all days of the year met some criteria of "criticality" according to the lunisolar hypothesis. Moreover, by stating the actual occurrence of the predicted events not to be mandatory, Falb immunized himself against failures while he could (and would) always claim successes as being in support of his hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Brückner E. Weather prophets. In: The Sources and Consequences of Climate Change and Climate Variability in Historical Times, p. 246–248. Ed.: Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;—a characteristic hallmark of predictions in [[pseudoscience]].

Falb also met the most determined resistance from the scientific establishment on geophysical grounds. Among his most determined and outspoken academic opponents were one of the founders of [[seismotectonics]], [[Rudolf Hoernes]]&lt;ref&gt;Die Erdbebentheorie R. Falbs und ihre wissenschaftliche Grundlage (Wien 1881)&lt;/ref&gt; in Graz, the director of the Austrian Meteorological Service, Josef M. Pernter&lt;ref&gt;Pernter, J.M. Falbs kritische Tage. Ed.: Hermann Paetel. Berlin 1892&lt;/ref&gt; in Innsbruck, and the British inventor of the modern seismograph, [[John Milne]].

This formidable and sustained scientific opposition notwithstanding, Falb influenced public opinion regarding seismic phenomena to such a degree that the two major German encyclopedias - the [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]]&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon. 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 6, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1888. Vol. 5, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt; - both mentioned Falb and his theory in editions published during the late 19th century. He also gained a degree of notability in the English-speaking world. In London [[Murray's Magazine]] published an appraisal of his earthquake predictions which was reprinted by [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;The Falb Earthquake theory.

[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/06/26/104013453.pdf The New York Times, June 26, 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic hypotheses ==

In 1877 Falb traveled in South America to study volcanic phenomena and became so fascinated with the native ethnic culture that he stayed much longer than he had planned. While in [[Bolivia]] he became a favorite of president [[Hilarión Daza]] but had to leave the country when Daza was removed from office in 1879. After interludes in California and New York, Falb returned to Austria but then moved on to [[Leipzig]] where he married Petrine von Labitschburg, a primary school teacher. There he opened up another front of controversy in 1883–1888 when he published books on the [[Inca civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;Das Land der Inka in seiner Bedeutung für die Urgeschichte der Sprache und Schrift. Leipzig 1883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Die Anden-Sprachen in ihrem Zusammenhang mit dem semitischen Sprachstamm.&lt;/ref&gt; postulating languages such as [[Aymara language|Aimara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] to be the "original languages of mankind" and linking them to the [[Semitic languages]]. These writings did not gain the broad publicity which the lunisolar flood theory continued to enjoy.

== Final years ==

Although increasingly affected by a paralytic spinal disease, Falb continued to publish "Critical Day" calendars (from 1888 onward) and other writings which became increasingly eccentric, including [[deluge myth]]s and ice ages. With his wife and their five children he spent the following 15 years under increasingly dire economic conditions relocating between [[Berlin]], his native town Obdach, Leipzig, and finally Berlin again where Rudolf Falb died in 1903, at an age of 65 years.

'''Ruin Academy''' (established 2010) is an independent cross-over architectural [[research center]] in the Urban Core area of [[Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/9/view/11727/c-laboratory-ruin-academy.html c laboratory: ruin academy]&amp;nbsp;– Designboom 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   It is 'set to re-think the industrial city and the modern man in the box' through research and a series of [[workshop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plusmood.com/2010/10/ruin-academy-in-taipei-marco-casagrande/ Ruin Academy in Taipei]&amp;nbsp;– +MOOD 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruin Academy occupies an abandoned 5-story apartment building in central Taipei. All the interior walls of the building and all the windows are removed in order to grow [[bamboo]] and vegetables inside the house.  The plants are situated so that their vegetation grows in front of the glassless window spaces, giving privacy to those inside. The [[professor]]s and [[student]]s are sleeping and working in [[mahogany]] made [[ad hoc]] dormitories and have a public [[sauna]] in the 5th floor. All the building is penetrated with 6&amp;nbsp;inch holes in order to let “rain inside”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landezine.com/index.php/2010/11/ruin-academy/ Ruin Academy]&amp;nbsp;– Landezine 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''The architectural control is in a process of giving up in order to let nature to step in. So far it is not giving up&amp;nbsp;– it is too lazy. Architectural control will be given up. Modernism is lost and the industrial machine will become organic. This happens in Taipei and this is what we study. Ruin Academy is an organic machine.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch-times.com/2010/10/10/ruin-academy-in-taipei-marco-casagrande/ Ruin Academy in Taipei | Marco Casagrande]&amp;nbsp;– Arch-Times 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ruin is viewed as a tipping point when a man-made object becomes part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpit.org/2012/05/survival-architecture-workshop-in-norway/ Survival Architecture Workshop in Norway | Guoda Bardauskaitė &amp; Suzanne van Niekerk]&amp;nbsp;– Art Pit 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Topics ==
The research and design tasks move freely in-between [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[environmental art]] and other disciplines of [[art]] and [[science]] within the general framework of built human environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ounodesign.com/2010/10/17/ruin-academy/ Ruin Academy]&amp;nbsp;– Ouno 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchic Grandmothers, Academic Squatting, [[Urban Acupuncture]]-these are some of the ideas behind the Ruin Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2011/02/more-ruins.html More Ruins]&amp;nbsp;– Phyllis Richardson, Archetcetera 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy workshops include:

* Organic [[Acupuncture]]
** Spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] balancing the industrial Taipei and tuning the city towards the organic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 The Community Gardens of Taipei]&amp;nbsp;– P2P Foundation 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[River]] [[Urbanism]]
** A form of [[landscape urbanism]] aiming in natural river restoration in urban conditions and reconnection of the [[Contemporary history|modern]] city and the river [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biourbanism.org/taipei-from-the-river/ Taipei from the River]&amp;nbsp;– International Society of Biourbanism 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*Illegal [[Architecture]]
** Architecture that uses the [[Official]] City as a “growing platform and energy source, where to attach itself like a [[parasite]] and from where to leach the [[electricity]] and [[water]]... [The Instant City's] illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the Taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the “official” Taipei, a parallel city&amp;nbsp;– or a para-city.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ Illegal Architecture in Taipei] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526043446/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ |date=2012-05-26 }}&amp;nbsp;– Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan, Architizer 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Casagrande adds, “many spontaneous and often illegal communities are growing that are more complex and fruitful than official development and official architecture – often blindly directed by economy and centralised politics. Anarchist grandmothers are cultivating illegal community gardens and urban farms everywhere around Taipei. They are breaking the city.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://luxuryinprogress.com/academic-ruin/ Academic Ruin] Emma Tucker, The LIP, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Knowledge is a theme penetrating through all the research elements and tying the Thirg Generation Taipei to the site-specific natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/taiwan/ruin_academy_taipei.htm Ruin Academy Taiwan : Architecture Information]&amp;nbsp;– E-Architect 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Casagrande: ''Architects’ and designers’ position about organic knowledge is tricky. We are not the ones who carry this collective genetic memory on, but we are in a better position to interpret and negotiate with it, step by step, like a shaman getting answers from the organic side. This can easily go very wrong, when architect starts copyrighting fragments of local knowledge under his ego. I guess often it would be enough to create a platform of accidents for the organic knowledge to surface, start cooking, and finding its own forms and dynamics. Design is not necessarily needed in here, and design should not replace reality&amp;nbsp;– while organic knowledge is close to reality, nature.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biourbanism.org/change-from-organic-city/ Change from organic city]&amp;nbsp;– M. Casagrande, International Society of Biourbanism&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruin Academy received the ''World Architecture Community Award'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/world-buildings/award-surfer.asp?position=detail&amp;country=Taiwan&amp;no=7495&amp;b_donem=9 WA Awards]&amp;nbsp;– World Architecture 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The Academy is operated by the Taiwanese JUT Foundation for Arts &amp; Architecture, in cooperation with Finland-based [[Marco Casagrande|Casagrande Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newterritories.org/blog/ruin-academy-in-taipei-architectural-research-center Ruin Academy in Taipei, Architectural Research Centre]&amp;nbsp;– New Territories 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third Generation City ==

The core of the Ruin Academy's cross-over architectural [[philosophy]] is the [[theory]] of the Third Generation City, the organic ruin of the industrial city. The Academy is focused in the research of the ruining processes of Taipei that keep the city alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekarchitects.gr/en/temporary/ruin-academy-id4119 Ruin Academy]&amp;nbsp;– Greek Architects 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The element of Ruin is viewed as something man-made having become part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dezeen.com/2009/06/26/chen-house-by-c-laboratory/ Chen House by C-Laboratory]&amp;nbsp;– Dezeen 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Generation City follows the first generation where humans' peacefully coexisted with nature and the second generation built walls and stone structures everywhere in an attempt to shut out nature. In the third generation however, nature, which can never be truly shut out, grows back through the ruins, through the cracks in the wall, sucking human nature back into the wider nature. Third Generation City concentrates on local knowledge and urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erenlai.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4520%3Areturning-man-to-nature-and-reality&amp;catid=697%3Amay-focus&amp;Itemid=348&amp;lang=en Returning Humans to Nature and Reality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211202/http://www.erenlai.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4520:returning-man-to-nature-and-reality&amp;catid=697:may-focus&amp;Itemid=348&amp;lang=en |date=2012-03-08 }}&amp;nbsp;– Nick Couson, eRenlai 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Third Generation cities are those that have grown from the ruin of industrial society but lie beyond its fordist structure of social and economic organization. Principally, Third Generation cities can be conceived of as rhizomatic in nature and ultimately, bound up with pre-existing and future conditions of human construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandsciencejournal.com/post/29908747216/ruin-academy-what-gives-a-building-presence-one Ruin Academy] - Lee-Michael J. Pronko, Art &amp; Science Journal, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Generation City is the industrial city ruined by the people&amp;nbsp;– human nature as part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr9/eng/cross-over.html Cross-Over Architecture and the Third Generation City]&amp;nbsp;– Epifanio 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the Third Generation Taipei are:
* Anarchist Gardener
** ''Spontaneous [[Community gardening|community gardens]] and urban farms operating outside the official urban development.''
* Urban [[Nomad]] / Instant Taipei
** ''Light weigh and movable citizen architectural actions attached on top of the static city.''
* Urban Acupuncture
** ''Architecture that is in the position of producing needles for the urban [[Qi]].''
* Compost
** ''Independent, self organized and often illegal communities that are organically editing the official city.''
* River Urbanism
**'' A form of landscape urbanism&amp;nbsp;– city developed from the viewpoint of river nature.''
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html Ruin Academy]&amp;nbsp;– Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ruin Academy’s workshops bring an ecological approach to a mapping of the city’s informal activities. In this sense, lodging a constructed nature within an architecture of decay dramatizes the incursion of the organic in the city. Ruin Academy establishes a living fragment of the third generation city that counters the modern spaces produced by global technology and standardized construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Ariane Lourie. 2013.

Cities, to be the fall of the machine, where “the ruin” is the reality produced by nature, that reclaims the artefact. Biourbanism happens, when nature force takes the initiative, affects the design of industrial society, and becomes co- architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biourbanism.org/biourban-acupuncture-2/ Biourban Acupuncture, review]&amp;nbsp;– Angelo Abbate, International Society of Biourbanism 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tartu Art School''' ({{lang-et|Tartu Kunstikool}}) is an upper secondary vocational art school in the city of [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. TAS provides study programs for aspiring [[Interior design|decorator-stylists]] (interior designers), [[Desktop publishing|print media designer-desktop publishers]], [[3D modeling|3D-modellers]] and [[Illustration|illustrators]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.tartu.ee/ Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of Tartu Art School is closely linked to the Tartu National Art Institute and therefore to the influential Pallas art school which was renamed as [[Konrad Mägi]]'s Higher State  School of Art in the early Soviet era. In 1944 the school adopted the name National Art Institute of Tartu.

In the 1940s the institutions that provided higher art education in Estonia were in both [[Tallinn]] and Tartu. However, at the end of the decade the Soviet Council of Ministers ruled that the National Art Institute of Tartu be united with the National Art Institute of Tallinn, concentrating all the higher education in art in the capital. The only function that the former National Art Institute of Tartu performed at the time was preparing future students set for the institute in Tallinn and training aspiring art teachers.

Tartu Visual Art School opened its doors on July 1, 1951 which is also considered the official birthday of Tartu Art School (the name was officially changed in 1960). In its first year of existence only courses in art pedagogy were taught with sculpting, decorating and fashion design disciplines being added to the curriculum during the next few years.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Main building of Tartu Art School.jpg|thumb|Tartu Art School]] --&gt;
The next couple of decades were a time of stable growth for TAS. During the 90’s the school moved to its own  building on Tähe street. TAS relocated again in early 2010 and is currently situated on Eha street (Eha 41) in the district of [[Karlova, Tartu|Karlova]] in Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art.tartu.ee/uldinfo/ajalugu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130106144914/http://www.art.tartu.ee/uldinfo/ajalugu/ |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

Students who enroll at Tartu Art School can choose one of four disciplines: interior design (decorator-stylists), print media design-desktop publishing, illustration and 3D-modelling. In addition to basic art studies (drawing, painting, graphics, sculpting, composition, typography, chromatics etc.), TAS study programs include animation and photography. Depending on the field of study, students need to have successfully graduated from a primary school or a secondary school. A youth contest which has been held for nearly 6 years gives a few aspiring TAS students a chance to enroll at the school without having to take the entrance exams. Students graduate after 3.5 years. The academic year begins in September and is divided into two semesters. Additionally, TAS has individual study programs for adults. About 50 teachers work at TAS and the current headmistress is Kadi Kreis (since August 2000).

==Traditions==

* A travelling trophy – the Golden Pencil - is awarded to the artist who has shown exceptional skill in drawing every semester. The panel who determines the recipient consists of the resident art teachers. The prize was first conceived by a drawing teacher at TAS, Udo Vool. The prize was first issued during the fall semester of 2010.
* The 24-hour comics event was launched in 2003 and lasted until 2009. The patron of the event was a TAS art teacher Peeter Krosmann, however, the idea originated from the American cartoonist [[Scott McCloud]]. The purpose of the event was to draw a page of a graphic novel in an hour with the ultimate goal of creating 24 pages of material.

==Notable alumni==

Many influential artists on the Estonian and international art scene have graduated from Tartu Art School including:

*[[Ellinor Aiki]]
*[[Tiit Pääsuke]] 
*[[Silvi Kelle]] 
*[[Enn Tegova]]  
*[[Fideelia-Signe Roots]]
*[[Mari Kartau]]
*[[Rein Tammik]]
*[[Kalli Kalde]] 
*[[Leonhard Merzin]]
*[[Lilian Mosolainen]] 
*[[Imbi Lind]]
*[[Concordia Klar]]
*[[Henno Käo]]
*[[Ene Tapfer]]
*[[Agaate Veeber]]
*[[Kuno Veeber]]

==Connection to Tartu Art College==

[[Tartu Art College]] was founded on the 1st of August 2000. It provides undergraduate level art education and is closely linked to Tartu Art School as a large percentage of the TAS graduates continue their studies at the college. The two biggest art schools in Tartu are situated right next to each other and also share a portion of the faculty and the facilities.

In addition, to enable the students to achieve their full potential in academic excellence, we strive to prepare our next generation to use Twenty First century skills and competencies to respond to the challenges of the new world, from economic crises to political upheavals. Shaped and driven by the vision, “A United World At Peace – Through Education” the schools aim to develop young people who are confident actors in the world, rather than acted upon by it. We encourage the values of cultural diversity and acceptance of others different from oneself. There is no better place to instill such holistic personal character for your kids than a school such as Tenby Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tenby Schools Group |url=https://www.tenby.edu.my/the-group/about-us |website=Tenby Schools |accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">The '''Virtual Global University''' ('''VGU''') is a [[virtual university]] offering online [[distance education]] or [[virtual education]] on the [[Internet]].

==Organization==

The Virtual Global University (VGU) is a private organization founded in 2001 by 17 professors of [[Business Informatics]] from 14 different universities in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. The VGU brings together the knowledge and experience of people from different universities in one [[virtual business|virtual organization]]. At the same time it is a real organization, according to German civil law under the name "VGU Private Virtual Global University GmbH".

Within the Virtual Global University, the School of Business Informatics (SBI) is the organizational unit that offers online courses and an online study program.

==Studies==

The focus of VGU's study offerings is [[information technology]] (IT) and [[management]]—or [[Business Informatics]] as it is called in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R. Zmud and et al., What Every Business Student Needs to Know About Information Systems, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, (9:30) December, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doukidis, G.: et al. (Ed.): Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS '95). Athens 1995, pp.1295–1297&lt;/ref&gt; Students of [[Business Informatics]] (BI) are taught how to use IT effectively to develop business solutions for global challenges.

All courses offered by the VGU are based on the Internet as well as on commonly available information and communication technology and are given entirely, or are substantially supported, by means of electronic media. The MBI can be conducted either in English or in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette |last=Bauer |title=Neuer Wirtschaftsinformatik-Master für Berufstätige startet |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news317473 |work=Abteilung Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit Europa-Universität Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)|date=2009-05-28 |accessdate = 2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MBI program===

The VGU offers a master's program leading to the degree of an "International [[Master of Business Informatics]]" (MBI). The creation of the MBI was supported by the German "Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung" (federal ministry of education and research) within the program "New Media in Education".

'''Wendy Ann Melvoin'''&lt;ref&gt;self&lt;/ref&gt; (born January 26, 1964) is an American [[guitar]]ist and [[singer-songwriter]], best known for her work with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] as part of his backing band [[The Revolution (band)|The Revolution]], and for her collaboration with [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]] as one half of the duo [[Wendy &amp; Lisa]].

== Music career ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Shortly after the completion of Prince and The Revolution's 1986 album ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'', Coleman and Melvoin left the Revolution and started their own duo, [[Wendy &amp; Lisa]], also known as Girl Brothers.

Melvoin and Coleman also composed music for the first season of the TV series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvoin's and Coleman's compositions for ''Heroes'' closely followed their music-scoring of the previous [[Tim Kring]] series, ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', which had starred [[Jill Hennessy]] in the lead role.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, they announced that they would release an album consisting entirely of the score from ''Heroes'', entitled ''[[Heroes: Original Score]]''. Melvoin and Coleman composed the main title song for ''[[Nurse Jackie]]'', for which they were awarded with an Emmy in 2010. As of mid-November 2015, the duo were working on the American TV series ''[[Touch (TV series)|Touch]]''.

Melvoin also contributed guitars to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2008 album ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'' on the song "She's Not Me", and she is mentioned by name during the song.

She contributed heavily to [[Neil Finn]]'s second solo album ''[[One Nil]]'', co-writing many tracks and playing drums and bass on several. She is credited for guitar work on most of the tracks on [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]]'s first solo album, ''[[...Something to Be]]''.

Melvoin is also listed in the credits of [[Glen Campbell]]'s 2011 final studio album, ''[[Ghost on the Canvas]]''.

==Personal life==

In April 2009, Melvoin gave an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine that, for the first time, publicly revealed that she was a [[lesbian]] and discussed her past romantic relationship with [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]], who is still her musical partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/04/16/revolution-will-be-harmonized|title=The Revolution Will Be Harmonized|date=16 April 2009|work=out.com|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==

{{nihongo|'''''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'''''|ワイリー&amp;ライトのRockBoard ザッツ*パラダイス}} is a spin-off [[video game]] title in the original ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series from [[Capcom]]. It is a [[business simulation game]] that is similar to [[board game]] [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']], in which players and the computer [[artificial intelligence|AI]] take turns going around a set of connected squares, buying up [[property]], and charging other participants [[renting|rent]] when they land on those spaces.

''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' was released on January 15, 1993 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] only in [[Japan]], though an unreleased English translation and a [[Game Boy]] version may have been in development. Critical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been decidedly poor.

==Gameplay==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' is a [[business simulation game]] in which the player chooses among several characters in the [[Mega Man (original series)|original ''Mega Man'' series]] and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of [[property]]. The characters include [[Roll (Mega Man)|Roll]], [[Dr. Light (Mega Man)|Dr. Light]], [[Doctor Wily|Dr. Wily]], [[Dr. Cossack]], and [[Kalinka Cossack|Kalinka]].&lt;ref name="bigref"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Rockman Big Reference Book | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'' | language=Japanese | pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fletcher, JC | date=November 29, 2007 | title=Virtually Overlooked: ''Wily &amp; Right no Rockboard: That's Paradise'' | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/29/virtually-overlooked-wily-and-right-no-rockboard-thats-paradise/ | publisher=[[Joystiq]] | accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency).&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; They can then charge other characters [[Renting|rent]] when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building.&lt;ref name="bigref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;

==Development==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' was developed by [[Capcom]] during a time when the ''Mega Man'' franchise was at its height of its popularity.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nutt, Christian  |author2=Speer, Justin  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The History of ''Mega Man'' | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6076983/p-26.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series artist [[Keiji Inafune]] had very little involvement in the development of ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'', simply designing the cover art and the new character [[List of Mega Man characters#Reggae|Reggae]].&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; When developing the game, the team wanted to include as many bosses from previous titles in the series as possible.&lt;ref name="club"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Club Capcom | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'': A Development Team Inside Story | language=Japanese | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they ultimately decided to leave room for an original character that fans could associate with the new game. When discussing a bird character labeled {{nihongo|''fukou no tori''|フコウノトリ||lit. "bird of misfortune"}}, one of the team members misread it as {{nihongo|''kounotori''|コウノトリ||lit. "[[Oriental stork]]"}}, resulting in Reggae's resemblance to the species.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;

The January 1993 issue of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] magazine ''[[Club Nintendo]]'' featured ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' as part of a preview article for the 1993 [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. Titling the game as "Mega Board", the article even had a screenshot featuring [[English language|English]] text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Club Nintendo]] | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | page=23 | title=''Mega Board'' | author=Ham, Richard | language=Spanish | date=January 1993 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unreleased [[Game Boy]] version was apparently in the works by the Japanese company Dual, which listed the game on the credits page of its official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:開発業歴 |trans-title=Development History | url=http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html  | publisher=Dual | language=Japanese | accessdate=January 30, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070726100055/http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html |archivedate = July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] was responsible for the audio in this version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hitoshi Sakimoto - Official English Website (Discography) | url=http://sakimoto.cocoebiz.com/discography/index.shtml | publisher=[[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] | accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Globalize/USA|section|date=November 2018}}
Critical reception for ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' outside Japan has been poor. [[GameSpot]] contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer found the relatively obscure game to be of no particular interest to anyone other than ''Mega Man'' fans.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] summated, "An oddity of the Famicom era, this import title was a simple "[[The Game of Life|''Game of Life'']]"-style board game with a ''Mega Man'' motif -- novel, but hardly essential."&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parish, Jeremy | date=May 10, 2007 | title=The ''Mega Man'' Series Roundup | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3159344 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] editor Brett Elston called it a "probably better-off-lost excursion into Mega-mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Elston, Brett | date=June 30, 2008 | title=The ultimate ''Mega Man'' retrospective | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-ultimate-mega-man-retrospective/a-2008062794557758069/p-3 | publisher=[[GamesRadar]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all views of the game have been negative. JC Fletcher of [[Joystiq]] expressed desire for the game's release on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service. He opined that it is "actually nowhere near as terrible as a ''Mega Man'' board game ''should'' be" and that its various effects and winning conditions grant it a much faster pace than [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']].&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;
