The eleventh cycle of '''''America's Next Top Model'''''  premiered on September 3, 2008 and was the fifth season to be aired on [[The CW]] network. The promotional catchphrase of the cycle was "Feel The Love."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcrunch.com/americas-next-top-model-cycle-11-promo-photo/ "America’s Next Top Model" Cycle 11 Promo Photo]. August 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prizes for this cycle were:

* A modeling contract with [[Elite Model Management]].
* A fashion spread and cover in [[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]].
* A {{USD}}100,000 contract with [[CoverGirl]] cosmetics.

Approximately the first half of the competition took place in Los Angeles, moving the show back from New York City where it was held [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 10)|last season]]. The international destination for the final episodes of the cycle was [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands. The promotional song was "[[When I Grow Up (Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up]]" by the [[Pussycat Dolls]].

The winner was 19-year-old [[McKey Sullivan]] from [[Lake Forest, Illinois]].

==Season summary==

Starting from this cycle, the contestant called first in judging every week would have her picture (or commercial) displayed as digital art in the models' house for the rest of the week. The CoverGirl of the Week contest was replaced by a new segment called Top Models in Action, focusing on former alums post-show careers.

The show featured fourteen contestants, similar to cycles [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 3)|3]], [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 4)|4]] and [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 10)|10]]. The winner of this cycle, similar to the past four cycles, won management and representation by [[Elite Model Management]], a $100,000 contract with [[CoverGirl]] cosmetics (including a billboard in Time Square and ads in Walmart&lt;ref&gt;Cycle 11 episode 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt;), and the cover and six-page fashion spread in ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]''. This season averaged 4.43&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=051909_05 |title=ABC Medianet |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131044226/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=051909_05 |archivedate=January 31, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cycle included a first for the series – having a [[transwoman|transgender]] contestant named [[Isis King]] participate and qualify for the final fourteen. The inclusion has been noted as an "unprecedented opportunity" by [[Neil Giuliano]], president of [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]], a national [[LGBT]] media advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/transgender-contestant-to-compete-on-antm |title=EXCLUSIVE: Transgender Contestant to Compete on Top Model |work=[[Us Weekly]] |date=August 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822151741/http://www.usmagazine.com/transgender-contestant-to-compete-on-antm |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anarky''''' was a short-lived [[American comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]], as a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]  between May and August of [[1997 in comics|1997]], and as an [[ongoing series]] between May and December of [[1999 in comics|1999]]. It was written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], with pencils by [[Norm Breyfogle]], and inks by [[Josef Rubinstein]]. The comic was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] title derived from the ''[[Batman]]'' franchise, and followed the adventures of [[Anarky]], an antagonist of the Batman character.

Although Anarky had originally been created to reflect the philosophy of [[anarchism]], the primary influence on both volumes was Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by [[Frank R. Wallace]]. The comic was overtly political in nature, exploring a number of themes including [[antimilitarism]], [[homelessness]], and [[political corruption]].

==Publication history==
{{See also|Publication history of Anarky}}

===''Anarky'' vol. 1===
Following the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle was unemployed and looking for work. As a result of a request Breyfogle made to DC for employment, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at DC Comics, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, written by Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon.&lt;ref name="Catching up with Norm"/&gt;

The four-issue limited series, ''Anarky'', was published in May 1997. Entitled "Metamorphosis", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of [[Frank R. Wallace|Neo-Tech]], an offshoot of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name="zon-power-comic-book" /&gt;

During the climax of the "Anarky" storyline of ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #41-42, it is implied that Anarky dies in a large explosion.&lt;ref name="Anarkist manifesto"/&gt; In turn, the ''Anarky'' limited series resolved this event by revealing that Anarky survives, but chooses to shed the encumbrance of his double life by faking his death.&lt;ref name="Anarky vol. one #one" /&gt; Anarky works in seclusion to further his goal of achieving a [[utopia]]n society, briefly hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. He has several further brushes with Batman, as well as the likes of [[Etrigan]] and [[Darkseid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | date = May 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }};&lt;br&gt; {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part 2: Revolution Number 9 | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | date = June 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }};&lt;br&gt; {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | date = July 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }};&lt;br&gt; {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 4: Fanfare for the Common Man | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 4 | date = August 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his "career highlights".&lt;ref name="why" /&gt;

===''Anarky'' vol. 2===
With the success of the first ''Anarky'' series, Darren Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment.&lt;ref name="Catching up with Norm" /&gt; Grant's primary concerns centered on his belief that Anarky's role as a non-superpowered teenager was not capable of competing for reader attention when DC Comics already had a similar series in ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]''.&lt;ref name="LoboBrazil"/&gt; Further, while potential disagreements with editors over story elements were not among his initial concerns, he eventually found himself constantly at odds with editors and editorial assistants throughout the creation of the series.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt;

During the ''Anarky'' series, much of the character's development was influenced by the nature of Grant and Breyfogle's association. As part of the story writing process, the duo would engage in philosophical discussion carried out entirely over [[Fax|fax-transmissions]]. These long, in-depth, and occasionally heated debates influenced plot points, as well as the general direction of Anarky's character development.&lt;ref name="411 mania" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breyfogle"/&gt;

Scheduled for a release date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999,&lt;ref name="Comics International"/&gt; to coincide with the creation of a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'', to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, ''Batman: Anarky'' was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K bug]] he discussed with Breyfogle.&lt;ref name="State of Anarky"/&gt; Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or "tone down" the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line,&lt;ref name="Graphic Novel Reporter"/&gt; and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt; This was achieved by explaining that following an [[Batman: Cataclysm|earthquake in Gotham]] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city.  As one of many refugees who escapes from [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]], he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the [[Washington Monument]].&lt;ref name = "Anarky vol. two #one" /&gt; Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, "Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t make sense to me at the time and it doesn’t make sense now."&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt; These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. "I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work."&lt;ref name="fouroneone"/&gt;

Grant's doubts concerning the comic's prospects eventually proved correct. The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues, however Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in Spanish speaking countries, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region.&lt;ref name="LoboBrazil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2000AD Review"/&gt; "It didn’t sit too well with American readers, who prefer the soap opera and cool costume aspects of superhero comics. But I became a minor hero in many Latin countries, like Argentina and Mexico, where readers had been subjected to tyranny and fascism and knew precisely what I was writing about."&lt;ref name="The Big Issue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigissuescotland.com/features/view/18 |title=Superheroes - made in Scotland |accessdate=2009-03-16 |last=Forrest |first=Adam |date=2009-02-12 |work=Bigissuescotland.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707235505/http://www.bigissuescotland.com/features/view/18 |archivedate=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final issue controversy===
[[File:Anarky (vol.2) -8 (December 1999) The Sins of the Father - cover.jpg|thumb|right|{{Descript-cvr|Anarky|2|8|December, 1999|}} Art by [[Norm Breyfogle]]. The [[tagline]] reads, "Your name is Anarky. One of these guys is your father. Have a nice life!"]]
Despite numerous editorial impositions, the most controversial plot point was not a mandate, but was instead a suggestion by Breyfogle, intended as a means to expand Anarky's characterization: that Anarky's biological father be revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt; Breyfogle expressed an interest using the relationship as a source for internal conflict in the character. "...I figured that because Anarky represents the epitome of reason, one of the biggest crises he could face would be to discover that his father was the exact opposite: a raving lunatic!"&lt;ref name="Graphic Novel Reporter"/&gt; Alternatively, Grant saw it as an opportunity to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise.  Grant's decision to pursue the suggestion ran into conflict with [[Dennis O'Neil]], who protested against it.
{{cquote|Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky’s father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that ... I talked him into letting me write the script anyway by saying the story would create a lot of interest and then maybe in six months time I would write the rebuttal, which proves that Anarky wasn’t the Joker’s son ... and Denny said OK but of course the monthly title got cancelled long before that point.|||Alan Grant, 2007.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt;}}
Pressing forward, Grant wrote the Anarky series with the intention of allowing the storyline to play out over time. As the first issue narrates, Anarky begins a search for his missing parents in ''Anarky'' vol.2 #1, and comes upon evidence that the Machins are not his biological parents, that his mother is insane and that his father is a "madman".  As revealed in ''Anarky'' vol.2 #8, his leads point to the possibility that his biological father is the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].  He first meets his supposed biological mother, but finds that she is clinically unstable and unable to answer his questions.  He then breaks into [[Arkham Asylum]] to confront the Joker himself, but is betrayed, as the Joker opportunistically attempts to escape from the Asylum without providing any firm answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = The Sins of the Father | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 8 | date = December 1, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the last issue of the ''Anarky'' series, this unresolved ending left open the possibility that the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] might be Anarky's actual father, and the planned "rebuttal" was never published. Further, Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that as Dennis O'Neil has retired from DC Comics, and the final editorial decision currently belongs to [[Dan DiDio]], it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt;  As of 2010, there is yet no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject, though the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC Universe timeline]] chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/Anarky/Anarky2_008.php |title=ANARKY Vol. 2 #8 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |work=The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe |quote= Greta claims that the Joker is Lonnie's father and recollects when she met him. However, as it is not 16&amp;nbsp;years since the Joker debuted in the DC Universe Lonnie's age suggests that even if the Joker is his real father the circumstances surrounding his birth had to be different from what Greta tells him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under "work-for-hire" rules, [[DC Comics]] owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.&lt;ref name="2000AD Review"/&gt;

While Grant has commented that the first volume stands among his favorite works, he did not wish to create the ongoing series. Convinced by Norm Breyfogle to continue the series, he chafed under what he felt were excessive demands made by editors for specific plot changes, such as "toning down" Anarky's philosophy and including cameos for [[Superman]], the [[The Haunted Tank|Haunted Tank]], and the [[Justice League]].

One of the earliest of these was that Grant was "made to" remove Anarky from Gotham City.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title=Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle |accessdate=2007-05-18 |last=Best |first=Daniel |date=2007-01-06 |work=Adelaide Comics and Books |publisher=ACAB Publishing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427174515/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |archivedate=2007-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved by explaining that following an [[Batman: Cataclysm|earthquake in Gotham]] Lonnie's parents disappeared, their house was destroyed, and he was threatened by Batman to leave the city.

{{quotation|...during the ([[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]) story line, when Gotham was devastated by an earthquake, for reasons which I could not make rational or logical in the story, Batman sought out Anarky and told him he had to leave the city or Batman would come down on him like two ton of concrete.

===Controversy===
The series ended in controversy when the final issue suggested that [[Anarky]] was the biological son of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Originally a suggestion by Norm Breyfogle,&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle"/&gt; the idea was advanced by Alan Grant as an attempt to solidify Anarky's role as a part of the ''Batman'' mythos.&lt;ref name="thepanel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/108672670397105.htm |title=The Panel: Do Fans REALLY Want Change? |accessdate=2007-01-24 |coauthors= Craig &amp; Lucie |date=2004-06-08 |publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was protested against by [[Dennis O'Neil]], who only allowed the publication of the story to take place after Grant negotiated a compromise.

{{cquote2|Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky’s father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that ... I talked him into letting me write the script anyway by saying the story would create a lot of interest and then maybe in six months time I would write the rebuttal, which proves that Anarky wasn’t the Joker’s son ... and Denny said OK but of course the monthly title got cancelled long before that point."&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt;}}

With the series cancellation taking place before the rebuttal could be produced, the story has been neither challenged nor confirmed for many years (as of 2008). After a period of several years in obscurity, Anarky was briefly "returned" to DC publications in 2005, when [[James Peatty]] wrote an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'' in which Anarky guest-starred. When interviewed about the story, Peaty noted the importance of Anarky's parentage on his interpretation of the character, alluding the final issue of the Anarky series.&lt;ref name="James Peatty"/&gt; Although Peaty expressed a desire to continue using Anarky in other stories, he eventually became employed by Marvel Comics, and Anarky returned to a second period of obscurity. Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that with Dennis O'Neil's retirement, and with the final editorial decision now belonging to [[Dan DiDio]], it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published.&lt;ref name="Alan Grant &amp; Norm Breyfogle" /&gt; There is currently no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject.

When asked if fans desired "change" in comic books, Alan Grant submitted: "publishers want the illusion of change, rather than change itself." He then referenced the final issue of ''Anarky'', and quoted an unnamed senior [[DC Comics]] official, who he claimed had told him, "'Anarky will never be the Joker's son. You can write the story, but someone else will write the sequel showing it just can't be.'"&lt;ref name="thepanel" /&gt;

In an overview of the issue, "The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe" notes that the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC Universe timeline]] chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years.&lt;ref name="UGDCU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/Anarky/Anarky2_008.php |title=ANARKY Vol. 2 #8 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |work=The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe |quote= Greta claims that the Joker is Lonnie's father and recollects when she met him.

==Plot synopsis==

==="Metamorphosis"===
;Volume 1, issues 1–4
The story describes that Lonnie Machin narrowly survived an explosion which faked his death in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #40 and 41 (July - August 1995). Several months later, he has begun a new plan to liberate the world of government. As Anarky, he attempts to create a device which will emit beams of light on frequencies which will trigger the human brain of all who see it. The people will then be "de-brainwashed" of all the social constraints which society has placed on the individual. Utilizing a makeshift [[teleportation]] device capable of summoning a [[boom tube]],&lt;ref&gt;The device is vaguely referred to as a "teleportation device" or inaccurately as a "boom tube" at different times during the two volumes of the series. The term "boom tube" is inaccurate as it refers to the portal opened by such devices, not the devices themselves. Further, the device is never described as being akin to a [[Mother Box]], another device in the DC universe capable of generating a boom tube.&lt;/ref&gt; he begins a quest to capture the power sources the device will need: the madness of [[Etrigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part One: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | date = May 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; the evil of [[Darkseid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part 2: Revolution Number 9 | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | date = June 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the goodness of [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | date = July 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the confrontation between Anarky and Batman, the device is damaged. Thus, when Machin activates it, it only affects himself. The vision that follows reveals what may have happened if he had succeeded, with nightmarish consequences. The conclusion of the story is that if society is to change, individuals must accept that change voluntarily. When Batman turns off the machine, Anarky awakens and promptly escapes, vowing to continue his mission, "until they all learn to choose for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 4: Fanfare for the Common Man | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 4 | date = August 1, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Volume 2, issues 1–3
Taking place during the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc, sixteen-year-old Lonnie Machin, aka Anarky, is chased from the ruins of [[Gotham City]] by [[Batman]], who refuses to face Anarky in a [[wikt:turf war|turf war]] over the city. With financial independence and technical genius, Anarky invents his new ally, '''MAX''', an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] computer, and uses his teleportation device and wealth to reestablish a secret base below the [[Washington Monument]]. He then begins a war against [[supervillain]]s and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]], while simultaneously searching for his parents, who disappeared in the aftermath of the ''[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' story arc. During research, Anarky mathematically predicts the eventual appearance of an "Aberration," an anomaly of physics that will destroy the planet, and steals a [[Green Lantern]] [[Power ring (weapon)|power ring]] to combat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

As an epiloque, '''MAX''' uncovers evidence that the Machins adopted Lonnie as an infant, and that his real father is "a madman." The mystery of the alleged father's identity becomes a recurring subplot of the series until the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

Anarky stumbles upon a black market transaction between a [[United States Senate|US senator]] and anonymous henchmen, and disrupts their meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part I | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | date = August 1, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovers that the senator was selling codes that revealed coordinates of bio-warfare factories in Iraq, and later that [[Ra's al Ghul]] was the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | date = September 1, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international terrorist's goal is to launch missiles against the factories from Israel, releasing clouds of deadly bacteria and sparking a war in the Middle East, the result of which would be a death toll in the millions. Ra's al Ghul eventually obtains the codes and launches his missiles. However, Anarky supplies him with the incorrect codes and the missiles land harmlessly over the desert. He then uses the Internet to alert the world to the plot, which results in the missile sites being discovered and destroyed by US warplanes. As an epilogue to the story, a secret meeting is held by key members of the federal government in the [[White House]]. The threat Anarky represents to the men attending is discussed, and it is decided that Mr. Staines, a mysterious figure employed by the federal government, would be charged with the task of neutralizing him. Mr. Staines suggests the use of Capital Eagle, a government employed superhuman, to defeat Anarky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | date = October 1, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tie-in]] to the ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' crossover event, Anarky encounters [[The Haunted Tank]] and teams up with its crew to defeat an army of zombies rising from [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Anarky also encounters various [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in the process.

==="The Sins of the Father"===
;Volume 2, issue 8
Taking place after the ''No Man's Land'' story arc, Lonnie Machin decides to finally confront his supposed biological parents to uncover the truth of his lineage. He first meets with his alleged biological mother, Greta Mitchell, but finds that she is mentally unbalanced, due to the side effects of [[Joker (comics)#Powers and abilities|Joker venom]] she was exposed to years earlier. In a flashback, she tells the story of how she became pregnant by the Joker, and that due to her condition she was deemed unfit for parental responsibility and that her child was taken away from her. However, Lonnie is unable to get any more information from her. As a final recourse, Anarky breaks into [[Arkham Asylum]] using his teleporter and confronts his alleged father, now revealed to be the Joker. Meanwhile, the Joker is in the midst of a prison break with other inmates, and takes advantage of the situation to steal the teleporter, and then forces Anarky to participate. Unarmed, Anarky plays along until he manages to regain the teleporter to escape, without the Joker having given him any clear answers either. Although the story presents no evidence, Anarky asserts that he personally believes the Joker is his father, and fears that someday he may become insane as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = The Sins of the Father | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 8 | date = December 1, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Batman|'''Batman''' (Bruce Wayne)]]: the vigilante protector of Gotham city, and Anarky's longstanding opponent. Batman investigates Anarky's activity, and eventually confronts the boy at a high-rise tower, foiling Anarky's plot to "save the world".

{{Big|'''Second volume cast of characters'''}}

New characters were introduced in the second volume with the intention that they would become regular cast members and receive more character development in future issues. However, due to the short run of the series, most of the original characters appeared in a limited number of scenes, with '''MAX''' being the only character to appear in every issue. Three characters – Roach, Mr. Stains, and Capital Eagle – were intended to appear in two unpublished issues.&lt;ref&gt;The information regarding the unpublished issues of ''Anarky'' can be seen in illustrations created by Norm Breyfogle, provided in the [http://www.normbreyfogle.com/gallery/anarky.asp Anarky Gallery] section of his website.

*'''MAX''': a [[supercomputer]] possessing [[artificial intelligence]], its name is an acronym standing for "'''M'''ulti-'''A'''ugmented '''X'''-Program". It is created by Anarky and is situated on-board Anarky's suit, where it functions as an assistant. Charged with scouring the internet for information regarding Anarky's lost parents, it discovers that he was adopted at a young age, and that his father is "a madman."

*'''Lieutenant Ryne''': a police officer who Anarky rescues on two occasions, he reciprocates by saving Anarky from an attack by [[Kyle Rayner]]. He is earnest in his work, fully believing in upholding the law. He first appears in ''Anarky'' vol.2 #2 (June 1999).
*'''Capital Eagle''': a government employed superhuman, he receives no character development during the brief series, but was intended to appear in later issues as an antagonist set against Anarky. In an unpublished issue of the series, he is portrayed as possessing super-human strength and durability. He first appears in ''DCU Heroes: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (February 1999).
*'''Mr. Staines''': a mysterious figure employed by the federal government, he is charged by anonymous politicians to spearhead the arrest of Anarky. He first appears in ''Anarky'' vol.2 #6, October 1999. Mr. Staines was later featured in a Batman [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''[[Batman: Dreamland]]'', by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle. The story presents Mr. Stains as an enigmatic scientist spearheading a top secret, [[black budget]], [[mind control]] program in "Dreamland" (aka [[Area 51]]). Staines is represented as an idealist who believes that society can be rid of war, crime, and chaos if the minds of individuals are controlled by authority figures.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Dreamland'' (w) Grant, Alan (co writer) Breyfogle, Norm.

While previously the character Anarky had been described as an [[anarchism|anarchist]], both volumes were instead based on the philosophy of [[Frank R. Wallace|Neo-Tech]], an offshoot of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. It is unique as the only mainstream comic book ever influenced by this philosophy.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;*[https://web.archive.org/web/19980218141349/http://gocomics.com/alangrant.htm Holy Penis Collapsor Batman!

A recurring theme in the first volume included four scenes, at one page per issue, in which Anarky expounded philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly for the reader, including explaining a [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky'' (vol.1) #1 (May 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky'' (vol.1) #2 (June 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of economic "parasites,"&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky'' (vol.1) #3 (July 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to advance.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky'' (vol.1) #4 (August 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Alan Grant explained that in the original script, these monologues were titled "''The History of Consciousness part 1 through 4''", and that Norm Breyfogle designed the illustrations so that a single quarter of a [[Anarchy a|Circle-A]] would act as a backdrop to each, which when placed together created a complete poster image.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org" /&gt; This theme was not utilized in the second volume, but story narration continued to allude to these concepts. Bicameralism and philosophy of the mind remained a topic of concern to Grant while writing the series, which Grant hoped could act as a vehicle for his thoughts on the origin of consciousness.&lt;ref name="fouroneone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |last=Cooling |first=William |date=2007-04-21 |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison between Plato and Aristotle had been used in two earlier stories which featured Anarky, although at the time the character was described as an anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;Anarky enters into monologues in which he describes the difference between Plato's concept of guardianship vs. that of Aristotle's concept of self-responsibility in ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual'' #2 (1994), ''The Tyrant'', and ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #31, ''The People's Court''.

Several of the issues contained strong anti-war messages, including issue #6. Near the conclusion of the ''War and Peace'' storyline, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the internet to hold an [[instant messaging|instant messaging session]] with the public in which he debates the need for war, arguing that money and time used on military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] crisis.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky'' (vol.2) #6 (October 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also introduced atheist leanings into the character's portrayal, coinciding with Grant's Neo-Tech philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky vol.1'' #1 (May 1997): Metamorphosis Part 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Political messages were also occasionally displayed in the backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarky vol.1'' #3 (July 1997): Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, "(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t say that I was being particularly subversive, although I was a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/breyfogle.htm Norm Breyfogle @ Adelaide Comics and Books.] (2003) Adelaidecomicsandbooks.com Accessed January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19222">'''Apex'''  radio stations (also known as '''skyscraper''' and '''pinnacle''') was the name commonly given to a short-lived group of United States [[radio broadcasting|broadcasting]] stations, which were used to evaluate transmitting on [[frequencies]] that were much higher than the ones used by standard [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[shortwave]] stations. Their name came from the tall height of their transmitter [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], which were needed because coverage was primarily limited to local line-of-sight distances. These stations were assigned to what at the time were described as "ultra-high" frequencies, between roughly 25 and 44 [[MHz]]. They employed AM transmissions, although in most cases using a wider bandwidth than standard broadcast band AM stations, in order to provide high fidelity sound with less static and distortion.

In 1937 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) formally allocated an Apex station band, consisting of 75 transmitting frequencies running from 41.02 to 43.98&amp;nbsp;MHz. These stations were never given permission to operate commercially, although they were allowed to retransmit the programming from standard AM stations. Most operated under experimental licenses, however this band was the first to include a formal "non-commercial educational" station classification. The FCC eventually decided there was no need for a second AM broadcast band, so the Apex station assignments were eliminated effective January 1, 1941. With this change, a few of the original Apex stations were converted into some of the earliest [[frequency modulation|FM]] stations. 

==Initial development==

Through the 1920s and 1930s, radio engineers and government regulators were slowly determining the transmission characteristics of various frequencies being evaluated for use by radio stations. In the United States, by 1930 the original AM broadcasting band consisted of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz, with a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between adjacent assignments. On this band, a station's coverage during the daytime consisted exclusively of its [[groundwave]] signal, which for the most powerful stations might exceed 200 miles (320 kilometers), although it was significantly less for the average station. However, during the nighttime, changes in the [[ionosphere]] resulted in additional long distance [[skywave]] signals, that were commonly reflected for up to hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/01/radio-signals-travel-night-day/ "Why Do Radio Signals Travel Farther at Night than in the Day?"] by Dan Elder, January 27, 2015. (todayifoundout.com)&lt;/ref&gt;	

Over time, the technology was developed to transmit on progressively higher frequencies. (Although initially these were in general called "ultra-high" frequencies, [[radio spectrum]] nomenclature was later standardized, with 3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz transmissions becoming known as "High Frequency" (HF), 30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz called "Very High Frequency" (VHF), and 300 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;MHz called "Ultra High Frequency" (UHF)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jneuhaus.com/fccindex/spectrum.html Allocation of Radio Spectrum in the United States"] (jneuhaus.com)&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became apparent that there were significant differences in the propagation characteristics of various frequency ranges. Signals from [[shortwave]] stations, operating roughly in the range from 5&amp;nbsp;MHz to 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, were found to be readily reflected by the ionosphere during both the day and at night, resulting in stations that sometimes could transmit halfway around the world. 

Investigation of ever higher frequencies found that, above around 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, signal propagation by both groundwave and skywave generally became minimal, which meant that station coverage now began to be limited to just [[Line-of-sight_propagation|line-of-sight]] distances from the transmitting antenna. This was considered to be a valuable characteristic by the FCC, because it would allow the establishment of broadcasting stations with limited but consistent day and night coverage, that could only be received by their local communities. It also meant that multiple stations could operate on the same frequency throughout the country without interfering with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/horizon.html "The VHF/UHF Line of Sight Horizon"] (em.hawaii.edu)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the standard AM broadcast band was considered to be too full to allow any meaningful increase in the number of stations, the FCC began to issue licenses to parties interested in testing the suitability of higher frequencies. Most Apex stations operated under experimental licenses, and were commonly affiliated with and subsidized by a commercially licensed AM station. Until the late 1930s, commercially made radio receivers did not cover these high frequencies, so early Apex station listeners constructed their own receivers, or built converters for existing models.

On March 18, 1934, [[WTSS|W8XH]] in Buffalo, New York, a companion station to AM station [[WBEN (AM)|WBEN]], became the first Apex station to air a regular schedule.&lt;ref&gt;"Pioneering" (WBEN advertisement), ''Broadcasting'', April 1, 1936, page 29. W8XH is a direct predecessor of current Buffalo FM station [[WTSS]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these stations merely retransmitted the programs of their AM station partners, in a few cases efforts were made to provide original programming. In 1936, [[The Milwaukee Journal]]'s W9XAZ, which initially had relayed the programming of [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]], became the first Apex station to originate its own programming on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jeff560.tripod.com/fm1.html Apex Station On Its Own]", ''Broadcasting'', Jan. 1, 1937. "[http://jeff560.tripod.com/fm1.html Milwaukee Station Using Apex Band Tells of Results]", ''Broadcasting'', May 15, 1937. W9XAZ eventually became WTMJ-FM, which was deleted in 1950. Nine years later a new WTMJ-FM was licensed; it is the current day [[WKTI-FM]] at 94.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While monitoring the first group of stations, it was soon realized that, due to the strengthening of the ionosphere during periods of high solar activity, at times the lower end of the VHF frequencies would produce strong, and undesirable, skywave signals. (The December 1937 issue of ''All-Wave Radio'' reported that W6XKG in Los Angeles, transmitting on 25.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, had been heard in both Asia and Europe, while W9XAZ, 26.4&amp;nbsp;MHz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin had "a strong signal in Australia", and W8XAI, 31.6&amp;nbsp;MHz in Rochester, New York, "is another station that is often heard in Australia.")&lt;ref&gt;"Ultra-High: When to Listen - What to Listen For" by Perry Ferrell, Jr., ''All-Wave Radio'', December 1937, page 628.&lt;/ref&gt; This most commonly occurred during the summer months, and during peaks in the 11-year [[sunspot cycle]]. This determination led to the FCC moving the developing broadcasting service stations, which by now began to include experimental FM and TV stations, to higher frequencies that were less affected by solar influences.

==Apex band establishment (1937)==
In October 1937, the FCC announced a sweeping allocation of frequency assignments for the various competing services, including television, relay, and public service, which covered 10&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz. Included was a band of Apex stations, consisting of 75 channels with 40&amp;nbsp;kHz separations, and spanning from 41.02 to 43.98&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 40&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.

At the time it was estimated that there were about 50 Apex-style stations currently in operation, although transmitting on a variety of frequencies.&lt;ref name="upper"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting13unse_0#page/n749/mode/1up "Upper Bands Set Aside for Television"], ''Broadcasting'', November 1, 1937, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1938 the band's first 25 channels, from 41.02 to 41.98&amp;nbsp;MHz, were reserved for non-commercial educational stations, with the Cleveland City Board of Education's WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio the first station to begin operation within this group.&lt;ref&gt;"Listening to Learn", ''Radio Guide'', November 26, 1938, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to FM (1941)==

At the time the Apex band was established, the FCC noted that "The Commission at an early date will consider carefully the needs and requirements for high-frequency broadcast stations using both conventional [AM] modulation and frequency modulation".&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt; As of January 15, 1940, only 2 non-commercial&lt;ref&gt;"Non-Commercial Educational Broadcast Stations", ''Broadcasting Yearbook'' (1940), page 387. The two stations were WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio and WNYE in Brooklyn, New York. WBKY in Beattyville, Kentucky would become the third non-commercial educational station later in the year.&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 experimental stations held Apex band licenses, all of which were assigned operating frequencies in the bottom half of the band. (A similar number of experimental stations held grants for frequencies in the 25-26&amp;nbsp;MHz region.) In addition, at this same time 20 experimental FM stations had been assigned slots within the top half of the Apex band frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;"High Frequency Broadcasting Stations in the United States", ''Broadcasting Yearbook'' (1940), page 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's studies soon found significant advantages to FM transmissions over the Apex AM signals. Sound quality, and especially resistance to interference from static, including from lightning, was found to be far superior for FM. Although FM assignments required five times the bandwidth of Apex stations (200&amp;nbsp;kHz vs. 40&amp;nbsp;kHz), the "[[capture effect]]" allowed FM stations operating on the same frequency to be spaced closer together than Apex stations. By 1939 the FCC began encouraging Apex stations to consider changing to the technically superior FM transmissions. In 1940, the FCC decided to authorize a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50&amp;nbsp;MHz (this was later changed to 88–106&amp;nbsp;MHz, and still later to 88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz.)

This new assignment also resulted in the elimination of the Apex band, and the Apex stations were informed that they needed to either go silent or convert to FM. The last of the Apex stations to leave the air were WBOE, which shut down its Apex operation in February 1941 and converted to FM that month,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting20unse#page/n388/mode/1up "Education by FM"], ''Broadcasting'', February 10, 1941, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and WBKY, which suspended operations after June 27, 1941 due to financial reasons.&lt;ref name="wbky"/&gt; Currently, the frequencies that had been used by the Apex band are allocated for land mobile communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf "FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations"] (fcc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

There would be at least one attempt to revive the Apex band concept. Beginning in May 1946, consulting radio engineer [[Sarkes Tarzian]] operated a 200-watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz in Bloomington, Indiana. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his "HIFAM" station,&lt;ref&gt;"HiFam Radio Bans Static with Gadget" (AP), ''Williamsport (Pennsylvania) Sun-Gazette'', June 27, 1947, page 9. "HIFAM" was a contraction of "high frequency amplitude modulation".&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 he proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency broadcast band, 400&amp;nbsp;kHz wide with 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between frequency assignments. Tarzian promoted this as a low-cost alternative to expensive FM transmitters and receivers, saying that a $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios that would allow them to pick up the HIFAM stations.&lt;ref&gt;"HIFAM" by Larry Christopher, ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', May 3, 1948, pages 22, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to operate his experimental station, which eventually became KS2XAP, until 1950, although by then its transmitting hours were greatly restricted, as the FCC required the station to remain off the air whenever nearby WFBM-TV in Indianapolis was broadcasting. This was due to the fact that the TV station's audio transmitter used the same frequency as Tarzian's station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting38unse_0#page/n432/mode/1up/ "HIFAM Renewal"], ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', April 24, 1950, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after his station's final license expired on June 1, 1950 the FCC denied Tarzian any further renewals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting38unse_0#page/n923/mode/1up/search/ "HIFAM Renewal Denied By FCC"], ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', June 5, 1950, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; concluding it would not reverse its earlier determination that there was no need for a second AM broadcast band.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=October 2018}}
The film opens after school on Tiffany's 18th birthday. She and her friend Gabriella encounter Tiffany's dad Brian and brother B.J. outside the school. It seems that Brian always picks her up from school on her birthday wearing a birthday hat. Tiffany's mom, Brian's ex-wife Debrah, arrives and she and her new husband Calvin surprise Tiffany with the car she wanted (and hoped her father would give her), but she can't drive it well. She and Gabriella drive it to the frat house, where they hear that Jonathan and the others are having a Halloween party at Lake Derrick. She hopes to make it up to them for ruining the previous year's party. Jonathan invites her.

Brian finds Madea, Joe, Bam, and Hattie at his house to surprise Tiffany; she's underwhelmed. She sees her friend Leah and tells her about the party. Tiffany asks her mom if she can go to the party. She says yes to upset Brian, but he lets her go there to teach her a lesson.

Madea overhears Tiffany's conversation about the party and gets her friends to go with her to Lake Derrick to get Tiffany. Meanwhile, Tiffany rounds up Gabriella, Leah, and Anna (a girl who's stalking Horse) and they arrive at Lake Derrick in her new car. The frat boys meet up and have fun with the girls until frat boys disappear after seeing "Derrick", his brother, and his daughters.

On their way up to Lake Derrick, Joe and the ladies' argue to Madea about why she is taking them with to Lake Derrick instead of taking them home. Hattie decides to get out of the car and walk, but changes (she says "shanged") her mind.

While driving, Madea accidentally hits one of Derrick's daughters with her car when she mysteriously appears on the road; the gang argue over who will get out of the car and check on the little girl. Madea goes, and Bam and Hattie reluctantly follow. The little girl is crying. Madea says that they must go check on her, but Bam and Hattie are afraid to go check, but do so anyway. She pulls her hair and shows her face, which has scars, cuts, to everybody. The ladies run back to the car and Joe decides to drive. The little girl appears on top of the car, scaring everyone again, and Joe immediately drives away.

Back at Lake Derrick, Tiffany, Gabriella, Leah, and the remaining frat boys are at the campfire discussing the murders that happened in the area but Gabriella doesn't want to hear this and insist on leaving. They soon realize that some people from the party are missing, so Horse and Leah agree to look for them, but they actually want to get away to have sex. "Derrick" and his family chase them into the woods; running for their lives they trip and fall, giving "Derrick" a chance to grab Horse and drag him away from Leah. Leah says she'll get help but Horse is presumably "killed." Leah runs out of the forest and sees Madea and the gang waiting for the Cadillac to stop smoking so she waits with them until Bam sees a "grim reaper" standing in the middle of the road. Everyone except Madea is afraid; Madea thinks the frat boys are pranking them so she confronts him. She touches his scythe and gets a cut on her hand. She tries to touch his face, but when she just feels air she goes back to the car. The Grim Reaper follows and slashes one of the Cadillac's tires, but Joe continues to drive it anyway.

Gabriella reluctantly seeks safety in a tent with Dino, a frat brother who had been flirting with her all night, but they discover "Derrick" and his daughters outside the tent. In another tent Tiffany hooks up with Jonathan until "Derrick" tears down the tent. Tiffany, Gabriella, Jonathan, and Dino escape from the camp after Tiffany tries unsuccessfully to call her mom. Madea's group finally arrive at Lake Derrick, but the camp is empty. In the car Joe flirts with Leah until she run away after seeing Derrick's daughter at the car, and Joe makes rude comments to the little girl. While they are looking for Tiffany, Madea and Hattie go to an outhouse where Hattie relieves herself. Madea waits, but Derrick appears out of the river and she runs away. Hattie also runs away when the little girl appears and tries to grab her.

At the police station Debrah and Calvin desperately ask the sheriff to check for Tiffany at Lake Derrick but Brian shows up and tells Debrah that he will go look for her with his friend Victor, Gabriella's dad. Madea's car stops in front of a old broken-down house. Madea, Bam, and Hattie run into the house when they see the little girl who tells Joe that "Derrick" wants to talk him about the rude comments he made earlier. Joe goes to the chainsaw killer, but Joe runs away from him. Madea, Bam, and Hattie discover that Tiffany, Jonathan, Gabriella, Leah, and Dino are hiding in the house from Derrick too and think the adults are pranking them. At the window Madea, Bam, and Hattie think Joe is dead when they see "Derrick" and his brother drag him away so they try to come up with a plan to save everyone but the ladies argue until the little girl reappears, scaring everyone out of the house. Brian and Victor are waiting for them - they had been pranking them for lying and sneaking out, and for Debrah to learn to co-parent. Debrah agrees, and the people who  were "killed" are found at the police station. However, the masked chainsaw killer at the outhouse wasn't part of the prank; he is the actual Derrick. When Brian and Victor realize this, they drive away from the camp. Joe then appears and it appears that he befriended the chainsaw killer. He then asks if he can help him kill Madea and he responds yes. After the screen cuts to black, a blooper reel appears.

'''Coopetition''' or '''co-opetition''' (sometimes spelled '''"coopertition"''' &lt;ref&gt;[[Urban Dictionary]], [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Coopertition Coopertition], added 25 April 2008, accessed 20 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; or '''"co-opertition"''') is a [[neologism]] coined to describe [[cooperation|cooperative]] [[competition]]. Coopetition is a [[portmanteau]] of [[cooperation]] and [[competition]]. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been described in [[game theory]], a scientific field that received more attention with the book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' in 1944 and the works of [[John Forbes Nash]] on [[non-cooperative game]]s. Coopetition occurs both at inter-organizational or intra-organizational levels.

==Coopetition in practice==
Giovanni Battista Dagnino and Giovanna Padula's conference paper (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dagnino |first1=Giovanni Battista |last2=Padula |first2=Giovanna |title=Coopetition strategy: Towards a new kind of interfirm dynamics for value creation |url=http://ecsocman.hse.ru/data/977/644/1219/coopetition.pdf|journal=EURAM 2nd annual conference, Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship, Sweden (pp. 8-10)|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a pioneering contribution. They conceptualized that, at inter-organisational level, coopetition occurs when companies interact with partial congruence of interests. They cooperate with each other to reach a higher value creation if compared to the value created without interaction and struggle to achieve competitive advantage. Often coopetition takes place when companies that are in the same market work together in the exploration of knowledge and research of new products, at the same time that they compete for market-share of their products and in the exploitation of the knowledge created. In this case, the interactions occur simultaneously and in different levels in the value chain. This is the case in the arrangement between [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] and [[Toyota]] to share components for a new city car—simultaneously sold as the [[Peugeot 107]], the [[Toyota Aygo]], and the [[Citroën C1]], where companies save money on shared costs while remaining fiercely competitive in other areas. Several advantages can be foreseen, as cost reductions, resources complementarity and technological transfer. Some difficulties also exist, as distribution of control, equity in risk, complementary needs and trust. It is possible for more than two companies to be involved in coopetition with one another. Another possible case for coopetition is joint resource management in construction. Sadegh Asgari and his colleagues &lt;ref name="asgari1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asgari|first=Sadegh|last2=Afshar|first2=Abbas|last3=Madani|first3=Kaveh|title=Cooperative Game Theoretic Framework for Joint Resource Management in Construction|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000818|journal=Journal of Construction Engineering and Management|language=en|volume=140|issue=3|doi=10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000818}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013) present a short-term partnering case in which construction contractors form an alliance, agreeing to put all or some of their resources in a joint pool for a fixed duration of time and to allocate the group resources using a more cost-effective plan. Sadegh Asgari, Abbas Afshar and [[Kaveh Madani]]&lt;ref name="asgari1"/&gt; (2013) suggested cooperative game theory as the basis for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation among the cooperating contractors. Their study introduced a new paradigm in construction resource planning and allocation. Contractors no longer see each other as just competitors; They look for cooperation beyond their competition in order to reduce their costs. 

At the intra-organizational level, coopetition occurs between individuals or functional units within the same organization. Based on game theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loebecke|first1=C|last2=Van Fenema|first2=P|last3=Powell|first3=P|title=Coopetition and Knowledge Transfer|journal=ACM SIGMIS Database - Special issue on information systems: current issues and future changes|date=1999|volume=30|issue=2|pages=14–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social interdependence theories, some studies investigate the presence of simultaneous cooperation and competition among functional units, the antecedents of coopetition, and its impact on knowledge sharing behaviors. For example, the concept of coopetitive knowledge sharing is developed to explain mechanisms through which coopetition influences effective knowledge sharing practices in cross-functional teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi|first1=S|title=Knowledge sharing in cross‐functional teams: a coopetitive model|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=16|issue=2|pages=285–301|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13673271211218889|doi=10.1108/13673271211218889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying argument is that while organizational teams need to cooperate, they are likely to experience tension caused by diverse professional philosophies and competing goals from different cross-functional representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi|first1=Shahla|last2=D'Ambra|first2=John|title=Coopetitive knowledge sharing: An analytical review of literature|journal=The Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=9|issue=4|pages=307–317|url=http://www.ejkm.com/issue/download.html?idArticle=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the word ==
The word ''coopetition'' and its variants have been re-coined several times:

* In 1913 by the [[Sealshipt Oyster System]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Terry Cherington, ''Advertising as a Business Force: A Compilation of Experience Records'', Doubleday, for the Associated advertising clubs of America, 1913, p. 144 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gk0ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=coopetition+OR+co-opetition+date:0-1930#PPA144,M1 full text at Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1937 by [[Rockwell D. Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;"Co-opetition", ''Los Angeles Times'', Nov 20, 1937, p. a4&lt;/ref&gt;
* Around 1975 by Doug Chamberlin in a class at Adrian College, responding to an instructor's request for an appropriate new word with which to refer to "conflict over how to divide up the benefits produced by cooperation."  Incorporated in 1981 college textbook Thinking About Politics:  American Government in Associational Perspective (N.Y: D. Van Nostrand, 1981), chapter 9,   p.&amp;nbsp;257.  Text is available on-line [http://www.deLespinasse.org ].
* In the decade of the 1980s, V. Frank Asaro, J.D., wrote and circulated his 314-page non-fiction work ''Between Order and Chaos is Coopetition'', aka ''Balance Between Order and Chaos'', which culminated in a letter from best-selling author Spencer Johnson, M. D., dated February 9, 1990, urging its publication. This resulted in the later publication of ''Universal Co-opetition''; ''The Tortoise Shell Game'', a novelization of co-opetition; and the non-fiction ''A Primal Wisdom'' (2014), corollary to the novel. (2d. Ed., Finalist 2015 USA Best Book Awards for nonfiction and philosophy.)
* Around 1992 by [[Raymond Noorda]] to characterize [[Novell]]'s business strategy.&lt;ref name="Fisher_1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Fisher |author-first=Lawrence M. |title=Preaching Love Thy Competitor |journal=[[New York Times]] |date=1992-03-29 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D9143EF93AA15750C0A964958260 |access-date=2018-08-04 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627203815/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/business/preaching-love-thy-competitor.html |archive-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary - Ray Noorda - Pioneer of 'co-opetition' |author-first=Marcus |author-last=Williamson |author-link=Marcus Williamson |date=2006-10-09 |journal=[[The Independent (UK)]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ray-noorda-422415.html |access-date=2018-08-04 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804102549/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ray-noorda-422415.html |archive-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, Daniel Ervin, CEO of Phoenix Fire Inc., which is an international business development agency that focuses on building business partner channels for technology companies, started using the word Coopertition to describe the approach of creating a partnership between two or more competing software vendors. This type of partnership enables vendors with nominal overlap in their solution portfolio to quickly gain more market share together than when they are operating apart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phoenixfireinc.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000, FIRST Robotics had a [[Co-Opertition FIRST|competition game]] titled Co-Opertition FIRST. In 2009, FIRST cofounder [[Dean Kamen]] received a patent titled  "Method for Creating Coopertition" (spelled as one word, with no hyphen), which involves giving FIRST Robotics teams some points scored by other teams, to encourage cooperation even as they compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamen|first=Dean|title=US Patent 7,507,169|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7507169.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7507169&amp;RS=PN/7507169|publisher=US Patent Office|date=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; US FIRST now claims a trademark on the term on its Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=36 "FIRST values"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129031350/http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=36 |date=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the mid-2000s, "coopetition" began to be used by [[Darrell Waltrip]] to describe the phenomenon of drivers cooperating at various phases of a race at "high speed" tracks such as Daytona and Talladaga where cooperative aerodynamic drafting is critical to a driver's ability to advance through the field. The ultimate goal for each driver, however, is to use the strategy to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waltrip|first=Darrell|title=For Gordon and Johnson, "coopetition" is a winning strategy.|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/For-Gordon-and-Johnson,-'coopetition'-is-a-winning-strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the examples of coopetition in practice in high technology context is the collaborative joint venture formed by Samsung Electronics and Sony formed in 2004 for the development and manufacturing of flat-screen LCD Panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Co-opetition between giants: Collaboration with competitors for technological innovation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000187|journal = Research Policy|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 650–663|volume = 40|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.respol.2011.01.009|first = Devi R.|last = Gnyawali|first2 = Byung-Jin (Robert)|last2 = Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coopetition is becoming more critical in high technology contexts because of several challenges such as shrinking product life cycles, need for heavy investments in research and development, convergence of multiple technologies, and importance of technological standards. While it is quite challenging to engage in coopetition (or cooperate with a competitor), coopetition engagements are helpful for firms to address major technological challenges, to create benefits for partnering firms, and to advance technological innovations that benefit the firms, the industry, and consumers.
* In 2009, the importance of coopetition was emphasized for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). As technological battles intensify and technologies become more complex, SMEs face numerous challenges such as rising R&amp;D costs, high  risk and uncertainty in technological development, and lack of resources to pursue large-scale innovation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Co-opetition and Technological Innovation in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Multilevel Conceptual Model|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-627X.2009.00273.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Small Business Management|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1540-627X|pages = 308–330|volume = 47|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-627X.2009.00273.x|first = Devi R.|last = Gnyawali|first2 = Byung-Jin (Robert)|last2 = Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMEs can more effectively deal with these problems if they work together by combining their own resources and expertise and develop their collective ability so that they can compete effectively with large firms and advance technologies they may not be able to advance alone.  
* In 2012 and 2013, the concept of 'Coopetitive Knowledge Sharing' was inspired by inter-organization research literature toward developing a Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing that explains (1) how coopetition should be conceptualized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi|first1=S.|title=Coopetitive relationships in cross-functional software development teams: How to model and measure?|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=2012|volume=85|issue=5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121211003190|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2011.12.027|pages=1096–1104}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) What forms coopetition (three formative constructs of outcome (goal, reward), means (task related), boundary (friendship, geographical closeness, sense of team belonging) interdependencies),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi|first1=S|title=Modeling High-Quality Knowledge Sharing in cross-functional development teams|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|date=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=138–157|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457312000775|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2012.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) How coopetition and its interrelated components interact and influence knowledge sharing behaviors in cross-functional software teams. This series of publications in the ''Journal of Systems and Software and Information Processing &amp; Management'' conceptualize and operationalize the multi-dimensional construct of cross-functional coopetition, and present an instrument for measuring this construct. Cross-functional coopetition is conceptualized with five distinct and independent constructs, three of them are related to cross-functional cooperation (task orientation, communication, interpersonal relationships), and two are associated with cross-functional competition (tangible resources and intangible resources).
* In 2013 Compassion Games International,&lt;ref&gt;[http://charterforcompassion.org/compassion-games Compassion Games International]&lt;/ref&gt; an activity of the Charter for Compassion, used "coopetition" to describe their annual games between cities about who can commit the most acts of kindness and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;http://charterforcompassion.org/node/5748&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 the Caring Citizens' Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2 Caring Citizens' Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; an Empathy Surplus Project, used "coopetition" to describe how to create "compassion primaries," where candidates for party office try to find allies in the other parties to cooperate around advancing freedom, compassion and human rights as governing principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://empathysurplus.com/compassion_primaries_invite_coopetition/?recruiter_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Descant''', [[discant]], or '''{{Lang|la|discantus}}''' can refer to several different things in [[music]], depending on the period in question; etymologically, the word means a voice (''cantus'') above or removed from others.

A descant is a form of [[medieval music]] in which one singer sang a fixed [[melody]], and others accompanied with [[Musical improvisation|improvisations]]. The word in this sense comes from the term ''{{Lang|la|discantus supra librum}}'' (descant "above the book"), and is a form of [[Gregorian chant]] in which only the melody is notated but an improvised [[polyphony]] is understood.  The ''{{Lang|la|discantus supra librum}}'' had specific rules governing the improvisation of the additional voices.

Later on, the term came to mean the [[treble voice|treble]] or [[soprano]] singer in any group of voices, or the higher [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] line in a song. Eventually, by the [[Renaissance]], descant referred generally to [[counterpoint]]. Nowadays the counterpoint meaning is the most common.

Descant can also refer to the highest pitched of a group of instruments, particularly the descant [[viol]] or [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].  Similarly, it can also be applied to the soprano [[clef]]. Descant can also refer to a high, florid melody sung by a few sopranos as a decoration for a hymn.

==Descants in hymns==
[[Hymn tune]] descants are counter-melodies, generally at a higher pitch than the main melody.

Although the [[English Hymnal]] of 1906 did not include descants, this influential hymnal, whose music editor was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], served as a source of tunes for which the earliest known hymn tune descants were published. These were in collections compiled by [[Athelstan Riley]], who wrote "The effect is thrilling; it gives the curious impression of an ethereal choir joining in the worship below; and those who hear it for the first time often turn and look up at the roof!"

Among composers of descants during 1915 to 1934 were [[Alan Gray]], [[Geoffrey Shaw (composer)|Geoffrey Shaw]], and Ralph Vaughan Williams.  Several of their descants appear in what is possibly the earliest hymnal to include descants, ''[[Songs of Praise (hymnal)|Songs of Praise]]'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1925, enlarged, 1931, reprinted 1971).

During the last quarter of the twentieth century, new editions of hymnals increased the number of included descants.  For example, the influential ''Hymnal 1940'' (Episcopal) contains no descants, whereas its successor, ''[[The Hymnal 1982]]'', contains 32.  Among other currently used hymnals, ''The Worshiping Church'' contains 29 descants; ''The Presbyterian Hymnal'', 19; ''[[The New Century Hymnal]]'', 10; ''Chalice Hymnal'', 21.  The Vocal Descant Edition for ''Worship, Third Edition'' (GIA Publications, 1994) offers 254 descants by such composers as Donald Busarow, John Ferguson, Richard Hillert, Robert Hobby, [[Hal Hopson]], [[David Hurd]], Austin Lovelace, Ronald Nelson, Sam Batt Owens, [[Robert Powell (composer)|Robert Powell]], [[Richard Proulx]], William P. Rowan, [[Carl Schalk]], Randall Sensmeier, Scott Withrow, and Michael Young.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1339">'''Documentary comedy''' is a form of [[comedy]]. The comic material used is presented in documentary style—usually, a report on a particular theme or issue—and with the same investigation and reporting methods used to gather the material.

Well-known documentary comics include [[Dave Gorman]],&lt;ref name=gormano&gt;{{cite web|title=Live|url=http://gormano.blogspot.co.uk/2008/10/live.html|publisher=gormano.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comedy&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/dave_gorman_googlewhack/|publisher=comedy.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Wallace (humourist)|Danny Wallace]], [[Tony Hawks]], [[Alex Horne]]&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why it’s time for horseback cricket to make a comeback|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7907491/Why-its-time-for-horseback-cricket-to-make-a-comeback.html|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Steel]].

'''Eliyahu Yatzpan''' ({{lang-he|אלי יצפאן}}; born June 6, 1965) is an Israeli [[television host]] and comedian, best known as the host of the [[Channel 3 (Israel)|Channel 3]] late-night [[talk show]]/[[variety show]] ''Yatzpan'' between 2001 and 2006.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yatzpan was born on June 6, 1965, in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. He is the fifth of eight children in an [[Iraq]]i-Jewish family. His father, Huji, was a tailor and his mother, Ungel, was a nanny.

While he attended the vocational school, [[Kadoorie Agricultural High School]] in the [[Lower Galilee]] in the early 1980s, he became known for his impressions and high jinks especially for coming into school dressed as [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] on random occasions. His schoolmates nicknamed him, "juha". After graduating, he was drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] first into a course for quartermasters because they didn't believe him when he said that he could sing. Luckily for him he was moved to the "mafhash" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: מפח"ש) entertainment troop (along with later to be Israeli celebrities such as [[Hanan Goldblatt]] and [[Duo Datz|Orna Datz]], then known as Orna Cohen).

===Television career===
His first television appearance was in the Israeli children's science fiction mini-series "Hatsatskanim" (1989) which was broadcast on the Israeli educational channel. he played the role of the alien "Shemesh", the technician of the rocketship.

In 1990 he appeared in the entertainment show "Motzash" (Saturday night) in [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]] helped earn Yatzpan a little bit of name recognition but when in 1992 he joined [[Yigal Shilon]]'s hidden camera show, "[[Fisfusim]]" ({{lang-he|פיספוסים}}) on [[Reshet]] [[Channel 2 (Israel)]] he exploded on screen playing many different characters, tricked many people in Israel and abroad and gained celebrity status in [[Israel]].

Between the years 1996 and 1997 Yatzpan hosted his own entertainment night show on Friday nights on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] in which he interviewed celebrity guests.  Between the years 1998 and 1999 Yatzpan's night show moved to Saturday nights and was remade to include more skits (which most of them he performed without any help from other actors).  Between the years 2001 until 2006 he hosted his own night show on [[Channel 3 (Israel)|Channel 3]] for which he received many awards.

In 2007 he started hosting his own night show on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] called "Shalom and Good Evening".

===Movie career===
In 1988, Yatzpan landed a role in the movie ''[[Fictional Marriage]]'' ({{lang-he|נישואים פיקטיביים}}), where he played Bashir, an Arab waiter. After that Yatzpan played in several films such as ''[[Ehad MiShelanu]]'' (One of Us) (1989), ''[[Max VeMorris]]'' (Max and Morris) (1994) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Chain of Command (1994 film){{!}}''Chain of Command''|2=fi|3=Chain of Command – salainen tehtävä|4=fr|5=Retour de flammes|preserve=1}} (1994)

===Theater career===
After discharge, he joined a Jewish performance tour of the United States. When he arrived back, he joined an acting group and auditioned for various acting roles at Tel-Aviv's famous [[Habima]] theatre.

In 1990, he appeared with Sefi Rivlin in the theatre show ''My wife, a choice of fine'' (אשתי, ברירת קנס). By the mid-1990s he raised an entertainment with [[Meir Suisa]] called "Suisa VeYatspan first" (סוויסה ויצפאן תחילה). In 1999 they performed in a new show called ''Suisa VeYatspan, second pulsation'' (סוויסה ויצפאן, פעימה שנייה). A year later he appeared in the children's musical ''The Siam king'' (based on the book ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (book)|Anna and the King of Siam]]''), and in 2004 he played in the children's musical ''[[Aladdin]]''. In 2007, Yatzpan played in the children's musical based on [[Jules Verne]]'s book ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]''.

===Family life===
Yatzpan met his wife Galit when she was in the kindergarten of Ruth Suissa, the wife of the actor Meir Suissa. At their wedding [[Shimon Peres]] was their guest of honor. Yatzpan has three children, Ido, Noa and Neta. Yatzpan lives in [[Ramat HaSharon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11947">'''Ernst Walter Ruhmer''' (April 15, 1878—April 8, 1913) was a German physicist. He was best known for investigating practical applications making use of the light-sensitivity properties of [[selenium]], which he employed in developing wireless telephony using line-of-sight optical transmissions, sound-on-film audio recording, and television transmissions over wires.

==Career==
Ruhmer's father was an inventor and manufacturer. From 1897 to 1900 he studied mathematics and natural sciences in Berlin, and the next year continued his studies in Giessen. His early work included extensive research in developing selenium cells that were more sensitive, and faster reacting, to the effects of light illumination. In December 1902 he and [[Salomon Kalischer]] were issued German patent 151,971 for their method of producing photographic images by exposing electrically conductive selenium-coated plates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050965324;view=1up;seq=610 "Herstellung von photographischen Bildern durch Belichtung von elektrisch leitenden, mit Selen Aberzogenen Platten"], ''Chemiker-Zeitung'' (in German), June 15, 1904, page 578.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruhmer also designed a light-sensitive control switch, using a selenium cell, which was successfully used to automatically turn off the flow of a buoy's illuminating gas during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t28912k17;view=1up;seq=75;size=150 "The Properties and Applications of Selenium"], ''[[Radium, and other radioactive substances|Radium and Other Radioactive Substances]]'' by William J. Hammer, April 17, 1903 lecture, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he established a private physics laboratory, located in southwest Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pNjvamt2Qg4C&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Fernsehleute im Spannungsdeld zwischen Fortschritt und Reaktion"] by Manfred Hempel (in German), included in ''Die Anfänge des Deutschen Fernsehens'', 1991, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Wireless telephony===
====Photophone====
[[File:Ernst Ruhmer, Technical World cover (1905).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ruhmer pictured listening to his "photo-electric" optical telephone system (1905)&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015057148481;view=1up;seq=13 Cover page] ''Technical World'', March 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ruhmer first gained widespread recognition for his work on improvements to [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s optical wireless telephone, the [[photophone]]. Bell introduced this device in 1880, which used selenium cells in the receiver to convert the fluctuating light produced by the transmitting unit into sounds. But Bell's invention only had a range of a few hundred meters, and he soon ended his research into this device. Ruhmer believed that the increased sensitivity of his selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon's "speaking arc", would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances.

Ruhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the [[Havel|Havel river]] and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles),&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090837562;view=1up;seq=133 "Correspondence: Wireless Telephony"] (October 30, 1902 letter from Ernst Ruhmer), ''The Electrician'', November 7, 1902, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; with equal success during the day and at night, although the longest transmissions were dependent on having clear weather. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=73 ''Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice''] by Ernst Ruhmer, 1908, pages 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Radiotelephone====
Ruhmer also carried out research in making audio transmissions using radio signals. In 1904, he was granted, along with Adolf Pieper, German patent 173,396, "A Process for Generating Permanently Undamped Electrical Oscillations", which described a method for creating "continuous wave" transmissions using a mercury-vapor vacuum-tube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/WirelessFromMarconisBlack-boxToTheAudion/Hong_Sungook_Wireless_From_Marconis_Black-Box_to_the_Audion#page/n184/mode/1up/ ''Wireless From Marconi's Black-Box to the Audion''] by Hong Sungook, 2001, page 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 he developed a high-speed alternator which produced transmitting frequencies of up to 120,000 cycles-per-second. However, this effort never got beyond a basic prototype that generated less than .001 watt.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1908) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=152 page 134]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernst Ruhmer radiotelephone transmitter circa 1905.jpg|thumb|Ruhmer's radiotelephone transmitter, ''circa'' 1905]]
Ruhmer also investigated radiotelephone transmissions using a high-frequency spark transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Alfred N. (1918) ''Radio Telephony'', [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89078532553;view=1up;seq=60 pages 46-48]&lt;/ref&gt; This work took place during winter 1904-5, however, this approach had limited results, as he later noted that "the transmitted speech received on microphonic contact and telephone was rough and broken like that of a stammerer".&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1908) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=136;size=150 page 118]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, employing a design largely based on the [[arc converter|hydrogen arc transmitter]] developed by Denmark's [[Valdemar Poulsen]], he reported that he had constructed a transmitter capable of producing frequencies up to 300,000 cycles-per-second. Although the quality of the resulting audio transmissions were "strikingly good", and he felt that transmission range could be extended to several kilometers, these tests were only conducted over a distance of 500 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1908) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=184 pages 166-167]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhmer also investigated [[carrier current]] transmissions (then commonly known as "wired wireless"), where multiple radio signals are transmitted along an electrical conductor, which acts as a wave guide carrying the signals to designated locations. In 1911, it was reported that during a recent demonstration, "four transmissions—German, French, song and gramophone music respectively—were effected simultaneously, but the number can obviously be increased considerably without any disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048678270;view=1up;seq=150 "Ruhmer's Multiplex Telephony"], ''Technical World'', September 1911, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 Ruhmer wrote ''Drahtlose Telephonie'', which was translated by [[James Robert Erskine-Murray|James Erskine-Murray]] and published in 1908 as ''Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=7 ''Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice''] by Ernst Ruhmer (translated from the German by James Erskine-Murray), 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; This book reviewed the various technologies being investigated for wireless telephony, including both optical telephone research and the newer radiotelephone developments. Radio transmissions were soon recognized to be superior for most applications, as they were unaffected by weather, and were not limited to line-of-sight transmissions.

===Sound-on-film recording===

In 1900, as part of his optical wireless telephone research, Ruhmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip, by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change in the selenium's resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He summarized the results as: "It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound."&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1908) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=57 page 39]&lt;/ref&gt; He called this invention the [[photographophone]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951001389779w;view=1up;seq=42 "The Photographophone"] by Ernst Ruhmer, ''Scientific American'', July 20, 1901, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept would eventually be adopted for producing [[sound film|sound movies]].

===Television===

[[File:Ernst Ruhmer demonstrating simple television system (1909).jpg|thumb|right|Ruhmer demonstrating his experimental television system, which was capable of transmitting images of simple shapes over telephone lines, using a 25-element selenium cell receiver (1909)&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015031441952;view=1up;seq=489 "Another Electric Distance-Seer"], ''Literary Digest'', September 11, 1909, page 384.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ruhmer also researched using selenium cells as the picture elements for a television receiver. In late 1909 he successfully demonstrated in Belgium the transmission of simple images over a telephone wire from the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] at Brussels to the city of Liege, a distance of 115 kilometers (72 miles). This demonstration was described at the time as "the world's first working model of television apparatus".&lt;ref name="seeing"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064281592;view=1up;seq=223 "Seeing by Wire"], ''Industrial World'', January 31, 1910, pages viii-x (reprinted from the ''London Mail'').&lt;/ref&gt; However, his device consisted of only 25 cells, thus was only capable of representing simple geometric shapes. Ruhmer was confident that producing a system capable of higher definition images "was only a matter of money". However, at the cost of £15 (US$45) per selenium cell, he estimated that a 4,000 cell system would cost £60,000 (US$180,000), and a 10,000 cell mechanism capable of reproducing "a scene or event requiring the background of a landscape" would cost £150,000 (US$450,000). Because of the high cost, he didn't foresee his device as suitable for private home use, instead envisioning that central offices in major cities could be established, and customers would make arrangements to make use of the service.

Ruhmer expressed the hope that the 1910 Brussels ''[[Brussels International 1910|Exposition Universelle et Internationale]]'' would sponsor the construction of an advanced device with significantly more cells, as a showcase for the exposition. However, the estimated expense of £250,000 (US$750,000) proved to be too high.&lt;ref name="seeing"/&gt; Also, television research turned to using [[cathode ray tube]]s in receivers as a superior approach.

Ruhmer's promising career was eventually cut short. He fell ill in 1912, and died the next year at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/journalofsociety17socirich#page/644/mode/1up/ "Pioneer Experiments of Eugene Lauste in Recording Sound"] by Merritt Crawford, ''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers'', October 1931, page 644.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estrada''' ({{lang-fr|estrade}}) — originally, a kind of [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] for performances. Now this term also means a kind of scenic art of small forms of mainly popular-entertaining direction, including such directions as singing, dance, circus on stage, illusionism, colloquial genre, parody, clownery. As a kind of cultural and economic activity, the Estrada is an integral part of [[show business]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigenc.ru/theatre_and_cinema/text/4916473|title=ЭСТРАДА • Большая российская энциклопедия - электронная версия|website=Bigenc.ru|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Artists performing in the Estrada genre are called Estrada Artist or Artist of Estrada.
The Russian estrada nowadays is a diverse group of artists representing both [[Russian pop|pop-song genre]] and other genres of theatrical art. [[Alla Pugacheva]], [[Valery Leontiev]], [[Sofia Rotaru]], [[Philip Kirkorov]], [[Oleg Gazmanov]], [[Lev Leshchenko]], [[Iosif Kobzon]], [[VIA (music)|vocal and instrumental ensembles]], pop groups and rock bands represent the variety-song genre: "[[Samotsvety]]", "[[Pesnyary]]", "[[Mashina Vremeni]]" ,"[[Zemlyane]]"," [[Aria (band)|Aria]] ","[[Alisa (Russian band)|Alice]]","[[Mumiy Troll]]", "[[Zemfira]]" and many others. The spoken genre is represented by such artists as [[Gennady Khazanov]], [[Evgeny Petrosyan]], [[Efim Shifrin]], [[Victor Koklyushkin]], [[Klara Novikova]], [[Semyon Altov]], [[Lion Izmailov]], [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Zadornov|Mikhail Zadornov]], [[Pavel Volya]], [[Garik Martirosyan]], the Urals pelmeni team, etc.

From the musical-creative point of view (more specific) in Russia (the USSR) and North Korea, the term "Estrada" is also called a closed group of people whose speeches are broadcast exclusively on state TV. The so-called "state actors", that is, the performances of which are approved by the dominant party (CPSU, Juche Party). At the same time, all the rest can be strictly censored.

There are also Estrada theaters, for example, the Moscow Estrada Theater, the St. Petersburg Estrada Theater, the Kiev Estrada Theater. In such theaters, as a rule, the spoken genre predominates (for example, reprises and humoresks), as well as humorous and satirical plays and miniatures are staged.

In the press, writing about estrada performers and estrada stars, sometimes an allegorical classification is used, adding the title to the name of the estrada artist. For example, "prima donna of the Russian estrada", "king of glamor", "king of Russian chanson". Also, official honorary title, included in the system of state awards of the Russian Federation, as "[[Meritorious Artist|Honored Artist of Russia]]" or "[[People's Artist of Russia]]" can often be added.

[[File:Commerce August 2015 10 (Family Video).jpg|thumb|Family Video location in [[Commerce, Texas]]]]

'''Family Video Movie Club Inc.''' is an American [[video rental]] chain located in the United States and Canada. The family-owned company is headquartered in [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Illinois]], and has approximately 700 stores in North America with the heaviest concentration in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. In 2013, with the collapse of [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]], it became the only remaining video rental chain in the United States.

==History==
In 1946, Clarence Hoogland founded Midstates Appliance and Supply Company. His son Charles Hoogland inherited the business in 1953. The company later became a distributor for [[Magnetic Video]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.edu/pressreleases/july05pr/07_13b_05.html UIS receives $1 million gift for new recreation and fitness center]&lt;/ref&gt; After getting stuck with a large inventory of excess video movies in the late 1970s, Charles had the idea to start the Video Movie Club in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in 1978.  The club originally charged a $25 membership fee and $5 per rental and later evolved into Family Video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entmerch.org/press-room/industry-history.html A History of Home Video and Video Game Retailing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster's]] main focus was larger cities, Family Video decided to establish themselves mostly in rural areas, suburbs, and small and midsize cities instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-exec-qa-keith-hoogland-family-video-0409-biz-20170405-story.html For Family Video, renting movies is the past, present and definitely part of the future - Chicago Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Family Video relocated its headquarters from Springfield to [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview, Illinois]]. By 2013, Blockbuster closed all of its remaining stores, making Family Video the sole-surviving [[video rental]] chain in the United States.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/22/business/la-fi-blockbuster-stores-20130122 |title=Blockbuster to close about 300 stores in U.S. |date=January 22, 2013 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blockbuster"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/dish-network-close-500-blockbuster-stores-015031969.html |title=Dish Network to close 500 Blockbuster stores |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[brick and mortar]] store front, Family Video has branched off into other markets such as real estate, 24-hour fitness centers, cell phones, and cable television.&lt;ref name="TMC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2011/08/16/5707741.htm |title=Chain with Illinois roots still growing after video-rental competitors stumble |date=August 15, 2011 |publisher=TMC News |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also sells new and previously used items online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sj-r.com/carousel/x749206641/Family-Video-building-stores-while-other-chains-close The State Journal-Register]&lt;/ref&gt;  Family Video expanded into the [[Canada|Canadian]] market in 2012.&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://windsorite.ca/2012/01/opening-soon-family-video-movie-rental-store-at-tecumseh-and-hall/ |title=Opening Soon: Family Video Movie Rental Store at Tecumseh and Hall |date=January 17, 2012 |last=Wolter |first=Owen |publisher=City News |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following the continued decline of competing video rental stores, Family Video formed a partnership with [[Marco's Pizza]] providing space for the franchise in many of its stores. The company is using the partnership as a way to deliver video rentals with pizza orders. Family Video also leases space to other retailers such as hair salons and fitness centers.&lt;ref name="The State Journal-Register"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sj-r.com/top-stories/x766862973/Family-Video-president-sees-continued-growth |title=Family Video president sees continued growth |date=February 6, 2013 |last=Landis |first=Tim |publisher=GateHouse Media Inc. |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penzenstadler|first=Nick|title=Movie chain adds pizza to fight streaming wave |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/30/family-video-adds-pizza-to-fight-streaming-wave/5067095/|work=USA Today|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike much of its competition, Family Video owns the real estate housing their stores, helping them to avoid unsuccessful lease negotiations that led to the demise of Blockbuster and [[Movie Gallery]], which includes [[Hollywood Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/12/30/you-can-still-rent-movies-indy-family-videos-ceo-explains-why-wont-change/77475656/|title=Video stores still 'alive and well' in Indy|last=Briggs|first=James|date=January 15, 2016|work=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And rather than depending on the revenue-sharing model used by others in the business, the chain buys and owns their movies, allowing them to keep all the rental profit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omaha.com/go/how-family-video-stays-afloat-when-bigger-chains-didn-t/article_1074e6ec-04c8-5540-8495-9af925fbb0f5.html How Family Video stays afloat when bigger chains didn’t]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it owns a fiber-optic network in the Central [[Illinois]] region, called ''iTV-3'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodside|first1=Nathan|title=Provider Spotlight: iTV-3 Expanding Fiber to the Home Service in Central Illinois|url=http://www.broadbandillinois.org/news/306}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a small chain of fitness centers named ''StayFit-24''.

A '''guitar technician''' (or 'guitar tech') is a member of a music ensemble's [[road crew]] who maintains and sets up the musical equipment for one or more [[guitarist]]s. Depending on the type and size of band, the guitar tech may be responsible for stringing, tuning, and adjusting [[electric guitar]]s and [[acoustic guitar]]s, and maintaining and setting up [[guitar amplifier]]s and other related electronic equipment such as [[effect pedal]]s.

Once the guitar equipment has been set up onstage, the guitar tech does a soundcheck to ensure that the equipment is working well. If there are any problems, the guitar tech replaces or repairs the faulty components or equipment. Since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have basic guitar-playing skills, a musical "ear" for tuning, and a familiarity with the way guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals are supposed to sound in the style of music of their band.  

Guitar techs learn their craft either "on the job", by working in a range of music, sound engineering, and instrument repair jobs; by completing a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school; or from a combination of these two routes. The salaries and conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely, depending on whether a guitar tech is working for a minor or regional touring bar band or a major international touring act.

==Duties==
===Setting up and soundchecking===
[[Image:Billy-corgan-guitar-rig.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photo of [[Billy Corgan]]'s guitar rig taken by his guitar tech during one of the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' live shows during their 200? tour.]]

The duties of a guitar technician depend on the type of band they are working for, and on a range of other factors such as the size and nature of the stage show and the length of the show. Guitar technicians who work for an acoustic band, such as a folk group or [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] ensemble may be responsible for setting up and stringing, and tuning a range of stringed, fretted instruments including acoustic guitars, [[dobro]]s, and mandolins. A guitar tech for a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, on the other hand, may focus mainly on electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. A guitar tech may change the sequence of effects pedals or alter the settings on effects pedals during the show, to assist the guitarist in creating different tone colours or sounds. For example, a guitarist may ask the guitar tech to connect a [[chorus effect]] and [[reverb]] before a [[guitar solo]]. In an [[indie rock]] band, a guitar technician would likely configure the equipment to evoke through [[Musical tone|tone]] a modern yet historically evocative sound. In an acid rock band, a guitar tech might have to manipulate the controls on a [[ring modulator]] or a rotating [[Leslie speaker]] cabinet to create unusual sounds while the guitarist is performing.
[[Image:Trent Wagler Chris Howdyshell tune.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Acoustic guitars being tuned up backstage before a concert; note the tiny electronic tuner clipped to the headstock of the guitar on the left.]]

Once the guitars have been tuned with an [[electronic tuner]] and strummed to ensure that they are in tune, the guitar tech usually sets up the different guitars on guitar racks, ensures that the leather or nylon straps are properly connected, and that the patch cords are plugged in properly. During the show, the guitar tech hands instruments to the guitarist or guitarists according to the types of guitar that are required in the songs that they are playing. For example, a hard rock guitarist may use a "flying-V" guitar for a fast song, and then switch to an acoustic 12-string guitar for a soft ballad. The guitar tech retunes all of the instruments before they are used, because even if an instrument was perfectly in tune during the soundcheck, the heat from stage lights and the humidity from the stage conditions may render the instrument slightly out of tune. 

After each guitar is used, the guitar tech cleans the strings with a cloth and replaces the instrument on a rack. During the show, the tech stands ready to replace any guitars in case a string breaks or if there is an equipment malfunction. The guitar tech may hand fresh towels to the guitarist so that the guitarist can remove sweat from the hands and ensure that the guitarist has ready access to bottles of cool water or other wet [[beer|beverages]]&lt;!--Technically, this could be called an easter egg...but it is on the grey zone, because Beer is a beverage...also, it is fun...who said we can't have a little bit o' fun!  --&gt;. If a guitar technician is working for a guitarist who uses [[plectrum|pick]]s, the guitar tech may lay out a variety of picks on a guitar amplifier or tape the picks to the mic stands with double-sided tape, so that they are within easy reach. At the end of the show, the guitar tech disconnects all of the patch cords, cleans the instruments and puts them back into their cases.

===Maintenance and repair===
The guitar tech also might perform any of a variety of maintenance tasks, such as checking that the string height of the guitars is set properly, modifying ("dressing") the height and arc of the frets, adjusting [[Intonation (music)|the intonation of the instruments]], checking that tubes (valves) on [[tube amplifier]]s are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. Techs also check the batteries on "outboard" devices — effects boxes, tuners, and pre-amps — and wireless transmitters, and change them as necessary. Depending on the size of a band's road crew, the guitar tech may either do this maintenance him- or herself, or, in a large touring act, delegate tasks to more-junior personnel.

The guitar tech does a basic soundcheck with the different guitars, amplifiers, and effects, to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with [[patch cord]]s) are plugged in correctly. This may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier or plugging an acoustic guitar into a [[DI box]] and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a tech may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals.  

When all of the instruments and equipment are set up and [[soundcheck]]ed, if there are problems — crackles, hum, no signal from the guitar, no sound from an amplifier — the tech may have responsibility for [[troubleshooting]] to determine the cause or causes. Common problems include damaged patch cords, [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] in connection between instruments and amplifiers, weak batteries in effects boxes or on-board preamps, bad vacuum tubes in tube amplifiers or overdrive effects, broken electrical connectors or solder joints, speaker voice coils damaged from the previous concert, or equipment damaged during transport. Tuning problems may come from old or dirty strings, damaged or worn machine heads or frets, or mis-adjusted bridges.

A guitar tech is often a "jack of all trades," expected to make simple repairs: resolder a loose wiring connection inside a guitar, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, reglue a loose part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a [[truss rod]]. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is may be responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up an item, the tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.

On rare occasions, guitar technicians may be asked to fill in for the guitarist they are teching for.

==Conditions of work==
The conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely. Some guitar techs for small touring acts may set up guitars for all of the stringed-instrument performers—rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, and so on; they may even take on a large variety of tasks beyond guitar tech work, such as helping to set up sound equipment or soundcheck the microphones. On the other hand, guitar techs for major touring bands may be part of a large road crew team that includes amplifier technicians, guitar technicians for each guitarist (rhythm guitarist and lead guitarist), and a variety of people who set up the stage equipment. In a major touring band, a guitar tech's duties might be more narrowly circumscribed. They might only have to set up the guitars for a single performer, and there might be other staff who set up and maintain the amplifiers, effects, and guitar stands, and electronics technicians who solder and repair connections and wiring.

The salary, benefits, and accommodations of guitar techs vary widely. The first jobs that a guitar tech does may be on a volunteer basis in a garage band or amateur group, to gain experience, or alternatively the guitar tech might work in return for a small cash payment that is more of a symbolic [[honorarium]] than a real salary. In regional-level bar bands or minor touring acts, the guitar techs may be paid on a contractual basis during the weeks or months that the group is on tour, and there may not be health or dental benefits. A guitar tech working for this type of band must find other work to fill in months when the band is not on tour. On the other hand, a major touring act may hire a guitar technician as a permanent employee and provide them with a range of benefits. 

Accommodations depend on conditions set out in the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own catering crew. Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as [[Jimmy Page]] or [[Tony Iommi]] can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created.

==Training and career path==
Guitar technicians must have a broad knowledge of the musical equipment used in the types of bands they work with. At a minimum, this must consist of familiarity with setting up and tuning guitars and making simple adjustments and repairs. As well, guitar techs are often expected to set up, repair, and adjust electronic effects, tuners, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, and pedalboards. To do these tasks, guitar techs must know about a range of audio engineering and electronics concepts—such as [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], signal phase (for speakers and microphone wiring), and input voltage for pre-amps and effects. To do simple repairs on electronic gear, a guitar tech may have to know how to use a soldering iron and a [[multitester]], and how to do basic electronics troubleshooting.

As well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have a knowledge of the way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable tube clipping or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same "color" or "warmth" when chords are played through it.

To check guitar tuning, a guitar tech must be able to play major, minor, and other chords in a variety of keys. Even if the guitar has been tuned with an electronic tuner, the tuning still must be checked by ear, because the [[Equal temperament|equal tempered tuning]] of a guitar can involve compromise. Guitar tuning can be affected by fret placement and wear, the angle of bridge angle, string age, and other factors. Thus, even if an electronic tuner indicates that a guitar is 100% "in tune," it may still need minor adjustments which are made by ear. 

The training of guitar technicians varies widely. Some guitar technicians have studied music, guitar repair, amplifier maintenance, or electronics repair in college or university. On the other hand, some techs learned these skills informally on the job, or by working their way up through the ranks in a range of musical jobs, from a [[roadie]] and [[sound engineer]] to a [[sideman]] in a bar band. Guitar techs trained on the job may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for [[PA system]] rental companies.  

A typical career path for becoming a guitar technician via on the job training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician could try to get promoted to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder.

In the early part of a guitar tech's career, there might be a great deal of mobility between different types of bands and technician roles. While working for minor or regional acts, a guitar tech may be able to work for a country rock bar band and then immediately switch to being the bass tech for a hard rock [[tribute band]], because the tasks are fairly uniform. Career mobility of guitar technicians tends to become more constrained, though, when guitar techs begin to get jobs with high-status professional touring acts from specific genres. When a regional bar band looks for a guitar tech for a summer nightclub tour, there may many guitar techs who could meet the skill requirements. However, if an internationally-known 1960s-style acid rock touring act with a celebrity lead guitarist goes on a major tour, there may be only a handful of guitar techs who have the unique combination of skills for this position.&lt;ref&gt;(E.g., professional lutherie training on how to repair vintage 1960s-era guitars and effects, familiarity with repairing and maintaining 1960s-era rotating Leslie speaker cabinets—and
familiarity with what is, for many, a more obscure music genre).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bass guitar technician==
[[Bass guitar]] technicians (or "bass techs") perform the same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is a variety of electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of the two types of instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the string action (height) and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as [[slap and pop]], [[tapping]], or [[upright bass]]-style playing with the thumb. 

As with guitar techs, a bass tech also sets up the amplification equipment and effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized [[bass instrument amplifier]]s. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few "sound conditioner" effects such as a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]], [[limiter]], or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]]. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function in the same way as regular electric guitar effects, a bass tech must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. A guitar tech who is in the first stages of learning to become a bass tech may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles.

In some country, [[rockabilly]], or jazz bands, the bass tech might also be responsible for setting up, tuning, and maintaining an [[upright bass]] or [[electric upright bass]]. In some folk or acoustic bands, the bass technician may also be responsible for maintaining an [[acoustic bass guitar]], which is a larger, bass version of a standard [[acoustic guitar]]. More rarely, some bass techs might have to set up a [[bass synth]] (e.g., as used by the bassists in some alternative bands) or bass [[pedal keyboard]] such as a [[Moog Taurus]] pedal, as used by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] or [[Led Zeppelin]]. Both upright basses and acoustic bass guitars usually use piezoelectric pickups rather than magnetic pickups, and in some cases, the instruments may use condenser mics to pick up the higher range sounds. To amplify instruments with piezo transducers and condenser mics, specialized impedance-matching preamplifiers are often required. Also, since both piezoelectric transducers and microphones are more prone to unwanted feedback than magnetic pickups, the bass tech may have to set up a [[notch filter]] with a [[parametric equalizer]] to reduce the frequency that is feeding back.

'''''Hannibal''''' is an American [[psychological horror]]–[[psychological thriller|thriller]] television series developed by [[Bryan Fuller]] for [[NBC]]. The series is based on characters and elements appearing in [[Thomas Harris]]' novels ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'', with focus on the relationship between [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special investigator [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] ([[Hugh Dancy]]) and [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecter]] ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]), a [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] destined to become Graham's most cunning enemy and at the same time, the only person who can understand him.

The series received a 13-episode order for its first season and, unlike most U.S. network shows, all future seasons would feature 13 episodes.&lt;ref name="fullerew"/&gt; [[David Slade]] executive produced and directed the first episode.

==Plot==
FBI profiler [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] is recruited by [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]], the head of [[Behavioral Analysis Unit|Behavioral Sciences]], to help investigate a [[serial killer]] in [[Minnesota]]. With the investigation weighing heavily on Graham, Crawford decides to have him supervised by [[forensic psychiatrist]] [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecter]]. Initially, Lecter – who is secretly a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer – works to manipulate the FBI from within, but the bond he builds with Graham begin to threaten his longevity. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] murderers, and tries to push the boundaries of Graham's fragile sanity in order to turn him into a killer himself.

==Production==

===Development===
NBC began developing a ''Hannibal'' series in 2011 and former head of drama Katie O'Connell brought in her long-time friend [[Bryan Fuller]] (who had previously served as a writer-producer on NBC's ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'') to write a pilot script in November. NBC gave the series a financial commitment before Fuller had completed his script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/nbc-buys-hannibal-series-from-bryan-fuller-gaumont-international-television/|title=NBC Buys 'Hannibal' Series From Bryan Fuller &amp; Gaumont International Television|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=November 7, 2011|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2012, NBC bypassed the pilot stage of development by giving the series a 13-episode first season based solely on the strength of Fuller's script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/nbc-gives-series-order-to-hannibal-picks-up-notorious-drama-pilot|title=NBC Gives Straight-To-Series Order To 'Hannibal', Picks Up 'Notorious' Drama Pilot|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series went into production quickly thereafter.

[[David Slade]], who had previously directed [[Pilot (Awake)|the pilot]] for NBC's ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', directed the first episode and serves as an executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=James|last=Hibberd|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/30/twilight-hannibal|title='Twilight Saga' director to helm NBC's 'Hannibal'|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Andrés]] is the series' "culinary cannibal consultant" and advises the crew on proper procedure for preparing human flesh for consumption.&lt;ref name="ausiello"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/07/16/pushing-daisies-broadway-bryan-fuller|title=Is ''Pushing Daisies'' Bound for Broadway?|website=TVLine|date=July 16, 2012|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller discussed the limited episode order and the continuing story arc he envisions for the series. "Doing a cable model on network television gives us the opportunity not to dally in our storytelling because we have a lot of real estate to cover". Speaking specifically about the Lecter character, Fuller said, "There is a cheery disposition to our Hannibal. He's not being telegraphed as a villain. If the audience didn't know who he was, they wouldn't see him coming. What we have is [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s principle of suspense—show the audience the bomb under the table and let them sweat when it's going to go boom". He went on to call the relationship between Graham and Lecter as "really a love story", saying "As Hannibal has said [to Graham] in a couple of the movies, 'You're a lot more like me than you realize'.

Regarding the series' influences, Fuller stated: "When I sat down to the script, I was very consciously saying, 'What would [[David Lynch]] do with a Hannibal Lecter character?

On June 22, 2015, NBC cancelled the series.&lt;ref name="canceled"/&gt; Fuller initiated talks with [[Amazon Video]] and [[Netflix]] for a renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/hannibal-season-4-netflix-amazon-1201527355/|title=‘Hannibal’ Season 4?

However, the series has an exclusive streaming deal with Amazon, making finding a new distributor for the series difficult.&lt;ref name=Cast-released&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=‘Hannibal’ Releases Cast As Show Continues To Look For New Home|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/hannibal-cast-released-new-home-1201467144/|accessdate=July 4, 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 2015, it was revealed that discussions with Amazon came to an end as a result of  deadlines set by the service as a part of the deal, which Fuller felt would not allow for enough time to conceptualize and produce a new season. Meetings with Netflix were held, but largely  due to the prior deal with Amazon, they also decided to pass on the series, and Fuller confirmed the series was still being shopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patten|first=Dominic|title=No ‘Hannibal’ Home On Amazon, Bryan Fuller Says|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/hannibal-amazon-netflix-pass-1201471391/|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 6, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, when asked to elaborate, Fuller commented that Netflix could not renew the series due to Amazon having the exclusive streaming rights, and that Amazon wanted to renew the series, but wanted an immediate debut, while Fuller wanted more time to work on the scripts in advance before shooting. Fuller also stated that he and the producers are exploring the possibility of a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/hannibal-movie-comic-con-bryan-fuller-1201538523/ |title=Bryan Fuller Teases ‘Hannibal’ Movie at Comic-Con |work=Variety |first=Elizabeth |last=Wagmeister |date=July 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller stated after the finale aired that financing for a film is being looked into, as well as divulging his planned ''Silence of the Lambs'' storyline and that [[Starz]] could serve as a potential renewal due to their relationship on ''[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/qa-bryan-fuller-on-the-end-for-now-of-hannibal-the-future-of-broadcast-tv-and-his-plans-for-clarice-starling/ |title=Q&amp;A: Bryan Fuller on the End (for Now) of ‘Hannibal,’ the Future of Broadcast TV, and His Plans for Clarice Starling |publisher=Grantland |first=Alex |last=Pappademas |date=August 31, 2015 |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/hannibal-creator-i-wanted-to-be-sure-we-had-an-ending-for-the-story/ |title='Hannibal' creator: 'I wanted to be sure we had an ending for the story' |publisher=HitFix |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=August 29, 2015 |accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller reunited with Anderson to direct a ''Hannibal''-themed ad for [[PETA]], which debuted on November 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/20/hannibal-peta |title=''Hannibal'' returns: Bryan Fuller creates PETA ad with Gillian Anderson |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Mikkelsen stated his willingness to return for a potential fourth season, while also stating that everyone involved would be pleased with the run and success of the series if it does not come together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/04/hannibal-mads-mikkelsen-looks-back-on-season-3-and-ponders-whether-the-show-will-continue |title=Hannibal: Mads Mikkelsen Looks Back on Season 3 and Ponders Whether The Show Will Continue |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, De Laurentiis blamed online piracy of the series as part of the reason for cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/18/hannibal-producer-thinks-piracy-contributed-to-cancellation |title=Hannibal Producer Thinks Piracy Contributed to Cancellation |publisher=IGN |first=Matt |last=Fowler |date=March 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Mikkelsen commented on a possible revival, stating, "It all depends on Bryan. He is the key, the base, the heart. We will wait and see what happens next in his career. But we all know that we can easily pick this up in two or three years, there are breaks in the stories. We could pick it up, say, four years later. If Bryan is up for it, we will all go for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/hannibal-return-mads-mikkelsen/ |title=Mads Mikkelsen Says Hannibal Could Return in a Few Years |publisher=Screen Rant |first=Jeremy |last=Clymer |date=May 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Fuller stated, "The cast is game, I'm game, it's just a matter of finding the right time where everybody's schedules sync up, but I would love to continue to tell the story with Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen. They're such fantastic collaborators, and one of the most satisfying actor-showrunner relationships I've ever had in this industry. So I would love to continue this story." He also revealed other information dealing with rights: "Two years after the last airing of the show, we can investigate our options [...] August 2017 is when we can actually start talking about it. That's when we would have to see what the rights are for the character and for the story, and see who's interested and how we get it done. I have the story, and the cast is excited for the story, so we're ready to go if somebody wants to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/hannibal-season-4-bryan-fuller/ |title=Exclusive: Bryan Fuller Reveals Exactly When We Can Start Hoping for ‘Hannibal’s Return |publisher=Collider |first=Allison |last=Keene |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Fuller confirmed his plans for a ''Silence of the Lambs'' miniseries in an interview on the [[Blumhouse Productions]] podcast, stating, "I think the film adaptation is a perfect film, but there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in that book to explore in a television series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2016/12/19/shock-waves-episode-31-for-the-love-of-horror-with-bryan-fuller/ |title=SHOCK WAVES Episode 31: For the Love of Horror, with Bryan Fuller! |publisher=Blumhouse.com |first=Rob |last=Galluzzo |date=December 19, 2016 |accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, formal conversations on the revival had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/hannibal-season-4-renewal-bryan-fuller/ |title=Hannibal Revival ‘Conversations’ Have Now Formally Begun |publisher=Screen Rant |first=Mansoor |last=Mithaiwala |date=August 10, 2017 |accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episode order===
The series' fourth episode, "[[Oeuf (Hannibal)|Oeuf]]", which revolves around kidnapped children who have been brainwashed into murdering their own former families, was pulled from the United States broadcast schedule at the request of creator Bryan Fuller. The episode was still shown in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/04/19/nbc-pulls-episode-of-hannibal-involving-children-who-murder-other-children/178816|title=NBC Pulls Episode of 'Hannibal' About Children Who Murder Other Children|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a result of the [[Boston Marathon bombings]] as some reports have indicated, but was actually decided just hours beforehand, and was more likely due to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/nbcs-hannibal-drops-episode-involving-children-killing-children|title=NBC's 'Hannibal' Drops Episode Featuring Children Turned Killers|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller said of the decision, "With this episode, it wasn't about the graphic imagery or violence. It was the associations that came with the subject matter that I felt would inhibit the enjoyment of the overall episode. It was my own sensitivity... We want to be respectful of the social climate we're in right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/nbc-pulls-episode-4-of-hannibal-in-wake-of-newtown-boston-bombings-1200390579|title=NBC Pulls 'Hannibal' Episode in Wake of Violent Tragedies|work=Variety|last=Marechal|first=A.J.|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of a traditional broadcast, a portion of the episode was broken into a series of [[webisode]]s, which was made available through various online media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808|title=Hannibal – Web Series: Newest – Videos|work=NBC|accessdate=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428150523/http://www.nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/|archivedate=April 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete episode was later made available via iTunes and Amazon Video on April 29, 2013, and the episode appears in the order intended on the DVD and Blu-ray release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/hannibal-season-1/id621056398|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGec2r4U?url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/hannibal-season-1/id621056398|archivedate=April 30, 2013|title=Hannibal, Season 1|publisher=iTunes Store|accessdate=April 30, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was axed by [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[KSL-TV]] (Channel 5) as of April 29, 2013, after four episodes were aired, and started airing in that market on [[KUCW]], Utah's [[The CW Television Network|CW]] affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogstv/56236258-63/hannibal-ksl-violent-nbc.html.csp|title=KSL yanks violent "Hannibal" off its schedule|last=Pierce|first=Scott D.|date=April 29, 2013|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Hannibal'' caters to an intellectual audience that prefers plenty of gore in its psychological thrillers, with a polished presentation of madness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/hannibal/s01/ |title=Hannibal: Season 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 70 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, which constitutes "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/hannibal|title=Hannibal Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanne Ostrow of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' praised the series as a "... well constructed, masterfully written piece," but stated "... this level of violent imagery is not my cup of tea..." She also had high praise for the characters, stating that they are "... so compelling, however, that you may give in to the gore-fest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2013/03/26/hannibal-a-new-entree-on-nbc/13372/|title="Hannibal" a savory new entree on NBC|work=The Denver Post|last=Ostrow|first=Joanna|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Doro of ''[[Crave Online|Shock Till You Drop]]'' gave ''Hannibal'' an 8/10 and said of the series, "The stab at classy horror mostly succeeds due to excellent performances from the leads, genuine suspense and surprises, well-constructed short and long-term mysteries, and an appropriately disconcerting mood that permeates the action right from the start..." and praised Hugh Dancy in particular, saying he "... does an outstanding job of subtlety conveying how painful human interaction is for him, and despite being abrasive and unpleasant, you are always in his corner and really feel for the guy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/reviews/173075-review-hannibal|title=Review: Hannibal|work=Shock Till You Drop|last=Doro|first=Paul|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the show an A- and called it "... finely acted, visually scrumptious, and deliciously subversive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20685801,00.html|title=TV Review – Hannibal (2013)|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Jensen|first=Jeff|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said, "A prequel TV series about Hannibal Lecter has to overcome a lot of preconceptions ... But guess what?

Club]]''{{'}}s Todd VanDerWerff wrote that the series acts as a corrective to the "empty" violence on much of television and "restores the seriousness of purpose to a genre long in need of it.... ''Hannibal'' is interested in death and murder as a means to glance sidelong at some of life’s largest questions. When not functioning as a cop drama, it’s an intricately twisted serial-killer thriller, but it’s also a surprisingly deep series about psychiatry and the state of the human mind."  VanDerWerff concluded that Fuller had taken a series "that had every reason to be a cheap cash-in and has, instead, turned into one of TV’s best shows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hannibal-returns-the-fear-of-death-to-the-tv-crime,99265/|title=Hannibal returns the fear of death to the TV crime drama |work=The A.V.

Other reviews were less favorable. Glenn Garvin from ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' called it "a fast-food hash of poor planning and worse execution...", referring to the writing as "a mess of unmemorable dialogue and unworkable characterizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/04/03/3319648/nbcs-hannibal-an-unappetizing.html|title=NBC's 'Hannibal' an unappetizing fast-food hash|work=The Miami Herald|last=Garvin|first=Glenn|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was similarly critical, calling the series "rank and depressing," and concluded that it is "shocking, gruesome, and, ultimately, hollow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/2013/04/03/hannibal-creepy-and-empty/4ipunY9GTYtSblPowDvYuK/story.html|title='Hannibal' is creepy and empty|work=Boston Globe|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Peters of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called ''Hannibal'' "an engrossing, psychologically dense show that is also visually stunning... the kind of gem seldom found on network TV." He did however note that the female characters were less developed.&lt;ref name=slate_hannibal&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Mark|title=Better Than Silence|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/02/hannibal_on_nbc_is_the_best_thomas_harris_adaptation_to_date_better_than.html|work=Slate|date=February 26, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Zoller Seitz]], writing for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine heaped praise on the show, calling it "serenely unlike anything else on TV or anything that ever has been on TV."&lt;ref name=nymag_hannibal&gt;{{cite web|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|title=Seitz on Hannibal Season 2: I Can't Get This Show Out of My Head|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/tv-review-hannibal-season-2.html|work=New York|date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Sepinwall of HitFix continued his praise of the series, highlighting the performances of the lead actors.&lt;ref name=hitfix_hannibal2&gt;{{cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Review: NBC's Hannibal serves up Delicious Second (Season) Course|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-nbcs-hannibal-serves-up-delicious-second-season-course|publisher=HitFix|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' named it the best TV series of 2014, and wrote that ''Hannibal'' was "the best, most elegantly designed thrill ride on TV in 2014".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/best-tv-shows-2014-part-2-212571 |title=The best TV shows of 2014 (part 2) |work=The A.V.

The season two finale was met with universal critical acclaim. Gathering a perfect rating of 10 out of 10 on [[IGN]], reviewer Eric Goldman stated, "''Hannibal'' ended its fantastic second season with a thrilling, exciting and audacious series of events" and praised the directing by [[David Slade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/24/hannibal-mizumono-review |title=Hannibal: "Mizumono" Review |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finale also earned a perfect "A" grade by ''The A.V.

She also laid praise on the sound design of the episode by saying that "the integration of a ticking clock worked so well not just in the usual 'time is running out' way, but also a subconscious reminder of Hannibal's manipulation of Will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s225/hannibal/recaps/a573251/hannibal-season-2-finale-recap-mizumono.html#~oPAYKL9gX1XuVg |title=Hannibal season 2 finale recap: 'Mizumono' |publisher=Digital Spy |first=Emma |last=Dibdin |date=May 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' named it the best TV episode of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/special/best-of-year-2014/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Episodes-2014-1091005/1091346 |title=The Best TV Episodes of 2014 |work=TV Guide |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review concludes by stating season 3 "re-establishes ''Hannibal'' as the best horror show on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3346848/tv-review-hannibal-season-three-deliciously-different/ |title=[TV Review] ‘Hannibal’ Season Three Is Deliciously Different |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |first=Zac |last=Thompson |date=May 28, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Cabin of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave it a very positive review, with four stars, and wrote that season 3 is "even more incisively and ambitiously written than the last season, and sporting the most radically expressive imagery currently on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/hannibal-season-three |title=Hannibal: Season Three |work=Slant Magazine |first=Chris |last=Cabin |date=June 2, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Jensen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated it an "A-" and wrote, "''Hannibal'' remains the most engrossing (and gross) serial-killer drama on television, and the most beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/21/hannibal-ew-review|title=''Hannibal'': EW review |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Blackbird Interactive]] and published by [[Gearbox Software]]. The game was released on January 20, 2016,&lt;ref name="DoKannounce"&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/16/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-announced Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak Announced - IGN]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[prequel]] to the 1999 space-based real-time strategy video game ''[[Homeworld]]''.

==Development==
[[Gearbox Software]] bought the [[intellectual property]] rights to the ''Homeworld'' franchise during [[THQ]]'s bankruptcy auction in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/22/thq-auction-darksiders-red-faction-homeworld/ |title=THQ auction results: Nordic Games takes Darksiders, Red Faction; 505 Games is Drawn to Life |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=2013-04-22 |accessdate=2013-04-24 |first=Alexander |last=Sliwinski }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/community/articles/1029/homeworld-acquisition-and-plans/&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, they announced that they were [[Video game remake|remaking]] both ''Homeworld'' and ''[[Homeworld 2]]'' in [[high-definition video|high definition]], released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in February 2015 as ''Homeworld Remastered Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/25/7884107/homeworld-remastered-collection-release-date-price-steam-beta |title=Homeworld Remastered Collection launching Feb. 25 with original games, multiplayer beta |accessdate=2015-01-26 |author=Griffin McElroy |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the IP rights, Gearbox granted permission for use of the ''Homeworld'' IP to [[Blackbird Interactive]], a company formed by members of the original ''Homeworld'' development team in 2007. At the time, Blackbird was developing a ground-based RTS game entitled ''Hardware: Shipbreakers'', which was subsequently renamed ''Homeworld: Shipbreakers'' and announced as a prequel to ''Homeworld''.&lt;ref name="GBXandBBI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-09-02-gearbox-had-no-clear-path-for-homeworld-ip-invests-in-blackbirds-shipbreakers |title=Gearbox had "no clear path" for Homeworld IP |first=Mike |last=Williams |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2013-09-07 |publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2015, the game was officially announced as ''Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak''.&lt;ref name="DoKannounce"/&gt; The game also became available for pre-order on Steam on that date. Pre-orders of ''Deserts of Kharak'' also included the ''Homeworld Remastered Collection'' for free, while those who already owned the ''Homeworld Remastered Collection'' received a 20% discount for their pre-order of ''Deserts of Kharak''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/281610/ Pre-purchase Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak on Steam]&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-order also came with a free copy of the interactive Expedition Guide, a [[downloadable content|DLC]] companion application to the game, which details the history of Kharak and its society, the expedition and its purpose, technical data on the vehicles used by the Coalition and the Gaalsien, and a behind-the-scenes look at Blackbird's founding and the eventual progression from ''Hardware: Shipbreakers'' to ''Deserts of Kharak''. It became available for purchase on Steam, along with the game's soundtrack by [[Paul Ruskay]] (who also composed the soundtracks for all of the previous ''Homeworld'' games), on the day the game launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/community/articles/1461/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-expedition-guide Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak Expedition Guide - Gearbox Software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/433240/ Deserts of Kharak Expedition Guide on Steam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/436550/ Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak - Soundtrack on Steam]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2016, the Soban Fleet Pack was announced as ''Deserts of Kharak''{{'}}s first in-game DLC pack, adding Kiith Soban as a playable faction in Skirmish and Multiplayer modes. Kiith Soban is a subfaction of the Northern Coalition, but with a number of unique differences, including their own version of the Carrier, Battlecruiser, Baserunner, and Railgun vehicles. The pack is available as of 22 March 2016.&lt;ref name="Soban"&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/433241 Soban Fleet Pack on Steam]&lt;/ref&gt; A second DLC pack introduced the Khaaneph faction, clanless scavengers from Kharak's southern deserts who use salvaged Gaalsien technology. The Khaaneph fleet pack was released on 26 April 2016.&lt;ref name="Khaaneph"&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/433242/ Khaaneph Fleet Pack on Steam]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game is set on the desert planet of Kharak, the home-in-exile of the Kushan (Hiigaran) people, 106 years prior to the events of ''Homeworld''. Kharak is a dying world, the desert growing larger with each passing year, and the Kushan clans regularly wage war amongst one another. Then a satellite detects an object in the Great Banded Desert, known as the Jaraci Object, or the "primary anomaly". An expedition had been sent by the Coalition of the Northern Kiithid, a group of Kushan clans from the northern polar region of Kharak, but had disappeared in the desert four years earlier; the in-game campaign centers around a second expedition, and its chief science officer, Rachel S'jet.&lt;ref name="DoKannounce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoKGameplay"&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/13/watch-the-first-homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-gameplay Watch the First Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak Gameplay - IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel's expedition, centered around the Kiith S'jet land carrier ''Kapisi'', departs from Epsilon Base in the Kharakian desert. Shortly after the expedition departs, however, Kiith Gaalsien (a group of religious zealots exiled from mainstream Kharakian society) attack and destroy a number of Coalition bases, including Epsilon, and lay siege to the city of Tiir, the planetary capital. The Gaalsien then attack the ''Kapisi'' at a S'jet base known as the Boneyard, while the ''Kapisi'' is undergoing final outfitting for desert operations.&lt;ref name="DoKGameplay"/&gt; A masked Gaalsien commander named Khagaan declares that the Coalition's use of satellites and other space-based technology violates the law of the Great Maker, Sajuuk, and the Gaalsien declare war on the Coalition. Escaping from the Boneyard under cover of a sandstorm, the ''Kapisi'' searches for their sister ship, the Kiith Siidim carrier ''Sakala'', which also escaped its base after a Gaalsien attack.

In a region called Hell's Gate, the expedition stumbles upon the wreck of a previously launched S'jet carrier, the ''Ifriit Naabal'', the flagship of the first expedition four years earlier; Rachel's elder brother Jacob had been first officer of the carrier, which recovered an artifact from the wreckage of a space-going vessel called the ''Kalash''. The expedition moves in to salvage more artifacts from the ''Kalash'', but come under attack from superior Gaalsien forces, led by Khagaan from the carrier ''Ashoka''. Just as the expedition is about to be overrun, the ''Sakala'' and its escorts arrive with reinforcements, driving the Gaalsien forces off. The ''Sakala'' draws off the ''Ashoka'' while the ''Kapisi'' attacks the Gaalsien resource operations, but the Gaalsien carrier changes course to attack the ''Kapisi'' and its escorts. Despite the Gaalsien carrier's defenses and EMP weaponry, the Coalition forces engage and destroy the ''Ashoka''.

Approaching the edge of Gaalsien territory, the two carriers assault a Gaalsien fortress, again using the ''Sakala'' to draw off the base's defenders while the ''Kapisi'' attacks the resource operations. Accessing the Gaalsien database, Rachel discovers that her brother had survived for years in Gaalsien custody, and that the Gaalsien believe the Jaraci Object to be the mythical Khar-Toba, the "First City" and origin of Kushan civilization. The Gaalsien leader, the K'Had Sajuuk, believes he will become ruler of all Kharak if he enters the temple of Khar-Toba. Along the way, the expedition also discovers a number of shipwrecks that are largely intact in spite of their age and conditions in the desert, and Rachel theorizes that they in fact materialized inside solid rock (referencing the hyperspace abilities of vessels by the time of ''Homeworld''), having been forcibly intercepted by the power contained within the Jaraci Object site. Making their way through a narrow canyon into a region the Gaalsien call the "Dreamlands", the ''Kapisi'' and the ''Sakala'' engage and destroy two Gaalsien carriers, and fight their way to a high plateau in order to obtain critical supplies via airborne cargo landers from their leaders in Tiir.

As the K'Had Sajuuk's forces approach the primary anomaly, a weapons satellite opens fire on them from orbit; Rachel leaves to investigate the source of the signal that triggered the satellite, as the ''Kapisi'' holds its ground against enemy forces on the plateau in order to secure a runway for the landers. Just as the Coalition forces gain the upper hand, however, the Siidim forces betray them, opening fire on the S'jet cargo landers; the Siidim, long-time enemies of the Gaalsien, declare that they alone were of divine origin and would "purify" the desert, and that Khar-Toba and its secrets were theirs to claim. Rachel discovers that the signal that triggered the orbital satellite was from a Taiidan carrier, which crashed on the surface after deploying the weapon; Jacob used the transponder to trigger the satellite himself before dying of starvation and exposure. Rachel escapes the wreck with the transponder and makes a rendezvous with the ''Kapisi'', which engages and destroys the ''Sakala'' and its escort forces.

With the Siidim defeated, Rachel travels ahead of the expedition, discovering that Khar-Toba is in fact an ancient starship, surrounded by an ancient city buried in the sand. The expedition sets up a scanner network around the wreck to better direct the Taiidan weapon satellite in orbit, and face the K'Had Sajuuk, commanding a unique flagship-style carrier. The Coalition forces destroy the Gaalsien flagship in a heated battle; as his ship is consumed in the explosion, the K'Had Sajuuk warns that Kharak would be destroyed by fire from the sky (prophetically referencing the events of ''Homeworld'') as a result of the Coalition's actions. At the end, Rachel reflects that her brother had believed the salvation of their people to be found in the desert as the scene pans out from Khar-Toba towards the night sky, and the future that would await the Kushan in the century to come.

===Factions===
Unlike the previous games, which had two separate races, all of the factions in ''Deserts of Kharak'' are Kushan, but have distinct looks from one another, and also work differently. The campaign centers around the Coalition (the player's faction) and Kiith Gaalsien; two other groups, Kiith Soban and the Khaaneph, were added in [[downloadable content|DLC packs]] as playable factions (in addition to the originals) for Skirmish and Multiplayer modes.

;Coalition of the Northern Kiithid
:A loose [[Military alliance|alliance]] of clans from the northern polar regions of Kharak, based in the planetary capital of Tiir, which were responsible for Kharak's spaceflight program and the discovery of the Jaraci Object. The clans involved are based largely on what vehicle designs they provide to the expedition forces; they include S'jet (the command carrier, its production facilities, and its launched aircraft), Soban (armored attack vehicles), Naabal (heavy ordinance and Baserunners), Manaan (light attack vehicles), and Somtaaw (salvagers).&lt;ref name="DoKGuideSec7"&gt;''Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak'' Expedition Guide, Section 7.0: "Vehicle Manifest"&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition makes extensive use of wheeled and tracked vehicles, heavy armor, and deployable technologies such as portable scanners, turrets, and mines, deployed by the Baserunner vehicles. Their tactics are described by the developers as being similar to the Greek [[phalanx]] and [[Cold War]]-era vehicle tactics, both of which required total commitment to battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackbirdinteractive.com/2016/01/19/coalition-faction-overview/ Deserts of Kharak Coalition Faction Overview - Blackbird Interactive]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Kiith Gaalsien
:A renegade clan dedicated to Sajuuk, the Great Maker Whose Hand Shapes What Is. Unlike the other religious clans, the Gaalsien preached harsh punishments against those who violated Sajuuk's law. Four hundred years before the events in ''Deserts of Kharak'', the Gaalsien were declared outlaws after destroying the city of Saju-ka, killing thousands.&lt;ref name="DoKGuideSec4"&gt;''Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak'' Expedition Guide, Section 4.0: "Kharakid Social Systems"&lt;/ref&gt; Well-adapted to residing in the deep desert, the Gaalsien use hover technology for their vehicles, and rely on speed and hit-and-run tactics, resulting in their vehicles being less armored than the Coalition forces. The Gaalsien also make use of railguns and self-repairing technology, recovered from wrecks in the desert. Tactically, they are described as being similar to the [[Mongol military tactics and organization|Mongol hordes]], relying on mobility and probing for weaknesses before attacking, and the modern [[United States Armed Forces]], using advanced technology to fight an opponent without fully committing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackbirdinteractive.com/2016/01/20/gaalsien-faction/ Gaalsien Faction - Blackbird Interactive]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Kiith Soban
:A clan belonging to the Coalition, which provided most of the heavy military hardware for the expedition forces. Known as the "Grey Brotherhood", the Sobani are a [[mercenary]] kiith formed from the remnants of a clan destroyed by rivals centuries before, eventually becoming one of the most feared warrior clans on Kharak.&lt;ref name="DoKGuideSec4"/&gt; Their vehicles are nearly identical to those of the greater Coalition, with some notable exceptions - the Sobani place greater emphasis on railguns, and both their Carrier and Battlecruiser vehicles are equipped with these weapons over the standard heavy cannons.&lt;ref name="Soban"/&gt;
;Khaaneph
:A group of clanless scavengers from Kharak's southern deserts, descended from survivors of clans destroyed in the Heresy Wars between Kiith Gaalsien and Kiith Siidim, hundreds of years prior to ''Deserts of Kharak''. "Khaaneph" is the Gaalsien word for "[[atheism|godless]]"; while the Coalition clans are seen as followers of "false gods" due to their emphasis on science over religion, the Khaaneph believe in nothing at all, save for their own survival. They often raid desert settlements and supply caravans, utilizing every last scrap of resources they can muster - even [[cannibalism|consuming the corpses of the dead]].&lt;ref name="DoKGuideSec4"/&gt; They use salvaged Gaalsien technology (particularly in the use of [[hovercraft]]), combined with heavy armor plating; the Khaaneph Carrier can also provide speed boosts not only for itself, but for all vehicles in a certain radius around it. They make extensive use of siege weapons, missiles, and other explosive devices.&lt;ref name="Khaaneph"/&gt;

===Spin-off===
''Deserts of Kharak'' is a spin-off, in that it deviates from the backstory included with the original ''Homeworld'' in the form of the ''Homeworld Manual: Historical + Technical Briefing'' booklet. The latter maintains that Kiith Gaalsien self-destructed and was reduced to the status of myth centuries before the discovery of Khar-Toba&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Homeworld Manual: Historical + Technical Briefing |publisher=Sierra Entertainment |page=24 |quote=Military expeditions to track them down once and for all have always failed, and a certain mythology has grown up around them -- as if there is a nagging suspicion in the minds of modern Khiraki that the only way Kiith Gaalsien could have survived is if they really did have the grace of Sajuuk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clans had long ceased any serious military conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeworld Manual: Historical + Technical Briefing|publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=2|quote=In 810, with all factions exhausted and falling from internal anarchy, a small clan emerged from hiding from the settlement at Tiir. [~snip~] within 20 years Tiir was the new capital and the Age of Reason had begun.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"I've Got Two Legs"''' is a song by the British comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] that was composed by [[Terry Gilliam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' CD booklet. 1989 Virgin Records&lt;/ref&gt; It most prominently appears in the concert film ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'', the concert LP ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' and the album ''[[Monty Python Sings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82483 Monty Python Sings – Monty Python : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic]&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared at the 2014 reunion shows in [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] titled ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)|Monty Python Live]]''.

At the [[Hollywood Bowl]], [[Drury Lane]], and the O2 Arena the song followed the [[Argument Clinic]]. Gilliam descended from the ceiling with a mandolin to perform the song. At the O2 the mandolin did however not feature but instead Gilliam performed the song in [[easy listening]] style, snapping his fingers.

Invariably, as he tries to begin the second verse, he is shot by another character.  On ''Monty Python Sings'', the voice who introduces the song ("And now Mr Terry Gilliam will sing for you "I've Got Two Legs.") can be heard after the shooting saying "Thank you."

'''''I Can See Your Voice''''' is a television [[music]] [[game show]] that has aired on [[ABS-CBN]]. The show and its format is the Philippine version of the [[I Can See Your Voice|international mystery music game show franchise of South Korean origin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/08/20/17/soon-on-abs-cbn-ph-version-of-koreas-mystery-music-show|title=Soon on ABS-CBN: PH version of Korea's mystery music show |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=August 20, 2017 |language=en |website=news.abs-cbn.com |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="format s1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/icanseeyourvoice/Show-Updates/2017/09/13/24091317-mystery-music-game-show-i-can-see-your-voice-premieres-on-abs-cbn|title=Mystery music game show “I Can See Your Voice” premieres on ABS-CBN|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|website=entertainment.abs-cbn.com |date=September 13, 2017 |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The guest artist(s) must attempt to guess six contestants who are ''good singers'' (''SEE-ngers'') and who are ''bad singers'' (''SEE-ntunados'') without hearing them singing. They will also help with a group of panelists under the ''SING-vestigators'' (also collectively known as the ''Sing of the Crime Operatives'').

After they eliminated one to two contestants in each round, they will reveal its singing ability on the ''Stage of Truth''. The last person standing will get to sing alongside the guest artist(s).

If the winner is a ''SEE-nger'', he/she becomes an official contender of ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]'s Tawag ng Tanghalan''; an ''Eye Ward'' to be given by guest artist(s); and 25,000 pesos. If the winner is a ''SEE-ntunado'', he/she receives only 25,000 pesos.&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;

== Round and clues ==
There are six people standing on a platform referred to as ''SEE-cret songers'', with their own ''aliases'' to make them keep secret. They do not speak until the final reveal.&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;

===Visual Rounds===
;''Stop, Looks, and Listen (Season 1–)''
The guest artist(s) must look at every contestant based on its {{underline|appearance}} and {{underline|singing visual}}. They will show a muted video of each contestant's singing that reveals only 0.3 seconds of their singing voice.&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;
:▶ ''One eliminated contestant in this round will receive 5,000 pesos.''
 
===Performance Rounds===
;''The Voice is Synching (Season 1–)''
Identify the skilled vocalists who are lip-syncing to their own voice and the tone-deaf vocalists who are lip-syncing to someone else's voice that have their similar voice tone.&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;

;''Sync Zoned (Season 2, episode 3 only)''
The contestants must perform a non-lyrical part of a song such as words of expression, [[whistling]], [[screaming]], or even musical [[onomatopoeia]].
:▶ ''Two eliminated contestants in this round will receive 10,000 pesos each.''

===Evidence Rounds===
;''I Like to Prove It! Prove It! (Season 1–2, episode 1–16, 18)''
They will provide proofs of each contestant's singing ability (i.e. photo, video, certificates, etc). Skilled vocalists had their own evidences while the tone-deaf vocalists had their evidences fabricated. Guests will then have 30 seconds to discuss with the SING-vestgators before making the final decision.&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;

;''Let's Play It by Hear (Season 1, episode 86; Season 2, episode 17, 19–)''
For 30 seconds, three randomly selected panelists must hear the contestant's singing voice using its headphones first. Afterwards, he or she must ''defend'' and ''convince'' the contestant to seek their evidence. In episode 17, the guest artist may ask one question to each panelist.
:▶ ''Two eliminated contestants in the final round will receive 15,000 pesos each. The last person standing will receive 25,000 pesos and gets to sing a duet with the guest artist(s). If the contestant is a SEE-nger, he/she becomes an official contender of Tawag ng Tanghalan.''&lt;ref name="format s1" /&gt;

An '''in-joke''', also known as an '''inside joke''' or a '''private joke''', is a [[joke]] whose [[humour]] is understandable only to members of an [[ingroup]], that is, people who are ''in'' a particular social group, occupation, or other community of shared interest. It is an [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] joke that is humorous only to those who are aware of the circumstances behind it.

In-jokes may exist within a small social clique, such as a group of friends, or extend to an entire profession such as the [[film]] or [[professional wrestling]] industries, or a particular sporting field or chess team.  Ethnic or religious groups usually have their own in-jokes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/tm_headline=are-the-welsh-really-funny-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=17932085&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html Wales Online: "Are the Welsh Really Funny?", 14 October 2006.  Retrieved 6 September 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In-jokes are cryptic allusions to shared [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] that act as triggers; only those who have shared the common ground provide an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication and Group Decision Making|author=Randy Y. Hirokawa and [[Marshall Scott Poole]]|pages=96|year=1996|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=076190462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An in-joke works to build community, sometimes at the expense of outsiders. Part of the power of an in-joke is that its audience knows that there are those who do not understand the joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Rides the Beast?: Prophetic Rivalry and the Rhetoric of Crisis in the Churches of the Apocalypse|author=Paul Brooks Duff|pages=81|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019513835X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-joke can also be used as a [[subtext]], where people in the know may find humour in something not explicitly spoken. They may even apologize for doing so to a [[rookie]], directly or indirectly stating that what they were laughing at was an in-joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acting Your Dreams: Use Acting Techniques to Interpret Your Dreams|author=Ben Tousey|pages=118&amp;ndash;119|year=2003|publisher=Ben Tousey|isbn=1-4140-0542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer industry==
In the computer industry some computer programmers hide in-jokes within the code of [[software]] in the form of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]s, i.e., hidden content that can be revealed only by following a specific sequence of inputs. Easter eggs is a way for software developers to put their "signature" on the program, especially in video games, originally during times when they received little or no credit from their employer for their work.

The ''[[Jargon File]]'' is a [[glossary]] of [[Hacking (innovation)|hacker]] [[slang]], much of which is in-jokes or is based on in-jokes.

'''JetCat''' is a young female superhero who "flies like a jet, and fights like a cat", created by [[Jay Stephens]] (of [[Tutenstein]] and [[The Secret Saturdays]] fame), who first appeared in the weekly comic strip "Oddville!"beginning in 1994. The character resurfaced as the star of the 1997 Dark Horse Comics mini-series, "The Land Of Nod", which was later collected as the multiple Eisner-Award nominated 'The Land Of Nod Rockabye Book'. Jetcat next appeared in four animated shorts that aired in the third and final season of [[Nickelodeon]]'s [[KaBlam!]].,&lt;ref name=jjj&gt;{{cite book|last=Hal Erickson|title=Television cartoon shows: an illustrated encyclopedia|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co., 2005|isbn=0786422564|page=875}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was nominated for an [[Annie Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Urbz|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/the_urbz_sims_in_the_city_comics_now_available|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=GameZone|date=October 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Jetcat starred in a new comic book miniseries for Oni Press titled 'Jetcat Clubhouse',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beau Yarbrough|title=Crazy Cat: Jay Stephens' 'Post-Ironic' 'Jetcat'|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=558|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=Comic Book Resources|date=November 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to her original town of Oddville in the weekly comic strip series, 'Welcome to... Oddville!', which ran in the Toronto Star's [[Brand New Planet]] from 2003-2007. This was later collected into the complete 'Welcome to... Oddville!' book by Adhouse Books.

'''James Robinson Clitheroe''' (24 December 1921 – 6 June 1973), popularly known as Jimmy Clitheroe, was an English comic entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;JIMMY CLITHEROE Popular radio entertainer. ''[[The Times]]'' Thursday, 7 June 1973; pg. 21; Issue 58802&lt;/ref&gt; He is best remembered for his [[BBC Radio]] programme, ''[[The Clitheroe Kid]]'' (1958–72), a version of which was produced for television on the ITV network under the title ''Just Jimmy'' (1964–68).

==Early years==
He was born in [[Clitheroe]], Lancashire, England on Christmas Eve 1921 at 58 Wilkin Street, (now called Highfield Road)&lt;ref name=LT&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1405865.research_reveals_life_of_clitheroe_kid/ |title=Research reveals life of 'Clitheroe Kid' |author=Gill Johnson |date=17 May 2007 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |publisher=Newquest |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to [[Weaving|weaver]]s Emma Pye and James Robert Clitheroe, who had married in 1918. He was born at his maternal grandparents' house. Within days the family moved to [[Blacko]], near [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]],&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; living at 14 Spout Houses, a row of terrace houses below Blacko Tower. He attended the Council School up to the age of 12, when he transferred to Barrowford Board School for his final two years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpoolpostcards.co.uk/2012/10/famous-blackpool-entertainers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpoolpostcards.co.uk/2012/10/famous-blackpool-entertainers/&lt;/ref&gt;

An only child, he was named after his mother's brother, James Robinson Pye, who had been born in Clitheroe in 1894 and was killed in action in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lancs-local-resources.talis.com/engage/showrecord/1287878827167 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723141539/http://lancs-local-resources.talis.com/engage/showrecord/1287878827167 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=Lancashire Lantern community history – East Lancashire Regiment |publisher=Lancs-local-resources.talis.com |date=30 March 1917 |accessdate=4 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to newspapers in 1937 and 1938, at the age of 16 Clitheroe was 3ft 6in and a half. His father was over 6ft tall but Jimmy never grew any taller than 4ft 2in — about average for an 8 or 9 year old boy. Clitheroe's small size was caused by his [[thyroid gland]] being damaged at birth during a [[forceps]] delivery and, until later life,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; he could easily pass for an 11-year-old, which was the character he played on stage, in his early films and on radio in ''[[The Clitheroe Kid]]''.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JimmyClitheroe.co.uk |title=Jimmy Clitheroe, The Kid Himself |publisher=Jimmyclitheroe.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Career==

Jimmy Clitheroe was too small to work in the weaving sheds with his parents as he couldn't reach the looms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1405865.research_reveals_life_of_clitheroe_kid/&lt;/ref&gt; so at first he worked in a bakery in Nelson on leaving school, but before long started out on the stage, touring the [[variety show|variety theatres]] in Yorkshire and Lancashire from 1937. He was a boy accordionist and also played the [[xylophone]] and saxophone. His parents bought a
caravan so they could take him round the various towns in whose theatres he appeared.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/uk.music.folk/1VZ33u5XiG4&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first pantomime appearance in 1938, alongside the bumptious "Two Ton" [[Tessie O'Shea]]. In pantomime Jimmy was usually cast as Buttons, Tom Thumb or Wishee Washee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpoolpostcards.co.uk/2012/10/famous-blackpool-entertainers/&lt;/ref&gt; but moved into films from 1940 (thanks to a chance meeting with top of the bill stars [[Arthur Lucan]] &amp; [[Kitty McShane]]), into radio from 1954 (initially on the BBC's regional Home Service North, and subsequently on the nationwide Light Programme), and finally onto television (with ITV, produced by ABC Television in their Manchester studios) from 1963. 

He also appeared in pantomime and summer season dates and bit-part film appearances with [[Old Mother Riley]], [[George Formby]], [[Vera Lynn]], and [[Frank Randle]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

His long-running radio programme on the [[BBC]], ''[[The Clitheroe Kid]]'', which aired from May 1958 to August 1972, is still occasionally repeated on [[BBC7|BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. His catchphrase was "Don't some mothers 'ave 'em!"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Born in the 60s|last = Glynne-Jones |first=Tim |publisher=Arcturus Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-90940-978-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Jimmy Clitheroe took part in the royal command variety show and he also starred in the television series [[Holiday Hotel]].
 
[[Mollie Sugden]] (who played [[Mrs Slocombe]] in the BBC TV series ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'') played Clitheroe's mother on stage in the 1960s and in his ITV television series ''Just Jimmy'' from 1964 to 1968 (which also featured Jimmy's co-star from ''The Clitheroe Kid'', Danny Ross).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163458/fullcredits&lt;/ref&gt;

Clitheroe owned a bookmaker's shop on Springfield Road and the Fernhill Hotel at [[Preesall]], and appeared on Blackpool stages for many decades. For many years he drove a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] with blocks on the pedals so his feet could reach them. Appearing to be an underage driver, he could seldom complete a journey without coming to the attention of the police.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/tragic-end-of-blackpool-comic-genius-1-426503&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

In September 1972 the Clitheroe Kid was axed by the BBC after a 14 year run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delabole.com/acrobat/2013/Slate%20May%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 1973 Clitheroe collapsed in his hotel room in [[Plymouth]] and spent four days in hospital. 

Jimmy Clitheroe died on 6 June 1973 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills and after having seven brandies, on the day of his mother's funeral. He was found unconscious in bed by relatives and died later that same day in hospital in Blackpool. His mother had died five days before aged 84.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=Christopher |title=Born Brilliant: The Life Of Kenneth Williams |publisher=John Murray |year=2010 |isbn=1-84854-195-3 |pages=412/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BG&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/local/tragic-end-of-blackpool-comic-genius-1-426503 |title=Tragic end of Blackpool comic genius |author= |date=2 May 2008 |work=Blackpool Gazette |publisher=Johnston Publishing |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was held at [[Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool]], where for many years he was commemorated by a plaque attached to memorial tree Number 3.

==Personal life==

He never married. He lived with his mother, to whom he was very close, in a bungalow at Bispham Road, [[Blackpool]]. His father died in January 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the [[Jumanji (picture book)|1981 children's book of the same name]] by [[Chris Van Allsburg]]. The film was written by Van Allsburg, [[Greg Taylor (author)|Greg Taylor]], [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], and Jim Strain and stars [[Robin Williams]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Bradley Pierce]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], and [[David Alan Grier]].

The story centers on 12-year-old Alan Parrish, who becomes trapped in a [[supernatural]] [[board game]] while playing with his best friend Sarah Whittle in 1969. Twenty-six years later, in 1995, siblings Judy and Peter Shepherd find the game, begin playing and then unwittingly release the now-adult Alan. After tracking down Sarah, the quartet resolve to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has caused.

The film was released on December 15, 1995. Despite the film receiving generally unfavorable reviews from critics,&lt;!--Metacritic indicates it as "generally unfavorable reviews".--&gt; it was a box office success, earning $263 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $65 million and it became the [[1995 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th highest-grossing film of 1995]].

A similar film, marketed as a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Jumanji'', titled ''[[Zathura: A Space Adventure]]'', was released in 2005 and was also adapted from a Van Allsburg [[Zathura|book]] that was more directly connected to the ''Jumanji'' book.

It is part of the [[Jumanji (franchise)|''Jumanji'' franchise]] and spawned a direct sequel, ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'' (2017), as well as an [[Jumanji (TV series)|animated television series]], which aired from 1996 to 1999.

In 1869, near Brantford, [[New Hampshire]], two brothers bury a chest, hoping that no one will ever find it.

In 1969, Alan Parrish flees a gang of bullies and retreats to a shoe factory owned by his father, Sam. An employee, Carl Bentley, shows Alan a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After the bullies attack Alan and steal his bicycle, he follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. There, he finds the chest, which contains a board game called "Jumanji", and brings it home. Sam and Alan argue about Alan attending boarding school, causing Alan to plan to run away. His friend Sarah Whittle arrives to return his bicycle, and Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. Sarah reads the first message on the board and hears an eerie sound. Alan then unintentionally rolls the dice after being startled by the chiming clock; a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a 5 or 8. Alan is sucked into the game, and a swarm of [[Hammer-headed bat|bats]] chase Sarah out of the mansion.

In 1995, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents having recently died in a car accident in Canada. Soon after, Judy and Peter find Jumanji in the attic and begin playing it. Their rolls release a swarm of giant mosquitoes and a troop of monkeys. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter's next roll releases a lion and an adult Alan. Alan leaves the house, where he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy, and Peter go to the now-abandoned shoe factory, where a hermit tells Alan that after his disappearance, Sam and his wife abandoned the business and searched for Alan, until their deaths just four years ago.

Realizing they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate her, now suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] due to Alan's disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah's roll releases fast-growing [[carnivorous plant]]s, and Alan's next roll releases a big-game hunter, Van Pelt. Judy's next roll releases a stampede of various animals, and a [[pelican]] steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl, and Peter transforms into a monkey after attempting to cheat. Later, Van Pelt catches up to the others and steals the game. Peter, Sarah, and Judy follow Van Pelt to a department store, where they create booby traps to subdue Van Pelt, retrieve the game, and reunite with Alan. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. As the game releases further calamities and Van Pelt returns, Alan finally rolls a winning turn, causing everything that had happened as a result of the game to be reversed.

Alan and Sarah return to 1969 as children, but have full memories of the future events. Alan reconciles with his father and admits that he was responsible for the shoe that damaged the factory's machine to prevent Carl from getting fired, and Sam tells his son that he does not have to attend boarding school. Alan and Sarah toss the board game into a river and then share a kiss.

In an alternate 1995, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan runs the factory, Carl still works in the factory and Alan's parents are retired, but still alive. He and Sarah legitimately meet with Judy and Peter, and meet their parents Jim and Martha during a Christmas party. The Parrishes offer Jim a job and convince the Shepherds to cancel their ski trip in which they agree, and begin a friendship with them.

On a beach, two French-speaking girls hear drumbeats as Jumanji lies partially buried in the sand.

==Production==
While [[Peter Guber]] was visiting [[Boston]], he invited author [[Chris Van Allsburg]], who lives in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] his book. Van Allsburg wrote one of the screenplay's drafts, which he described as "sort of trying to imbue the story with a quality of mystery and surrealism".&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|title= Jumanji Author Getting Aboard Hollywood Express : Movies: Chris Van Allsburg says the film version of his book is like a Christmas gift.

[[Tristar Pictures]] agreed to finance the film on the condition that Robin Williams play the starring role. However, Williams turned down the role based on the first script he was given. Only after director [[Joe Johnston]] and screenwriters [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], [[Greg Taylor (author)|Greg Taylor]] and Jim Strain undertook extensive rewrites did Williams accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/jumanji-robin-williams-oral-history.html| title=Making 'Jumanji' with Robin Williams: An Oral History| author=Fretts, Bruce| publisher=The New York Times| date=2017-11-02|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston had reservations over casting Williams because of the actor's reputation for [[improvisation]], fearing that he wouldn't adhere to the script. However, Williams understood that it was "a tightly structured story" and filmed the scenes as outlined in the script, often filming duplicate scenes afterwards where he was allowed to improvise with [[Bonnie Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/jumanji-robin-williams-oral-history.html| title=Making 'Jumanji' with Robin Williams: An Oral History| author=Fretts, Bruce| publisher=The New York Times| date=2017-11-02|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting took place in various New England locales, mainly [[Keene, New Hampshire]], which represented the story's fictional town of Brantford, New Hampshire, and [[North Berwick, Maine]], where the [[Olde Woolen Mill]] stood in for the Parrish Shoe Factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/jumanji-in-keene-a-photo-retrospective/collection_661c0795-463f-5b57-9c13-714a637760a0.html| title='Jumanji' in Keene: A Photo Retrospective| publisher=Keene Sentinel| date=2014-08-22| access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbueQbBwOE| title=Jumanji Parrish Shoe Factory Film Location (North Berwick, ME)| author=Jordan McGee| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2015-05-30| access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional filming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where a mock-up of the Parrish house was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/jumanji-robin-williams-oral-history.html| title=Making 'Jumanji' with Robin Williams: An Oral History| author=Fretts, Bruce| publisher=The New York Times| date=2017-11-02|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and spin-offs==

===Zathura: A Space Adventure===
{{main|Zathura: A Space Adventure}}
''[[Zathura: A Space Adventure]]'', the [[Spiritual successor|spiritual successor]] that was marketed as being from the same continuity with varied uses of the tagline, "From the world of ''Jumanji''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ytm_r-o9BaM/TnWq-vai8cI/AAAAAAADYiM/PTMUJScRh0Y/s1600/zathura_ver3.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; was released as a feature film in 2005. Unlike the book ''[[Zathura]]'', the film makes no references to the previous film outside of the marketing statement. Both films are based on books written by [[Chris Van Allsburg]]. With the films being based on books that take place in the same series, the films vaguely make reference to that concept from the novels by having a similar concept and themes.

In July 2012, rumors emerged that a remake of the film was already in development.

===Television===
{{main|Jumanji (TV series)}}
An [[Jumanji (TV series)|animated television series]] was produced between 1996 and 1999. While it borrowed heavily from the film – incorporating various characters, locations and props, and modeling Alan's house and the board game on the way they appeared in the film – the series [[Retroactive continuity|retcons]]{{Jargon-inline|date=December 2017}} rather than using the film's storyline. In the series version, on each turn the players are given a "game clue" and then sucked into the jungle until they solve it. Alan is stuck in ''Jumanji'' because he has not seen his clue. Judy and Peter try to help him leave the game, providing their motivation during the series. Sarah is absent from the series.

===Games===
''Jumanji'' is a board game originally published by Milton Bradley in the US and MB Spiele in Germany in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1751/jumanji|title=Jumanji Board Game|website=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1751/jumanjihttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1751/jumanji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jumanji'' is a North American-exclusive game for [[Microsoft Windows]] that was released on 1996 and based on the film. It was developed by Studio Interactive and published by [[Philips|Philips Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumanji for Windows 3.x (1996)|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/win3x/jumanji|website=[[MobyGames]]|publisher=Blue Flame Labs|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains five different [[Action game|action]]-[[Arcade game|arcade]]-based [[Minigame|mini-games]] that are based on popular scenes from the film. Clips of cutscenes from the film can also be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantbomb.com/jumanji/61-24714/&lt;/ref&gt; There are five different mini-games that the player can choose from, with different rules and objectives. Animals from the film provide instructions to the player for each mini-game, except for the Treasure Maze mini-game, where the Jumanji board game spirit provides instructions instead. Notably, players cannot play the actual Jumanji board game from the film. All of these mini-games contain rounds (or levels) and when players reach a goal, that level is cleared and the player advances to a more difficult version of the mini-game. The player must try to score as many points as possible, and set the best [[high score]].

A video game based on the film was released in Europe for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/955232-jumanji/images/1115595|title=Jumanji Box Shot for PlayStation 2 - GameFAQs|website=www.gamefaqs.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[:ja:藤商事|Fujishoji]] released a [[Pachinko]] game, using clips from the film and also used 3D rendered CGI anime character designs for the game as part of the screen interaction.

==Legacy==
In 2005 ''Jumanji'' was listed 48 in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Family Films documentary just behind ''[[Dumbo]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]''  and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.

In 2011, Robin Williams recorded an audiobook for Van Allsburg's book's 30th edition to coincide its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fictiondb.com/author/chris-van-allsburg~jumanji-30th-anniversary-edition~433680~b.htm|title=Jumanji 30th Anniversary Edition|website=FictionDB|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a game board prop from the movie was auctioned on [[eBay]] and sold for US$60,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ebay.com/blogs/stories/real-rare-jumanji-game-board | title= The real, rare Jumanji game board |first =Joe |last= MacFarland |date= January 24, 2014 |work= Ebay Stories Blog | publisher= EBay |accessdate= March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date= January 25, 2014| url= http://www.ebay.com/itm/Real-Rare-JUMANJI-board-Screen-used-carry-board-w-COA-signed-by-Johnston-/251425585636? |title= Real &amp; Rare -- JUMANJI board Screen-used (carry board) w/ COA signed by Johnston| publisher= EBay |accessdate= March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kadhaprasangam''' (''lyrical narrative'' or ''story telling performance'') is a performing art of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It combines speaking, acting, and singing to present a story. There are no costumes, make-up, or settings. The main artist, ''Kaadhikan'' tells the story, act, and sings before the audience with two or three accompanying artists in the background playing the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/kerala/performing-arts/kathaprasangam.html Kathaprasangam, Story Telling In Kerala]&lt;/ref&gt; It typically is one-and-a-half to two hours long. It originated from an earlier art form ''Harikadhakalakshepam'' which used similar techniques but differed in theme and style. While Harikadhakalakshepam was based on themes from [[puranas]] and [[epic poetry|epics]], Kadhaprasangam received themes from sources largely classical and popular literature. The scripts can be original works written for the performance or adaptations of stories from epics, classical, or modern literature. [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Othello]], [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s [[Anna Karenina]], [[Kumaran Asan]]'s [[Karuna (poem)|Karuna]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]]’s Magdalana Mariyam, [[Changampuzha Krishna Pillai]]'s [[Ramanan]], [[Thirunalloor Karunakaran]]'s [[Rani (Malayalam poem)|Rani]] and [[Vayalar Ramavarma]]'s Aaayisha  were some of the literary classics thus successfully adapted for Kadhaprasangam.

Kadhaprasangam's heyday was in the second half of 20th century, attracting crowds on temple grounds in the festival season. This was brought out of the temple grounds and founded as a popular presentation viz. 'KADHAPRASANGAM' by Swami Sathyadevan. The Govt of India honoured Swami Sathyadevan with pension awarded to founders of art forms while the Swami was in Banaras in the year 1961. Its chief and later exponents were Swami Brahmavruthan,  M. P. Manmadhan, K. K. Vadhyar, P. C. Abraham, [[Kedamangalam Sadanandan]], Joseph Kaimaparamban, [[V. Sambasivan]], Kollam Babu, V. Harsha Kumar, Kallada V. V. Kutty,Paravur Sukumaran, [[V. D. Rajappan]], Vatakara V Asokan, Nadakkal AshokKumar and others. They contributed to the development of social and educational renaissance in Kerala history.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Nadakkal Ashokkumr performed kadhaprasangam in Temples, Cultural organisations, All India radio,Dooradarsan etc.. He performed Shakesper's Hamlet  and Mahabharatha stories.Some time he performed magica with kadhaprasangam in gulf countries also,

'''Kay Clark''' is a fictional character created and portrayed by [[Tracey Ullman]]. She is the character Ullman has portrayed for the longest time, spanning over four decades and three television series. The character was born out of a sketch for a guest appearance on the British television comedy and music show ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' in 1986.

==Origins==
Ullman says that Kay is based on a woman who worked at her bank in [[The Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Froelich |first=Janis D. |date=3 October 1993 |title=Versatile Tracey Ullman show she hasn't lost her knack in skits |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/130401778 |work=[[The Des Moines Register]] |access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Basically, she's forty-three, has never been touched by a man and never will be. There's always one like her in every office who sells sanitary napkins and stamps, with her nice polyester ass waddling across the room. Once, at an office party, someone got her behind the filing cabinets, and he's never lived it down. People go, 'Oh, you and Kayyy - 1982....' 'Shut up! I never did nothing with her!' I love people like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Foxy Lady |last=Zehme |first=Bill |date=August 27, 1987 |work=Rolling Stone |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[The Tracey Ullman Show|Fox show]] series, Kay works for a paper-products distribution company, a job Ullman once held. In her [[Tracey Takes On...|HBO series]], Kay was employed as a bank teller.

==Biography==
Kay is described an eternal optimist. "Musn't crumble, Kay." She has devoted herself to caring for her invalid mother. While she loves her mother, Kay has outbursts of hatred for her from time to time, though she's quick to scold herself for such behavior. 

Kay wears clothing made from [[polyester]], along with a pen on a string which hangs around her neck. She cuts her own hair using a ceramic kitchen bowl and scissors. Kay's mode of transportation is a moped; she is sometimes shown wearing a helmet.

===''The Tracey Ullman Show''===
Kay, a [[Rhode Island]] paper distribution company office worker, is the constant victim of her coworkers', and even boss', taunts and pranks. Kay takes it all in stride, though. She frequently checks in on her mother on the phone. "Hello, Mummy, it's (draws out) Kaaaay." We never see her mother on screen or hear her on the phone. We do know that she is an invalid. The cause of Mummy's injuries are revealed in the sketch "Kay Babysits":

{{quote| Once there was a little girl about your age who was told never, never to listen to the radio. Because her mother said it was the Devil’s instrument and would give her bad thoughts. And one day, she couldn’t resist, and listened to it anyway. And she heard a weather report saying that a storm was coming. Now later, her mother discovered that the radio was warm. And she asked the little if she played it. And the little girl lied. “No,” she said. Then she saw her mummy leaving the house in a summer frock. She couldn’t tell her to take an umbrella, could she? No. Because she lied. That day, her mother got caught in the storm and came down with a cold. An illness that got progressively worse overly the next thirty years until she was a completely invalid, unable to do a single bloody thing for herself. And do you know what happened to that little girl who lied? She felt so responsible that she let her mother interfere with every aspect of her life. Until that little girl dedicated her whole self of taking care of her mother.

Kay doesn't have any friends. It's revealed that she did have a boyfriend, Derrick in her youth.

===''Tracey Takes On...''===
Kay is presented as a 42-year-old Californian bank teller (and sometimes branch manager) at Van Nuys Savings and Loan. She took a work transfer from the bank she worked at in England to its American branch to take advantage of the American health care system for her mother. She lives in [[Panorama City, Los Angeles|Panorama City]]. Unlike her portrayal in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', Kay does not face the wrath of her nasty coworkers. While her Mother is not seen on screen, she is heard through a series of beeps from her bedroom. Kay's mother became an invalid after having been involved in an accident where the sidecar in which she was traveling  broke free from the motorbike Kay's father was driving. "'I didn't know the damn motorbike would part company with the sidecar, Mildred,' he shouted over his shoulder, as he sped off up Shaftesbury Avenue."&lt;ref name="tto-107"&gt;{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Kay's mother warned her: "I remember the cold, steely glint in Mother's eye as she stared up at me from her iron lung. 'Kay,' she said, 'don't ever marry. All men will try to kill you, after they've done nasty things to your downstairs areas.'"&lt;ref name="tto-107"/&gt; In the episode "Tracey Takes On... Death", Kay's father is revealed to have run off with her aunt, Marjorie. 

Kay is an avid reader of espionage fiction. In the book ''[[Tracey Takes On (book)|Tracey Takes On]]'', Kay's age is revealed to be 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; She seeks medical marijuana for Mother in the episode "Tracey Takes On... Smoking" and inadvertently becomes a recreational user herself. Work and acting as a caregiver have given Kay very little time for a social life. She has never lost her virginity. After she takes part in a prison pen-pal program, attorney Sydney Kross (Ullman) convinces her to marry an inmate in hopes of sparing him the death penalty. Kay follows through with the quickie wedding, but her marriage does not result in a stay of execution from the governor. Kay's husband is placed in a gas chamber, leaving her, as Ullman refers to her, as "the virgin widow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Kay |series=[[Tracey Takes On...]] |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series finale, "Tracey Takes On... The End of the World," Kay's mother finally dies. Kay now has her freedom - "Three hours and fourteen minutes of it!" she exclaims.

===''Tracey Ullman's Show''===
Kay is presented as a pensioner living in England with her mother who is 103. Unlike in previous shows, Mother is not an invalid. She has had many medical procedures performed, though. For the first time in the character's television history, Mother appears on-screen (played by actress Joan Linder).  Kay was shown to be a year old at the time of [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|King George VI's coronation]] in her first appearance in series one, making her nearly 80 years old. Kay and Mother live in [[New Malden]].

Ullman in 2016 on Kay in ''Tracey Ullman's Show'':

{{Quote|Kay is somebody I've done for many years, as you realize, because I did her on the original show in America and Americans used to like her. She's obviously a virgin who's lived with her mom, who's taught by her mom. There was a woman that was this character. She just broke my heart. She would always dress very plainly and have pics of cats at her desk. I remember and she did speak like that, "Hello! Good morning!" She used to work at a bank that I banked at when I was like twenty years old and she’s always killed me. She wore her little polyester pants and her pen around her neck. People have gotten the empathy behind it and the poignancy and the sadness. She's like a classic sort of character for me. And my daughter loves me being that character. She said, "That is you, Mom." I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "Part of your personality is Kay." So I decided to do her again.

And I brought in a brilliant woman to be Mother this time. You love to laugh at her; I love this woman. She's called Joan Linder and she was in the same year at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts as Joan Collins. That's what Joan Collins really should look like. [Laughs] She's great, this actress. She shows up and she says, "Would you like me to take my teeth out?" We're like, "Yes. Brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemag.com/tv-news/2016/10/28/tracey-ullman-interview-tracey-ullman-show-hbo/|title=Tracey Ullman Talks HBO’s “Tracey Ullman’s Show,” Grandma Camilla, Getting (Literally) Duded Up and More|publisher=Channel Guide Magazine|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In series two, during a flood, Kay and Mother take shelter in their attic. While looking for something to keep them warm, she discovers a postcard addressed to her from a man inviting her to the cinema. It is dated 1965.  Mother has been keeping a variety of correspondents from her for decades: a marriage proposal, acceptance of her application to a university, a job offer, and an invitation from a group of people to join them on holiday. In episode six, Kay tracks down her cousin Debbie from Australia who is doing their family tree. Kay learns that she has a large extended family. Kay has been under the impression that her only family is Mother (and Mother is keen on keeping it that way). Kay, overjoyed at the news that she has a family and the invitation from Debbie to come to Australia and meet them all, Mother (worried, and obviously lying) blurts out that Kay's father was not really her father. Her real father was a sailor. Kay is heartbroken.

{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}
'''''Kouji''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:口技|口技]]}}), which can be translated literally as "mouth skill" or "skill of mouth" is a Chinese vocal [[mimicry]] performance art which utilizes the [[larynx|human speech organs]] to mimic the sounds of everyday life.  When this vocal mimicry is combined with varying degrees of story telling, acting, and singing, it results in the basic structure for a Kouji performance.  The sounds most commonly used in Kouji tend to be those of animals, such as birds or dogs, but with the advancement of technology, Kouji has also come to incorporate imitations of busses, planes, and modern weapons.  It is also now common to use a microphone in the performance of Kouji.  Often the Kouji of a highly skilled performer so accurately mimics real life sounds that if the audience were to close their eyes, they might not be able to tell that the sounds were being produced by a human.  Although it is an art form in and of itself, it may often be performed in combination with other traditional Chinese art forms such as [[Xiangsheng|Cross-talk]].  The primary objective of a Kouji performance is to bring joy to the audience through the sounds of their everyday lives, in a celebration of the harmony which exists between human beings and nature.

==Elements of Kouji performance==

'''Mimicry''' – The principle and most difficult element of a Kouji performance is of course the vocal mimicry.  It has neither a theoretical basis nor a concrete standard framework, and instead relies on the performer’s own talent and hard work in attempting to imitate the sounds of their environment.

'''Dialogue''' – It is often necessary to use an appropriate amount of dialogue to accompany vocal mimicry in a Kouji performance.  The main aim of using dialogue is to strengthen the connection between the performer and the audience.  Dialogue is used as an introduction and a guide throughout the performance.  It may be carried out in the form of narration, poetry recitation, or [[Shuo-chang]] (Talk-sing) monologues which may be used to introduce a performance.

'''Humor''' – Use of comedy serves to enrich a Kouji performance by providing an entertaining context in which to use vocal mimicry.  Through humor the audience is invited to follow their innate instinct and laugh at the comical noises coming from the mouth of the performer.  Humor fills out and gives character to a performance.

'''Singing''' – Often singing is also used in Kouji in order to reference well known songs.  In addition, some Kouji performers may also choose to imitate the singing voice of a particular recording artist to display the extent of their vocal mimicry skills.

==History==

Although Kouji is believed by many to have origins in the animal calls used by hunters in tribal society, there are unfortunately no historical accounts of its transition from such a context into a performance art. The first historical account of Kouji ever recorded was over 2,300 years ago in [[Shandong province]] during the [[Warring States period]]. In the year 298 BC there was a [[Qin (state)|Qin]] prime minister named Mengchang who was a student of [[Confucius]], and accumulated over 3,000 followers.  Mengchang found himself in a difficult situation when the Qin ruler began to believe that Mengchang could be spying on him for the neighboring state in which he was raised, and Mengchang was jailed.  Mengchang tried to win his freedom by sending away for some very special garments to give the Qin ruler’s wife in an attempt to win her over, and thus gain his freedom.  Complications arose however when the garments were seized by the guards and locked away.  It was at this point that Mengchang used his followers' Kouji skills to steal back the clothes by luring the guards away by mimicking the barking of dogs.   When the clothes were retrieved, they were successfully passed on to the ruler’s wife who was deeply touched and sent immediately for the release of Mengchang.  By the time that the Qin ruler discovered what had happened, Mengchang and his followers had already begun to flee.  When they had reached a nearby mountain pass which was their gateway to freedom, the Qin guards were hot on their trail.  They needed to get through the mountains immediately, but it was still night time and the gatekeepers were not permitted to open the pass until the roosters' crows signaled that the morning had come.  Yet again, one of Mengchang’s followers used his Kouji skills to mimic a rooster and trigger all of the local roosters to crow. This signaled that morning had come and allowed the gatekeepers to open the pass for Mengchang’s successful escape.

Although this historical record of Kouji from the Warring States period was the first ever to be documented, more documentation followed as time passed.  In fact, another student of Confucius named Gongchang Zhi who actually married one of the great thinker’s daughters, was himself known to be a performer of Kouji noted for his bird call mimicry during the same period.

It was during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties that Kouji's development as an art form began to experience slightly more attention from the Chinese state.  During these dynasties Kouji was one of the most popular forms of entertainment amongst the common people.  As is Chinese political tradition to offer support and resources as a method of incorporation into the state, the government realized the power and importance of Kouji for the Chinese people and began to aid the development of the art form.  In order to promote Kouji and train those who practiced it, a society of vocal mimicry was set up by the government.

During this period of Kouji's history in the Song dynasty, truly legendary Kouji masters began to gain fame which has survived up until today.  During the rule of [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] there was a Kouji master who was nicknamed Liu Baiqin (Baiqin meaning hundreds of species of birds) because he was phenomenal at mimicking bird songs.  His level of mastery was so high that his abilities were not limited only to performance;  Liu was also able to communicate with birds in trees.  The most famous female Kouji Master of all time Wen Banian, also made a name for herself during this same time period by performing her renowned mimicry of fruit peddlers’ cries.  With government support and popular demand combined, Kouji found itself in a favorable position as far as nurturing new talents.

The following years were marked by the arrival of celebrated masters of Kouji who advanced the art form by building off of the work of their predecessors.  During the [[Ming dynasty]], the most famous Kouji Master was Fang Zhailang who is best known for his ability to imitate the dialects of different regions. Gou Maoer, who lived and performed during the early period of the [[Qing dynasty]], made his name by creating and performing such pieces as "slaughtering pigs" and "pigs fighting for food".  These are amongst the performances that have been passed down through the generations and can still be seen today.  Later on in the Qing dynasty during the reign of the [[Guangxu Emperor]] there was a very eminent Kouji master who was famous for his mimicry of a song bird called the [[hwamei]] (melodious laughingthrush), and therefore was nicknamed Hwamei Yang.  Amongst his great performances was “two birds fighting over food”, which is now on the verge of extinction.

It can be said that Kouji entered into a new phase of its history beginning in the 1930s when a Shanghai Kouji Master by the name of Yin Shilin implemented radical alterations in the way that Kouji was performed.  Traditionally the Kouji master would sit at a big square table surrounded with a screen called an "[[Eight Immortals]]" table, which had a fan and a piece of wood on it.  With the assistance of these tools, the performer would execute various vocal mimicry acts to entertain the audience who could only hear but not see their performance. The tools were important because they could make up for certain sounds that human speech organs are incapable of producing.  Also, the screen allowed the performer to not think about facial expressions and gestures, and concentrate strictly on the sounds that they were making.  After the 1930s when the screen and tools were taken away from the stage however, the audience could not only hear the vocal mimicry, but see the artists’ facial expressions and gestures as well.  It was at this point in history that Kouji went from being called "drama behind a screen" to Kouji, meaning "vocal skill" or "skill of mouth" .  Thus through a combination of imitation of sounds and stage performance, Kouji came to be what some might call a more engaging entertainment experience for the audience.

After the formation of the [[People’s Republic of China]] in 1949, Kouji began to reach new audiences around the globe.  Kouji masters such as the above-mentioned Yin Shilin and his disciple Zhou Zhicheng (the creators of such performances as "the powerful army of one million crossing the [[Yangtze River]]" and "Coastal Front"), traveled abroad extensively to perform Kouji.  Largely by touring with acrobat troupes, performers began to gain Kouji an international reputation as "an amazing oriental art".  Kouji Master Sun Tai, while in [[Poland]] even won a gold medal at the Warsaw International Acrobatics Competition for his performances.  Since the Internationalization of Kouji, its relationship with the global community has expanded beyond entertainment for common people into use for Chinese diplomacy.  Kouji master Niu Yuliang who currently resides in [[Beijing]], has traveled to over 30 countries and performed for the likes of the [[King of Cambodia]] and the former [[US President]] [[George Bush Sr]].

==Current status==

Kouji has been in constant development throughout the generations and ups and downs of history ever since the Tang dynasty.  Today, Kouji finds itself facing a new set of generational challenges which threaten to change it forever.  A lack of dedicated young disciples not only threatens to minimize Kouji’s presence in the fabric of Chinese culture, but it is also the cause for concern that many traditional performances might be lost forever.  An increasing interest amongst the younger generation of China in new and foreign art forms suggests that to a great extent, traditional performance arts such as Kouji might lose some of their attractiveness to the future generations of Chinese.  As an art form with a history of over 2,300 years that has traveled the world showcasing the artistic creativity and intelligence of the Chinese people, it has surprisingly still not received any direct support for preservation from the government.  As the Chinese government becomes increasingly enthusiastic about preservation of their vast intangible cultural heritage, many hope that Kouji will come under the grace of their assistance as well.

==Mastery==

To become a master of Chinese Kouji requires much more than may meet the eye.  First and foremost a Kouji master must achieve an advanced level of excellence in vocal mimicry.  This level of excellence however means little without the possession of natural stage presence and a passion for performance.  In addition to being able to perform high level vocal mimicry skills with a contagious stage presence, a master of Kouji must also hold a profound dedication to their art.  This means that when they perform they are fully aware that they are not only performing for themselves and their current audience, but for all past and future Kouji masters and audiences as well.  Responsibilities intimately connected with this dedication are the learning of classic performances, and the commitment to passing them on to the coming generations. 
Beyond all aspects of Kouji mastery directly related to the performance and preservation of the art form, there is one additional characteristic that any true Kouji master must possess.  This final characteristic is a profound understanding that everything which a Kouji master has, was given to him by the people and therefore truly belongs to them and not the master himself.  Thus an intense commitment to the well being of all people is also a precursor to achieving mastery in the Chinese art form of Kouji.

==Inheritance==

A key element of Chinese Kouji is the manner in which it is passed on to successive generations.  This may take the form of either family inheritance, or a combination of family and master-disciple inheritance.  Perhaps partially as a result of its involvement in Chinese military code talking, Kouji disciples have been limited to citizens of the Chinese state.  In fact, in 1956 [[Zhou En Lai]] refused an offer by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government to exchange their two best acrobat training programs for one Kouji training program.  Although the two countries were on good terms at the time, Zhou stated that Kouji was a special cultural heritage that belonged to the Chinese, and should thus be protected.

'''Les Percussions de Guinée''' was founded in 1987 by the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism of the [[Republic of Guinea]] with the meeting between seven nationals drummers and the French artist François Kokelaere.  It is a government sponsored national ballet of the finest percussionists, musicians, and dancers from Guinea, [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Guinée"/&gt;

They present a performance inspired by [[traditional music]] set in a modern scenic presentation. The group is naturally oriented toward the music of the Guinean highland and the coastal region known for the [[djembe]] drum, but their influences are also drawn from the Guinea midland and the forest regions as well.  In the tradition of the [[griots]], the history of many of the ethnic groups is told through the medium of drum and dance performance. African-styled performing arts has transmitted traditional values, actual histories, and the spiritual energy of the African people for centuries.

The fifteen-member ensemble includes seven [[master drummer]]s, chosen among the best soloists of Guinea's national companies, as well as members playing [[flute]], [[balafon]], [[Kora (instrument)|kora]], and traditional [[dancers]].

==History==
In 1952, a world-renowned dance company called ''[[Les Ballets Africans]]'' was established by artist [[Keita Fodeba]], who had a rich legacy of connecting the cultures of Africa with the cultures of the world. Now, some 45 years later, this important work has been taken up by [[Mamoudou Conde]], the charismatic relative of Fodeba.

Between 1987 and 1995, the company realized many tours around the world. In 1995, following political problems, François Kokelaere left the artistic direction(management) of the group which was confided to the national ballets.

Since 1994, Mamoudou has managed and directed performances in the Guinean Dance Company. In 1994, they received an award from the [[Rochester, New York]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] for their contribution to the development and promotion of the arts. This was the catalyst for the creation of [[World Music Production Inc.]] to preserve, spread, and promote the culture of Africa around the world.

In 1998, the Department of Arts and Culture of the Republic of Guinea appointed Mamoudou as the Managing Director and Producer of ''Les Percussions de Guinée'', and to represent the Ministry of Youth and Culture of the Republic of Guinea worldwide. In 2000, he also began managing ''[[The Djoliba National Ballet]]'' of the Republic of Guinea (formerly managed by [[Harry Belafonte]]). In 2001, Mamoudou signed a contract with the Guinean government to manage ''Les Ballets Africans''. In 2002, World Music Productions Inc. arranged for ''Les Percussions de Guinée'' to appear in the [[IMAX]] film, ''[[Pulse: A Stomp Odyssey]]''. The first all-female Guinean percussion group, ''Amazones&amp;nbsp;— Women Master Drummers of Guinea'', was also officially created that year. In Mamoudou Conde's words, "it is very important that we teach our culture to everyone, especially the younger generation, so that the wisdom and value of our civilization is spread and honored throughout the world."

==Mission==
The mission of ''Les Percussions de Guinée'' is to educate the people of the world about Guinean traditional values through [[music]], [[drum]]s, [[Dance music|Dance]], and the storytelling of Africa's rich cultural legacy.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

{{Expand list|date=November 2014}}
This is a '''list of musical forms and genres''' organized according to the eras of [[Classical music]]. The [[Musical form|form]] of a [[musical composition]] refers to the general outline of the composition, based on the sections that comprise it or on specific details that are unique to a certain type of composition. For example, a [[rondo]] is based on alternation between familiar and novel sections (ABACA); a [[mazurka]] is defined by its [[meter]] and [[rhythm]]; a [[nocturne]] is based on the mood it creates, required to be inspired by or evocative of night. This list summarizes these broadly defined forms and genres within the musical periods that they arose or became common.

The '''location manager''' is a member of the [[film crew]] responsible for finding and securing locations to be used, obtaining all fire, police and other governmental permits, and coordinating the logistics for the production to complete its work. They are also the public face of the production, and responsible for addressing issues that arise due to the production's impact on the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/location_manager_job_description.htm prospects.ac.uk, Location manager: Job description]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duties ==
Historically, the duties of the Location Manager were the responsibility of the [[Assistant Director]]. As the film industry grew, a need was identified for greater oversight, to allow ADs to focus on the internal aspects of the set. A dedicated person focusing on external influences was first seen in the 1950s on large studio features, and became common in the industry by the late 1970s.

The first job of a location manager is managing the [[location scouting]] of a project, usually supervising several scouts and assistant managers during the course of a show. A location manager will work closely with the [[film director|director]] and the [[production designer]] during preproduction to find and secure their creative vision, and oversee additional scouts to insure that all scripted locations are accounted for. The manager is also responsible for public relations at the locations used, and the safety of the crew during filming.

A "location scout" is responsible for the initial scouting of all the [[Location shooting|locations]] used in a film, and translates the [[writer]] and director’s vision for the feel of the [[Scene (filming)|scene]] into a viable and appropriate location. An experienced location scout will take into account all the logistics necessary for the production to function.

Some items that a location scout must be aware of before submitting a location for approval are the budgetary restrictions of the production, local permitting fees and regulations, [[Movie camera|camera]] and lighting requirements, convenience to other locations, production services, crew and unit parking, and possibly incidental issues such as direction of the sun, [[traffic]] in and around the location, aircraft flight paths, weather patterns, road work, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and even interest by local [[organized crime]] families.

[[File:FilmLightingEquipmentLowerBroadwayNYC060709.JPG|thumb|Large lighting equipment must be stored between shoots. For [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'']], the storage spot was lower [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in Manhattan]]

Once a location has been determined to have the appropriate appearance, the location manager must schedule dates for preparation, wrap and strike, and negotiate with the property owner an appropriate fee as well as fees to neighbors and tenants that may be impacted by production. The location manager will also apply for the necessary permits through the local municipality and/or community and housing associations, arrange parking for trucks, equipment and crew, prepare temporary facilities for holding production, talent, crew and meals, and ensuring the security of the location, the safety of the crew while minimizing the impact to the surrounding community.

Good location managers are well-poised and able to think on their feet as they are constantly moving, usually preceding production at a location, and overseeing final strike and wrap. They are the first and last people the public sees that represent the production, and are responsible for ensuring that the location is returned to the condition in which it was received. The location manager is also to be aware of the possible copyright issues which may be an issue if the show is filmed in a public place where there is art work or such, and where the artist has to give consent to the creation being depicted or covered or replaced by other artwork.

They need to be aware of the production's needs and know how to best accommodate them while diplomatically ensuring that the requirements of all parties, from the property owners, [[Line Producer|line producer]], director and production designer, to the [[Grip (job)|grip]] and [[gaffer (motion picture industry)|electric]] teams lighting and rigging the set, and their [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|teamster]] brothers with their trucks, trailers and vans.

== Employment ==
In [[Studio zone|Hollywood]], they are represented by the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 399]], and in New York and Chicago they are represented by the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild of America (DGA)]] for features and television work. In New York Commercials, they are represented by Teamsters Local 817. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], location managers are represented by the Teamsters Local 728.  Additionally, there is the [[Location Managers Guild International]], a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and interests of their members and their relations with the general public, communities and industry partners.

Location Managers are commonly associated with [[Production management|production]] as being part of the management of a show and as such, are generally paid a weekly [[salary]] as opposed to an hourly [[wage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://locationmanagers.org/who-we-are/ locationmanagers.org, Who are we]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locationworks.com/howto/ locationworks.com, How to become a Location Manage]&lt;/ref&gt; The average salary can vary depending on the experience of the individual and can range from a couple hundred dollars a day on low-budget films to almost a thousand dollars a day on commercials.

== Recognition ==
The [[California Film Commission]] has recognized the work of Location Managers with the [http://www.californiaonlocationawards.com California On Location Awards] (COLA) since 1995, producing an annual awards show celebrating the best Location Professional, Team, and Public Servant in Film, Television, and Commercials.

The [[Location Managers Guild Awards|Location Managers Guild]] held their inaugural awards show in 2014 to honor the outstanding creative contributions of location professionals around the world, currently held in conjunction with the [[Association of Film Commissioners International#AFCI Locations Show|AFCI Location Show]] in Los Angeles, CA.

'''''Mamma Mia! Original Cast Recording''''' is the [[cast recording|original cast album]] for the 1999 [[England|English]] [[stage musical]] ''[[Mamma Mia!]]''. The album was released in [[1999 in music|1999]] and it reached No.56 in the UK album chart, with 2 weeks on the chart. [[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]] reinvigorated the popularity of [[ABBA]] (the [[Mamma Mia! The Movie Soundtrack|film soundtrack]] was the best-selling album of the week and several songs made the top #75 in the [[UK singles chart]]). The re-interest in this 1999 Original London Cast album caused it to reach #12 in the [[UK Album Chart]], having charted at #16 a week earlier. It features performances by the original London cast of the musical including [[Lisa Stokke]], [[Siobhán McCarthy]] and [[Hilton McRae]]. The album was produced by the two male members of ABBA, [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Björn Ulvaeus]]

The album featured a number of [[ABBA]]'s best known songs, including the [[Mamma Mia (song)|title track]], "[[Dancing Queen]]", "[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]" and "[[Thank You for the Music]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000031WEN |title=Track listings for soundtrack |publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mint Museum of Toys''' {{zh|t=玩具博物館|s=玩具博物馆}} is a purpose-built museum showing a private collection of vintage toys. It was officially opened on March 5, 2007 and officiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr [[George Yeo]]. The museum is located at 26 Seah Street, in the Arts &amp; Heritage district of [[Singapore]]. MINT is an acronym for '''"Moment of Imagination and Nostalgia with Toys"'''.

==Background==
The museum collection includes more than 3,000 toys and childhood memorabilia from the mid-19th century to mid-20th Century. All the toys displayed in the museum are the lifetime collection of Singaporean, '''Chang Yang Fa''', an alumnus of [[Saint Andrew's School, Singapore|St Andrew's School]].

Exhibits on display include Disneyana toys, [[Astro Boy]], [[Batman]], [[Bonzo the Dog]], [[Dan Dare]], [[Popeye the Sailor]], Pre-war Japanese toys, including a 'Door of Hope' Chinese doll collection dating from the turn of the 20th Century, [[Teddy Bear]] collection as well as Chinese comics and comic covers dating from 1920s, and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' collectables.

The museum's collection includes a large collection of enamel signs and tin boxes which are displayed in the museum's restaurant and wine bar.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Mint Museum2.png|thumb|Mural at the Mint Museum of Toys in [[Singapore]].]]
The collection is housed within a five-storey contemporary building designed by [[Chan Soo Khian]], Principal Architect of [[SCDA Architects]] and Structural Engineers Web Structures. The building has garnered international awards including The Chicago Athenaeum, Museum of Architecture and Design “International Architecture Awards” 2007 and was Runners Up in the Commercial Building Category for the Cityscape Architectural Review Award, held on 4 December 2006, at Cityscape Dubai 2006. The museum was awarded the 2007 International Architectural Award for Best New Global Design by the Chicago Athenaeum.

The window-less building prevents UV-rays from reaching the exhibits; the shelves are fitted with LED lights; shelvings are designed such that no shadows are cast on the exhibits. The building's signature facade, which is made up of 26 glass panes shaped into a wavelike structure, gives the museum an iconic status in Singapore's urban landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdaarchitects.com/architecture/mint-museum-of-toys|title=Mint Museum of Toys - Singapore - Architecture - SCDA|last=exhibit-e.com|website=www.scdaarchitects.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkūnas' wife was named Perkūnija/Perkūnė/[[Perperuna]]/Przeginia.&lt;ref&gt;But most likely ''Przeginia'' (and ''[[Bereginya]]'') is a loan in Slavic from [[German language|German]] *''fergunja'', see: ''Николаев С. Л., Страхов А. Б.'' К названию бога-громовержца в индоевропейских языках // [http://www.inslav.ru/images/stories/books/BSI1985(1987).pdf Балто-славянские исследования. 1985. М.: Наука, 1987. С. 152–158.]&lt;/ref&gt; Germanic ''*[[Thor|Þunraz]]'' ([[Thor|Þórr]]) is from a stem ''*{{PIE|(s)tene-}}'' "thunder",&lt;ref name="SIMEK332"&gt;Simek (2007:332).&lt;/ref&gt; but the name ''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos}}'' is continued in [[Fjörgyn]], mother of Þórr.&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Thunder god |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=1997 |page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;(w)&lt;/sup&gt;unos}}'' is reconstructed on the basis of ''Perkūnas''. ''Parjanya'' is no exact cognate, see below.

The [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] is reconstructed due to a [[Centum]] word for "[[oak]]", "coniferous tree", or "mountain", "coniferous mountain forest", ''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;us}}''. Here also, the labiovelar is non-trivial, and indeed singular in the sequence ''*{{PIE|-k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;u-}}'', its justification being in [[Latin]] ''[[quercus]]'' "oak", the result of an assimilatory [[Italo-Celtic]] sound law changing ''*{{PIE|p...k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' to ''*{{PIE|k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;...k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' (compare ''quinque'', Irish ''cóic'' vs. Sanskrit ''{{IAST|pañca}}'' "five"; ''coquo'' vs. Sanskrit ''pacati'' "to cook").  Celtic ''[[Hercynia silva|*Ercunia]]'', if cognate, did not partake in the assimilation, advising towards a cautious reconstruction of ''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;(w)&lt;/sup&gt;us}}''.

''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;(w)&lt;/sup&gt;unos}}'', then, is the god of the ''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;(w)&lt;/sup&gt;us}}'', comparable to Germanic ''*[[Wodanaz]]'' being the god of the  ''*[[wōþuz]]'', by virtue of the same suffix ''*{{PIE|-no-}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Termed "Herrschersuffix" by [[Wolfgang Meid]], ''Beiträge zur Namenforschung'' 8 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of this u-stem ''{{PIE|*perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;u-}}'' appears to be concept of an oak, a coniferous forest, a mountain forest, or a wooded mountain:
*"oak": [[Latin]] ''[[quercus]]'', Old High German ''fereheih'' "oak", Celtic [[Hercynia silva]]. The oak is quite a common [[Motif (literature)|motif]] in myths about Perkūnas. Cognates include Sanskrit ''parkaṭī'' "fig tree", the [[Venetic language|Venetic]] and [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] ethnonyms ''Quarquēni'' and ''Querquerni'', the [[Ligurian (ancient language)|Ligurian]] ''Nymphis Percernibus'', [[Old Norse]] ''fjörr'' "tree", Anglo-Saxon ''furh'' (Modern English ''[[fir]]''), Old Norse ''fura'', Old High German forha (Modern German ''Föhre'') "pine tree", Old Norse ''fyri'', Old High German ''forh-ist'' (Modern German ''Forst'') "pine forest", Old High German ''Fergunna'' (the [[Erzgebirge]]), Langobardic ''Fairkuna''. Anglo-Saxon ''firgen'' "wooded height", [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''fairguni'' "mountain".
*A possibly related word ''{{PIE|*peru-r/n-}}'' for "rock" or "mountain" is reconstructed from [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''peruna'', "rock", [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''parvata'', "mountain" ([[Parvati]], daughter of [[Himavant]]), [[Thracian language|Thracian]] ''per(u)'', "rock".

The association with oaks can be explained by the frequency with which tall trees are struck by lightning. This is reflected in two beliefs, one being that the Norse god Thor could strike enemies hiding under an oak tree, but not under the smaller [[beech]]; the other that oak trees contained a fire within them that lightning could release (or vice versa, that the lightning transferred fire into the tree that explained why wood was effective fuel).{{r|eiec}}

Fittingly, there was a  sanctuary to Perun (now a monastery) located on a height called ''[[Perynь]]'' near [[Novgorod]], on the northern shore of [[Lake Ilmen]], the source of the [[Volkhov River]]. There is a [[Pirin]] mountain range is in south-western Bulgaria.

As seen from the cognates above, the name of the thunder god is  only attested in [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Germanic languages]], but mythological connections of the thunderer with oaks or wooded mountains may link to the Proto-Indo-European word.

Further etymological connections were hypothesized with a verbal root ''{{PIE|*per-}}'' "to strike", in reference to the [[thunderbolt]] and the violent nature of a thunder god. The name [[Parjanya]] itself could also be derived from ''*per-'', though it cannot be strictly cognate with ''*{{PIE|perk&lt;sup&gt;(w)&lt;/sup&gt;unos}}'', since Old Indic ''j'' does not reflect PIE *kʷ. A closer relationship of the verbal root to the theonym is not demonstrable, because the ''*{{PIE|-k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;u-}}'' extension is not otherwise attested as an Indo-European suffix, and because of the semantic distance between "slaying" and "tree" or "mountain".

According to [[Julius Pokorny]] (''[[IEW]]''), Russian ''Perunъ'' "thunder god" and ''perun'' "thunderbolt" which likewise lack the velar element are indeed influenced by the root discussed, the activity of "striking down" being associated with the Balto-Slavic theonym by [[popular etymology]].

[[Portugal]] took part in the first [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] in 2007. Representing the country were [[Sónia Araújo]], a TV host and [[Ricardo Silva (dancer)|Ricardo Silva]], a ballroom dancer. The couple were chosen after winning the second Portuguese version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' ("Dança Comigo", in Portuguese). The dances they performed at the contest were [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] and [[Tango (dance)|Tango]]. Portugal came joint fifth after receiving 74 points from 12 countries. It was their first top five finish in any Eurovision contest.

Sónia is a co-hoster of the Portuguese talk-show "Praça da Alegria", by [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]], [[RTP África]] and [[RTP Internacional]], along with [[Jorge Gabriel]] and [[Hélder Reis]].

In 2008, Portugal were represented by singer [[Raquel Tavares]] and dancer [[João Tiago]], who danced a fusion of [[Rhumba|Rumba]] and [[Tango]]. The [[Third Eurovision Dance Contest]] has been cancelled indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=What caused the death of the Eurovision Dance Contest?|url=http://eurovoix.com/2011/05/29/what-caused-the-death-of-the-eurovision-dance-contest-p1/|website=Eurovoix.xom|publisher=Eurovoix.com|accessdate=22 June 2014|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's first [[English language]] radio station was later established in 1977, as a result of an increase in English speakers in Bahrain and the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Alan|title=World Broadcasting: A Comparative View|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567502459|pages=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgptYdAcsOgC&amp;pg=PA136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Radio Bahrain|url=http://www.radiobahrain.fm/index.php?pr=About_Radio_Bahrain|publisher=Radio Bahrain|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The radio's programmes were primarily religious and educational, with occasional news announcements.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

Almost all radio stations in Bahrain are state-owned, by the [[Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation]] though privately owned radio stations like the [[Hindi]] / [[Malayalam]] language Radio Mrichi 104.2FM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio Mirchi to launch in Bahrain|url=https://ultra.news/s-k/39036/radio-mirchi-to-launch-in-bahrain|publisher=Ultra News|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which serves the country's [[Indian people|Indian]] community, operate in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541053|work=Bahrain profile|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The British established the Bahrain Broadcasting Station in November 1940 in response to the initiation of pro-[[Nazi]] programmes being broadcast in Arabic in the Persian Gulf from 1934 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/nazi-propaganda-sharjah-during-world-war-ii|title=NAZI PROPAGANDA IN SHARJAH DURING WORLD WAR II|publisher=qdl.qa|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest studies done on radio use in Bahrain assert that in 1940, there were 511 radio receivers in operation.&lt;ref name="frishkopf"/&gt; However, radio ownership was not common among the residents, and most people went to cafés to listen to broadcasts. The station was staffed mostly with Bahrainis and its broadcasts included Quranic recitations, the national anthems of Kuwait and Bahrain, and poetry recitations, which may have been in the form of music. The station was closed down in 1945.&lt;ref name="frishkopf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frishkopf|first1=Michael|title=Music and Media in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KANOAYzkhA8C|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|year=2010|pages=116–117|isbn=978-9774162930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the term "site survey" or "tech scout" is commonly used with the same meaning.

==Origins==
"Recce" is borrowed from the [[military term|military expression]] of the same name, which derived from "[[reconnaissance]]" in the noun sense and "[[reconnoitre]]" in the verb sense.

==Radio and TV==
The term "recce" is also used to refer to scouting recording or broadcast locations for radio and TV production.

'''Samaritans Radar''' was a [[Twitter]]-based service created by the digital advertising agency Jam for the British emotional support charity [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]]. It was intended as a way to inform users when their Twitter contacts were potentially in need of emotional support. The app scanned Twitter for key phrases such as "help me", "hate myself", mentions of being depressed or needing someone to talk to and then sent an email to that user's friends.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29801214|title=Samaritans app monitors Twitter feeds for suicide warnings|publisher=BBC News Online|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaritans suspended the Radar service  following widespread criticism and a petition asking the charity to discontinue the service.&lt;ref name="suspension"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samaritans.org/news/samaritans-radar-announcement|title=Samaritans Radar announcement|publisher=Samaritans|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samaritans noted as justification for building the app that there is a link between posting suicidal messages on social media services and committing suicide, and that social media services are used predominantly by younger people.&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/samaritans-radar-app-criticised-being-4563584|title=Samaritans Radar app criticised for being creepy invasion of privacy|work=The Mirror|first=Olivia|last=Solon|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Many Twitter users expressed concerns about Radar, arguing that it infringed privacy, that tweets were scanned and collected without consent, and the [[Web_application|app]] allowed bullies, [[Stalking|stalkers]] and [[Troll (Internet)|internet trolls]] to target their victims when they were at their most vulnerable.&lt;ref name="mirror" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2014/11/anti-suicide-app-samaritans-radar-could-do-more-harm-than-good-critics-say.html|title=Anti-suicide app Samaritans Radar could do more harm than good, critics say|author=Lauren O'Neil|publisher=CBC|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BBC, the majority of tweets using the [[hashtag]] #SamaritansRadar were negative.&lt;ref name="bbctrending"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29881099|title=#BBCtrending: The petition to block the Samaritans' Twitter app|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Change.org]] petition was launched to ask Twitter to shut Radar down and a number of complaints were sent to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] claiming that the app breached the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]].&lt;ref name="thirdsector"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/twitter-users-fear-samaritans-radar-app-breaks-data-protection-act/communications/article/1320449|title=Twitter users fear Samaritans Radar app breaks the Data Protection Act|author=Susannah Birkwood|publisher=Third Sector|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to critics, Samaritans allowed users to be "whitelisted", meaning that their tweets would not be scanned by the app. This required sending a direct message on Twitter to be opted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/04/samaritans-twitter-app-mental-health-depression|title=Samaritans Twitter app identifying user's moods criticised as invasive|first=Karen|last=McVeigh|work=The Guardian|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service had been activated by 3,000 users as of 4 November 2014.&lt;ref name="bbctrending" /&gt;

[[File:Tom Browns school-days (1911) (14566807667).jpg|thumb|Illustration of a game of [[rugby football]] from a 1911 edition of ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]''; first published in 1857, ''Tom Brown'' helped to typify the school story.]]
The '''school story''' is a fiction genre centering on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, at its most popular in the first half of the twentieth century. While examples do exist in other countries, it is most commonly set in English [[boarding school]]s and mostly written in girls' and boys' subgenres, reflecting the [[single-sex education]] typical until the 1950s. It focuses largely on friendship, honor and loyalty between pupils. Plots involving sports events, bullies, secrets, rivalry and bravery are often used to shape the school story.

The popularity of the traditional school story declined after the Second World War, but school stories have remained popular in other forms, with a focus on state run coeducational schools, and themes involving more modern concerns such as racial issues, family life, sexuality and drugs (see [[Grange Hill]]). More recently it has seen a revival with the success of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, which uses many plot motifs commonly found in the traditional school story.

==History==

===Early works===
''[[The Governess, or The Little Female Academy]]'' by [[Sarah Fielding]], published in 1749, is generally seen as the first boarding school story.&lt;ref name="fostersimons195"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Foster | first1 = Shirley | last2 = Simons| first2 = Judy |title = What Katy read: feminist re-readings of "classic" stories for girls | pages = 195 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-87745-493-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding's novel was a moralistic tale with tangents offering instruction on behavior, and each of the nine girls in the novel relates her story individually. However, it did establish aspects of the boarding school story which were repeated in later works. The school is self-contained with little connection to local life, the girls are encouraged to live together with a sense of community and collective responsibility.&lt;ref name="fostersimons196"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Foster | first1 = Shirley | last2 = Simons| first2 = Judy |title = What Katy read: feminist re-readings of "classic" stories for girls | pages = 196 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-87745-493-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding's approach was imitated and used as a formula by both her contemporaries and other writers into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="fostersimons197"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Foster | first1 = Shirley | last2 = Simons| first2 = Judy |title = What Katy read: feminist re-readings of "classic" stories for girls | pages = 197 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-87745-493-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence of school stories in nineteenth century===
School stories were a somewhat late arrival as a popular literature. Children as a market were generally not targeted until well into the nineteenth century. There was concern about the moral effect of novels on young minds, and those that were published tended to lean towards giving moral instruction.&lt;ref name="kershner168"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whited | first = Lana A. |title = Joyce, Bakhtin, and Popular Literature: Chronicles of Disorder | page = 168 | publisher = UNC Press| year = 1992 | ISBN = 0-8078-4387-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Hughes and successors====
''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847) by [[Charlotte Brontë]], and ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848) and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (1850) by [[Charles Dickens]] had school story elements, which generated considerable public interest&lt;ref name="huntbutts154"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Peter | last2 = Butts | first2 = Dennis | title = Children's Literature: An Illustrated History| page = 154 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-19-212320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and close to 100 school stories had been published between 1749 and 1857, the year that ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by Thomas Hughes appeared. It is perhaps the most famous of all such tales, and its popularity helped firmly establish the genre, which rapidly expanded in the decades to follow across thousands of novels.&lt;ref name="whited141-2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whited | first = Lana A. |title = The ivory tower and Harry Potter: perspectives on a literary phenomenon | pages = 141–2 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-8262-1549-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes never wrote another school story: the sequel ''[[Tom Brown at Oxford]]'' focused on university life. However, more school stories followed such as [[Frederic William Farrar|F.W. Farrar]]'s ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]: A Tale of Roslyn School'' (1858), Revd H.C. Adams' ''Schoolboy Honour; A Tale of Halminster College'' (1861) and A.R. Hope's ''Stories of Whitminster'' (1873). In 1870 the Education Act paved the way for universal education for children, and so gave the market for school stories a considerable boost, which led to some publishers advertising novels specifically as school stories.&lt;ref name="huntbutts157"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Peter | last2 = Butts | first2 = Dennis | title = Children's Literature: An Illustrated History| page = 157 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-19-212320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boys' magazines also began to be published which featured school stories, the best known being ''[[Boy's Own Paper]]'', with its first issues appearing 1879.&lt;ref name="reidfilby78"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Arbuckle Reid | first1 = William | last2 = Filby| first2 = Jane |title = The Sixth: An Essay in Education and Democracy | page = 78 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 1982 | ISBN = 0-905273-29-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talbot Baines Reed====
[[Talbot Baines Reed]] wrote a number of school stories in the 1880s, and contributed considerably to shaping the genre, taking inspiration from [[Thomas Hughes]]. His most famous work was ''[[The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's]]'' (1887) (serialised 1881–82). It was reprinted on a number of occasions, selling 750,000 copies in a 1907 edition. While seated in Baines Reed's Christian values, ''The Fifth Form at St Dominic's'' showed a definite leaning from the school story as instructional moral literature for children and with greater focus on the pupils and a defined plot.&lt;ref name="huntbutts157-8"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Peter | last2 = Butts | first2 = Dennis | title = Children's Literature: An Illustrated History| pages = 157–8 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-19-212320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender difference in school stories====
As schools were segregated by gender in the nineteenth century, school stories naturally formed two separate but related genres of girls' school stories and boys' school stories.&lt;ref name="whited141"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whited | first = Lana A. |title = The ivory tower and Harry Potter: perspectives on a literary phenomenon | pages = 141 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-8262-1549-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been an increase in female schooling from the 1850s, augmented by the 1870 Education Act. [[L. T. Meade]], who also wrote historical novels and was a magazine editor, become the most popular writer of girls' school stories in the final decade of the nineteenth century. Her stories focused on upper class pupils at boarding schools who learned to earn trust by making mistakes, they had little focus on sports and were primarily interested in friendships and loyalty. They remained largely rooted in Victorian values and preparing girls to be proper wives and mothers.&lt;ref name="huntbutts159"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Peter | last2 = Butts | first2 = Dennis | title = Children's Literature: An Illustrated History| page = 159 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-19-212320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Most literature for girls at the turn of the twentieth century focused on the value of self-sacrifice, moral virtues, dignity and aspiring to finding a proper position in societal order. This was to a large extent changed by the publication of [[Angela Brazil]]'s girls school stories in the early twentieth century, which featured energetic characters who challenged authority, played pranks, and lived in their own youthful world in which adult concerns were sidelined.&lt;ref name="briggs169"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Julia | last2 = Butts | first2 = Dennis | last3 = Grenby | first3 = M.O. | last4 = Anderson | first4 = Brian |title = Popular Children's Literature in Britain| page = 169 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 1-84014-242-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twentieth-century boys' school stories were often comical in nature – examples being the [[Billy Bunter]] stories and the [[Jennings (novels)|Jennings]] series.

Coeducation remained rare in boarding school stories. Enid Blyton's [[Naughtiest Girl]] series was unusually set in a progressive coeducational school. J. K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series represents a more recent example of a mixed-sex boarding school.&lt;ref name="grenby88"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grenby | first = Matthew |title = Children's Literature | page = 88 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press| year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7486-2274-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of the school story genre===
The peak period for school stories was between the 1880s and the end of the Second World War. Comics featuring school stories also became popular in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="whited142"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whited | first = Lana A. |title = The ivory tower and Harry Potter: perspectives on a literary phenomenon | page = 142 | publisher = University of Iowa Press| year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-8262-1549-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II boarding school stories waned in popularity. Coeducational schools for all British schoolchildren were being funded by the public purse; critics, librarians and educational specialists became interested in creating a more modern curriculum and tended to see stories of this type as outdated and irrelevant. School stories have remained popular, however, with a focus shifting towards state-funded day schools with both girls and boys, and dealing with more contemporary issues such as sexuality, racism, drugs and family difficulties. The ''Bannerdale'' series of five novels (1949–56) by [[Geoffrey Trease]], starting with ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]'', involved two male and two female pupils of day schools in the [[Lake District]], and a widowed mother. Trease was inspired to set the series in a day school following a letter from a young reader complaining that, despite being the setting for many school stories,  boarding schools were in fact no more exciting environments than day schools. This is something remarked upon by the narrator. 

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of novels has in some respects revived the genre, despite having a strong leaning towards [[fantasy]] conventions. Elements of the school story prominent in ''Harry Potter'' including the action being described almost exclusively from the point of view of pupils.

==Elsewhere==
While school stories originated in Britain with ''Tom Brown's Schooldays'', school stories were also published in other countries. 'Schulromane' were popular in Germany in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and school stories were also published in Soviet [[Russia]]. Some American classic children's novels also relate to the genre, including ''What Katy Did at School'' (1873) by [[Susan Coolidge]], ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) by [[Louisa May Alcott]] and ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'' (1941) by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]. The 1980s and 1990s [[Sweet Valley High]] series by [[Francine Pascal]] and others are set in California.

However, the core school story theme of the school as a sort of character in itself, actively formed by the pupils and their enjoyment of being there, is primarily a British and American phenomenon. In France, ''Mémoires d'Un Collégien'' (1907) by André Laurie (Jean-François Paschal Grousset), set in a boarding-school context similar to Talbot Baines Reed's St. Dominic's in England and Arthur Stanwood Pier's St. Timothy's in America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcdrutgers.net/pier.htm "Arthur Stanwood Pier"] by [[William C. Dowling]]&lt;/ref&gt; would have a considerable influence on French stories in the genre. German school stories tended to be written for adults, in the tradition of the earlier ''Bildungsroman'', and explored the disruption the school environment made to a character's sense of individuality. Soviet stories tended to focus on how individualistic behaviour could be corrected and brought into line with collective goals by the school environment.&lt;ref name="grenby87-8"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grenby | first = Matthew |title = Children's Literature | pages = 87–8 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press| year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7486-2274-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[manga]] such as ''[[School Rumble]]'' and US dramas ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]].

==Themes==
The vast majority of school stories involve the culture of boarding schools in general. Common themes include honour, decency, sportsmanship and loyalty. Competitive team sports often feature and an annual sports event between rival school houses is frequently a part of the plot. Friendships between pupils are a common focus and also relationships with particular teachers, and the difficulty of new pupils fitting into the school culture is a central theme.&lt;ref name="anato73"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anatol | first = Giselle Liza | title = Reading Harry Potter | page = 73 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-313-32067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullies often feature in school stories, particularly boys' school stories. Identical twins appear with some frequency and are often the subject of comedy.&lt;ref name="anatol77"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anatol | first = Giselle Liza | title = Reading Harry Potter | page = 77 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-313-32067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; School principals are usually even handed and wise and provide guidance to characters &lt;ref name="anatol78"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anatol | first = Giselle Liza | title = Reading Harry Potter | page = 78 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-313-32067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will often bend the rules to get them out of trouble.&lt;ref name="anatol79"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anatol | first = Giselle Liza | title = Reading Harry Potter | page = 79 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-313-32067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the development of the genre, school stories avoided dealing with [[adolescence]] or [[puberty]] directly.&lt;ref&gt;''George Brown's Schooldays'' (1946) by [[Bruce Marshall]] is a novel dealing with boarding school education; it is much more sensitive to the misery and sexuality of all-male boarding, disqualifying itself from the genre.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' by [[Dean Farrar]] was a classic [[didacticism|moral tract]] set in a boarding school. Its Victorian tone was never adopted as generic convention.

==Writers==
Commercially successful authors of '''school novels''' include writers for boys, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Anthony Buckeridge]], and prolific writer [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]], better known as Frank Richards, who wrote the Greyfriars School series, St. Jim's and Rookwood, and others for the [[Amalgamated Press]] between 1906 and 1940, his most famous character being [[Billy Bunter]]. Writers for girls include [[Angela Brazil]], [[Enid Blyton]], [[Elinor Brent-Dyer]], [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]], [[Mary Gervaise]] and [[Elsie Oxenham]].

'''Stan Laurel''' (born '''Arthur Stanley Jefferson'''; 16 June 1890 – 23 February 1965) was an English [[comedian|comic]] [[actor]], writer and film director, who was part of the comedy duo [[Laurel and Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary". ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 3 March 1965, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with his comedy partner [[Oliver Hardy]] in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Laurel began his career in [[music hall]], where he developed a number of his standard comic devices: the [[bowler hat]], the deep comic gravity and the nonsensical understatement. His performances polished his skills at [[pantomime]] and music hall sketches. Laurel was a member of "[[Fred Karno]]'s Army", where he was [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[understudy]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;McCabe 2005, p. 143. Robson, 2005 Retrieved: 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With Chaplin, the two arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe.&lt;ref name="Karno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/the-fine-mess-maker-at-home/|title=The Fine Mess-Maker at Home|website=[[New York Times]]|date=7 September 2012|last=Cavett|first=Dick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. From 1928 onwards, he appeared exclusively with Hardy. Laurel officially retired from the screen following his comedy partner's death in 1957.

In 1961, Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement [[Academy Award]] for his pioneering work in comedy. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7021 [[Hollywood Blvd]]. Laurel and Hardy ranked top among best double acts and seventh overall in a 2005 UK poll to find the ''Comedians' Comedian''.&lt;ref name="Legacy"/&gt; In 2009, a bronze statue of the duo was unveiled in Laurel's home town of [[Ulverston]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ulverston's most famous son - geograph.org.uk - 151570.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at Laurel's birthplace in [[Ulverston]]]]
Arthur Stanley Jefferson was born in his grandparents' house on 16 June 1890 in Argyll Street, [[Ulverston]], [[Lancashire]], to Arthur Jefferson, a theatre manager from [[Bishop Auckland]], and Margaret (née Metcalfe), an actress from Ulverston. He was one of five children.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Midwinter, Eric. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37659 "Laurel, Stan".] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' 2006.

He moved with his parents to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where he completed his education at [[Stonelaw High School|Rutherglen Academy]]. His father managed Glasgow's [[The Metropole Theatre|Metropole Theatre]], where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was [[Dan Leno]], one of the greatest English [[music hall]] comedians.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the [[Britannia Music Hall|Panopticon]] in [[Glasgow]] at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at [[pantomime]] and music hall sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 2007, pp. 143–147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his [[bowler hat]] and nonsensical understatement.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt;

He joined [[Fred Karno]]'s troupe of actors in 1910 with the stage name of "Stan Jefferson"; the troupe also included a young [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The music hall nurtured him, and he acted as Chaplin's [[understudy]] for some time.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; Karno was a pioneer of [[slapstick]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin and Laurel arrived in the United States on the same ship from Britain with the Karno troupe and toured the country.&lt;ref name="Karno"/&gt;
During the [[First World War]], Laurel registered for military service in America on 5 June 1917, as required under the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]].

[[File:Laurel and Hardy - The Lucky Dog (1921).ogv|thumb|left|Laurel and Hardy appeared for the first time together in ''[[The Lucky Dog]]''.]]
Between 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and [[Baldwin Cooke]], who became his lifelong friends. Amongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside [[Oliver Hardy]] before the two were a team in the silent film short ''[[The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; It was around this time that Laurel met [[Mae Dahlberg]]. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters.{{#tag:ref|Laurel disputed this and claimed that it just "sounded good".&lt;ref&gt;McCabe 1961, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.

By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan 1992, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925), ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).

==Laurel and Hardy==
{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}
[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]
Laurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]''. He intended to work primarily as a writer and director.

[[Oliver Hardy]], another member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap in 1927, and Laurel was asked to return to acting. Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in ''[[Slipping Wives]]'', ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1927), and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.

Together, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].

===Trouble at Roach Studio===
During the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was "teamed" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called "The Hardy Family." But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.

===20th Century Fox===
[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]
In 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox|20th Century Fox]] to make ten films over five years. During the war years, their work became more standardised and less successful, though ''[[The Bullfighters]]'' and ''[[Jitterbugs]]'' did receive some praise.

Revisiting his music hall days, Laurel returned to England in 1947 when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom performing in [[variety shows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tea and buns with Laurel and Hardy: Derek Malcolm on the day he met his comedy heroes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/11/tea-and-buns-with-laurel-and-hardy-the-day-i-met-my-comedy-heroes |accessdate=12 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobbed wherever they went, Laurel's homecoming to [[Ulverston]] took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall.&lt;ref name="nwmail"/&gt; The ''[[North-West Evening Mail|Evening Mail]]'' noted: "Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it."&lt;ref name="nwmail"&gt;[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 "Stan at Queen's first Royal Variety Show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221344/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 |date=1 February 2014 }}. ''North West Evening Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour included a ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' infront of King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in London.&lt;ref name="nwmail"/&gt; The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe.

Around this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects which he did, taking parts in [[John Wayne]] and [[Bing Crosby]] films.

In 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen 1992, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called ''Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables'' based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a [[stroke]] on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, his partner Hardy had a massive stroke on 14 September 1956, which resulted in his being unable to return to acting.

===Hardy's death===
Oliver Hardy died on 7 August 1957. Laurel was too ill to attend his funeral and said, "Babe would understand".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Rawlngs, Nate.

==After Laurel and Hardy==
In 1961, Stan Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award for his pioneering work in comedy. He had achieved his lifelong dream as a comedian and had been involved in nearly 190 films. He lived his final years in a small flat in the Oceana Apartments in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_oceana.html "Latter."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228174300/http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_oceana.html |date=28 February 2012 }} ''The Stan Laurel Correspondence Archive Project''.

Laurel was always gracious to fans and spent much time answering fan mail. His phone number was listed in the telephone directory, and fans were amazed that they could dial the number and speak to him directly.

[[Jerry Lewis]] was among the numerous comedians to visit Laurel, who offered suggestions for Lewis's production of ''[[The Bellboy]]'' (1960). Lewis paid tribute to Laurel by naming his main character Stanley in the film, and having [[Bill Richmond (writer)|Bill Richmond]] play a version of Laurel as well.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Richard.

Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Van Dyke]] told a similar story. When he was just starting his career, he looked up Laurel's phone number, called him, and then visited him at his home. Van Dyke played Laurel on "The Sam Pomerantz Scandals" episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.

Laurel was offered a cameo role in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), but turned it down. He did not want to be on screen in his old age,&lt;ref name="Karno"/&gt; especially without Hardy.

==Personal life==
Laurel and Mae Charlotte Dahlberg never married, but lived together as [[Common-law marriage|common-law husband and wife]] from 1919 to 1925, before Dahlberg accepted a one-way ticket from [[Joe Rock]] to go back to her native Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Louvish, ''Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy'', Faber &amp; Faber 2001 {{ISBN|0-571-21590-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937, Dahlberg was back in the USA and sued the now successful Stan Laurel for financial support. At the time, Laurel's second marriage was in the process of a divorce, with Dahlberg's legal suit adding to Laurel's woes. The matter was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19371207.1.4 ''San Bernardino Sun'', Volume 44, 7 December 1937, Page 4, "Stan Laurels in Agreement"] Accessed 2017-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlberg was described as a "relief project worker" by the court.

In 1935, Laurel married Virginia Ruth Rogers (known as Ruth). In 1937, Laurel filed for divorce from Ruth, confessing that he was not over his ex-wife Lois, but Lois decided against a reconciliation. On New Year's Day 1938, Laurel married Vera Ivanova Shuvalova (known as Illeana), leading to an irate Ruth accusing Stan of [[bigamy]], but their divorce had been finalised a couple of days before his new marriage.

==Development==
The series co-creator, [[Jacky St. James]], mentioned that she was unhappy with the way BDSM was portrayed in ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which she considers "passed off an abusive relationship as an honest interpretation of the BDSM lifestyle". She hoped to create a more nuanced view of the BDSM world with the series. In an interview with [[GQ]], she described the series as, "imperfect people in BDSM relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/how-bdsm-went-mainstream-on-tv|title=How BDSM Went Mainstream on TV|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead actress [[Ashlynn Yennie]] also echoed the creator's sentiment saying, "''Fifty Shades of Grey'' was  not a correct portrayal of the type of sex that people practice. It made it seem like it was for people that were messed up or dark and it’s not at all."&lt;ref name="uproxx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/showtime-submission-review-late-night/|title=Showtime’s ‘Submission’ Is Trying To Change The Way We Look At Late-Night Erotica|date=19 May 2016|author=Mark Shrayber|work=[[Uproxx]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hoped that the show "can shatter that glass ceiling of false belief and show the world what it truly means to trust, communicate, and finally feel free to talk about what you want and don’t want sexually in a consensual and healthy way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/28/my-bdsm-journey-how-i-became-empowered-through-submission.html|title=My BDSM Journey: How I Became Empowered Through ‘Submission’|author=[[Ashlynn Yennie]]|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer for the series was released on 29 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/submission-trailer-showtime_us_5723d441e4b0b49df6ab6641|title=The Trailer For ‘Submission’ Puts The Sex In ‘Fifty Shades’ To Shame|date=29 April 2016|author=Cole Delbyck|work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = Elliott is disturbed when he receives threatening email from Dylan, who threatens that unless Elliott agrees to ''loan her'' to her, she'll expose him. Elliott tells Ashley that as a part of a submissive experience, she would be loaned to another dominant. Initially baffled, Ashley reluctantly agrees as a trust-building measure. During the submissive experience, Dylan puts her through pain, but she manages to complete it without safeword. Traumatised by the experience, she vows to Elliott that she'll never go through it again. Jules is not satisfied with her threesome and complains that threesomes are overrated. Raif disagrees and recounts his experience of a threesome with two older women, Melanie Masterson (Cherie DeVille) and Roberta Johnson ([[India Summer]]) and claims he satisfied both of them, however Ashley and Jules laughs him off. Jules realizes that she loves only Scarlet and cannot be in the relationship with both Scarlet and Tomas and breaks off the relationship. Dylan decides to move out of the house and while leaving she reveals to Ashley that Elliott is not Nolan Keats, just his [[Copy editing|copy editor]]; Ashley is heart-broken. She informs Elliott that revealing the secret was her ultimate act of domination. The series ends with an angry Ashley breaking up with Elliott, Jules now working for Raif in his cafe, and Dylan at the doorstep of the real Nolan Keats.

[[File:The dancing bear by William Frederick Witherington.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The dancing bear'' by [[William Frederick Witherington]], England, 1822]]

A '''tame bear''', often called a '''dancing bear''', is a wild [[bear]] captured when the animal was young, or born and bred in captivity, and used to entertain people in streets or taverns. Dancing bears were commonplace throughout Europe and Asia from the Middle Ages to the nineteenth century, and can still be found in the 21st century in some countries.

==Dancing bears==

===History===
Dancing bears were commonplace in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. The last of them were freed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8421867.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Last Indian dancing bear set free |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Russia and [[Siberia]], cubs were for centuries captured for use as dancing bears accompanying tavern musicians (skomorokhi), as depicted in the ''Travels'' of [[Adam Olearius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Findeizen |first=Nikolai|title=History of Music in Russia from Antiquity to 1800, Vol. 1: From Antiquity to the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZexDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201 |year=2008 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-02637-8 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dancing bears were widespread throughout Europe from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were still present in the streets of Spain in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neale |first1=Adam |title=Dancing bears in Spain cause public outcry |url=http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2007/10/16/dancing-bears-in-spain-cause-public-outcry/|publisher=The Olive Press |accessdate=4 January 2017 |date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The 15:17 to Paris''''' is a 2018 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] produced and directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] and written by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the autobiography ''The 15:17 to Paris: The True Story of a Terrorist, a Train, and Three American Heroes'' by Jeffrey E. Stern, [[Spencer Stone]], [[Anthony Sadler]], and [[Alek Skarlatos]]. The film stars Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos as themselves and follows the trio as they stop the [[2015 Thalys train attack]]; [[Judy Greer]] and [[Jenna Fischer]] also star.

''The 15:17 to Paris'' was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who called it "well-intentioned" but "strained to wring a full-length feature's worth of drama out of [an event] that was over in a few minutes", and grossed $57 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
[[Spencer Stone]] and [[Alek Skarlatos]] are attending a suburban Christian middle school. They bond over their interest in guns, and are often sent to the principal's office for disciplinary action. Once, while sent to the principal's office, they meet another student, who often misbehaves in school, [[Anthony Sadler]], and the three become friends. Spencer and Alek are from single mother homes, and their mothers often stick up for them when called to the principal's office regarding their misconduct.

While working part time at a smoothie shop, Spencer waits on a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back. The recruiter replies that the [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force pararescue]] save lives and "seem to being doing fine work in the field." Spencer is intrigued and decides  that he wants to join up. So he begins working out to lose some extra weight. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he gets into much better shape and enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.

Upon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for pararescue school. But having poor depth perception, he is turned down. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. His friend, Alek, enlisted in the Army, and has been deployed to Afghanistan. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave. Spencer skypes Anthony, now a college student, and talks him into coming to Europe for a vacation, visiting Italy. Afterwards, the three meet in Germany and decide to go to Amsterdam. After a few days there, they finally decide to visit France after deliberation. They depart from [[Amsterdam Centraal station]] on the 15:17 train to Paris.

On the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When he goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and he is tackled by Spencer, who successfully disarms the terrorist of his weapon. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to further overwhelm the terrorist, finally knocking him out. Spencer then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and they begin to treat his wounds, and the more serious ones of the shot passenger. Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.

In a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of France for their gallantry and bravery. The terrorist was later discovered to have been armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being over a thousand-to-one, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor. French officials at the ceremony to honor Spencer's selfless act acknowledge his bravery and he is awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] in recognition of his act of courage. On September 22, 2015, Mark Moogalian was awarded the Legion of Honor by President [[François Hollande]] for his actions on the train.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 144 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The 15:17 to Paris'' pays clumsily well-intentioned tribute to an act of heroism, but by casting the real-life individuals involved, director Clint Eastwood fatally undermines his own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_1517_to_paris|title=''The 15:17 to Paris'' (2018)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-1517-to-paris|title=''The 15:17 to Paris'' Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Writing for [[Showbiz411]], [[Roger Friedman]] acknowledged the film's attempts to be different by casting the real-life men and said, "If there’s a problem with ''15:17'' it’s that it’s almost filmed like [[cinéma vérité]], certainly as the story unfolds. There’s a lot of exposition and it seems slow. Again, a little patience wouldn’t hurt anyone. Because when the kids’ backstories switch to the main guys, Eastwood finds a groove. Forgive him if the entry seems clunky."&lt;ref name="FriedmanShowbiz411"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.showbiz411.com/2018/02/07/clint-eastwoods-1517-to-paris-is-an-eclectic-mix-of-patriotic-christian-and-cutting-edge|title= REVIEW: Clint Eastwood’s “15:17 to Paris” Is An Eclectic Mix of Patriotic, Christian, and Cutting Edge — And Will Resonate in the Heartland|last=Friedman|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Friedman|date= February 7, 2018|work=[[Showbiz411]]|accessdate= February 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a positive review and wrote, "But [Eastwood's] workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving. Its radical plainness is tinged with mystery."&lt;ref name="AOScottNYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/movies/the-1517-to-paris-review-clint-eastwood.html|title=Review: In ‘The 15:17 to Paris,’ Real Heroes Portray Their Heroism|last=Scott|first=A.

'''''The Partridge Family''''' is an American [[music]]al [[sitcom]] starring [[Shirley Jones]] and featuring [[David Cassidy]]. Jones played a widowed mother, and Cassidy played the oldest of her five children who embarked on a music career. It ran from September 25, 1970, until March 23, 1974, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network as part of a Friday-night lineup, and had subsequent runs in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The family was loosely based on the real-life musical family [[The Cowsills]], a popular band in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Premise==

[[File:Partridge Family first cast 1970.JPG|thumb|left|''The Partridge Family'', season 1. L-R: Shirley Jones, Jeremy Gelbwaks, Suzanne Crough, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce and David Cassidy]]
In the pilot episode, a group of musical siblings in the fictitious city of San Pueblo, California (said to be "40 miles from [[Napa County, California|Napa County]]" in episode 24, "A Partridge By Any Other Name") convinces their widowed mother, bank teller Shirley Partridge, to help them out by singing as they record a pop song in their garage. Through the efforts of precocious 10-year-old Danny they find a manager, Reuben Kincaid, who helps make the song a [[Top 40]] hit. After more persuading, Shirley agrees that the family can go on tour. They acquire an old [[school bus]], a 1957 [[Chevrolet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cmongethappy.com/faq.html| website= CmonGetHappy.com| title= FAQ| date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 6800 [[Superior Coach Company|Superior]], for touring, paint it with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]-inspired patterns, and head to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] for their first live gig at [[Caesars Palace]].

Subsequent episodes usually feature the band performing in various venues or in their garage. The shows often contrast suburban life with the adventures of a show-business family on the road. After the first season, more of the show's action takes place in their hometown than on tour.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
''The Partridge Family'' was created for television by [[Bernard Slade]]; the series' executive producer was Bob Claver. The show was inspired by and loosely based on [[The Cowsills]],&lt;ref name= Cmon /&gt;{{rp|51–52}} a family pop music group that was famous in the late 1960s. In the show's early development, the Cowsill children were considered by the producers, but because the Cowsills were not trained actors and were too old for the roles as scripted, Slade and Claver abandoned that idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url= http://www.cmongethappy.com/interviews/bc/claver2.html |title=An Interview with Bob Claver, part 2 |website= CmonGetHappy.com |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shirley Jones]] had already been signed as mother Shirley Partridge and star of the show.

The [[television pilot|pilot]] was filmed in December 1969. This unaired pilot differs from the pilot broadcast in 1970. In the unaired pilot, Shirley's name is "Connie" and she has a boyfriend played by Jones' real-life husband at the time, [[Jack Cassidy]], father of [[David Cassidy]]. Laurie mentions her late father once getting drunk at a Christmas party, and the family has a different address and live in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partridge Family – The Pilot|url=http://www.davidcassidy.com/fansite/TvFilmPages/PFPilot.html|website=David Cassidy: Official Website|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show proved popular, but the fame took its toll on several, if not most, of the starring cast, particularly David Cassidy. In the midst of his rise to fame, Cassidy soon felt stifled by the show and trapped by the mass hysteria surrounding his every move.&lt;ref name=Cmon /&gt;{{rp|92–95}} In May 1972, he appeared nude on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in a cropped [[Annie Leibovitz]] photo. He used the article to get away from his squeaky clean image.&lt;ref name= Cmon/&gt;{{rp|167}}  Among other things, the article mentions Cassidy was riding around New York in the back of a car "[[Substance intoxication|stoned]] and drunk."&lt;ref name=RSGreen&gt;{{cite journal| work= [[Rolling Stone]] |title= Naked Lunch Box| first= Robin| last= Green| authorlink= Robin Green| date= May 11, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the series ended, scriptwriter Roberta Tatum launched a lawsuit against [[Screen Gems]] concerning the creation of the show. Tatum claimed that she had submitted a similar premise to Screen Gems prior to 1970 called ''Baker's Half-Dozen''. The matter was resolved out of court, with Tatum receiving a reported $150,000 from Screen Gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Appelton| first= Jerry| title= TVQ| work= [[The Toronto Star]]| date= April 21, 1978| page= D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the show's soundtrack and records, none of the actors actually played the indicated instruments, and only Jones and primarily Cassidy sang. The actors pretended while listening to recordings by session musicians who provided the real vocal and instrumental music attributed to The Partridge Family.

===Notable guest stars===
During its four-season run, many actors made guest appearances on the show. Some of them were well known at the time, such as [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[John Astin]], [[Carl Ballantine]],  [[John Banner]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], [[George Chakiris]], [[Dick Clark]] (who later hosted ''[[The Other Half (TV series)|The Other Half]]'' from 2001 to 2003 with Danny Bonaduce), [[Jackie Coogan]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]], [[Ned Glass]], [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]], [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]], [[Pat Harrington Jr.]], [[Arte Johnson]], [[Harvey Lembeck]], [[Art Metrano]], [[Mary Ann Mobley]], [[Harry Morgan]], [[Slim Pickens]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Barbara Rhoades]], [[William Schallert]], [[Nita Talbot]], [[Larry Wilcox]], [[Dick Wilson]], and [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]]. Others would later become famous in other roles, such as [[Meredith Baxter]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], [[Bert Convy]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Norman Fell]], [[Anthony Geary]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], [[Harold Gould]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Season Hubley]], [[Ann Jillian]], [[Gordon Jump]], [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Michael Lembeck]], [[William Lucking]], [[Stuart Margolin]], [[Richard Mulligan]], [[Michael Ontkean]], [[Noam Pitlik]], [[Annette O'Toole]], [[Charlotte Rae]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]], [[Jaclyn Smith]], [[Vic Tayback]], [[Nancy Walker]], and [[Frank Welker]].

[[File:The Partridge Family Cast 1972.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''The Partridge Family'', season 3]]
Country singer [[Johnny Cash]] made an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] in the pilot episode. [[Ray Bolger]] played Shirley's father in three episodes, and [[Rosemary DeCamp]] played Shirley's mother in four episodes. Then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]'s daughter, [[Maureen Reagan]], was also featured in one episode. Future ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' stars [[Jaclyn Smith]], [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Cheryl Ladd]] all made guest appearances on separate episodes.

[[Bobby Sherman]] appeared in the last episode of the first season (Episode 25) as struggling songwriter Bobby Conway. This episode led into a short-lived spinoff series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[Getting Together]]'', starring Sherman and Wes Stern as Bobby Conway's business partner Lionel Poindexter.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of The Partridge Family episodes}}
[[File:Partridge Family 1973.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Shirley Jones and Ricky Segall, season 4]]

==Production==
At the end of the first season, Jeremy Gelbwaks' family moved out of the Los Angeles area, and the part of Chris was recast with actor [[Brian Forster]].  According to David Cassidy, Gelbwaks "had a personality conflict with every person in the cast and the producers" and especially did not get along with Cassidy or Bonaduce.&lt;ref name= Cmon&gt;{{cite book| title= C'mon, Get Happy: Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus| first1= David| last1= Cassidy | first2= Chip| last2= Deffaa| authorlink2= Chip Deffaa| year= 1994| publisher= DBC Enterprises, [[Warner Books]] Inc.| isbn= 9780446395311}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} A dog named Simone was featured in the first season, but it was phased out during the second season. At the beginning of the fourth season, a four-year-old neighbor, Ricky Stevens (Ricky Segall), was featured and would sing a children's song during each episode, but the character was dropped mid-season.

===Music===
Music recorded for the pilot episode was produced by [[Monkees]]' producer [[Shorty Rogers]]. Songs for the ongoing series were recorded by music producer [[Wes Farrell]].

The Partridge Family songs heard in the show, and on the several Partridge Family singles and albums, were not performed as seen on-screen. Actor David Cassidy sang lead on most of the records, and actor Shirley Jones can be heard on a few. But the other voices and all the instruments were recorded by session musicians.

The Partridge Family's instrumental sound was provided by musicians informally known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], who did many of the pop hits of the day attributed to other performers. The actors pretended to play their instruments.

None of the actors sang background; they lip-synched to recorded singing by [[the Ron Hicklin Singers]], composed of brothers John and Tom Bahler, [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] (who as Robin Ward had a #14 hit "Wonderful Summer" on Dot Records in 1963 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/robin-ward|title=Robin Ward|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Ron Hicklin.

Actor David Cassidy was originally to [[lip sync]] with the rest of the cast, but convinced Farrell that he could sing and was allowed to join the studio ensemble as the lead singer.&lt;ref name= Cmon /&gt;{{rp|56–60}} He and his step-mother, Shirley, are the only two show actors allowed to sing for recording.

''The Partridge Family'' theme song, produced by Rogers, was shown over opening credits. More than one song was used as the theme song. Season 1 episodes feature the song "When We're Singin'", which was replaced in subsequent seasons with "C'mon Get Happy".

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"Five of us, and Mom working all day,
we knew we could help her if our music would pay,
Danny got Reuben to sell our song, and it really
came together when Mom sang along..." ''(from "When We're Singin'")''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, under Farrell's direction, the new version had new lyrics sung to the "When We're Singin'" tune.  With the new chorus finalized, "C'mon Get Happy" showcased the new verse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"We had a dream, we'd go travelin' together,
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on.
Somethin' always happens whenever we're together
We get a happy feelin' when we're singing a song..." ''(from "C'Mon Get Happy")''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Broadcast history==
For its final season, ABC moved the show from its 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm Friday night slot (where it rated first in its timeslot) to Saturday at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm (opposite CBS' top-rated ''[[All in the Family]]'', with which it could not compete successfully).  In the UK, the first three episodes were broadcast in a Friday children's slot of 17:20, starting on 17/09/1971. From 02/10/1971, the programme moved to Saturdays at  17:10, and eight episodes were shown at this time. A further episode was shown on New Year's Eve, after which the BBC dropped the programme. After David Cassidy succeeded with UK Top 30 chart hits the following year, the show was picked up by independent commercial television. On London Weekend Television, it was shown on Saturday lunchtimes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&amp;q=the+partridge+family#search|title=Search Results - BBC Genome|author=|date=|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;After the show's popularity began to decline in the US, it began to increase in the UK. This new popularity in the UK gave them five UK Top 20 Hits, some of which were less popular in the States.

After 96 episodes and eight Partridge Family albums, ABC canceled the show.

===Syndication===
[[Nickelodeon]] featured a run of ''The Partridge Family'' from 1993 to 1994 as part of its [[Nick at Nite]] lineup. The network used interviews and commercials featuring cast members, and created a new version of the bus for promotion. The show also aired at various times on [[USA Network]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family]], [[Ion Television]], and [[Hallmark Channel]]. {{As of|January 2011}}, it airs on [[Antenna TV]]. [[Fetv|FETV]] also started airing ''The Partridge Family'' in December 2017.

The cast was reunited in 1977 on the special ''Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons''. Reunited again in the 1990s on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and ''The Danny Bonaduce Show'' and were featured on ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' and VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''.

When the digital subchannel Antenna TV premiered in January 2011, ''The Partridge Family'' became one of its offerings through the network's distribution agreement with [[Sony Pictures Television]] (parent company and successor of series producer [[Screen Gems]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antennatv.tv/shows/partridgefamily/ |title=Partridge Family &amp;#124; Antenna TV – Antenna TV |website=AntennaTV.tv |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326132525/http://www.antennatv.tv/shows/partridgefamily/ |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtvusaforum.com/general-tv-chat/42645-antenna-tvs-fall-schedule.html |title=Antenna TV's Fall Schedule |website= Dtvusaforum.com |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Pavan|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/07/antenna-tv-fall-2011-schedule-own-and.html |title=Antenna TV Fall 2011 Schedule; OWN and TLC Acquires Undercover Boss Repeats for Fall 2012 |website= sitcomsonline.com |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate= 2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktla.com/entertainment/antennatv/ |title=Antenna TV: Classic Television and Movies on KTLA's Antenna TV 5.2 |website=[[KTLA]].com |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318102823/http://www.ktla.com/entertainment/antennatv/ |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discography===

{{main|The Partridge Family discography}}
''The Partridge Family'' was produced for ABC by Screen Gems. The company promoted the show by releasing a series of albums featuring the family band, though David Cassidy and Shirley Jones, who sang background, were the only cast members who were actually featured on the recordings.&lt;ref name= Cmon /&gt;{{rp|56–60}}

As the show and other associated merchandising soared, [[David Cassidy]] became a [[teen idol]].&lt;ref name= Cmon /&gt;{{rp|68–73}} The producers signed Cassidy as a solo act as well. Cassidy began touring with his own group of musicians, performing Partridge songs as well as hits from his own albums, to thousands of screaming teenagers in major stadiums across the USA, UK, Europe, Japan and Australia.

The Partridge Family's biggest hit came in 1970 with the song "[[I Think I Love You]]", written by [[Tony Romeo]] (who had previously written several of the Cowsills' hits), peaked at Number 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in December of that year. It sold over five million copies, outselling the [[Beatles]]' "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]", was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]], and made the group the third fictional artist to have a No. 1 hit (after [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|The Chipmunks]] and [[The Archies]]).&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= 284| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's companion LP, ''[[The Partridge Family Album]]'', reached Number 4 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was also awarded a gold disc by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in December 1970, having sold over 500,000 copies.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/&gt; A string of hit Partridge singles followed: "[[Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted]]", "[[I'll Meet You Halfway]]", "[[I Woke Up In Love This Morning]]", "[[It's One of Those Nights (Yes Love)]]", "[[Am I Losing You]]", "[[Looking Through the Eyes of Love]]", "[[Breaking Up Is Hard to Do]]", and "A Friend and a Lover".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tsort.info/music/vqq60e.htm | title = TSORT Song Artist 592 – The Partridge Family | website= TSORT.info| accessdate = June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These singles were showcased on million-selling albums including ''[[Up To Date]]'', ''[[Sound Magazine]]'', ''[[Shopping Bag]]'', ''Notebook'', ''[[Crossword Puzzle]]'', and ''[[Bulletin Board (album)|Bulletin Board]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tsort.info/music/tweqe1.htm| website= TSORT.info| title = TSORT Album Artist 994 – The Partridge Family | accessdate = June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their holiday album ''[[A Partridge Family Christmas Card]]'' was the No. 1 selling Christmas record of 1971.&lt;ref name= Whitburn&gt;{{cite book | last = Whitburn  | first = Joel | title = Christmas in the Charts (1920–2004) | publisher = Record Research Inc. | year= 2004 | location = Wisconsin  | page = 179 | isbn = 0-89820-161-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Record sales success was replicated internationally, with both The Partridge Family (group) and David Cassidy (solo) achieving huge hits in Canada, Great Britain, Europe, Japan, Australia, [[New Zealand]] and South Africa. In all, The Partridge Family released 89 songs on 9 albums between 1970 and 1973.

===Danny Bonaduce album===
Though Danny Bonaduce was not part of the session band, he also got a recording contract, and released a self-titled album in 1972, ''Danny Bonaduce''. Though Bonaduce was credited as lead singer on all songs, he insists that he had a weak voice and that [[Bruce Roberts (singer)|Bruce Roberts]] provided most of the vocals on the album. The first track, "I'll Be Your Magician", in which the 13-year-old Bonaduce seduces a woman into having sexual intercourse with him, has developed a [[cult following]] for its [[camp (style)|campy]] entertainment value. The original, watered-down, version was recorded with Cassidy for the ''Sound Magazine'' album, but was discarded and never released. In fall 2010, Cassidy dared Bonaduce to learn how to play the bass guitar lines on the songs the Partridge Family performed. Bonaduce learned the bass guitar line for "Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted", stating that although he had no ability to read music, the song was relatively easy to learn; Cassidy and Bonaduce subsequently performed together on rare occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Wayne (April 10, 2011). [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MUSIC_CASSIDY_BONADUCE_REUNION?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT David Cassidy, Danny Bonaduce play Partridge song]. ''Associated Press''. Retrieved 2011-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ricky Segall album===
In conjunction with the songs featured by Ricky Segall in the fourth season of the TV show, Bell Records released the album ''Ricky Segall and The Segalls'' in 1973.  Seven of the album's ten tracks were featured on the TV show.  Two tracks were also released as a single: "Sooner or Later"/"Say Hey Willie" (Bell 45429).

===Animated spin-off===
The Partridges had a brief resurgence in animated form which saw the family propelled into the future. The animated Partridges first appeared when the kids did a series of guest spots on ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]''. That idea evolved into a [[CBS]] Saturday morning [[Hanna-Barbera]]-produced cartoon in 1974, ''[[Partridge Family 2200 A.D.]]'' (also called ''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'' when rerun later as part of ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''). Shirley Jones and David Cassidy did not voice their animated characters and Susan Dey and Dave Madden had very limited involvement with this cartoon.

===Board game===
Released in 1971 by [[Milton Bradley]], The Partridge Family Game offers a glimpse of what life on the road was like for one of TV’s favorite fictional pop bands. The back of the box explains, “As on TV, many happenings occur to the Partridge family, this game describes one of them. They have finished playing at a local arena and must hurry to their BUS to get traveling again. On the way, they may have some delays.” The object of the game is to be the first player to get back to the tour bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=The Partridge Family Game|url=https://toytales.ca/the-partridge-family-game/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
[[Charlton Comics]] produced a comic book featuring The Partridge Family between March 1971 and December 1973. It features stories about the characters, song lyrics and features about David Cassidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Ian |last= Shirley| title= Can Rock &amp; Roll Save the World?: An Illustrated History of Music and Comics| publisher= SAF Publishing Ltd| year= 2005| isbn= 0946719802 |pages= 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings were provided by [[Don Sherwood (cartoonist)|Don Sherwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=238081| title= Partridge Family (1971) comic books| website= MyComicShop.com| access-date= December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sherwood_don.htm| title= Don Sherwood: (2 September 1930 – 6 March 2010, USA)| work= Lambiek Encyclopedia| access-date= December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reunion special===
Three years after the show's cancellation, Shirley Jones and other cast members gathered with cast members of ''[[My Three Sons]]'' for the ABC special ''Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons'', that aired on November 25, 1977. The show featured the casts discussing the histories of their shows, although other than Jones and [[Fred MacMurray]] both portraying single parents of large families, the two series had no narrative link.

===Reunion on ''Danny!''===
In 1995, a majority of the cast appeared on Bonaduce's talk show ''Danny!'', including Shirley Jones, Dave Madden, Jeremy Gelbwaks, Brian Forster, Suzanne Crough, Ricky Segall and the show's executive producer Bob Claver.  Susan Dey was working on a movie at the time but called into the show to briefly reminisce with Bonaduce.  David Cassidy was also unable to appear as he was working on a new album at that time.

===''The New Partridge Family''===
In 2004, [[VH1]] produced a pilot for a syndicated ''The New Partridge Family'', starring Suzanne Sole as Shirley, Leland Grant as Keith, [[Emma Stone]] as Laurie and Spencer Tuskowski as Danny. The pilot was the only episode produced.

===Home Media===
[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] has released all 4 Seasons of ''The Partridge Family'' in DVD Region 1. Seasons 1 and 2 have been released in Regions 2 and 4.

On October 15, 2013, Sony released ''The Partridge Family – The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Partridge-Family-The-Complete-Series/18703 |title=The Partridge Family DVD news: Announcement for The Partridge Family – The Complete Series |website=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916214516/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Partridge-Family-The-Complete-Series/18703 |archivedate=September 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 12-disc set features all 96 episodes of the series as well as bonus features.

'''Transmediation''' is the process of translating a work into a different medium. The definition of what constitutes transmediation would depend on how medium is defined or interpreted. In [[Understanding Media|Understanding media]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] offered a quite broad of medium "an extension of ourselves": &lt;blockquote&gt;"In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30734000|title=Understanding media : the extensions of man|last=1911-1980.|first=McLuhan, Marshall,|others=Lapham, Lewis H.,|isbn=0262631598|edition=First MIT Press edition, 1994|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=30734000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From McLuhan's definition, it is possible to infer the definition of transmediation could involve at least two different dimensions: a [[sensory]]{{dn|date=October 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña|first=Ernesto|last2=James|first2=Kedrick|date=2018-04-10|title=Raw Harmonies: Transmediation through raw data|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01635|journal=Leonardo|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1162/leon_a_01635|issn=0024-094X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] translation. When referring to medium as a sensory mode, transmediation would require to move between sensory modes (e.g., visual to aural, aural to tactile). When referring to transmediation as semiotic translation, transmediation can refer to the process of "responding to cultural texts in a range of sign systems -- art, movement, sculpture, dance, music, and so on -- as well as in words." [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/semali2/ Semali and Fueyo] 

Transmediation may utilize more than one media form. All the components of a transmediated work are interlinked with each other to form the whole network. Therefore, transmediated works are closely linked to semiotics and technology in the context of digital media. Transmediation can include response to traditional printed texts, as well as [[multimedia]] materials including [[video]], [[animation]], a [[website]], a [[podcast]], a [[game]], etc.

Transmediation is closely linked to [[semiotics]], which is the impact study of signs. Academic researchers and educators interested in transmediation are often also interested in [[media literacy]], [[visual literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[critical literacy]].

[http://www.edutopia.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=art_1361&amp;issue=oct_05 Leonard Shlain] highlights the importance of engaging students in the process of transmediation when writing, "Digital information comes in multiple forms, and students must learn to tell stories not just with words and numbers but also through images, graphics, color, sound, music, and dance. There is a grammar and literacy to each of these forms of communication. Bombarded with a wide variety of images regularly, students need sharp visual-interpretation skills to interact with the media analytically. Each form of communication has its own rules and grammar and should be taught in ways that lead students to be more purposeful, specific, and concise in communicating."

'''Unite Union''' (Unite) is a [[trade union]] in [[New Zealand]]. It represents a number of workers across various industries, and was the sponsor of the [http://www.supersizemypay.com Supersizemypay.com] campaign directed towards improving working conditions for fast food workers in the country, in addition to representing other hospitality and retail workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworkerarchive.net.nz/~server/Socialist_Worker_NZ_Archive/Unity_(2006)_files/UNITY%20June%2006%20laid%20up.pdf Beat the brands: SuperSizeMyPay part one] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195923/http://www.socialistworkerarchive.net.nz/~server/Socialist_Worker_NZ_Archive/Unity_(2006)_files/UNITY%20June%2006%20laid%20up.pdf |date=July 24, 2011 }}, Unity journal, June 2006, pp12-26&lt;/ref&gt; Unite is affiliated with the [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions]].

== History ==
In mid 2003 a small group of trade unionists and activists attempted to "organise the unorganised". It began to focus on unionising workers predominantly from fast food, cinema and security.

In response to the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Key Government's]] [[Employment Relations Act 2000#2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act|amendment to the Employment Relations Act 2000]] allowing small businesses greater liberty to 'hire and fire' workers in the first 90 days, Unite established the 'Rat Patrol' to [[name and shame]] companies that abuse the legislation.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_2507459"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/unite-holds-rat-patrol-in-aotea-square-2507459 |title=Unite holds 'Rat Patrol' in Aotea Square |date=28 February 2009 |agency=[[Newstalk ZB]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matt McCarten]]'s United Support Services, a company he formed to supply support services to the union, was placed into liquidation on 17 June 2011 owing $92,000 in unpaid taxes to the IRD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/mccartens-unite-liquidated-mn-p-95547|title=McCarten's Unite liquidated|first=|date=17 June 2011|work=National Business Review|subscription=yes|access-date=|via=|author=Matt Nippert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Unite engaged in the [http://www.unite.org.nz/end_zero_hours End Zero Hours] campaign, primarily aimed at securing minimum guarantees of hours in union collective employment agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11441887 |title=Celebrations after McDonald's ends zero hour contracts|date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was ultimately successful with the National Government passing legislation outlawing "zero hour contracts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.business.govt.nz/news/times-up-for-zero-hour-contracts/|title=Time's up for 'zero-hour' contracts|website=www.business.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the inspiration for the [[Unite Union (Australia)|Australian UNITE Union]], which was founded in [[Melbourne]] in 2003.

Following the match, Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality, and expressed excitement over the event.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

In the following match, Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

Next, the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions, Cesaro and Sheamus. In the end, Hardy distracted Sheamus, allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him. Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the titled.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

Jeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal. Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

After that, The Bludgeon Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained the titles after performing The Reckoning on Jimmy Uso.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

Next, Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor, Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match. Near the end of the match, Balor attempted to retrieve the title, only for Rollins to springboard onto the ladder and retrieve the title belt, thus retaining the championship.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

In a segment between matches, four prospects from the recent Saudi tryouts came out to the ring to introduce themselves. Cruiserweight [[Ariya Daivari]] and his brother [[Shawn Daivari]], who had not appeared for WWE in many years, came out to interrupt them. The Saudi prospects attacked and cleared the Daivari brothers from the ring.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

Later, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics, such as a low blow, increasingly frustrating Styles. In the end, both Nakamura and Styles fought outside of the ring, only for the match to end in a double countout. After the match, Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm to the floor on Nakamura.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

After that, The Undertaker fought Rusev (who was accompanied by Aiden English) in a Casket match. At the end of the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket. Before he could close the lid, English attacked the Undertaker, who retaliated with another chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

In the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match. Reigns performed three spears on Lesnar for a near-fall. As Reigns tried to escape through the door, Heyman pushed the door into Reigns, allowing Lesnar to execute an F5 on Reigns for a near-fall. In the end, Reigns performed a Spear through the cage wall on Lesnar. Despite Reigns touching the floor first, the referee awarded the win to Lesnar, thereby retaining the Universal Championship.&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

===Main event===
[[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Dolph Ziggler]] began the 50-man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants. Bryan survived until the final three, beating [[Rey Mysterio]] for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes. In the end, [[Big Cass]] eliminated Bryan and attempted a big boot on [[Braun Strowman]], who countered and eliminated Cass to win the match. Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13, beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12.&lt;ref name=ViewReport&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Adam|title=WWE Royal Rumble PPV results 1/26/14 - (30 man Rumble)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/46382-wwe-royal-rumble-ppv-results-1-26-14-30-man-royal-rumble|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-match, Strowman received a trophy and a [[#Championship belt|green championship belt]].&lt;ref name="GreatestRR"/&gt;

==Controversy==
{{see also|Women in WWE}}
{{further|Terrorism in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen}}
WWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers, who were unable to perform at the event due to the [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uproxx"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/john-cena-triple-h-greatest-royal-rumble-no-womens-matches/ | title =WWE Reveals New Matches For The Greatest Royal Rumble, But No Women’s Wrestling Allowed | last =Collins | first =Elle | date =March 26, 2018 | website =[[Uproxx]] | access-date =April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Triple H]], WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, responded to the criticism: "I understand that people are questioning it, but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you don’t agree with a certain aspect of it, it doesn’t mean it’s not a relevant culture...You can’t dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women’s evolution in the world and what you can’t do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it....While women are not competing in the event, we have had discussions about that and hope that, in the next few years they will be".&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/wwe-mma-wrestling/wwe-greatest-royal-rumble-saudi-arabia-triple-h-interview-defends-no-women-wrestlers-a8319446.html | title =WWE Greatest Royal Rumble: Triple H defends hosting event in Saudi Arabia without any women wrestlers | last =Paddock | first =Matty | date =April 24, 2018 | website = [[The Independent]] | access-date =April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were in attendance for the event, though only if [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Male guardians|accompanied by a male guardian]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; This was a major change from previous events, which were only open to men. [[Associated Press]] noted that this is due to "a series of social changes" by the Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/a05bf0eea74b4a9a9a776ae5039c7066|title=Women, children attend wrestling event in Saudi Arabia|website=apnews.com|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the event, WWE aired a promotional video, which included WWE female wrestlers. The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for "indecent material" that aired at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/117156/apology-issued-for-indecent-material-aired-during-greatest-royal-rumble.html?p=1|title=APOLOGY ISSUED FOR 'INDECENT' MATERIAL AIRED DURING GREATEST ROYAL RUMBLE - PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In addition to the women, wrestler [[Sami Zayn]] did not participate in the event as Zayn is of [[Syrian people|Syrian]] descent, and Saudi Arabia has [[Saudi Arabia–Syria relations#Syrian civil war|strained relations]] with Syria. On the Raw after the event, a storyline excuse was given in where Sami was suffering from vertigo given to him by Bobby Lashley and therefore couldn’t compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/117141/vince-thanks-saudi-arabia-backstage-notes-and-more-from-greatest-royal-rumble.html?p=1|title=VINCE THANKS SAUDI ARABIA, BACKSTAGE NOTES AND MORE FROM GREATEST ROYAL RUMBLE|website=PWInsider|date=2018-04-28|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subject of criticism was the situation of [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia]], as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/26/wwe-greatest-royal-rumble-saudi-arabia-women-lgbt-rights/amp/?__twitter_impression=true|title=WWE is hosting Greatest Royal Rumble in Saudi Arabia and LGBT+ fans are not happy about it – PinkNews|website=www.pinknews.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]], a militant group offshoot of [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[Yemen]], issued a warning to bin Salman and criticized the WWE event stating that "Disbelieving wrestlers exposed their privates and on most of them was the sign of the cross, in front of a mixed gathering of young Muslim men and women. The corruptors did not stop at that, for every night musical concerts are being announced, as well as movies and circus shows."&lt;ref&gt;https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Periodicals/aqap-condemned-saudi-entertainment-and-sports-authorities-points-to-wwe-event-in-jeddah-as-example-of-sin.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/06/01/563541/Saudi-Arabia-alQaeda-Crown-Prince-Mohammed-bin-Salman-Yemen-United-States&lt;/ref&gt;

* By eliminating 13 men, [[Braun Strowman]] broke the record of 12, set by [[Roman Reigns]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2014)|2014 Royal Rumble]].
* [[Daniel Bryan]] broke the longevity record for lasting 1:16:05, previous record held by [[Rey Mysterio]] (lasting 1:02:12) at the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]].

===Championship belt===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GreatestRoyalRumbleChamp.jpg|thumb|300px|The WWE Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt with default side plates]] --&gt;
At the conclusion of the Greatest Royal Rumble, [[Braun Strowman]] was awarded a trophy and a championship title. The role of this Greatest Royal Rumble Championship, however remains unclear. According to ''The Sportster'', "the likelihood is that nothing that took place in the main event will have any effect on anything once WWE arrives back in the United States and resume normal service."&lt;ref name="Sportster"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesportster.com/news/wwe-reveals-greatest-royal-rumble-championship-belt/?view=list|title=WWE Reveals Greatest Royal Rumble Championship Belt [Photo]|date=April 27, 2018|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, the belt has not reappeared on WWE programs.

The base design is similar to the [[WWE Championship#Current design|current design of the WWE Championship]], with some differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars|title=Superstars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate is modeled with an Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center. Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016 and 2017, the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt contains two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates show the official logo of [[General Sports Authority|Saudi General Sports Authority]], which is identical to the [[Emblem of Saudi Arabia|national emblem of Saudi Arabia]]. The plates are on a green leather strap resembling the color of the [[Flag of Saudi Arabia|national flag of Saudi Arabia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="831">The '''xaxado''' ({{IPA-pt|ʃaˈʃadu}}) is a popular [[dance]] created in the [[Sertão]] of [[Pernambuco]] state, [[Brazil]].  It was often practiced by ''[[Cangaço|cangaceiro]]s'' of the region to commemorate victory in battle; it is also practiced as a traditional dance by the local population as a whole.

The name ''xaxado'' comes from the noise made by the ''cangaceiros''' [[sandal]]s as they strike the [[sand]] during the dance.

'''''Écriture féminine''''' translates from the [[French language|French]] as "women's writing".&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, Chris. ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Literary Terms''. OUP, 1990. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory, which unpacks the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Showalter|Showalter, Elaine]]. Critical Inquiry, Vol. 8, No. 2, Writing and Sexual Difference, (Winter, 1981), pp. 179-205. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343159&lt;/ref&gt; is a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s through the work of theorists including [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Luce Irigaray]],&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce, ''Speculum of the Other Woman'', Cornell University Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Chawaf]],&lt;ref&gt;Cesbron, Georges, " Ecritures au féminin. Propositions de lecture pour quatre livres de femmes" in Degré Second, juillet 1980: 95-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mistacco, Vicki, "Chantal Chawaf," in Les femmes et la tradition litteraire - Anthologie du Moyen Âge à nos jours; Seconde partie: XIXe-XXIe siècles, Yale Press, 2006, 327-343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Clément]], and [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia  ''Revolution in Poetic Language'', Columbia University Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "To Inscribe in the Feminine: A Kristevan Impossibility? Or Femininity, Melancholy and Sublimation." ''Parallax, n. 8'', [Vol. 4(3)], 1998. 81-117.&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently been extended by writers such as psychoanalytic theorist [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''Matrix . Halal(a) - Lapsus. Notes on Painting, 1985-1992''. MOMA, Oxford, 1993. ({{ISBN|0-905836-81-2}}). Reprinted in: ''Artworking 1985-1999''. Edited by Piet Coessens. Ghent-Amsterdam: Ludion / Brussels: Palais des Beaux-Arts, 2000. ({{ISBN|90-5544-283-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'' (essays 1994-1999), Minnesota University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who emerged in this field in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, "Does Art Think?", in: ''Art and Thought'' Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Écriture féminine as a theory foregrounds the importance of language for the psychic understanding of self. The theory draws on the foundational work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as 'other' in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own outsiderness.&lt;ref&gt;"Murfin, Ross C." http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cixous==

[[Hélène Cixous]] first coined ''écriture féminine'' in her essay, "[[Hélène Cixous#The Laugh of the Medusa (1975)|The Laugh of the Medusa]]" (1975), where she asserts "woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies" because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous' essay, a recent book titled ''Laughing with Medusa'' (2006) analyzes the collective work of [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam, ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as "the French feminists," though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that [[Post-structural feminism|"poststructuralist theoretical feminists"]] would be a more accurate term.&lt;ref name="Klages" /&gt; [[Madeleine Gagnon]] is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women's studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group ''Psychanalyse et politique'' and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, ''des femmes''. And when asked of her own writing she says, "''Je suis là où ça parle''" ("I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.") &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist critic and writer [[Elaine Showalter]] defines this movement as "the inscription of the feminine body and female difference in language and text."&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, Elaine. "Feminist Criticism in the Wilderness." ''The New Feminist Criticism: essays on women, literature, and theory''. Elaine Showalter, ed. London: Virago, 1986. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Écriture féminine'' places experience before language, and  privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades "the discourse that regulates the [[phallogocentrism|phallocentric]] system."&lt;ref&gt;Cixous, Hélène. "The Laugh of the Medusa." ''New French Feminisms''. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron, eds. New York: Schocken, 1981. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, “the female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes”.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ecriture féminine'' thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.&lt;ref&gt;However, the phallogocentric argument has been criticised by W. A. Borody as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of ‘’indeterminateness’’ in Western culture.  Borody claims that the "black and white" view that the masculine = determinateness and the feminine = indeterminateness contains a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a form of gender-othering it originally sought to overcome. See Wayne A. Borody (1998) pp. 3, 5 "[http://kenstange.com/nebula/feat013/feat013.html Figuring the Phallogocentric Argument with Respect to the Classical Greek Philosophical Tradition]." ''Nebula: A Netzine of the Arts and Science'', Vol. 13 (pp. 1-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Rosemarie Tong, “Cixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie Putnam. Feminist Thought : A More Comprehensive Introduction. New York: Westview P, 2008.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright.&lt;ref name=Klages&gt;Klages, Mary. "[http://www.colorado.edu/English/courses/ENGL2012Klages/cixous.html Helene Cixous: The Laugh of the Medusa]."&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric writing]], Tong argues that "male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the "big dick", is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring" and furthermore, that "stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; not ''yourself''. Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don't like the true texts of women- female-sexed texts. That kind scares them.&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Cixous, Summer 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Cixous, ''écriture féminine'' is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as [[James Joyce]] or [[Jean Genet]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous’ definition of ''écriture féminine'' (often termed ‘white ink’) because of the many references she makes to the female body (“There is always in her at least a little of that good mother’s milk. She writes in white ink”.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, Mary. "Helene Cixous: 'The Laugh of the Medusa.&lt;/ref&gt;) when characterizing the essence of écriture féminine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Ecriture féminine'', then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises many problems. The realm of the body, for instance, is seen as somehow immune to social and gender condition and able to issue forth a pure essence of the feminine. Such essentialism is difficult to square with feminism which emphasizes femininity as a social construction…"&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002.128.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Irigaray and Kristeva==

For Luce Irigaray, women's sexual pleasure ''[[jouissance]]'' cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, "logical," masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed [[Julia Kristeva#The semiotic|the semiotic]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garrattt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called ''parler femme'', womanspeak)&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women's sexuality and women's language through the following analogy: women's ''jouissance'' is more multiple than men's unitary, phallic pleasure because &lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Ross C. http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more diffusive than its 'masculine counterpart'. That is undoubtedly the reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to discern the coherence." &lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce. [[This Sex]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

The approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically 'French' in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toril Moi|Moi, Toril, ed.]] ''French Feminist Thought''. Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1987. ({{ISBN|0-631-14972-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in practice the French women's movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the [[International Women's Day|8 March]]; fought hard for women's right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women's rights.

Further criticisms of écriture féminine include its essentialist view of the body; its over-reliance on a feminism of 'difference'; and its tendency to demonise not only the masculine but those (many) women authors who write or have written in more conventional, linear literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Holmes, ''French Women's Writings, 1848-1994'' (1996) p. 228-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

As a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of "écriture féminine", very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool.&lt;ref&gt;See however Frédéric Regard, ''L'écriture féminine en Angleterre'', Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. S. Byatt]] offers: "There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (''langue'', tongue)".&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1990) p. 244-5&lt;/ref&gt;
