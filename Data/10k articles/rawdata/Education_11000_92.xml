Various methods of '''academic grading in New Zealand''' are shown below.

==Secondary schools==
===NCEA===
The [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]], the current national secondary school qualifications, uses standard-based assessment. Assessment for Achievement Standards uses a four-grade system, the lowest being a failing grade, while Unit Standards use a simple achieved/not achieved (pass/fail) grade system.

|-
| {{no|Standard Not Attempted}}

|}

Several schools in New Zealand, predominantly in Auckland, also offer the CIE ([[Cambridge International Examinations]]) Program and IB ([[International Baccalaureate]])  in addition to NCEA.

===School Certificate===
Until 2002, [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]], the predecessor to NCEA Level 1, used a norm-based five-grade system.

==Universities==
New Zealand universities generally award letter grades (i.e. A to D) to students, with +/- variations. These letter grades correspond to percentage mark bands, though these vary between universities (common cut-offs for A+ include 90% and 85%, and even within a university, an A+ from one department may vary from an A+ from another, with the actual cut-off subject to discretion). D grade is a failing grade, corresponding to work receiving less than 50%. However, for Honours degrees, the letter grades also correspond to degree classes, with A+/A/A- grades corresponding to a first, B+/high B corresponding to 2:1, etc.

D and E are failing grades, received by approximately 47.4% of New Zealanders at some point in a child's school and college career (according to JOPDHG study 2007). ''Grade Value'' is used to convert ''Grade'' into GPA (e.g., A+ = 9). ''Averaged GPA'' is used to convert GPA back into ''Grade.' (e.g., 8.57 = A+). Note that some courses may employ different ranges in grade designation, such as starting A+ from 90%.

{{Grading}}
'''Academic grading in the United States''' commonly takes on the form of five, six or seven [[Grading in education|letter grades]]. Traditionally, the grades are A+, A, A−; B+, B, B−; C+, C, C−; D+, D, D−; F; with A+ being the highest and F, short for ''failed'', the lowest. Numeric to letter grade conversions generally vary from system to system and between disciplines and status. In some cases, grades can be numerical, from 0 to 4, with 0 being the worst and 4 being the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5174/supp-4|title=File S1: Supplementary 3D PDF of synchrotron-based micro-CT|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerical and letter grades==
The typical grades awarded for participation in a course are (from highest to lowest) (S), A, B, C, D, and F. Variations on the traditional five-grade system allow for awarding A+, A, &amp; A−; B+, B, &amp; B−; C+, C, &amp; C−; D+, D, &amp; D−,and F+, F, &amp; F−. In primary and secondary schools, a D is usually the lowest passing grade, however, there are some schools that consider a C the lowest passing grade, so the general standard is that anything below a 60 or 70 is failing, depending on the grading scale. In college and universities, a D is considered to be an unsatisfactory passing grade. Students will usually still earn credit for the class if they get a D, but sometimes a C or better is required to count some major classes toward a degree, and sometimes a C or better is required to satisfy a prerequisite requirement for a class.

Below is the grading system found to be most commonly used in [[Education in the United States#Public and private schools|United States public high schools]], according to the 2009 High School Transcript Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is Grade Average Calculated?|url=http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/howgpa.aspx|website=National Center for Educational Statistics|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=14 February 2015|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503013210/http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/howgpa.aspx|archivedate=3 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most used grading system, however, there are some schools that use an edited version of the college system.

&lt;!-- This grading scale has single gaps between all grades, I think it could be fixed --&gt;

==How grades are assigned to students==
In a percentage-based system, each assignment regardless of size, type, or complexity, is given a percentage score: nine correct answers out of ten is a score of 90%. The overall grade for the class is then typically [[weighting|weighted]] so that the final grade represents a stated proportion of different types of work. For example, daily homework may be counted as 50% of the final grade, chapter quizzes may count for 20%, the comprehensive final exam may count for 20%, and a major project may count for the remaining 10%. Each are created to evaluate the students understanding of the material and of their complex understanding of the course material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5174/supp-4|title=File S1: Supplementary 3D PDF of synchrotron-based micro-CT|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary school, grades may represent rewards from teachers "for being friendly, prepared, compliant, a good school citizen, well organized and hard-working" rather than mastering the subject material.&lt;ref name=Tyre&gt;{{cite news |title=A's for Good Behavior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/weekinreview/28tyre.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |author=Tyre, Peggy |date=27 November 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107133109/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/weekinreview/28tyre.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=7 November 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in the United States have been accused of using academic grades to penalize students for being bored, uncooperative or for talking out of turn. Usually, this behavior leads to poor or non-existent studying habits which most likely are to blame for their grades.&lt;ref name=McKeown&gt;{{cite news |title=The Problem with Standards-Based Grading |url=https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/problem-standards-based-grading |author=McKeown, Joe |date=13 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415200413/https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/problem-standards-based-grading |archivedate=2017-04-15 |df= |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers use [[self and peer assessment]] to evaluate some of a student's progress.

==Standards-based grading==
With the adoption of [[Outcome-based education|standards-based education]], most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student should know and be able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Test Development |last=Webb|first=Norman L.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=2006|isbn=|location=Mahwah, N.J|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.

As an instrument of systemic reform, the tests are targeted to items and skills not currently in the curriculum{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} to promote adoption of methods such as constructivist mathematics, inquiry-based science, and problem solving.

Grades can be enhanced by [[extra credit]]s, awarded where students undertake optional work, additional to their compulsory school work.&lt;ref name=Lucas2004&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lucas |first1=Sandra Goss |last2=Bernstein |first2=Douglas A. |year=2004 |title=Teaching Psychology |pages=36 |isbn=1-4051-5150-1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an example of standard-based grading, see "The 1-2-3-4 System" below.

==Rank-based grading==
[[Grading on a curve]] is any system wherein the group performance is used to moderate evaluation; it need not be strictly or purely rank-based.

In the most extreme form, students are ranked and grades are assigned according to a student's [[class rank|rank]], placing students in direct competition with one another.

One model uses percentages derived from a [[normal distribution]] model of educational performance. The top grade, A, is given here for performance that exceeds the [[mean]] by +1.5 [[standard deviation]]s, a B for performance between +0.5 and +1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Slavin, ''Educational Psychology: Theory into Practice'', (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1986, p.556–57&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the absolute performance of the students, the best score in the group receives a top grade, and the worst score receives a failing grade.

Rank-based grading is popular among some American educators, usually under the [[euphemism]] of grade rationing. The arguments for grade-rationing{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} are that:
* [[Grade inflation]], which is a serious problem in education &lt;ref&gt;Valerie Strauss, "Why grade inflation (even at Harvard) is a big problem," ''The Washington Post'', December 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030804/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/ |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which more students receive high grades, is mathematically impossible in a rank-based system, because the teacher cannot rate all students as being better than all of the other students: someone must be ranked better, and someone must be ranked worse. Historical measures of performance in the subject matter may no longer apply, as human knowledge has increased substantially over time. Rank-based grading compares current students to each other, rather than to a standard that may have been set decades before.
* Rank-based grading may push some students to their greatest performance potential by appealing to their competitive instincts.
* Rank-based grading shows how the student compares to other students, who all had the same instructor with the same lessons and homework during the same time period. If grades are meant to represent the student's relative ability to learn, rather than to certify that the student knows and can do certain things, then rank-based grading shows clear superiority in methodology to non-curved methods of grading. However, if the purpose of grading is purely to indicate abilities learned, then a non-ranked system is more appropriate.
* As many [[corporation]]s used rank-based evaluation measures, sometimes even related to [[termination of employment|termination]] (see: [[Vitality curve|rank and yank]]) such grading prepares students for the corporate world. By limiting success and recognition to the top-performing students, the grading system becomes a relevant measure of student performance in relation to their peers. In this way, rank-based grading prevents the illusion that students are competitive in areas in which they are actually only competent.

The arguments against rank-based grading are similar:
* Rank-based grading only measures performance relative to a given group, but not the real achievements of a given student. A student with moderate skills could be the best of a bad group, or the worst of a good group. For example, in a generally good class the pressure to assign grades along the curve would produce an artificial 7% of F students, although all students actually performed quite well. This also works the other way round: in a class with generally bad performance, the students whose performances are not totally bad would be singled out to form an artificial group of A-students, although in another context they would never get these grades.
* There is no actual evidence that a given group really performs along the normal curve. The distribution may not match the pattern at all.
* Rank-based grades become meaningless when taken out of the context of a given class or school. To understand what a rank-based grade indicates, it is necessary to understand the overall performance of the entire group on an absolute scale.

Numerical values are applied to grades as follows:
* A = 4
* B = 3
* C = 2
* D = 1
* F = 0

This allows grades to be easily averaged. Additionally, many schools add .33 for a + grade and subtract .33 for a − grade. Thus, a B+ yields a 3.33 whereas an A– yields a 3.67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentspreunited.com/page/GPA4pointcalculator|title=GPA Calculator 4 Point Scale|author=|date=|website=StudentsPreunited.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A+s, if given, are usually assigned a value of 4.0 (equivalent to an A) due to the common assumption that a 4.00 is the best possible grade-point average, although 4.33 is awarded at some institutions. In some places, .25 or .3 instead of .33 is added for a + grade and subtracted for a − grade. Other institutions maintain a mid-grade and award .5 for the grade. For example, an AB would receive a 3.5-grade point and a BC would receive a 2.5-grade point.

The industry standard for graduation from undergraduate institutions is a minimum 2.0 average. Most graduate schools have required a 3.0-grade point average since 1975 (the transition began two decades earlier), but some schools still have 2.75 as their pass standard. Some doctoral programs do not have a formal pass standard, but it is unlikely that they would retain a student who is doing work below 'B' quality.

Most American law schools require no more than a 2.0-grade point average to qualify for the professional doctorate in law. This is because law school grades are usually based on a strict bell curve system which typically results in the failure of 10–30% of first-year students. A few law schools require 2.3 or 2.5 for post-doctoral degrees, such as the American LL.M. or S.J.D. degrees. Regular graduate schools have commonly eliminated the D grade because anything below a C is considered failing.

===Weighted GPA===
Some high schools, to reflect the varying skill required for different level courses and to discourage students from selecting courses that are considered a source of easy 'A's, will give higher numerical grades for difficult courses, often referred to as a '''weighted GPA'''. For example, two common conversion systems used in honors and [[Advanced Placement]] courses are:
* A = 5 or 4.5
* B = 4 or 3.5
* C = 3 or 2.5
* D = 2 or 1.5
* F = 0&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentspreunited.com/page/highschoolgpa "High School GPA Calculator"], Studentspreunited.com. Accessed 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Denver Public Schools uses a different system in honors and AP courses to get weighted GPA values; the scale is as follows:
* A = 5.2
* A− = 4.77
* B+ = 4.33
* B = 3.9
* B− = 3.47
* C+ = 3.0
* C = 2.6
* C− = 2.17
* D = 1.3
* F = 0.0

Another policy commonly used by 4.0-scale schools is to mimic the eleven-point weighted scale (see below) by adding a .33 (one-third of a letter grade) to honors or advanced placement class. (For example, a B in a regular class would be a 3.0, but in honors or AP class it would become a B+, or 3.33).

Sometimes the 5-based weighting scale is used for AP courses and the 4.6-based scale for honors courses, but often a school will choose one system and apply it universally to all advanced courses. A small number of high schools use a 5-point scale for Honors courses, a 6-point scale for AP courses, and/or a 3-point scale for courses of below average difficulty.

Although weighting GPAs is a widespread practice in the United States, there is little research into whether weighted GPAs are better than unweighted GPAs. In one study, weighted GPAs were not suitable for predicting any college outcomes, but unweighted GPA were strong predictors of college GPA.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Warne, R. T., *Nagaishi, C., *Slade, M. K., Hermesmeyer, P., &amp; Peck, E. K. (2014). "Comparing weighted and unweighted grade point averages (GPAs) in predicting college success in diverse and low-income college students." ''NASSP Bulletin'', 98, 261–279. doi:10.1177/0192636514565171&lt;/ref&gt; However, standardized test scores were better predictors than either type of GPA.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

===Six-point system===
At least one boarding school in the United States uses the six-point system, [[Phillips Academy]] at Andover.&lt;ref name="andover.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.andover.edu/Academics/CollegeCounseling/Documents/PhillipsAcademySchoolProfile2013-2014.pdf|title=Academic Curriculum |date=27 April 2018|publisher=Phillips Academy|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220221024/https://www.andover.edu/Academics/CollegeCounseling/Documents/PhillipsAcademySchoolProfile2013-2014.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are approximate equivalents to the 100 point system, grades are most often described as follows:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* 6 – Outstanding (High Honor)
* 5 – Superior (Honor)
* 4 – Good
{{col-break}}
* 3 – Satisfactory
* 2 – Low Pass, but certifying
* 1 – Failure
{{col-break}}
* 0 – Low Failure
{{col-end}}

Although described above, grades below a 3 are rarely dispensed in practice.&lt;ref name="andover.edu" /&gt;

===Eleven-point system===
[[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and a few other high schools in the United States use an eleven-point system. Numerical values are applied to grades as follows:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* A = 11
* A− = 10
{{col-break}}
* B+ = 9
* B = 8
* B− = 7
{{col-break}}
* C+ = 6
* C = 5
* C− = 4
{{col-break}}
* D+ = 3
* D = 2
* D− = 1
{{col-break}}
* F = 0
{{col-end}}

Very few American high schools use a twelve-point system, which differs from the above only in using the grade A+, to which the value 12.0 is applied.

==The 1-2-3-4 system==
Some school districts use a 1-2-3-4 rating system for grades at the elementary (K–5) level, notably many California school districts including The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) who switched with the class of 2000. The four-point scale more clearly indicates proficiency levels in core subjects by segmenting students who are proficient (4&amp;3) and ready to advance, from those who are not meeting all required standards (2&amp;1) and should not advance. Most notably this removes the "C" rating which did not clearly partition students who should advance from those who should not.&lt;ref name="Kondo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kondo |first=Annette |title=LAUSD Switches From Letter to Number Grades |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/06/local/me-19434 |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140424181411/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/06/local/me-19434 |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The E-S-N-U system==
At one time (until roughly the mid-20th Century), the most popular grading system in the [[United States]] used four letters,{{cn|date=September 2018}} which ranked in descending order:
* '''E''' (Excellent)
* '''S''' (Satisfactory)
* '''N''' (needs improvement; "NI" was also used interchangeably)
* '''U''' (unsatisfactory)

This system has largely been replaced by the five-point system discussed above, but is still encountered quite often at the [[elementary school]] level, particularly in [[kindergarten]] and Grades 1 through 3 (these levels comprising the lower division of [[primary school]]). It is also occasionally used at schools for older children, including [[Secondary school|high schools]], especially in the issuance of conduct or citizenship grades.

There are a few variations to this system, including the use of an O (for "outstanding") grade, which is even higher than the E; the use of an O instead of the E; a G (for "good") placed between the E and the S; the use of a G (again for "good") instead of the E; and the lack of a U grade. In this version, E stands for "exemplary" and P proficient, with AE and AP for work that approaches the E and P levels. "Credit" is equivalent to the D level and "No Credit" is equivalent to F.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060505214425/http://www.csupomona.edu/~ceis/ipoly/I-Poly%20Handbook%202004-2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of M (for "mediocre") in place of the N and I (for "insufficient") in place of the U was used in some places, and included the F.
* '''E''' (Excellent)
* '''S''' (Satisfactory)
* '''M''' (Mediocre)
* '''I''' (Insufficient)
* '''F''' (Failure)

The S grade may be so modified with an S+ or S−, but otherwise plus and minus are rarely used.

A similar system is used to rank practical work in the certain science department of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]; however only with the grades S (Satisfactory), S+ (more than satisfactory, and may be used in the allocation of degree grades) and NS (Not Satisfactory).

==Alternative approaches to academic grading ==
Alternatives to letter-grading assessments have been tried in some schools, but still remain a marginal approach due to the heavy emphasis and history of letter grading.&lt;ref name=" From Degrading to De-grading"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=Alfie|title=From Degrading to De-grading|journal=High School Magazine|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives to standard letter grading are able to evaluate the students skills and understanding of the course material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Marzano, Robert|date=2000|title=Transforming Classroom Grading.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED446072|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flaws in the standard letter grading system are major and require a lot of attention. These issues include ways for students to achieve high grades without actually understanding the course material. They don't have any  real understanding of the complex information taught in the class. Kyle Spencer discusses a issue a high school teacher discovered during his time teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tippin|first=Gregory K.|last2=Lafreniere|first2=Kathryn D.|last3=Page |first3=Stewart|date=2012-03-01|title=Student perception of academic grading: Personality, academic orientation, and effort|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1469787411429187 |journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=51–61|doi=10.1177/1469787411429187|issn=1469-7874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was on test his students were able to achieve high grades yet when presented with a complex question they couldn't get it correct. Showing him that they only have a general understanding of the material which wasn't reflected by the grades they received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/409314df15d984ffc58e734f28eab40a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=25066|title=Standards-Based Grading - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[liberal arts college]]s in the U.S. either do not issue grades at all (such as [[Alverno College]], [[Antioch College]], [[Bennington College]], [[Evergreen State College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Hampshire College]]), de-emphasize them ([[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Reed College]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Prescott College]], [[College of the Atlantic]]), or do not calculate grade point averages ([[Brown University]]&lt;ref name=brownGPA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown University|title=Statement on Grade Point Average|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/faculty/documents/gpaStatement.pdf|website=Brown University|accessdate=7 April 2015|format=PDF|date=March 2004|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213065439/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/faculty/documents/gpaStatement.pdf|archivedate=13 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In many cases, [[narrative evaluation]]s are used as an alternative measurement system. [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in [[Brooklyn]] is one of several secondary schools to eschew grades in favor of narrative reports, while still managing to be the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in [[Ivy League]] and several other highly selective colleges.&lt;ref&gt;April 2, 2004 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Cover Story (Personal Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional collegiate grades==
* FN = Failure for Non-Attendance
* W = Withdrawal
* WP = Withdrawal (had a passing grade at the time of withdrawal)
* WF = Withdrawal (had a failing grade at the time of withdrawal)
* UW = Unofficial Withdrawal
* X = Audit/Exemption
* NR = Not Reported by Instructor
* E = Excellent

The FN grade indicates that a student has failed a course due to non-attendance. It is calculated as an "F" in the student's grade point average. For students receiving financial aid, failure for non-attendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his or her aid. The FN grade will be assigned by the faculty member at any time following the final withdrawal date for the course. Students who are in a failing status because of non-attendance but return to the course prior to the withdrawal date may elect to withdraw from the course.

A grade of "W" indicates that a student has elected to withdrawal from a course prior to the course's withdraw deadline. It is not calculated in the student's grade point average, which would keep the student from facing possible academic disciplinary action if he or she was to fall below the required Standards of Academic Progress (SAP). For students receiving financial aid, a grade of "W" may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his or her aid. Some schools indicate whether the student was passing or failing the course at the time of withdrawal by placing WP or WF grades on the transcript; policies vary as to whether a WF counts as an unsatisfactory grade when determining if a student is in good standing.

Standards for Academic Progress in Florida, for example, require a student to maintain a grade point average of 2.00 on the 4.00 scale. The student must also successfully complete 67% of the courses attempted, which includes previous failures, re-takes, and withdrawals. Additionally, a student may not attempt a course more than three (3) times.

===Course audits===
Students may elect to audit a college credit course or workforce credit course by completing the audit form. Students may not change from credit to audit or from audit to credit after the drop deadline. A grade of 'X' will be assigned for all courses taken in audit status.

No credit will be awarded and fees for college credit courses taken on an audit basis are the same as those taken on a college credit or workforce credit basis.

Courses taken for audit do not count as hours enrolled in the following areas: veteran certification, financial aid awards, Social Security certification, international student enrollment requirements or early admission program enrollment requirements.

==Standards of Academic Progress (SAP)==
Standards of Academic Progress are the standards set by the school, state, Board of Education, or other agency which are required of students to adhere to in order to continue to attend classes. A student who falls below the SAP may have disciplinary action taken against him or her or denial of financial aid until the student has met the required SAP. In Florida, Standards of Academic Progress require a student to maintain a grade point average of 2.00 or above on the 4.00 numeric grading scale. The student must also finish 67% of the courses attempted, which includes previous failures, re-takes, and withdrawals. Additionally, a student may not attempt a course more than three (3) times.

The '''Royal Naval Academy''' of France ({{lang-fr|L'Académie royale de marine}}) was founded at [[Brest, France|Brest]] by a ruling of 31 July 1752 by [[Antoine Louis de Rouillé]], comte de Jouy, [[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)|Secretary of State for the Navy]].  This institutionalised an earlier initiative by a group of officers from the Brest fleet headed by the artillery captain [[Sébastien Bigot de Morogues]] who all wanted to contribute to the modernisation of the [[History of the French Navy|French Navy]], a group which had very quickly received the approbation of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].

de Morogues was named the Academy's first president and the institution gathered in astronomers, hydrographers, mathematicians and so on, including such names as [[Dumaitz de Goimpy]], [[Jean-Charles de Borda|Borda]], [[Antoine-Jean-Marie Thévenard|Thévenard]], [[Jean-Jacques de Marguerie|Marguerie]], and [[Claret de Fleurieu]], and three of its members (Claret de Fleurieu, [[Fleuriot de Langle]], [[Charles Gabriel Morel d'Escures|d'Escures]]) were to be found amongst [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Perouse]]'s expedition to the [[Solomon Islands]] which later disappeared.  The Academy contributed greatly to the improvement of navigational instruments, and its graduates included [[Étienne Eustache Bruix]].

The institution disappeared temporarily from 1764 to 1769, at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]].  In 1769, [[Aymar Joseph de Roquefeuil]], commandant of the Brest fleet, obtained permission for its re-establishment from [[Louis XV]] and from [[César Gabriel de Choiseul|Choiseul-Praslin]], Secretary of State for the Navy.  The Academy was linked to the [[Académie des sciences]] by an edict of 1771, but was finally suppressed by the [[National Convention]] on 8 August 1793 at the same time as all the other academies.  It was restored again under the [[First French Empire|Empire]] as the "Académie de marine" and continues its work today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6174">'''Anne Allison''' is a professor of [[cultural anthropology]] at [[Duke University]] in the [[United States]], specializing in contemporary [[Japan]]ese society. She wrote the book ''[[Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club|Nightwork]]'' on [[hostess club]]s and Japanese corporate culture after having worked at a hostess club in [[Tokyo]].

She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and her [[Ph.D.]] in [[anthropology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1986.

==Work==

Allison's work investigates the intersection between the political economy and the imaginative dreamworld(s) of day-to-day Japanese life.  Her first book, ''Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club'' (University of Chicago Press 1994), examines the Japanese corporate practice of entertaining white-collar, male workers in the sexualized atmosphere of hostess clubs.

Her second book, ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan'' (Westview-HarperCollins 1996, reissued by University of California Press 2000) studies the intersection of motherhood, productivity, and mass-produced fantasies in contemporary Japan through essays on lunch-boxes, comics, censorship, and stories of mother-son incest.

Allison's third book, ''Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination'' (California, 2006), analyzes the interplay of fantasy, capitalism, and cultural politics in the rise of "J-cool" (Japan's brand of "cool" youth goods) on the global marketplace. A Japanese edition of this book was published in 2010 by Shinchosha Press under the title Kiku to Pokémon: Guro-barusuru nihon no bunkaryouuku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?subpage=profile&amp;Gurl=/aas/CA&amp;Uil=anne.allison |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304214405/http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?Gurl=%2Faas%2FCA&amp;Uil=anne.allison&amp;subpage=profile |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 4, 2011 |title=Anne Allison |publisher=Duke University Cultural Anthropology |accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her fourth book focuses on how the Japanese experience insecurity in their daily and social lives is the subject of ''Precarious Japan''. Tacking between the structural conditions of socioeconomic life and the ways people are making do, or not, Anne Allison chronicles the loss of home affecting many Japanese, not only in the literal sense but also in the figurative sense of not belonging. Until the collapse of Japan's economic bubble in 1991, lifelong employment and a secure income were within reach of most Japanese men, enabling them to maintain their families in a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Now, as fewer and fewer people are able to find full-time work, hope turns to hopelessness and security gives way to a pervasive unease. Yet some Japanese are getting by, partly by reconceiving notions of home, family, and togetherness.

==Duke lacrosse case==
Allison was a leading faculty figure during the [[Duke lacrosse case]] She is noted for  being  among the “[[Group of 88]]” Duke professors and faculty who published an ad condemning the Duke lacrosse team, three of whose members were accused of rape but ultimately found innocent. The backlash from the letter led to the disclosure that Allison and other Duke members of the anthropology department were reprimanded in 2003 by Provost Peter Lange for misuse of university funds in 2003 for the publication of a political ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/department-anti-war-ad-violated-law | title=Department anti-war ad violated law | date=March 25, 2003 | publisher=The Chronicle at Duke University | accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, during the Duke controversy, Allison offered a course entitled “Hook-Up Culture at Duke” which professed to examine what “the lacrosse scandal tell[ s] us about power, difference, and raced, classed, gendered and sexed normativity in the U.S.”   She was criticized for offering this course, given that facts made public in the case had already established that the lacrosse team was innocent of all charges.&lt;ref name=loco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/220274/loco-parentis-or-just-loco-frederick-m-hess | title=In Loco Parentis… or Just Loco? | publisher=National Review Online | date=March 13, 2007 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   “For Group members,” wrote the authors of a book on the rape scandal, “pretending that a rape had occurred was apparently preferable to facing the facts.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case |last=Johnson |first=KC |last2=Taylor |first2=Stuart, Jr. | year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-312-36912-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Review reported that when “an engineering professor saw the syllabus” for the “Hook-Up” course and asked about it, Allison was irritated. “'The very query seemed hostile. I mean, I'm not asking him about his class,' she told The Chronicle of Higher Education.”&lt;ref name=loco/&gt;

Professional organizations for AT service providers include: the [[Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America|Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA)]], AAATE (Association for the Advancement of Assistive Technology in Europe (AAATE), ARATA (Australian Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology Association (ARATA), and Rehabilitation Engineering Society of Japan (RESJA).

Since the profession includes people with such varied backgrounds, beginning in 1995, RESNA developed several certification programs for recognizing a demonstrated level of professional competence in the service provision of Assistive Technology:&lt;ref&gt;Lenker, J.A., "Certification in Assistive Technology", OT Practice 5(21), 2000. reproduced at http://www.wheelchairnet.org/WCN_ProdServ/Clinicians/ATPCertification.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Rehabilitation Engineering Technologist (RET) - A person who applies engineering principles to the design, modification, customization and/or fabrication of assistive technology for persons with disabilities. An individual must obtain the ATP credential prior obtaining the RET credential.

Credentialed service providers must meet specific education and professional experience levels, and must demonstrate knowledge of assistive technology, as shown by passing a credentialing exam.  According to RESNA, several thousand individuals hold these credentials.

Assistive technology service providers may specialize in several areas of assistive technology, including job accommodations, [[computer accessibility]], vehicle modifications, architectural modifications and home modifications, [[augmentative and alternative communication]], environmental controls, positioning devices, seating and mobility, sensory aids, and learning accommodations.  They may be affiliated with hospitals, state vocational rehabilitation programs, schools, assistive technology companies, or disability organizations.

'''Azerbaijan State University of Economics''' (ASUE) ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət İqtisad Universiteti (ADIU)}}) is a [[public university]] located in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. ASUE was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the [[South Caucasus]]. ASUE has 14 faculties, where 16 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], [[New York Academy of Sciences]], winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. ASUE is a full member of the [[European University Association]], [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]], University Council of [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] and Eurasian Association of Universities. There are 650 undergraduate and postgraduate students from 10 countries of the world getting education at ASUE.

In 2007 a Library and Information Center and a student career center started functioning at ASUE and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year ASUE received the “European quality” award and the   European Club of Rectors and [[European University Association]]. 

The strategic direction of ASUE development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with [[Bologna Process]], as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rektor/|title=UNEC — RECTOR|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rectorate/|title=UNEC — RECTORATE|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

Originally a part of [[Baku State University]], it became a separate, independent institution in 1934.  Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] changed the name to the "Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after [[Karl Marx]]" (similar to the naming of the [[Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov]]), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the "Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx".  With the onset of [[World War II]], ASEU was folded into [[Baku State University]]'s Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.

In 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.

== Derbent branch ==
The [[Derbent]] branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:

* [[World economy]]
* [[Finance]] and credit
* [[Accounting]], analysis and [[audit]]
* General Economy

Along with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2691145.html|title=Official opening of UNEC’s Darband branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageu-derbent.ru/o_filiale/|title=Derbent Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the Derbent Branch of the Azerbaijan State University of Economics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zagatala branch ==
Under the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]]. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:

* [[Business administration|Business management]]
* Finance
* Accounting
* [[Economy]]

The first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salamnews.org/ru/news/read/235908|title=В Загатале состоялось открытие филиала UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/zagatala-branch/|title=Zagatala Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Cooperation ==
The Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities. 

Thus, ASUE cooperates with the [[University of Siegen|Siegen University]] of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled "Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2878793.html|title=UNEC launches summer school together with Siegen University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2446509.html|title=The International School of Economics is UNEC’s gateway to the Western Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASEU was declared the winner of the [[TEMPUS]] IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called "Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the [[European Commission]]. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus+]] Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[University of Warwick]] Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ue.poznan.pl/data/upload/articles/20151016/98254f399020401045/informacje-o-uczelni-asue.pdf|title=Azerbaijan State University of Economics|last=|first=|date=|website=Poznań University of Economics and Business|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2726274.html|title=Успешно реализован проект UNIVIA, осуществляемый при координаторстве UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University - the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]] (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/en/page/61|title=International cooperation|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French [[University of Montpellier]] in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.haberler.com/unec-s-first-students-to-study-at-university-of-928998/|title=UNEC's First Students To Study At University Of Montpellier|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interesting facts ==

=== Setting for Novel ''Ali and Nino'' ===
[[Kurban Said]]'s landmark novel, ''[[Ali and Nino]]'', opens in a classroom in the Economics University building in Baku. Ali Khan, the protagonist, took his final graduation exams in that building, which is located on one of Baku's most prestigious streets - Independence (Istiglaliyyat), though at the time of the novel, it was called Nikolay Street, named after the Russian czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Nino's school, now Public School No. 132, was located across the street.

Curiously, both [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli|Yusif Vazir (Chamanzaminli)]] (1887-1943), the Core Author of ''Ali and Nino'',&lt;ref&gt;101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4] (2011), pp. 262-333.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Essad Bey / [[Lev Nussimbaum]] (1905-1942) both attended this school. Vazirov attended Baku Realni High School (having transferred in as a refugee from [[Shusha]]) beginning in 1906 and he graduated in 1909. 

[[Lev Nussimbaum]] attended Men's Gymnasium No. 2, which at that time (1914-1920) was housed inside Baku Realni. Though Nussimbaum was often absent due to sickness and political unrest, he was enrolled from Junior Preparatory to the beginning of Fourth Grade when he fled the Bolshevik takeover of the Baku government (1920). This school offered classes through Eighth Grade. Documents indicate that Nussimbaum failed his Azerbaijani class in 1919, the only time records exist showing that he had enrolled in Azerbaijani.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13. Photo of Lev Nussimbaum's grade report is published in "Secrets in the Archives: Lev Nussimbaum's Early School Record in Baku," in [[Azerbaijan International]], Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), p. 153.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3429">'''Clement Vavasor Durell''' (born 6 June 1882, [[Fulbourn]], [[Cambridgeshire]], died [[South Africa]], 10 December 1968) was an [[England|English]] [[schoolmaster]] who wrote [[Mathematics|mathematical]] textbooks.

==Background and early life==
A son of John Vavasor Durell (1837–1923), Rector of [[Fulbourn]], Cambridgeshire, and his wife Ellen Annie Carlyon, Durell had four older brothers. He was educated at [[Felsted School]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge]] (1900&amp;ndash;1904), where he gained a first class in part two of the [[mathematics]] [[tripos]] and was seventh [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].

==Career==
*Assistant master at [[Gresham's School, Holt]], 1904&amp;ndash;1905
*Assistant master at [[Winchester College]], 1910
*Lieutenant in [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] during [[First World War]]
*[[Mentioned in Dispatches]]
*Housemaster of Chernocke House, Winchester College, 1920&amp;ndash;1927

In 1900 he joined the [[Mathematical Association]] and in the 1900s was contributing articles on teaching to its journal, ''The Mathematical Gazette''. After the [[First World War]], he found a substantial second career and income in writing textbooks.

After spending most of his career teaching and writing about mathematics at [[Winchester]], Durell retired to [[East Preston, West Sussex|East Preston]], [[Sussex]], wintering in [[Madeira]] and [[South Africa]], where he died in 1968.

His estate at death amounted to £200,098, which in the 1960s was a large fortune for the son of a clergyman to amass as a schoolmaster.

==Books==
Durell's textbooks were hugely successful from the 1920s, and by 1935 his publisher, G. Bell &amp; Sons, was claiming: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There can indeed be few secondary schools in the English-speaking world in which some at least of Mr Durell's books are not now employed in the teaching of mathematics''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He collaborated on books with masters from other schools, such as R. M. Wright of [[Eton College|Eton]], A. W. Siddons of [[Harrow School|Harrow]], C. O. Tuckey of [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], Alan Robson of [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and G. W. Palmer of [[Christ's Hospital]].

Durell's books cover all areas of school mathematics, including [[algebra]], [[calculus]], [[mechanics]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]], and include:

*''Elementary Problem Papers'' (Arnold, London, 1906)
*''Readable Relativity'' (G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1926)
*''The Teaching of Elementary Algebra'' (G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1931)
*''General Arithmetic (G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1936)
*''Elementary Geometry'' (G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1948) First published 1925

[[File:Cable in the Classroom.png|right|thumb|200px|''Cable in the Classroom'' title card used at the beginning and end of select programs. (see list)]]
'''Cable in the Classroom''' was an [[United States|American]] division of the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] that assisted the [[cable television]] industry in providing educational content to schools. The organization was founded in 1989. A [[Canada|Canadian]] organization, also called '''"Cable in the Classroom"''' ('''"La câblo-éducation"''' in [[French language|French]]), was founded in 1995, and held the same scope as the US organization.

Cable stations broadcast [[educational television]] programs at specific times (usually early in the morning) commercial-free and notified Cable in the Classroom as to when the shows would air, which maintained a master list for educators to reference. This way, educators were able to record the programs for free and use them in school as learning tools for children. [[Copyright]]s were cleared so that educators could use the content of the listed programs as they wished for their syllabi and learning plans.

Over the years however, many networks discontinued any effort at promoting Cable in the Classroom or setting aside programming for the organization's purposes, ceding more to [[direct marketing]] of their educational television programming to teachers and school districts via their [[home video]] departments, their [[Internet]] sites, or in the cases of networks such as [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#ABC Family|ABC Family]], [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]], removing their involvement altogether, commensurate with the Internet ending other cable services tied to traditional scheduling such as "near [[video on demand]]". Another factor was likely the decline in [[VHS]] recorders, as [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s with non-portable storage became the recording format of choice over [[DVD recorder]]s, the equivalent successor to VCRs. [[Streaming media|Streaming video]] also played a factor in the reduction of Cable in the Classroom, as educators can now access and play content at any time via computers connected to in-classroom televisions and [[video projector]]s rather than on a set schedule.

In 2014, Cable in the Classroom was entirely discontinued in the United States with ''[[CNN Student News]]'' the only program left under the effort, and the NCTA redirected the former Cable in the Classroom portal to promote their "Cable Impacts Foundation" [[Charitable organization|charity]] arm instead.

'''Charles D. Hayes''' is a self-professed, [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and one of America's strongest advocates for [[lifelong learning]].

== Biography ==

Charles D. Hayes is an unabashed liberal who professes to being a self-taught philosopher and one of America’s strongest advocates for lifelong learning. He spent his youth in Texas and served as a U.S. Marine and as a police officer before embarking on a career in the oil industry. Alaska has been his home for more than thirty years.

Hayes’ book Beyond the American Dream: Lifelong Learning and the Search for Meaning in a Postmodern World received recognition by the American Library Association’s CHOICE magazine as one of the most outstanding academic books of the year. His other titles include Existential Aspirations: Reflections of a Self-Taught Philosopher; September University: Summoning Passion for an Unfinished Life; The Rapture of Maturity: A Legacy of Lifelong Learning; Training Yourself: The 21st Century Credential; Proving You’re Qualified: Strategies for Competent People without College Degrees; and Self-University: The Price of Tuition is Desire. Your Degree is a Better Life. His fiction work includes the novel Portals in a Northern Sky; the novellas Pansy: Bovine Genius in Wild Alaska and The Call of Mortality, forthcoming; and two short fiction pieces, Moose Hunter Homicide and Stalking Cindy, in production.

His nonfiction Kindle essays include: Atlas Begs to Differ; Aging Existentially: Getting the Most Out of the Fall and Winter of Life; Heroism, Cowardice and the National Tragedy of Hidden Guilt; Learning a Living: Career Success Without Formal Credentials; Class Warfare: Is It Real? Is It Over? Or Has It Just Begun?; Nostalgia: Why the Past Matters; Pursuing Justice: Foxes, Hedgehogs, and the Baby-Boom Legacy; America's Greatest Enemy: Ignorance, Why Political Dialog is Disingenuous; and Extreme Conditions: Universal Lessons About Workplace Safety Learned in an Arctic Environment.
    
Promoting the idea that education should be thought of not as something you get but as something you take, Hayes’ work has been featured in the [http://www.laprogressive.com/author/charles-d-hayes LA Progressive], USA Today, and the UTNE Reader, on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation and on Alaska Public Radio’s Talk of Alaska. His web site, www.autodidactic.com, provides resources for self-directed learners—from advice about credentials to philosophy about the value lifelong learning brings to everyday living. In 2006, Hayes established www.septemberuniversity.org, a site devoted to ongoing dialogue among September University participants in search of the better argument.

The prohibition "'''do not feed the animals'''" reflects a policy forbidding the artificial feeding of wildlife ([[wildlife|wild]] or [[Feral organism|feral]] animals) in situations where the animals, or the people doing the feeding, might be harmed. [[Signage|Signs]] displaying this message are commonly found in [[zoo]]s, [[circus]]es, [[animal theme park]]s, [[aquarium]]s, [[national park]]s, [[park]]s, [[public space]]s, [[farm]]s, and other places where people come into contact with [[wildlife]].&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rothfels, ''Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo'', JHU Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0801898099}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Not Feed the Animals: Do Not Touch: Desire for Wild Animal Companionship in the Twenty-first Century |first=June |last=Dwyer |pages=623-644 |year=2013 |volume=19 |issue=4 |journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment |doi=10.1093/isle/iss118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases there are laws to enforce such no-feeding policies.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA Public Affairs, [http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/jan04/noaa04-piro03.html DO NOT FEED OR INTERACT WITH HAWAIIAN MONK SEALS], 30 January 2004, accessed 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/news/newsReleases/fishAndWildlife/nr_0483.html |title=Artificial Feeding of Wildlife is against the law |author=Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks |format= |pages= |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |quote= |publisher=State of Montana }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people (such as some of those who enjoy feeding pigeons in cities) openly and strongly oppose such laws claiming that animals such as pigeons can be an amenity for people who do not have company such as friends or family, and say that the laws prohibiting feeding animals in urban places must change.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lonely-woman-must-pay-2300-7426683&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, such as [[Greece]], feeding the pigeons in cities is a widespread practice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qERMr-ADaY&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural hostility to feeding animals in cities and laws that ban the practice raise concerns about how humans relate to other living beings in the urban environment.&lt;ref name="unple"&gt;http://unpleasant.pravi.me/unpleasant-for-pigeons/&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have also protested laws that ban feeding feral pigeons in cities.&lt;ref name="unple" /&gt; Feral pigeons in cities existed for thousands of years but only recently in some countries humans started seeing them as a nuisance and became hostile to them.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;http://www.environment.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/8744/socialproblems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], feeding feral animals in cities is considered a noble act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/why-feed-pigeons-dogs-or-monkeys-in-public-places/story-XGbCyMBVsgZL4DECVSfuJN.html&lt;/ref&gt; Academicians say that how humans treat animals is related to how humans treat each other and thus raise concerns about the cultural shift from seeing feral city pigeons as harmless in the 1800s to seeing them a undesirable in some countries in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;

[[File:No Feeding.jpg|thumb|right|This sign discourages feeding coyotes, which can result in [[Coyote attacks on humans|aggressive behavior]] toward humans&lt;ref name="UrbanCarnivores"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AOH"/&gt;]]
In zoos, giving food to the animals is discouraged due to the strict [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary controls]] in place.&lt;ref name="Zoo"&gt;Darill Clements, ''Postcards from the Zoo'', HarperCollins Australia, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, artificial feeding can result in, for example, [[Avitaminosis|vitamin deficiencies]]&lt;ref name="DEHP-QLD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/wildlife/livingwith/feeding_native_animals.html |title=Feeding native animals |author= |format= |pages= |date=2011 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |quote= |publisher=Queensland Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dietary mineral]] deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Heiser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/habitat/wild-in-the-woods/feeding-wildlife-food-for-thought.pdf |title=Feeding Wildlife: Food for Thought |author=Carol A.

Adler and Colby J. Tanner, ''Urban Ecosystems: Ecological Principles for the Built Environment'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|0521769841}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcl_cmlQWkEC&amp;pg=PA210 p. 210.]&lt;/ref&gt; In public spaces, the congregation of animals caused by feeding can result in them being considered [[Pest (animal)|pests]].&lt;ref name="UrbanHabitats"/&gt; Artificial feeding can also lead to animals aggressively seeking out food from people, sometimes resulting in injury.&lt;ref name="UrbanCarnivores"/&gt;

==Zoos==
[[File:Feeding goats (zoo d'Attilly).jpg|right|thumb|Where zoos permit visitors to feed animals, it is usually domestic animals such as sheep and goats,&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; as in this French zoo]]
[[Zoo]]s generally discourage visitors from giving any food to the animals.&lt;ref name="Zoo"/&gt; Some zoos, particularly [[petting zoo]]s, do the opposite and actively encourage people to get involved with the feeding of the animals.&lt;ref name="Kleiman"&gt;Devra G. Kleiman, Katerina V. Thompson, and Charlotte Kirk Baer, ''Wild Mammals in Captivity: Principles and Techniques for Zoo Management'', 2nd ed., University of Chicago Press, 2010, {{ISBN|0226440117}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a1vev5hf7o8C&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140.]&lt;/ref&gt;   This, however, is strictly monitored and usually involves set food available from the [[zookeeper]]s or vending machines, as well as a careful choice of which animals to feed, and the provision of hand-washing facilities to avoid spreading disease.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;Paul A. Rees, ''An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management'', Wiley, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fRp4zrPgTYQC&amp;pg=PT306 p. 306.]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic animals such as [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s are often permitted to be fed,&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; as are [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref name="Kleiman"/&gt;

==National and state parks==
[[File:Yogi Bear with "don't feed the bears" message - NARA - 286013.jpg|left|upright|thumb|In the 1960s, US national parks began to discourage the feeding of bears,&lt;ref name="Lau"/&gt; as reflected in this photograph from 1961, featuring [[Yogi Bear]]]]
[[File:Safety instructions on Lone Ranch Beach.JPG|thumb|200px|Prohibited activities and safety instructions at a state park in [[Oregon]]]]
In [[national park]]s and [[state park]]s, feeding animals can result in malnourishment due to inappropriate diet and in disruption of natural hunting or food-gathering behavior. It can also be dangerous to the people doing the feeding.&lt;ref name="LGE"&gt;Lisa Gollin Evans, ''Outdoor Family Guide: Rocky Mountain National Park'', The Mountaineers Books, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NQSVFNya4jgC&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, early 20th century [[Wildlife management|park management]] actually encouraged animal feeding. For example, "the feeding of squirrels had been seen as a way to civilize the parks and rechannel the energies of young boys from aggression and vandalism toward compassion and charity."&lt;ref name="EBenson"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/3/691.full |title=The Urbanization of the Eastern Gray Squirrel in the United States | last =Benson | first =Etienne  |authorlink= | journal =Journal of American History | volume =100 | issue =3 | pages =691-710 |date =December 2013  |doi = 10.1093/jahist/jat353 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Park rangers once fed bears in front of crowds of tourists.&lt;ref name="Keiter"/&gt; However, with a greater awareness of ecological and other issues, such pro-feeding policies are now viewed as detrimental,&lt;ref name="Lau"&gt;Tammy Lau and Linda Sitterding, ''Yosemite National Park in Vintage Postcards'', Arcadia Publishing, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUuNJT1IGsC&amp;pg=PA125 p. 125.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keiter"&gt;Robert B. Keiter, ''To Conserve Unimpaired: The Evolution of the National Park Idea'', Island Press, 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx-uo4Erq6EC&amp;pg=PA176 p. 176.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Sandford, ''Ecology and Wonder in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site'', Athabasca University Press, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2aPnUlT5HAkC&amp;pg=PA284 pp. 284–288.]&lt;/ref&gt; and US national parks now actively discourage animal feeding.&lt;ref&gt;David Williams, "Conspicuous Consumption," ''National Parks'', April/May 2002, pp. 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canadian national parks, it is illegal to disturb or feed wildlife,&lt;ref&gt;Terry Inigo-Jones, ''The Canadian Rockies Colourguide'', James Lorimer, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v9rrvssw1oEC&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Parks Canada]] advises visitors not to leave out "food attractants" such as dirty dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/jasper/visit/securite-safety.aspx#conflict |title=Jasper National Park: Safety and Hazards |author=Parks Canada |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the "it is unlawful to feed animals" signs may themselves become food attractants for [[porcupine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Van Tighem, ''Wild Animals of Western Canada'', Rocky Mountain Books, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w-Nj4mcsR6EC&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Road salt]] and [[roadkill]] may also act as food attractants, and removing roadkill is considered good park management.&lt;ref&gt;Jon P. Beckmann, Anthony P. Clevenger, Marcel Huijser, and Jodi A. Hilty, ''Safe Passages: Highways, Wildlife, and Habitat Connectivity'', Island Press, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dgiq9UnHVf4C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine parks==
[[File:Monkey Mia, Western Australia.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Monkey Mia]] in Australia, [[dolphin]]s are fed under [[Park ranger|ranger]] supervision&lt;ref name="sharkbay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkbay.wa.gov.au/visitors/places-to-go/monkey-mia-reserve.html |title=Monkey Mia Reserve |author=Shire of Shark Bay |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020112/http://www.sharkbay.wa.gov.au/visitors/places-to-go/monkey-mia-reserve.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tourism operators often provide food to attract marine wildlife such as [[Shark tourism|sharks]] to areas where they can be more easily viewed. Such a practice is controversial, however, because it can create a dependency on artificial feeding, habituate animals to feeding locations, increase inter-species and intra-species aggression, and increase the spread of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higham|first1=James|last2=Lück|first2=Michael |title=Marine Wildlife and Tourism Management: Insights from the Natural and Social Sciences|year=2008|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-1-84593-345-6|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsRZW0dU-6MC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], shark feeding is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |title=Environmental Status: Sharks and rays: Response: tourism |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411143054/http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hawaii|Hawaiian waters]], shark feeding is permitted only in connection with traditional [[Hawaiian religion|Hawaiian cultural or religious activities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/legislativeatlas/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=568 |title=Prohibition of Shark Feeding |author=Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, Hawaii Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820061233/http://www.csc.noaa.gov/legislativeatlas/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=568 |archivedate=2014-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feeding of wild [[dolphin]]s for tourist purposes is also controversial, and is prohibited in the US because it can alter natural hunting behaviour, disrupt social interaction, encourage the dolphins to approach or ingest dangerous objects, and endanger the person doing the feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gales |first1=Nicholas |last2=Hindell |first2=Mark |last3=Kirkwood |first3=Roger | title=Marine Mammals: Fisheries, Tourism and Management Issues |year=2003|publisher=[[CSIRO]] |isbn=0643099263 |page=306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkLGVQDvN7MC&amp;pg=PA306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/education/protectdolphins.htm |title=Protect Dolphins Campaign |author=[[National Marine Fisheries Service]] |accessdate=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Monkey Mia]] in Western Australia, dolphin feeding is permitted under [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]] supervision.&lt;ref name="sharkbay"/&gt;

==Backyards==
Similar issues to those in national and state parks also apply in suburban and rural [[backyard]]s. Artificial feeding of [[coyote]]s, deer, and other wildlife is discouraged.&lt;ref name="UrbanCarnivores"&gt;Stanley D. Gehrt, Seth P. D. Riley, and Brian L. Cypher, ''Urban Carnivores: Ecology, Conflict, and Conservation'', JHU Press, 2010, {{ISBN|0801893895}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xYKqluO6c8UC&amp;pg=PA231 p. 231.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AOH"&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyote Attacks: An Increasing Suburban Problem|url = http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf|accessdate =August 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926044522/http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf |archivedate = September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coyote"&gt;Stephen DeStefano, ''Coyote at the Kitchen Door: Living With Wildlife in Suburbia'', Harvard University Press, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo0Po4xSwAC&amp;pg=PA76 p. 76.]&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding deer, for example, may contribute to the spread of [[Mycobacterium bovis|bovine tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Heiser"/&gt; The feeding of birds with [[bird feeder]]s is an exception, at least in the US, even though it can sometimes contribute to spreading disease.&lt;ref name="Coyote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Warhol and Marcus Schneck, ''Birdwatcher's Daily Companion: 365 Days of Advice, Insight, and Information for Enthusiastic Birders'', Quarry Books, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YkepQQWk-TQC&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Fitzpatrick and André A. Dhondt, "[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Publications/Birdscope/Spring2003/In_Defense.html In Defense of Bird Feeding]," ''Birdscope, newsletter of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology'', Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, artificial [[bird feeding]] is viewed more negatively.&lt;ref name="DEHP-QLD"/&gt; Instead, growing native plants that can act as a natural food source for birds is recommended.&lt;ref name="DEHP-QLD"/&gt; Similar suggestions have been made in the US.&lt;ref name="Heiser"/&gt;

==Public spaces==
[[File:Do not feed the pigeons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sign in Singapore telling people not to feed the pigeons]]
[[File:Man feeding pigeons.jpg|thumb|right|[[Feral pigeon]]s being fed in a public space]]
[[File:Do not feed our ducks - geograph.org.uk - 942538.jpg|thumb|right|Sign telling citizens to not feed the ducks&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt;]]
[[Feral pigeon]]s are often found in urban [[public space]]s. They are often considered environmental pests, and can transmit diseases such as [[psittacosis]].&lt;ref name="UrbanHabitats"&gt;C. Philip Wheater, ''Urban Habitats'', Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|0203061144}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeVUjqkWx60C&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberate feeding of feral pigeons, though popular, contributes to these problems.&lt;ref name="UrbanHabitats"/&gt;

[[Duck]]s are also commonly fed in public spaces. In one US study, 67% of people visiting urban parks did so to feed ducks.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Barnes, ''Gardening for the Birds'', University Press of Kentucky, 1999, {{ISBN|0813129028}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVQEVh0ZD1EC&amp;pg=PA9 p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such feeding may contribute to water pollution and to over-population of the birds, as well as delaying [[Bird migration|winter migration]] to an extent that may be dangerous for the birds.&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;Laura Erickson, ''101 Ways to Help Birds'', Stackpole Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0811733025}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m6SrsYLQ_V0C&amp;pg=PA130 p 130.]&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding foods such as white bread to ducks and geese can result in bone deformities.&lt;ref name="Heiser"/&gt; Like pigeons, ducks may also congregate in large numbers where feeding takes place, resulting in aggression towards humans who don't have food to hand as well as towards other individuals in the group. Ducks can also be messy animals, and the cleanup of an area where they congregate is time consuming.

'''Edinburgh University Highland Society''' (Scottish Gaelic ''Comann Ceilteach Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann'') is the [[Gaelic language]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] Studies society at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Established in 1851, it the oldest society at the University. It is the successor organization to the short-lived Ossianic Society, which was founded in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crouse|first1=L.A.|title=The establishment of Celtic Societies|journal=[[History Scotland]]|issue=Sept/Oct 2013|pages=24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacCoinnich|first1=Aonghas|title=19th &amp; 20th C: Ossianic Society|url=https://sgeulnagaidhlig.ac.uk/ossianic-society/?lang=en|website=The Gaelic Story at the University of Glasgow|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Highland Society' is the current official name registered with [[Edinburgh University Students' Association]], although during its existence it has also been known as Edinburgh University Celtic Society, the literal translation of the Gaelic name.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Society runs the Highland Annual Ball (Scottish Gaelic ''An Dannsa Bliadhnail'') each spring, a [[ceilidh]] for students and the wider Edinburgh Gaelic community which has been a prominent fixture of the Gaelic calendar in the city for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Highland Society|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/about/gaelic/the-highland-society|website=The University of Edinburgh|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, graduates are awarded the title of "certified professional nanny" or "certified professional governess," through the American Council of Nanny Schools (ACNS).&lt;ref name= "American Council of Nanny Schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancouncilofnannyschools.com/|title=American Council of Nanny Schools|publisher=American Council of Nanny Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was founded in 1984, on the grounds of Case Western Reserve University. In 1992, it moved to its current location in the village of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. The school was the first of its kind in America, with a full academic faculty dedicated exclusively to educating nannies and governesses.&lt;ref name="Everyday Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/kids-health/finding-the-best-nanny-for-your-kids.aspx|title=Finding the Best Nanny for Your Kids|publisher=Everyday Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was invited to represent the child-care and nanny profession at the Conference on Childcare at [[The White House]], by the [[First Lady]], [[Hillary Clinton]].

The school has appeared in newspaper and magazine articles, including ''[[The Times of London]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'', as well as radio shows, and on television programs.

'''Frederick John Kiesler''' ([[Czernowitz]] or Tschernovitz, [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (now [[Chernivtsi]], [[Ukraine]]), September 22, 1890 – [[New York City]], December 27, 1965) (born as Friedrich Jacob Kiesler). [[Austria]]n-[[United States|American]] architect, theoretician, theater designer, artist and sculptor.

==Biography==
From 1908 to 1909, Kiesler studied at the [[Vienna University of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Vienna]]. From 1910–12, he attended painting and printmaking classes at the [[Akademie der bildenden Künste]], both in [[Vienna]]. In July 1913, Kiesler quit the academy without having earned a diploma.

He married Stefanie (Stefi) Frischer (1896–1963) in 1920, and they moved to New York City in 1926, where he lived until his death. Kiesler collaborated there early on with the [[Surrealists]], and with [[Marcel Duchamp]]. His writing was extensive, and his theoretical work embraced two lengthy manifestos, the article "Pseudo-Functionalism in Modern Architecture" (''[[Partisan Review]]'', July 1949) and the book ''Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and Its Display'' (New York: Brentano, 1930).

Stefi Kiesler died in September 1963. In 1964, the year before his death, Kiesler married Lillian Olinsey, his longtime secretary and confidante, as Stefi had advised him to do while she was still living. In May 1965, he traveled to Jerusalem for the inauguration of the [[Shrine of the Book]]; seven months later he died in New York City.

==Design and architectural career==

Kiesler was productive as a theater and art-exhibition designer in the 1920s in Vienna and [[Berlin]]. In 1920, he started a brief collaboration with architect [[Adolf Loos]] and, in 1923, became a member of the [[De Stijl]] group in 1923. Kiesler was friendly with many of the major figures of the European [[avant-garde]], which may have influenced his heretical approach to artistic theories and practices.

Kiesler arranged the world premiere in Vienna on September 24, 1924, of the 16-minute film ''[[Ballet mécanique]]'', directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and [[Fernand Léger]], with [[Man Ray]]. In November 1975, Lillian Kiesler, Frederick's second wife, found Léger's original spliced [[35mm]], 16-minute version of the film in the closet of their week-end house in the [[Hamptons]] on [[Long Island]], near New York City. This version, restored by [[Anthology Film Archives]], has since been included in the documentary film compilation ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant-Garde Film 1893-1941'' (released as a seven-disc DVD set by Image Entertainment, October 2005). The music for the film was originally composed by [[George Antheil]], who used it to create a separate concert piece, also named ''Ballet mécanique'', which premiered in Paris in 1926.

His architectural designs include the [[Film Guild Cinema]] (1929) in New York City and, with [[Armand Phillip Bartos]], the [[Shrine of the Book]] (1965) in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Samuel. [http://www.archdaily.com/156442/AD "Classics: Shrine of the Book / Armand Phillip Bartos and Frederick John Kiesler"], ''ArchDaily'', September 24, 2011, accessed October 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1943, Kiesler was the director of the Laboratory for Design Correlation within the [[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|Department of Architecture]] at [[Columbia University]], where the study program was more pragmatic and commercially oriented than his deep, theoretical concepts and ideas, such as those about "correalism" or "continuity," which concern the relationship among space, people, objects and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Creighton (July 1961), "Kiesler's Pursuit of an Idea," ''[[Progressive Architecture]]'', vol. 42, no. 7, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt;

For his object designs, such as the biomorphic furniture in his Abstract Gallery room of [[Peggy Guggenheim]]’s ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]'' art salon (1942), for example. For it, he sought to dissolve the visual, real, image, and environment into a free-flowing space. He likewise pursued this approach with his “[[Endless House]],” exhibited in maquette form in 1958–59 at [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. The project stemmed from his shop-window displays of the 1920s and his [[Film Guild Cinema]] in New York City, mentioned above. Pursuing display and art-gallery work, he was a window designer for [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] from 1928 to 1930. Earlier in his career in Europe, Kiesler invented the 1924 L+T (Leger und Trager) radical hanging system for galleries and museums.

His unorthodox architectural drawings and plans that he called "polydimensional" were somewhat akin to Surrealist automatic drawings.

He designed some intriguing furniture, a few pieces of which were featured in the yearbook of the short-lived [[American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen]] (AUDAC); he was a founding member of the organization in 1930. Some models of the furniture — none of which was reproduced in numbers as intended — have been posthumously manufactured in limited quantities by various firms in Europe since 1990. The most popular has been the cast-aluminum "Two-Part Nesting Table" (1935).

==Galaxies and Installational Works==

During the 1950s, Kiesler created a series of paintings called ''Galaxies'', which translated his vision of space into multi-paneled installations that protruded from the wall. Combining painting, sculpture and drawing, the ''Galaxies'' were presented as grouped units. To Kiesler, the space between the different parts was just as important as the paintings themselves, marking a reflection of the “inner necessity” of the work as a whole. He noted that it was the same as what “breathing is to our body reality.” Kiesler wrote further:

{{Quote|text=''"Each painting represents a definite unit in itself just as in one family each member is of distinct individuality. Yet, their firm cohesion (into one) is inborn no matter how heterogeneous the character of the members might be. Under these circumstances, it seems natural that each painted unit, particularly when protruding from the wall, and viewed from the side, will also assume the value of a plastic entity, very much in the sense of sculpture, while the aspect of the total galaxy promotes too, the idea of an architectural coordinate without destroying the main character as a painting. Thus the traditional division of the plastic arts, sculpture, and architecture, is transmuted and overcome and their fluid unification is now contained within rather than combined from without."''}}

[[File:Frederick Kiesler, Horse Galaxy, 1954, installation view at Jason McCoy Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Kiesler, ''Horse Galaxy'', 1954, installation view at Jason McCoy Gallery, 1993.]]
These multi-paneled paintings were also sparked by the artist's response to the political and social upheaval of his time. Conceived only a few years after the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Kiesler described his inspiration for the ''Galaxies'' as follows:

{{Quote|text=''"If the reassessment of values in these tense times is of necessity for each and all of us, one is convinced that the artist’s work too can no longer be placed in isolation: that art must strive again to become part of daily experience. It seems, therefore, that painters, sculptors, and architects must conceive their work – as part of the world."''}}

[[File:Frederick Kiesler, Us, You, Me installation view, Parrish Art Museum.jpg|thumb|Installation view of Frederick Kiesler's ''Us, You, Me'' at the [[Parrish Art Museum]] in 2003. ]]
Kiesler’s body of sculptural works also incorporate similar philosophies, uniting individual pieces with specific placements, further illustrating his theories of human-design relationships. His installation of ''Us, You, Me'' (completed 1963-65), included pieces in bronze, aluminum, wood, granite, and concrete in various sizes, and was shown at [[Hunter College]]/Times Square Gallery (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=Art in Review: 'Moved'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/09/arts/art-in-review-moved.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parrish Art Museum]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longwell|first1=Alicia G.|title=FREDERICK KIESLER: THE LATE WORK US, YOU, ME AUGUST 10 - OCTOBER 12 2003|url=http://artists.parrishart.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/124|website=Parrish Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]] (1995).  The idea of sculpture as a landscape in ''Us, You, Me'' reflects upon Kiesler’s history with stage design, and the subject matters marking underlying anxieties of modern life. Kiesler’s final sculpture ''Bucephalus'', inspired by [[Bucephalus|Alexander the Great’s battle horse]], was to be entered by the viewer and used as a grotto for meditation. The sculpture was conceived in concrete and mesh by Kiesler and his assistant, Len Pitkowsky, between 1962-1965 and was posthumously cast in aluminum at the Polich Tallix Foundry, Rock Tavern, New York by [[Jason McCoy Inc|Jason McCoy Gallery]] with the help of Len Pitkowsky between 2006-2008.

==Recognition and awards==
Kiesler was often shunned by his peers, although he was chosen in 1952 as one of "the 15 leading artists at mid-century" by The [[Museum of Modern Art]] and in 1957 became a fellow of the Graham Foundation in Chicago. [[Israel]]i architects disapproved of his and Bartos's serving as the architects for the [[Shrine of the Book]] (1957–65) because they were not Israelis, even though they were [[Jews]]. Further objections to Kiesler were that he had not completed his architecture studies and had built no structures, despite having been a licensed architect in [[New York (state)|New York State]] since 1930. One of his colleagues at Columbia University joked: "If Kiesler wants to hold two pieces of wood together, he pretends he's never heard of nails or screws. He tests the tensile strengths of various metal alloys, experiments with different methods and shapes, and after six months comes up with a very expensive device that holds two pieces of wood together almost as well as a screw".&lt;ref&gt;"Design's Bad Boy", ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', vol. 86, no. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;140, February 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Private Foundation was established in 1997 in Vienna and biennially grants the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts.  Recipients include [[Hani Rashid]], [[Lise Anne Couture]], [[Andrés Jaque]], [[Toyo Ito]], [[Andrea Zittel]], and [[Judith Barry]].&lt;ref name="Meissner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meissner|first1=Jill|title=Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts Laureate 2016 ANDRÉS JAQUE|url=http://www.kiesler.org/cms/media/pdf/KP2016_Presskit_20161007_EN.pdf|website=Austrian Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Private Foundation|date=7 October  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glenaeon Rudolf Steiner School''' is an independent, co-educational day school co- located across multiple campuses in [[Middle Cove, New South Wales|Middle Cove]], [[Castlecrag, New South Wales|Castlecrag]] and [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]] in the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. It was the first Steiner school established in [[Australia]]. The three campuses include the Pre-School in Willoughby, a Junior School (K-2) at Castlecrag and years 3-12 in Middle Cove.

The school’s curriculum and pedagogy follows the NSW Education Standards Authority requirements,combined with the educational insights of Austrian-born philosopher, scientist, artist and educator Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). There are now more than 1000 Steiner schools in 61 different countries worldwide and over 40 Steiner schools in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Steiner Education Australia - Steiner Education Australia|url = http://www.steinereducation.edu.au/about/|website = www.steinereducation.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-09-17|first = Steiner Education|last = Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamaroi Rudolf Steiner School (K-6), is located in [[Belrose]] and serves as a feeder school for both Glenaeon and [[Lorien Novalis School]] in Dural.

Glenaeon's motto is "Unfolding Individual Journeys". It was previously "Education for Life".

==History==
The school was originally established in Pymble in 1957, by Sylvia Brose OAM, out of the community surrounding Walter and Marion Burley Griffin and  their belief that the values of design, the arts, community, nature and spirit needed to underpin a rich academic education.

In 1970 the school was fully established in Middle Cove, located on four and a half acres of bushland. During the 1990s, Glenaeon expanded to the Castlecrag campus, where it now caters for Kindergarten and classes 1 and 2.

==Facilities==
The School currently has two halls, the Sylvia Brose Hall at Middle Cove and the Marion Mahony Griffin Hall at Castlecrag. The Middle Cove campus also includes two playing fields, two multipurpose basketball courts, specialist Design &amp; Technology and Art facilities, a biodynamic garden and music rooms. The high school building features several classrooms including a recently renovated library.

[[File:Henry-wood-Histed-1906.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|alt=Head and shoulders picture of a young man with flowing medium length dark hair, a beard and moustache, and a huge floppy bow tie| Henry Wood, c.&amp;nbsp;1906]]
'''Sir Henry Joseph Wood''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Companion of Honour|CH]]}} (3 March 1869{{spaced ndash}}19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of [[promenade concert]]s, known as the [[The Proms|Proms]].  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the "Henry Wood Promenade Concerts", although they continued to be generally referred to as "the Proms".

Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], he came under the influence of the voice teacher [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]] and became his accompanist. After similar work for [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s opera companies on the works of [[Arthur Sullivan]] and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]]. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' in 1892.

From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario [[Robert Newman (impresario)|Robert Newman]] to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the [[Queen's Hall]], offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the [[Royal Albert Hall]].

Wood declined the chief conductorships of the [[New York Philharmonic]] and [[Boston Symphony]] Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wood was born in [[Oxford Street]], London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, ''née'' Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's [[pawnbroker|pawnbroking]] business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal [[tenor]] in the choir of [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]], known as "the musicians' church".{{refn|According to Wood, his father was urged to become a professional singer by the conductor [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Sir Michael Costa]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]] piano, on which his mother gave him lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola.&lt;ref name=j6&gt;Jacobs, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prout-Garcia.jpg|thumb|right|alt=two elderly Victorian men in head and shoulders shots, the first is bearded; the other is clean-shaven and bald|Two of Wood's mentors: [[Ebenezer Prout]] (l) and [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]]]]
Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, [[George Cooper (organist)|George Cooper]], who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 17 and Jacobs, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard.&lt;ref name=j6/&gt; At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], being paid [[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]].{{refn|Two shillings and sixpence: in decimal coinage, 12½ pence. In terms of average earnings, this equates to more than £65 in current values.&lt;ref name=worth&gt;Williamson, Samuel H., [http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare "Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present"], MeasuringWorth, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]]. He remained a life-long amateur painter.{{refn|In 1911 Wood gave an exhibition of fifty sketches in oil at the Piccadilly Arcade Gallery, raising £200 in aid of the Queen's Hall Orchestra Endowment Fund.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive&gt;Herbage, Julian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/37001 "Wood, Sir Henry Joseph"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography archive, 1959, accessed 14 November 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cox56"/&gt;|group= n}}

After taking private lessons from the musicologist [[Ebenezer Prout]], Wood entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]]'s singing class,{{refn|Wood (p. 29) lists Garcia as among his professors, but Jacobs (p. 13) notes that Wood's name does not appear among the choir lists in which Garcia's pupils all appeared.|group= n}} but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia.&lt;ref name=w29&gt;Wood, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by Garcia's son [[Gustave Garcia|Gustave]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Wood's ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could,&lt;ref name=w29/&gt; although by his own account, "I possess a terrible voice. Garcia said it would go through a brick wall. In fact, a real conductor's voice."&lt;ref name=singing&gt;"Occasional Notes", ''The Musical Times'', November 1927, p. 1007–08&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting "more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with"&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; at half a guinea an hour.{{refn|Ten shillings and sixpence: 52½ pence in decimal terms; in 2009 values somewhere between £40 (based on retail prices) and £275 (based on average earnings).&lt;ref name=worth/&gt; Jacobs (p. 19) suggests that Wood may have exaggerated his fee when recalling it in his memoirs.|group= n}} He also worked as a [[répétiteur]]. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] during the rehearsals for the first production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer [[Arthur Jacobs]] doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]] about the score.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as "vivacious in style but factually unreliable".&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Jacobs, Arthur, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/30538 "Wood, Sir Henry J."] ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 17 October 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La-Basoche-Pick-Me-Up-1891.jpg|thumb|left|alt=magazine sketch of an operatic production, showing a man and a woman among mediaeval scenery|1891 production of [[André Messager|Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'', for which Wood was répétiteur]]
It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]] for Sullivan's [[grand opera]] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' in late 1890 and early 1891, and for [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' in 1891–92.&lt;ref name=mop/&gt; He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to [[François Cellier]] on ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'' in 1891.&lt;ref name=mop&gt;"Mr. Henry J. Wood", ''Musical Opinion &amp; Music Trade Review'', March 1899, pp. 389–90&lt;/ref&gt; Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an [[oratorio]], ''St. Dorothea'' (1889), a light opera, ''Daisy'' (1890), and a one-act comic opera, ''Returning the Compliment'' (1890).&lt;ref name=mop/&gt;

Wood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a choral concert in December 1887.  Ad hoc engagements of this kind were commonplace for organists, but they brought little prestige such as was given to British conductor-composers such as Sullivan, [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], or the rising generation of German star conductors led by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] and [[Arthur Nikisch]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 3 and 17&lt;/ref&gt; His first sustained work as a conductor was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble, the Arthur Rouseby English Touring Opera. The company was not of a high standard, with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at each tour venue. Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 53–56 and Jacobs, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as conductor for the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] in 1891. For that company he conducted ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'', ''[[The Daughter of the Regiment]]'', ''[[Maritana]]'', and ''[[Il trovatore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, Robert, "Henry J. Wood: Organist, Accompanist, Opera Conductor, and Composer", ''The Musical Times'', August 1960, pp. 488–90&lt;/ref&gt; This appointment was followed by a similar engagement with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 58–60 and Jacobs, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

When Signor Lago, formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg, was looking for a second conductor to work with [[Luigi Arditi]] for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The season opened at the newly rebuilt [[Olympic Theatre]] in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews.{{refn|[[George Bernard Shaw]], in a long review in ''[[The World]]'', commented on all the principal singers, the costumes, scenery and choreography, but did not mention the conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, pp. 718–21&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of ''Maritana'' and rehearsed ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' and ''[[Der Freischütz]]''.&lt;ref name=mop/&gt; After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing tuition. With the exception of a season at the [[Opera Comique]] in 1896, Wood's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years of the Proms===
[[File:Robert-Newman-1906.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=head and shoulders photograph of a middle-aged man with large, curled moustache|Robert Newman, co-founder with Wood of the [[Queen's Hall]] promenade concerts]]
In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] where he met the conductor [[Felix Mottl]],&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built [[Queen's Hall]] in London.&lt;ref name=j30&gt;Jacobs, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt; The manager of the hall, [[Robert Newman (impresario)|Robert Newman]], was proposing to run a ten-week season of [[promenade concerts]] and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct.&lt;ref name=j30/&gt; There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from [[Louis Antoine Jullien]] to Arthur Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Newman aimed to do the same: "I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music."&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In decimal coinage, respectively 5, 10, 15 and 25 pence: the equivalent of approximately £4 to £20 in terms of 2009 retail prices. Tickets for formal symphony concerts at the time cost up to five times as much.&lt;ref name=worth/&gt;|group= n}}

Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy [[Otolaryngology|ear, nose and throat]] specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard [[Concert pitch#19th and 20th century standards|''diapason normal'']]. Concert pitch in England was nearly a [[semitone]] higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.&lt;ref name=elkin25&gt;Elkin, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher, agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.&lt;ref name=elkin25/&gt;

On 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts took place. Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer [[Agnes Nicholls]]:&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain at the end of the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem&amp;nbsp;... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the ''[[Rienzi]]'' Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The rest of the programme comprised, in the words of an historian of the Proms, David Cox, "for the most part&amp;nbsp;... blatant trivialities."&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, however, Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream classical works, with [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished Symphony]] and further excerpts from [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first season were Schubert's ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Great C Major]]'', [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Mendelssohn)|Italian]]'' and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|Fourth]].  The concertos included Mendelssohn's [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto]] and Schumann's [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; During the season Wood presented 23&amp;nbsp;novelties, including the London premieres of pieces by [[Richard Strauss]], Tchaikovsky, [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 35; and Orga, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Hugo, "Sullivan without Gilbert", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 July 1971, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The violist Bernard Shore wrote, "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with ''that'' stick in front of you".&lt;ref&gt;Shore, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-five years after Wood's death, [[André Previn]] recounted a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time."&lt;ref name=previn&gt;Previn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of Wood's conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork.&lt;ref&gt;Shore, p. 200 and Wood, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] persuaded him that it was no longer necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; To improve [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]], Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 100; and Boult, Adrian, "Stereo Strings", ''The Musical Times'', April 1973, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OlgaWood-ILN-1January1910-p6;.jpg|thumb|125px|alt=head and shoulders picture of a young woman with dark hair|Wood's first wife, Olga]]
Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera ''Shamus O'Brien'' at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, "I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-five years later, [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boult, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, p. 144; and Jacobs, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at [[Windsor Castle]] in November 1898, [[Queen Victoria]] chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, "Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?"&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior.{{refn|In his memoirs Wood refers to her as "Princess Olga Ouroussoff", but according to Jacobs (p. 59) she was entitled to neither the rank nor the surname, although her mother was Princess Sofiya Urusova|group= n}} Jacobs describes it as "a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Wood-1908.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=bearded man in evening dress seen from his left, conducting an orchestra and making a dramatic gesture, holding the baton high over his head|Wood in 1908 – painting by [[Cyrus Cuneo]]]]

The promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s, but in 1902 Newman, who had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations, found himself unable to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen's Hall Orchestra and was declared bankrupt. The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, retained Newman as manager of the concerts, and encouraged him and Wood to continue with their project of improving the public's taste.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1902, Wood accepted the conductorship of that year's [[Sheffield]] triennial festival. He continued to be associated with that festival until 1936, changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces. A German critic, reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication, wrote, "Two personalities now represent a new epoch in English musical life – [[Edward Elgar]] as composer, and Henry J. Wood as conductor."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 79, ''quoting'', Otto Lessman in ''Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung''&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, overtaxed by his enormous workload, Wood's health broke down. Even though this was during the Proms season, Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of scene. Leaving the leader of the orchestra, Arthur Payne, to conduct during his absence, Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco, missing the Proms concerts from 13 October to 8 November.&lt;ref name=cox44&gt;Cox, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals that Wood was neglecting British music.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 Newman unsuccessfully attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar's ''[[Enigma Variations]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; but in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] to London concertgoers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the first decade of the new century, however, Wood's reputation in conducting British music was in no doubt; he gave the world, British or London premieres of more than a hundred British works between 1900 and 1910.&lt;ref name=cox44/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs441"/&gt; Meanwhile, he introduced his audiences to many European composers. In the 1903 season, he programmed symphonies by [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] ([[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|No. 7]]), [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] ([[Symphony No. 1 (Sibelius)|No. 1]]), and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] ([[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|No. 1]]). In the same year, he introduced several of Richard Strauss's tone poems to London, and in 1905 he gave Strauss's ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]''.  This prompted the composer to write, "I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood's master hand has created in such a short time."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away."&lt;ref&gt;Levien, John Mewburn, ''quoted'' in Reid (1961), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning."&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood had great sympathy for rank-and-file orchestral players and strove for improvements in their pay.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to raise their status and was the first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to acknowledge applause along with the conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced women into the Queen's Hall Orchestra in 1913.&lt;ref name=cox56 &gt;Cox, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "I do not like ladies playing the trombone or double bass, but they can play the violin, and they do."&lt;ref&gt;"Future of Music: Interview with Sir Henry Wood", ''[[The Observer]]'', 2 June 1918, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; By 1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Henry Wood Will Stay", ''The Musical Herald'', July 1918, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time. He gave his ''Fantasia on Welsh Melodies'' and ''Fantasia on Scottish Melodies'' on successive nights in 1909.  He composed the work for which he is most celebrated, ''[[Fantasia on British Sea Songs]]'', for a concert in 1905, celebrating the centenary of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. It caught the public fancy immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s "See the Conquering Hero Comes" and [[Thomas Arne|Arne]]'s "Rule, Britannia!".  He played it at the Proms more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the "[[Last Night of the Proms]]", the lively concert marking the end of each season. It remained so under his successors, though often rearranged, notably by [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 31–32; and Orga, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In 2002 and 2003, the Fantasia was performed "with additional Songs arranged by [[John Wilson (conductor)|John Wilson]], Stephen Jackson (chorusmaster of the BBC Symphony Orchestra) and Percy Grainger";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/performance_find.shtml?work_id=32985&amp;all=1&amp;tab=search&amp;sub_tab=work "Fantasia on British Sea Songs (with additional Songs arranged by John Wilson, Stephen Jackson and Percy Grainger)"], Proms Archive, BBC, accessed 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 "with additional Songs arranged by Stephen Jackson";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/performance_find.shtml?work_id=32862&amp;all=1&amp;tab=search&amp;sub_tab=work "Fantasia on British Sea Songs (with additional Songs arranged by Stephen Jackson)"], Proms Archive, BBC, accessed 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, 2006 and 2007 with "extra Songs arranged by Bob Chilcott".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/performance_find.shtml?work_id=32793&amp;all=1&amp;tab=search&amp;sub_tab=work "Fantasia on British Sea Songs (with additional Songs arranged by Bob Chilcott)"], Proms Archive, BBC, accessed 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} A highlight of the Fantasia is the [[hornpipe]] ("Jack's the Lad"); Wood said of it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe – that is until I whip up the orchestra to a fierce ''[[Tempo#Terms for change in tempo|accelerando]]'' which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.&lt;ref name=wood192&gt;Wood, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:LSO-Queen's-Hall.jpg|thumb|left|alt=interior of a Victorian concert hall, showing the orchestra and conductor on the platform|The London Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall in 1911]]
Among Wood's other works was his ''Purcell Suite'', incorporating themes from [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s stage works and string sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range of composers from [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]] to [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 173 and 434–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood worked with his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the [[Norwich]] music festival he presented Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Choral]] Symphony and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', with his wife among the singers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss.{{refn|In his memoirs, Wood does not say where or for how long.|group= n}} On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 117; and Blom, Eric, "A Fauré Memorial Concert", ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 10 June 1925, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he accepted a [[knight bachelor|knighthood]],&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and declined the conductorship of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in succession to Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early part of the century, Wood was influential in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press.&lt;ref&gt;"Handel's Messiah and Applause", ''The Musical Times'', December 1902, p. 826; and Jacobs, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, [[Wolverhampton]], and [[Westmorland]] festivals, and at orchestral concerts in [[Cardiff]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leicester]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; His programming was summarised in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (28); [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] (16); [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] (16); J.S. Bach (14); [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] (14); Elgar (14); and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] (13).&lt;ref&gt;"The Autumn Music Festivals", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 August 1911, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arnold-schoenberg-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|alt=oil painting of head and shoulders of a bald man of early middle age looking at the artist|Schoenberg's music was hissed at the Proms in 1912.]]
The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of this part of Wood's career. Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Max Reger|Reger]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]].&lt;ref name=cox56/&gt; [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Five Pieces for Orchestra]]'' also received its first performance (the composer not being present);&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic [[Ernest Newman]] wrote after the performance: "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Ernest, "The Case of Arnold Schoenberg", ''The Nation'', 7 September 1912, p. 830, ''quoted'' in Lambourn, David, "Henry Wood and Schoenberg", ''The Musical Times'', August 1987, pp. 422–27&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: "I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands."&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 23 January 1914, quoted in Lambourn , David, "Henry Wood and Schoenberg", ''The Musical Times'', August 1987, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War and post-war===
On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned. They had by this time become an established institution,{{refn|Although Wood himself did not generally use the term "the Proms", it was common currency by now even in the more formal newspapers. It was used in ''The Observer'' and ''The Musical Times'' in 1912. ''The Times'' and ''The Manchester Guardian'' used the term from 1918 and 1923 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Covent Garden Opera – Le Lac Des Cygnes", ''The Observer'', 28 July 1912, p. 7; "London Concerts", ''The Musical Times'', December 1912 pp. 804–07; "The Promenade Concerts – Successful Opening of the Season", ''The Times'', 12 August 1918, p. 9; and Newman, Ernest, "The Week In Music", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 August 1923, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Even Wood used the term when referring to the [[The Proms#Last Night of the Proms|Last Night of the Proms]], which he called "the Last Prom of the Season".&lt;ref name=wood192/&gt;|group= n}} and it was agreed to go ahead. However, anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the US, and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned: "The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour."&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell's took on the responsibility for the Queen's Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, "Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale."&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the war, Wood received an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] invited him to become its musical director.&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; He had been guest conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic|Berlin]] and New York Philharmonic Orchestras,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs pp. 65 and 95&lt;/ref&gt; but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world.&lt;ref name=mop/&gt; Nonetheless, as he told Boult, "it was hard to refuse, but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wood-ILN-November 11, 1922; p. 769;.jpg|thumb|right|alt=drawing of a middle-aged man in evening dress, seen from his left, conducting an orchestra|Wood in 1922]]
After the war, the Proms continued much as before. The second halves of concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of which were not profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English conductor to receive the honour.{{refn|Wood was only the second conductor of any nationality to receive the honour, the first being [[Hans von Bülow]] in 1873. Wood received the award four years before it was given to Delius and Elgar (1925). The next conductor to receive the medal was Sir Thomas Beecham (1928).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/?page=awards/gold/goldmedallist.html "List of Gold Medal holders"] Royal Philharmonic Society, accessed 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} By now he was beginning to find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals.  [[Thomas Beecham]] had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, always admired and respected Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood's orchestra, including [[Basil Cameron]] and [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Another protégé of Wood was [[Malcolm Sargent]], who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1968), pp. 101 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1925 Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. Such was their success, both artistic and financial, that Wood was invited back, and conducted again the following year. In addition to a large number of English pieces, Wood programmed works by composers as diverse as Bach and Stravinsky. He again conducted there in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 203–06&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC and the Proms===
On his return to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood found himself in the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell's, William Boosey, and the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music, fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts. He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen's Hall from broadcasting for the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Boosey announced that Chappell's would no longer support concerts at the Queen's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC's announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Orga, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry-Wood-1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Caricature of a man in evening dress, seen from his left; he wears a large carnation in his lapel and is conducting an orchestra on tip-toe|Wood caricatured in 1922]]
The BBC regime brought immediate benefits. The use of the second half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, [[Roger Quilter|Quilter]] and [[Hubert Parry|Parry]] rather than ballads from Chappell's.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed.&lt;ref name=cox88&gt;Cox, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.&lt;ref name=cox88/&gt;

In 1929, Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics. "I got ''very fed up with them'', always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ...

Jacobs (p. 232) states that no such composer ever existed, although a Russian composer called Nicolai Klenovsky died in 1915. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' supports the latter statement.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/15142 "Klenovsky, Nikolay Semyonovich,"]  ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 November  2010 {{subscription}} and [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e5659 "Klenovsky, Paul",] ''Oxford Dictionary of Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 November  2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In Wood's later account, the press and the BBC "fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare {{sic}} for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and ''asked for''."&lt;ref name=jacobs232/&gt; Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth.&lt;ref&gt;"'Paul Klenovsky' a Musical Hoax by Sir Henry Wood", ''The Times'', 4 September 1934, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The press treated the deception as a great joke; ''[[The Times]]'' entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.&lt;ref&gt;"The Late Paul Klenovsky", ''The Times'', 5 September 1934, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Later, ''The Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; music critic (anonymous, but presumed to be [[Frank Howes]], the paper's music critic at the time) was less forgiving than his colleagues.

Wood Memorial Concert", ''The Times'', 5 March 1945, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

As Wood's working life took a turn for the better, his domestic life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad.{{refn|After the marital split, Muriel Wood lived in Japan (her brother was British consul in [[Nagasaki]]), China and New Zealand. She did not return to England until after Wood's death.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} She refused to divorce him.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 262–70 and 278&lt;/ref&gt; The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players recalled, "She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new evening suit, instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human."&lt;ref name=previn/&gt; As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to "Lady Jessie Wood" and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife.&lt;ref name=j265&gt;Jacobs, pp. 265–71&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.&lt;ref name=j265/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, index pp. 376 and 384&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with the year-round concert season. Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC in 1930. In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 140–41; and Jacobs, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC chose Wood for important collaborations with Bartók and [[Paul Hindemith]],{{refn|At BBC symphony concerts, Wood conducted Hindemith's Viola Concerto, with the composer as soloist, and his oratorio ''Das Unaufhörlich'';&lt;ref&gt;"B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra: Hindemith's Viola Concerto", ''The Times'', 23 November 1929, p. 10 and "Music This Week: An Oratorio by Hindemith", ''The Times'', 20 March 1933, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and Bartók's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Bartók)|Piano Concerto No 1]] with the composer as soloist.&lt;ref&gt;"Broadcasting, The Programmes, Sir Henry Wood At Queen's Hall", ''The Times'', 14 February 1930, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also programmed their music during Proms seasons.|group= n}} and for the first British performance of Mahler's vast [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; But Jacobs notes that, in the general concert repertory, Wood now had to compete against well-known foreign conductors such as [[Bruno Walter]], [[Willem Mengelberg]], and [[Arturo Toscanini]], "in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a workhorse".&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Jacobs Arthur, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/37001 "Wood, Sir Henry Joseph (1869–1944)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
In 1936, Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival. The choral works he conducted included the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'', Beethoven's ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'', [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]' ''[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]'', [[William Walton|Walton]]'s ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', and, in the presence of the composer, Rachmaninoff's ''[[The Bells (symphony)|The Bells]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 302–03&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wood began planning for a grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor. The [[Royal Albert Hall]] was chosen as the venue, having a far larger capacity than the Queen's Hall. The concert was given on 5 October 1938. Rachmaninoff played the solo part in his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Piano Concerto]], and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], at Wood's request, composed a short choral work for the occasion:  the ''[[Serenade to Music]]'' for orchestra and 16 soloists. The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan, Beethoven, Bach, [[Arnold Bax|Bax]], Wagner, Handel and Elgar. The orchestra comprised players from the three London orchestras: the London Symphony, [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The concert raised £9,000 for Wood's chosen charity, providing health care for musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 311–14 and 329–30&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Wood published his autobiography, ''My Life of Music''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Wood-bust-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|alt=metal bust of an elderly man with moustache, beard and receding hair|Bust of Wood at the Duke's Hall, [[Royal Academy of Music]], London. During [[the Proms]], it is placed in front of the organ at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].]]
In September 1939, the Second World War broke out and the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing. Its musical activities, including the orchestra, moved to Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7 September 1940. In May 1941, the hall was destroyed by bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

It was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 122 and 208–09&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel, Wood insisted on going to provincial cities to conduct – as much, according to Jacobs, to help the local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His final season was in 1944. The season began well with Wood in good form, but after three weeks raids by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the closure of places of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Proms were immediately relocated to [[Bedford]] some {{convert|50|mi|km}} away, where Wood continued to conduct. He was taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary Prom on 10 August; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its broadcast. Wood died just over a week later on 19 August at Hitchin Hospital in [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]];&lt;ref&gt;Orga, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; his funeral service was held in the town at [[St Mary's Church, Hitchin |St Mary's church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2010/wk36/sat.shtml "BBC Proms 2010 Sir Henry's Hoard"], BBC Press Office, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and his ashes were interred in the Musicians' Chapel of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-sepulchre.org.uk/20th_century.html 20th-Century Church History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316173757/http://www.st-sepulchre.org.uk/20th_century.html |date=16 March 2011 }} St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, accessed 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
Wood's recording career began in 1908, when he accompanied his wife Olga in "Farewell, forests" by Tchaikovsky, for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, better known as [[HMV|His Master's Voice]] or HMV. They made eight other records together for HMV over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; After Olga's death, Wood signed a contract with HMV's rival, [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]], for whom he made a series of discs between 1915 and 1917 with the singer [[Clara Butt]], including excerpts from Elgar's ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1915 and 1925 he conducted 65 recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process, including many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar's [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|Violin Concerto]] with [[Albert Sammons]] as soloist.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 426–28&lt;/ref&gt; When the microphone and electrical recording were introduced in 1925, Wood re-recorded the Elgar concerto, with Sammons, and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 428–29&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on compact disc and is well regarded by some critics.{{refn|The recording by Sammons and Wood was chosen in preference to all others by the reviewer Ian Burnside on [[BBC Radio 3]]'s "Building a Library" feature in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/building/data2/rev_844_2003.shtml "First Choice",] ''Building a Library'', BBC Radio 3, accessed 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Wood was wooed from Columbia by the young [[Decca records|Decca]] company in 1935. For Decca he conducted 23 recordings over the next two years, including Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'' and Vaughan Williams's ''[[A London Symphony]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 429–30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he returned to Columbia, for whom his five new recordings included the ''Serenade to Music'' with the 16 original singers, a few days after the premiere, and his own ''Fantasia on British Sea Songs''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood's recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death. ''[[The Record Guide]]'', 1956, lists none of his records.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, index, p. 957&lt;/ref&gt; A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dutton Vocalion]] CD (2001), catalogue number CDBP 9707&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours, memorials and reputation==
In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as [[Companion of Honour]] in 1944, to the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] (Belgium; 1920), and [[Officer of the Legion of Honour]] (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the [[Royal College of Music]] (1923).&lt;ref name=jacobs465&gt;Jacobs, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Henry Wood Hall (former Holy Trinity Church) - geograph.org.uk - 847582.jpg|thumb|left|alt=exterior shot of a neo-classical church used as a rehearsal space|Henry Wood Hall in [[Southwark]]]]
Jacobs lists 26&amp;nbsp;compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams ''Serenade to Music'', works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, [[Marcel Dupré]] and  Walton.&lt;ref name=jacobs465/&gt; The [[Poet Laureate|poet laureate]], [[John Masefield]], composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled "Sir Henry Wood", often referred to by its first line, "Where does the uttered music go?". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamwalton.net/works/choral/where_does_the_uttered_music_go.html "Where does the uttered Music go?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121021947/http://www.williamwalton.net/works/choral/where_does_the_uttered_music_go.html |date=21 November 2008 }}, WilliamWalton.net, accessed 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in [[Southwark]], which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwh.co.uk/history.htm "History"], Henry Wood Hall, accessed 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a [[laurel wreath|chaplet]] on the Last Night of the Proms.

His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him "Timber" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too. His tally of first performances, or first performances in Britain, was heroic: at least 717&amp;nbsp;works by 357&amp;nbsp;composers. Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not be his, particularly in his limited legacy of recordings, but he remains one of the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

'''Heritage studies''' looks at the relationship between people and tangible and intangible [[History|heritage]] through the use of social science research methods. The publication of the book by [[David Lowenthal]], ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', in 1985 is credited with creating the field (Carman &amp; Sørensen 2009). While related to the disciplines of [[history]], [[heritage conservation]], and [[historic preservation]], heritage studies is not necessarily concerned with the objective representation of the past. History is "the raw facts of the past" (Aitchison, MacLeod, &amp; Shaw 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;96) while heritage "is history processed through mythology, ideology, nationalism, local pride, romantic ideas or just plain marketing" (Schouten 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;21). The meanings of heritage are therefore subjective and rooted in the present; these meanings are defined by social, cultural, and individual processes. In other words, the meanings of heritage can be understood through contemporary sociocultural and experiential values. Lowenthal (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;410) argues that in the realm of human experience, we create heritage; to most people, heritage is therefore more important than history and is a product of human invention and creativity.

'''Island Oak High School''' is located in Duncan, [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], in [[Canada]].  It offers Grades 9 to 12. Enrollment is limited to between 30 and 50 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Island Oak High School|url=http://www.islandoak.org/#!about-us/c1se|publisher=Island Oak High School|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current enrollment is around twenty students split into two classes. There is a faculty of thirteen teachers, specialists, administrators, and assistants.  In Feb. 2007 the school hosted the BC Waldorf Teachers Conference.

The school has been operated since 1995 by the Steiner Educational Society, a group of parents and community members. It is certified by the Ministry of Education of British Columbia and receives government funding for Independent Schools.

The school is a Developing Member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWSNA/WECAN Membership Directory|url=http://www.waldorfearlychildhood.org/uploads/other_documents/BiAnnualMemberDirectory.pdf|publisher=Waldorf Early Childhood Association of North America|accessdate=2 February 2016|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, over half of the Grade 9 students entering the school come from a Waldorf elementary school. [[Sunrise Waldorf School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunrisewaldorfschool.org Welcome to the Sunrise Waldorf School&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at sunrisewaldorfschool.org&lt;/ref&gt; a Kindergarten to Grade Eight school also located in the [[Cowichan Valley]], provides many of the students, but is not formally associated with Island Oak High School.

Every year since founding, a number of international students have come to the school in exchange for Island Oak High School students visiting their countries.  Approximately 25% of the students are boarding or exchange students. They come from Waldorf Schools in France, Germany, England, Russia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Australia. Most recently, exchange students have come from Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan and other Asian locations. International students stay for periods ranging from three months to several years. The opportunity to travel to other countries, to study and learn other languages and immerse themselves in other cultures is an attraction for BC and Canadian students of Grade Ten and Eleven. The high school offers many opportunities for students to grow and explore in their learning environment. Island oak typically sees two short-term exchanges per year with varying numbers of students, one at the beginning of the first semester and a second at the beginning of the second semester.

== Research==

Jonah Rockoff's research focuses on teachers, in particular the measurement of teachers' impact, and public schools.

=== Research on teachers===

Revolving themes in Rockoff's research on teachers are teachers' effectiveness and the recruitment and retention of effective teachers. For example, he estimates that increasing teacher quality by one standard deviation raises reading and math test scores by approximately 0.20 and 0.24 standard deviations, respectively, and reading scores are found to increase in teachers' experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041302244 Rockoff, J.E. (2004). The impact of individual teachers on student achievement: Evidence from panel data. ''American Economic Association: Paper &amp; Proceedings'', 94(2), pp. 247-252.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, together with [[Donald Boyd|Boyd]], [[Susanna Loeb|Loeb]], [[James Wyckoff|Wyckoff]] and [[Hamilton Lankford|Lankford]], Rockoff finds that the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach for America initiatives were able to substantially reduce the gap between the average qualifications of teachers at New York City's low- and high-poverty schools by substituting uncertified teachers in high-pverty schools by academically qualified teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pam.20377 Boyd, D. et al. (2008). The narrowing gap in New York City teacher qualifications and its implications for student achievement in high-poverty schools. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 27(4), pp. 793-818.]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Thomas Kane (economist)|Kane]] and [[Douglas Staiger|Staiger]], Rockoff has also studied how to recruit effective teachers. In particular, they find that—unlike teachers' performance in classrooms during the first two years—teacher certification poorly predicts teachers' future effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v27y2008i6p615-631.html Kane, T.J., Rockoff, J.E., Staiger, D.O. (2006). What does certification tell us about teacher effectiveness? Evidence from New York City. ''Economics of Education Review'', 27(6), pp. 615-631.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that composite measures of teachers' cognitive and non-cognitive skills predict well teachers' effectiveness, though individual measures do not (with [[Brian Jacob]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/EDFP_a_00022 Rockoff, J.E. et al. (2011). Can you recognize an effective teacher when you recruit one? ''Education Finance and Policy'', 6(1), pp. 43-74.]&lt;/ref&gt; This research is complemented by work with [[Cecilia Speroni]], wherein he principals' subjective evaluations of teacher effectiveness to be good predictors of teachers' objective effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537111000315 Rockoff, J.E., Speroni, C. (2011). Subjective and objective evaluations of teacher effectiveness: Evidence from New York City. ''Labour Economics'', 18, pp. 687-696.]&lt;/ref&gt; Next to teacher recruitment, Rockoff's research on teacher retention has found that mentoring among [[New York City|NYC]] teachers has only a weak effect on teachers' turnover, absenteeism and their students' achievements, though there is some evidence that mentoring successfully improves school-specific knowledge and teaching skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rockoff |first=J. E. |date=March 2008 |title=Does Mentoring Reduce Turnover and Improve Skills of New Employees? Evidence from Teachers in New York City |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13868 |doi=10.3386/w13868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Rockoff's views on the recruitment, evaluation and retention of teachers in the U.S. are summarized in a ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives|JEP]]'' article with Staiger, wherein they highlight five empirical findings: (1) teachers' impact on student achievement vary strongly; (2) measures of teacher effectiveness based on student test scores are unreliable; (3) teachers' effectiveness increases degressively over their careers; (4) the main issue related to teacher turnover is the loss in student achievement as students are taught by less experienced teachers rather than the direct cost of hiring and firing teachers; and (5) identifying effective teachers at the time of recruitment—as opposed to based on their actual job performance—is very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.3.97 Staiger, D.O., Rockoff, J.E. (2010). Searching for effective teachers with imperfect information. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 24(3), pp. 97-118.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, Rockoff and his co-researchers [[Raj Chetty]] and [[John Friedman]] have researched better ways to measure the effectiveness of teachers, with a focus on the [[value-added modeling|value added methodology]]. They find that value-added provides unbiased estimates of teachers' impacts on student achievement and that teachers with high value-added improve students' adulthood outcomes, with a one standard deviation increase in a teacher's value-added in a single grade corresponding to a 1% increase in earnings of her students' earnings by age 28.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jrockoff/papers/value_added_dec2011.pdf Chetty, R., Friedman, J.N., Rockoff, J.E. (2011). The long-term impacts of teachers: Teacher value-added and student outcomes in adulthood. ''National Bureau of Economic Research'', No. 17699.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.9.2593 Chetty, R., Friedman, J.N., Rockoff, J.E. (2014).

''American Economic Review'', 104(9), pp. 2593-2632.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.9.2633 Chetty, R., Friedman, J.N., Rockoff, J.E. (2014). Measuring the impacts of teachers II: Teacher value-added and student outcomes in adulthood. ''American Economic Review'', 104(9), pp. 2633-2679.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on public schools, crime and housing===

Next to his research on teachers, Rockoff has also studied public schools, the impact of sex offender registration, and the relationship between crime risk and property values. Together with Damon Clark and Paco Martorell, Rockoff finds scant evidence for a relationship between school performance and principals' education and work experience, though there is a benefit to having worked as assistant principal beforehand and students' test scores improve as principal experience increases, suggesting principal retention as an important policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509693.pdf |last=Clark |first=D. |last2=Martorell |first2=P. |last3=Rockoff |first3=J. |year=2009 |title=School Principals and School Performance |work=Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research Working Paper Series No. 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his research with [[Caroline Hoxby]] on the impact of [[charter school]]s on student achievement, Rockoff finds that charter school attendance improves elementary school students' scores in math and reading by ca. six percentile point ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/labor/seminars/adp/pdfs/2005hoxby.pdf |last=Hoxby |first=C. M. |last2=Rockoff |first2=J. E. |year=2004 |title=The impact of charter schools on student achievement |work=Unpublished Working Paper |accessdate=April 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In work with [[Leigh Linden]], Rockoff observes that house prices within 0.1  miles of a sex offender fall on average by 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1257/aer.98.3.1103 |last=Linden |first=L. |last2=Rockoff |first2=J. E. |year=2008 |title=Estimates of the impact of crime risk on property values from Megan's Laws |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=1103–1127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in research with J.J. Prescott, Rockoff finds that both [[sex offender registration]] and notification reduce the frequency of reported sex offenses against local victims, though the former acts by keeping police informed about local sex offenders, whereas the latter deters non-registered offenders and actually may exacerbate  [[recidivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/658485 |last=Prescott |first=J. J. |last2=Rockoff |first2=J. E. |year=2011 |title=Do Sex Offender Registration and Notification Laws Affect Criminal Behaviour? |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=161–206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lesson''' is a structured period of time where [[learning]] is intended to occur.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It involves one or more [[student]]s (also called pupils or learners in some circumstances) being taught by a [[teacher]] or instructor. A lesson may be either one section of a [[textbook]] (which, apart from the printed page, can also include [[multimedia]]) or, more frequently, a short period of time during which learners are taught about a particular subject or taught how to perform a particular activity. Lessons are generally taught in a [[classroom]] but may instead take place in a [[situated learning]] [[social environment|environment]].

In a wider sense, a lesson is an insight gained by a learner into previously unfamiliar subject-matter. Such a lesson can be either planned or accidental, enjoyable or painful. The colloquial phrase "to teach someone a lesson", means to punish or scold a person for a mistake they have made in order to ensure that they do not make the same mistake again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Lessons can also be made entertaining. When the term ''[[education]]'' is combined with ''[[entertainment]]'', the term ''[[edutainment]]'' is coined.

==Types of lesson==
The potential format and  speaks to one or more people in the same room or space. This may be supplemented with gestures and tools. A lesson may range from a lecture, to a demonstration, to a discussion or a blend of some of these common presentation methods.

Some lessons may involve work by the student. Traditionally this might include reading and writing or creating something, perhaps when the instructor is not present. The student may work independently or collaborate with others.

More recent technologies have expanded the way a lesson can be delivered. For example: film strips, pre-recorded audio and video tapes, television programs and podcasts are some ways to deliver or add to a lesson. [[Distance education]] techniques such as [[video teleconference|video conferencing]], or [[electronic learning]] in a [[virtual learning environment]] have allowed interactive lessons to be presented to students who may not be in the same physical location. These tools offer new synchronous, asynchronous and blended ways to deliver lessons.

==Lesson plan==
{{main|Lesson plan}}
Teachers and instructors usually have a [[lesson plan]] which dictates the structure of the teaching. A group of lessons may be linked together in a unit plan, scheme, or work. The detail of the plan may vary with some being a simple list of what is going to be taught in a lesson with others working including much more detail, such as a time plan and the learning aims and objectives. Student teachers and beginning teachers are usually advised to put a great amount of detail into the written plan. This ensures that the plan will be cohesive, that all the components of a successful lesson are taken care of, and that one has a checklist to ensure that practicalities are taken care of (e.g., resources, scheduling, and [[classroom management]] considerations). Furthermore, beginning teachers are often advised to script some sections for themselves, such as questions they might ask the students in order to get a discussion going at the beginning of the lesson. The expectation is that the teachers can and should depart from the script when appropriate; improvisation is definitely encouraged and the fact of having written it out in advance ensures that an adequate amount of thought has been put into it ahead of time. Another reason for including a great amount of detail is that student teachers are often required to submit lesson plans in advance to their mentor teachers or professors in order to receive feedback on their ideas. When creating the lesson plan it is usual to look at the following:
* The aims (the broader goals of the lesson, what it is reaching towards)
* The objectives (the specific, measurable outcomes of the lesson – the particular skills or knowledge students should have acquired by its conclusion)
* The number of attendees and the student-teacher ratio
* The previous knowledge of the learners (which may or may not be the same for all) and how this will be activated at the start of the lesson
* The motivation of the learners (school students, for example, have no choice but to attend so the teacher must build some kind of motivation into the lesson)
* The time required for each section of teaching and learning
* The resources required and available
* Catering for the different needs (cultural differences, learning styles, special needs) of the individuals
* How the lesson is to be evaluated

==Etymology==
The word ''lesson'' comes from [[Latin]] ''lectio'' "the action of reading (out)". From there, the word was also used for the text itself, very often a passage from the [[Bible]] read out during a religious service ("first lesson", "second lesson"). Finally, any portion of a book to be studied was referred to as a ''lesson''.

'''Lucy Myers Wright Mitchell''' (March 20, 1845 – March 10, 1888) was an [[United States|American]] writer, historian, and expert on [[ancient art]].  Mitchell was one of the first Americans to write and publish a book on [[classical sculpture]] and was one of the first women to study the field of [[classical archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''murder of Heather Rich''' is an American [[child murder]] case dating from October 1996 in which a 16-year-old high school student from [[Waurika, Oklahoma]] was [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]], [[rape]]d, then shot to death before her body was thrown into a creek in [[Montague County, Texas|Montague County]], [[Texas]].

Three teenagers (two of whom had been known to Heather) were arrested two weeks after the discovery of her body; each would later be tried and subsequently convicted of Heather's murder. One of the perpetrators would be sent to two terms of life [[Life imprisonment#United States|life imprisonment]] with no possibility of [[parole]]; a second individual would be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment plus 99 years for [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy to commit murder]], while the third individual was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 40 years.

Conflicting [[testimony]] delivered at two of the perpetrators' separate trials leads to ongoing speculation as to which of the trio actually shot and killed Heather.

==Early life==
'''Heather Rose Rich''' (January 19, 1980{{spaced endash}}October 3, 1996) was the third of four children and only daughter born to Gail and Duane Rich.&lt;ref name="bendriver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1992676/A-bend-in-the-river.html|title=A bend in the river|date=July 1, 2002|work=Texas Monthly|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=July 1, 2018|author=Colloff, Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather was an avid horse rider and a talented musician, and has been described by her family as "a naive girl with a big heart." An academically successful sophomore who was popular with her peers at Waurika High School,&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt; she had a notably excitable personality.

According to one of her friends, despite her [[masking (personality)|façade]] of ebullience, Heather was a "very troubled" teenager,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-bend-in-the-river/|title=A Bend in the River|first=Pamela|last=Colloff|date=July 1, 2002|publisher=|via=www.texasmonthly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she began to exhibit troublesome behavior both at home and at school in the late summer and early fall of 1996. Her classmate and former boyfriend, 17-year-old Randy Wood, would state this emotional behavior largely stemmed from Heather's restlessness at the fact Waurika held few amenities to entertain the town's youth.&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|The total population of Waurika in 1996 was just 1,988 people.}} On September 27, she and another girl had been temporarily [[Suspension (punishment)#OSS/Out of School Suspension|suspended]] from Waurika High School and the ''Waurika Eagles'' [[cheerleader|cheerleading]] team for their being noticeably [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] upon the sidelines of a school cheerleading performance.&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt; The duration of this suspension was just three days, and she was expecting to be a potential candidate to be the sophomore class [[Homecoming#Homecoming Court|homecoming queen]] of Waurika High School on October 11.&lt;ref name="Newsok.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigation Continues in Teen's Death |date=October 15, 1996 |url=https://newsok.com/article/2554658/investigation-continues-in-teens-death |publisher=Newsok.com |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2, 1996===
At approximately 11 p.m. on the evening of October 2, 1996, Heather left her home without her parents' knowledge to meet a 17-year-old Waurika High School senior named Joshua Bagwell in a trailer parked at the rear of the home of Bagwell's grandfather.&lt;ref name="Wayback Machine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends Face One Another in Courtroom Climax |date=May 6, 1998 |url=http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0506.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227000424/http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0506.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 27, 2012 |publisher=Wayback Machine |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell had already been drinking heavily with his friends, 19-year-old Curtis Gambill and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Wood. One of the trio had earlier telephoned Heather to suggest she join them at Bagwell's trailer that evening.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Heather arrived at the trailer, both Wood and Gambill left Heather and Bagwell alone for approximately one hour, believing that as this was their first date, the two wished to be left alone. When Wood and Gambill returned to the trailer approximately one hour later, both Bagwell and Heather were naked, and a bottle of [[gin]] had been half consumed. Heather was extremely drunk, later being described as largely [[insensibility (intelligence)|insensible]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victim's Mom Dismayed by Texas Jail Escape |date=February 4, 2018 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126380&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell would later claim the two had engaged in [[Sexual consent|consensual sex]]. According to Wood's later trial testimony, the three youths, themselves intoxicated, began goading each other to sexually assault Heather while she was naked and largely insensible.&lt;ref name="Coloff"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-question-of-mercy/|title=A Question of Mercy|first=Pamela|last=Coloff|date=March 1, 2014|publisher=|via=www.texasmonthly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood then proceeded to sexually assault Heather ([[fingering (sexual act)|digitally penetrating]] her) before Gambill himself engaged in [[rape|unconsensual sex]] with the semi-conscious girl. Shortly after Gambill had engaged in sex with Heather, she partially roused out of her semi-conscious state and began began moaning, screaming and crying.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tangle of Guilt and Repentance Follows Slaying of Cheerleader |date=May 31, 1998 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/31/news/mn-55034/2 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly fearing the girl would later accuse the trio of rape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victim's Mom Dismayed by Texas Jail Escape |date=February 4, 2018 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126380&amp;page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambill then decided to kill Heather and, with a measure of force, successfully persuaded Bagwell and Wood to assist him in the commission of this act.&lt;ref name="NYT12Feb" /&gt; According to Wood, Gambill pointed his [[shotgun]] at him and ordered him to dress Heather before he and Bagwell carried her into Bagwell's grandfather's pickup truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Families Face Tragedies of Murder; Ill Feelings During Trial |date=May 7, 1998 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/16838005/ |publisher=Galveston Daily News |accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell then began to drive in a seemingly aimless manner around southern Oklahoma for in excess of an hour as Gambill repeatedly exclaimed they would have to kill her before driving to desolate property his grandparents owned as a potential murder location. Gambill vetoed Bagwell's choice of a murder location, stating this location could easily be traced to the trio. Gambill then chose to drive the truck; driving towards a cement bridge upon a rural road in Belknap Creek, Texas.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

At this location, Gambill retrieved his shotgun from the vehicle as he ordered Bagwell and Wood to "get her out and put her on the side (of the road)." Bagwell and Wood then carried Heather towards the bridge, where Gambill proceeded to shoot her several times in the head and torso with the shotgun as she lay upon the ground.&lt;ref name="CochraneFriends" /&gt; Wood would later claim that he had sat inside the pickup truck as Gambill approached Heather with the shotgun in his hand; he had then covered his face with his hands before hearing "the first shot ... then I heard a bunch more."{{refn|group=n|In a 2014 interview Randy Wood granted to the [[prosecutor]] at his trial, Tim Cole, he (Wood) remained adamant Heather Rich had been so intoxicated she was unaware of her impending fate, and that by the time they had arrived at Belknap Creek, she had been completely "passed out".&lt;ref name="Coloff" /&gt;}} He then climbed from the truck to observe Gambill appearing "dazed at what he'd done." Joshua Bagwell then took one of Heather's shoelaces and used this item to secure a rock to weight her body.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tangle of Guilt and Repentance Follows Slaying of Cheerleader |date=May 31, 1998 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/31/news/mn-55034/3 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather's body was then thrown over the guard rail into the creek below before the trio attempted to conceal the extensive bloodstains at the precise murder scene by kicking and throwing soil across the ground.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

Discovering that their daughter's bed had not been slept in and that all her possessions were untouched, yet that her bedroom window was open, Gail and Duane Rich reported Heather [[missing person|missing]] to the [[Jefferson County, Oklahoma|Jefferson County]] Sheriff's Department the following day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact Heather had not taken any of her personal possessions with her,&lt;ref name="Newsok.com"/&gt; when police learned from Gail that Heather had recently argued with her mother over a $300 phone bill for which she (Heather) had largely been responsible for the accrual, investigators initially assumed Heather had likely temporarily eloped from her household to stay with friends, and would likely return home within hours. Aghast, Gail responded: "When your daughter is missing, you can stay at home!" She and her family then began making their own inquiries around Waurika for information as to Heather's whereabouts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They would subsequently hire a [[private investigator]] to assist in the search for their daughter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy===
Heather's body was discovered partially submerged in the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] by a rancher and his daughter on October 10.{{refn|group=n|This individual had actually initially spotted Heather's body on October 9, but had initially believed her body to be a drowned calf.&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt;}} Due to a combination of [[decomposition]] and the sheer number of shotgun wounds she had received, including the fact she had been shot once in the back of the head, her face and body were largely unrecognizable. Thus initially, her body was tentatively identified by her father via his recognizing a gold [[signet ring]] Heather had received as a present for her 16th birthday. Her body would later be officially identified via [[forensic dentistry|dental records]]
&lt;ref name="pressreader.com"&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/uk/real-people/20180705/281509341929594 ''Time to Kill''. ''pressreader.com July 5, 2018'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The wounds Heather had received had disfigured her body to such an extreme that her parents were not allowed to make a visual identification of their daughter.&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt;}}

The [[autopsy]] of Heather's body revealed she had been shot nine times with an M-9 [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] shotgun, with [[Shot (pellet)|pellets]] from the [[Shotgun shell#Shot sizes|buckshot]] rounds fired also hitting her body in several locations. One of these shots had been fired into the back of her head, with the remaining eight rounds being fired into her lower back, waist, pelvis and buttocks. In conjunction with the pattern of the bloodstains discovered at the preliminary [[crime scene]], the trajectory of the shotgun wounds indicated Heather had most likely been shot as she lay face down, with her death being almost instantaneous.

===Funeral===
The funeral of Heather Rich was conducted on Monday, October 14, 1996 at the Praise Assembly of God Church in [[Comanche County, Oklahoma|Comanche County]].&lt;ref name="Newsok.com"/&gt; She was laid to rest in Fletcher Cemetery. As her murderer or murderers had neither been apprehended or convicted at the time of the service and with her family strongly suspecting her murderer(s) had not been strangers to her, Heather's family forbade any individual outside her immediate family from touching her [[coffin]] throughout the service, with her mother stating that prior to the service, she had promised her only daughter that "whoever did this to her would never touch her again."&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt;

==Perpetrators==
===Curtis Allen Gambill===
Curtis Gambill was a high-school dropout. He was born on February 24, 1977, and at the time of Heather's murder, he was living with his 64-year-old grandmother in [[Terral, Oklahoma]]. Gambill was known to possess a short temper, and to exhibit [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] features, being known to have regularly forced boys to fight each other in his presence upon the threat that if they did not do so, they would otherwise have to fight him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously escaped from every [[youth detention center]] in which he had been incarcerated, and had been briefly committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] at age 17. In addition, he had been convicted of [[gun laws in Oklahoma|feloniously carrying a firearm]] in February 1996; receiving a five-year [[suspended sentence]].{{refn|group=n|According to one investigator, Curtis Gambill had been the "most violent person" he had ever encountered in his career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;}}

In the week prior to Heather's disappearance, Gambill was notably [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] due to his best friend, 20-year-old Dennis Goss, having committed suicide on 25 September. Just days prior to October 2, he and his close friend Joshua Bagwell had attended Goss's funeral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Joshua Luke Bagwell===
Joshua Bagwell was born on December 21, 1978. His parents were among the wealthiest landowners in southern Oklahoma, although as his parents' employment led them to be largely absent from home, he had lived with his grandparents since the age of 16.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tangle of Guilt and Repentance Follows Slaying of Cheerleader |date=May 31, 1998 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/31/news/mn-55034 |publisher=Newsok.com |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell was a [[senior (education)#High school|senior]] at Waurika High School, and by October 1996, had been the recipient of six new cars. He was variously described as being a [[snob]]bish and pampered youth, although he was considered somewhat of an outcast among his peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} pp. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt; He and Gambill had formed a mutual friendship, in part due to their shared interests in firearms, drinking, camping, and fishing. Occasionally, the camping and fishing trips the two had eloped upon had seen the pair travel to the environs of Belknap Creek.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} pp. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

Undisciplined at home, Bagwell had once been arrested for [[driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]], and had demanded a lawyer while [[resisting arrest#Oklahoma|resisting arrest]]. Both Randy Wood and Heather Rich had been impressed by Bagwell's affluent means; the latter commenting on more than one occasion that she had [[flirting|flirted]] with Bagwell until she had secured a seat in his white [[Dodge Stealth]] for the forthcoming Waurika [[homecoming#Parade|homecoming parade]]. On the night of October 2, Heather had sneaked from her parents' home to meet Bagwell for what was supposed to be their first date.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Randy Lee Wood===
Randy Wood was born on July 7, 1979. He and his [[single parent|single-parent]] mother had frequently relocated throughout Oklahoma during his childhood—frequently resulting in him having to attend numerous different schools. By 1996, Wood lived with his mother in a largely dilapidated house, and his family was known as one of the poorest in Waurika.

Wood began smoking [[cannabis]] in the third grade, often stealing the money or the narcotic itself from his mother. Despite his personal disadvantages, Wood endeavored to better himself among his peers, and by 1996, was the captain of the Waurika High School football team, having earned the respect of the entire team. He and Heather had dated for approximately five months, during which they had regularly attended church together and conversed on the phone, although their relationship, despite being an [[intimate relationship|intimate]] one, had never resulted in [[sexual intercourse]], and the two were frequently mistaken as simply being friends. Having heard a rumor Heather had [[nude swimming|skinny-dipped]] at a party, Wood chose to end their relationship, although the two remained close friends.&lt;ref name="pressreader.com"/&gt;

One week after Heather's body was found at Belknap Creek, Randy Wood was crowned [[homecoming#Homecoming Court|homecoming king]] of Waurika High School.

==Investigation and arrests==
A total of 14 investigators were assigned to investigate Heather's murder. The investigation was assisted by the [[FBI]] in the event [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[kidnapping]] charges could be brought against the perpetrator or perpetrators should Heather have been transported across [[border|state lines]] against her will.

Initially encountering a wall of silence from much of Waurika's youth as to Heather's potential whereabouts, by the second week of the inquiry, investigators focused more closely on a potential lead provided by Heather's best friend on the cheerleading squad that Heather may have left her home to attend a party at the home of a classmate of theirs named Joshua Luke Bagwell. Upon informal questioning, Bagwell initially claimed he and a friend of his named Randy Wood (both of whom had earlier been questioned by Gail Rich as to her daughter's whereabouts) had not seen Heather on October 2 as they had been playing dominoes and drinking whisky and beer in his trailer until approximately 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the following day. Wood would [[corroborating evidence|corroborate]] this statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1992676/A-bend-in-the-river.html|title=A bend in the river|date=July 1, 2002|work=Texas Monthly|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=August 25, 2018|author=Colloff, Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having discovered that the buckshot rounds fired from the Winchester shotgun which killed Heather were of a distinct brand, investigators soon learned that only one store in Waurika had stocked this brand. Conversing with the owners of the store, these investigators discovered that just days prior to the murder, 20 rounds had been purchased by one Joshua Bagwell. The owner of this store was also able to positively identify Bagwell from an assembled [[police lineup]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; Furthermore, an employee of this store was adamant that at the time Bagwell had made this purchase, he had been in the company of another young male.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Further discovering that Bagwell had spent much of his time in recent months in the company of a 19-year-old high school dropout named Curtis Allen Gambill, and had regularly hunted in his company,&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; Curtis Gambill was arrested on October 24. He was [[interrogation|questioned]] for a total of eight hours, and agreed to submit to a [[polygraph test]] pertaining to his potential [[culpability]] in Heather's murder. Gambill failed this polygraph test, and subsequently agreed to allow investigators to subject the shotgun he owned to [[Forensic firearm examination|ballistic fingerprinting]] to determine whether this firearm had been used to murder Heather Rich.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/31/news/mn-55034/2|title=Tangle of Guilt and Repentance Follows Slaying of Cheerleader|access-date=August 23, 2018|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 31, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|A piece of [[circumstantial evidence]] against Gambill revealed by his grandmother on October 24 was that, as a child, she had regularly taken her grandson fishing at the very same bridge where the murder of Heather Rich had taken place.}}

Discovering the results of the ballistic analysis of his shotgun indicated the firearm had been the one used to murder Heather Rich, and that the weapon was capable of firing nine rounds before requiring reloading, Gambill confessed to being a participant in Heather's murder, also naming Bagwell and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Lee Wood, as participants in the murder. According to Gambill, Wood had been the instigator of the crime, and the actual murderer, with himself and Bagwell acting upon his (Wood's) instructions. Wood's actual [[motive (law)|motive]], Gambill claimed, had been [[sexual jealousy]] due to the fact Heather had engaged in sex with Bagwell and not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convicted Man Denies Murder: Appeal of Verdict Planned |date=August 29, 1998 |url=https://newsok.com/article/2624540/convicted-man-denies-murder-appeal-of-verdict-planned |publisher=Newsok.com |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagwell and Wood were also arrested on October 24. Bagwell refused to admit any culpability in Heather's murder; invoking his [[right to silence]] and refusing to submit to a polygraph test. Shortly thereafter, his family hired a team of high-profile lawyers to defend him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;''Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-292-71675-9}} p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Randy Wood willingly agreed to provide a written [[witness statement|statement]] in which he confessed to his being a participant in the murder, although he was adamant Curtis Gambill had been the instigator of the entire crime, and the individual who had shot and killed Heather, adding that Joshua Bagwell had been a knowing and willing participant. Wood further claimed not to have actually believed Gambill was serious in his vocal intentions to murder Heather until Gambill had parked the pickup upon the Belknap Creek bridge. He also agreed to submit to a polygraph test to verify his version of events—the results of which fully corroborated his written statement.

Initially, all three individuals were charged with the kidnapping of Heather and denied [[bail]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; All would subsequently be formally charged with [[murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]] in [[Montague County, Texas]] on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 Teens Face Charges In Waurika Girl's Death |date=October 26, 1996 |url=https://newsok.com/article/2553574/3-teens-face-charges-in-waurika-girls-death |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials of all three [[defendant]]s were held in Texas. Owing to the [[law of Texas]], all three individuals were tried as adults.&lt;ref name="airwolf" /&gt;

==Trials==
===Gambill===
Curtis Gambill was brought to trial on October 15, 1997. He was tried in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]].&lt;ref name="NYT12Feb"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/12/us/teen-ager-abandons-plea-agreement-in-killing-of-cheerleader.html|title=Teen-Ager Abandons Plea Agreement in Killing of Cheerleader|date=February 12, 1998|work=New York Times online|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his trial had begun, Gambill accepted a [[plea bargain]] offered by Montague County [[district attorney]] Tim Cole, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to Heather's murder—admitting to being the individual who had physically taken her life—in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Spurns Plea Bargain In Death Case |date=February 12, 1998 |url=https://newsok.com/article/2602608/teen-spurns-plea-bargain-in-death-case |publisher=Newsok.com |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of [[Life imprisonment#United States|life imprisonment]] with a potential possibility of parole after 30 years.&lt;ref name="TDCJ Gambill"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05746545 |title=Offender Information Details {{bracket|Gambill}} |publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |location=[[Huntsville, Texas]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224215055/https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05746545 |archive-date=February 24, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his plea bargain, Gambill also agreed to testify against Bagwell at his upcoming trial.&lt;ref name="CochraneFriends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0506.html|title=Friends face one another in courtroom climax|last=Cochran|first=Mike|date=May 6, 1988|work=Abilene Reporter-News|accessdate=May 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614100439/http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0506.html|archive-date=2011-06-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Montague County, Texas|Montague County]] [[District Attorney]] Tim Cole had initially intended to pursue a death sentence for Gambill, and mandatory sentences of [[life imprisonment]] against Bagwell and Wood.

[[File:Montague county courthouse.jpg|195px|thumb|Montague County courthouse. Both Bagwell and Wood were tried at this location in 1998.]]

===Bagwell===
Joshua Bagwell was brought to trial in February 1998. Prior to and at his trial, he refused to admit any culpability in her murder; claiming that his intercourse with Heather after Gambill and Wood had initially left the two alone in his trailer had been consensual;&lt;ref name="TexNewsStunning" /&gt; that he had later left his trailer prior to Gambill and Wood actually discussing killing Heather; and that he had ultimately believed the trio were simply driving Heather around in an effort to [[sobriety|sober]] her up before returning her home. Furthermore, he stated that he was unaware of any actual plan to murder her.&lt;ref name="airwolf" /&gt;

At Bagwell's trial, Gambill reneged upon his own previous agreement with prosecutors; changing his story and reverting to his initial claims upon arrest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; This testimony largely suited the portrayal of Bagwell by the defense; minimizing Bagwell's role in the murder and corroborating his own claims that Wood had committed Heather's murder.&lt;ref name="TexNewsStunning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0505.html|title=A stunning reversal changes the case|last=Cochran|first=Mike|date=May 5, 1998|work=May 5, 1998|publisher=Texas News|accessdate=May 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115050906/http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/death0505.html|archive-date=2010-11-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Wood had initially accepted a similar plea bargain to that previously offered to Gambill in exchange for his testimony at Bagwell's then-forthcoming trial. However, the evening before he was due to give evidence, Wood—against the vehement advice of his defense attorney—changed his mind and rejected the plea bargain,&lt;ref name="NYT12Feb" /&gt; insisting he wished to testify against Bagwell without any preconditions despite being informed by his lawyer that he risked either a longer prison sentence or a potential death penalty if convicted.

On the third day of testimony, Wood testified under [[oath]] that Gambill had largely orchestrated the murder, had shot and killed Heather, and that Bagwell had been a full, knowing participant in the act.&lt;ref name="NYT12Feb" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|Wood has since been quoted as saying that, although aware of the risk factors by taking this course of action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen-Ager Abandons Plea Agreement in Killing of Cheerleader |date=February 12, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/12/us/teen-ager-abandons-plea-agreement-in-killing-of-cheerleader.html |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had done so both for his own peace of mind, for the benefit of Heather and her family,&lt;ref name="NYT12Feb" /&gt; and also to improve the credibility of his testimony, stating: "I figure I owe it to [Heather] and her parents and her family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen-Ager Abandons Plea Agreement in Killing of Cheerleader |date=February 12, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/12/us/teen-ager-abandons-plea-agreement-in-killing-of-cheerleader.html |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since stated: "I knew it would make people see I was telling the truth."&lt;ref name="CochranTrial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/050598/0505980013.shtml|title=Trial in girl's death takes turn|last=Cochran|first=Mike|work=Lubbock Avelanche-Journal|pages=May 5, 1998|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceG" /&gt;}}

The day after Wood delivered his testimony, Bagwell testified before the jury. He insisted he had not been present in his trailer when Wood and Gambill had discussed murdering Heather, and blamed Wood for her actual shooting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG" /&gt; Bagwell added his conjecture that Wood's motivation for this act had been that he had been angry at Heather for earlier refusing to engage in intercourse with him (Wood). Bagwell finally claimed not to have been physically close to the actual crime scene at the time Heather had actually been murdered, but had walked away to urinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waurika Man Gets Prison Term Cheerleader Slaying Nets Life Sentence, Too |date=February 19, 1998 |url=https://newsok.com/article/2603392/waurika-man-gets-prison-term-cheerleader-slaying-nets-life-sentence-too |publisher=Newsok.com |accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He solely admitted to a limited role in refusing to disclose acknowledgement of the murder after the event.&lt;ref name="Wayback Machine"/&gt; Despite this testimony, when questioned as to his witnessing the actual shooting of Heather Rich, Bagwell self-contradicted himself in his reply, claiming he had witnessed "Curtis—sorry I mean Randy—lowering the gun."&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

===Wood===
Randy Wood was tried for capital murder later in 1998. Against the advice of his attorney, Pat Morris, Wood declined another offered plea bargain offered prior to his trial; choosing to [[Plea|plead not guilty]] to Heather's murder, stating that although he was aware of the law of Texas, he had neither intended for Heather to be killed, and that he had not physically taken her life himself.&lt;ref name="Coloff" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|The fact that Randy had not actually fired the gun did not differentiate the legal viewpoint in Texas Law.

Wood was found guilty of capital murder on August 25, 1998. As the [[State (polity)|State]] did not seek the death penalty in his trial, he was automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood will first become eligible for parole in 2036.&lt;ref name="Coloff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TDCJ Wood"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05759345 |title=Offender Information Details {{bracket|Wood}} |publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |location=[[Huntsville, Texas]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224223918/https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05759345 |archive-date=February 24, 2018|dead-url=no |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
* Randy Wood requested to meet with Heather's parents prior to his own trial, to explain his actions on the night of their daughter's murder, the [[moral]] and legal reasoning behind his course of action regarding his testimony at the trial of Joshua Bagwell, and the legal vulerability this had subjected himself to.

Having asked for their forgiveness but stating upfront he did not expect to receive it, Gail Rich responded by stating she and her husband had forgiven him for the hurt he had caused them, but they could not forgive him for his role in their daughter's murder, adding, "Only Heather can do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/31/news/mn-55034/3|title=Tangle of Guilt and Repentance Follows Slaying of Cheerleader|access-date=August 23, 2018|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 31, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1999, Wood filed an [[appeal]] against his conviction with the [[Second Court of Appeals of Texas]]. In this appeal, he did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented at his trial, but contended that his attorney had been [[ineffective assistance of counsel|ineffective]] in his service; failing to request an initial instruction upon the potential [[lesser included offense|lesser-included offense]] of murder, an erroneous introduction of the guilty or innocence plea phase of his trial, and his attorney's  failing to raise [[Objection (United States law)|objection]] at this stage. This appeal was overruled on October 14, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-court-of-appeals/1079245.html: Wood vs. State: Decided October 14, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Joshua Bagwell also appealed his sentencing; his appeal was filed with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas in November 2000, arguing that because Heather had been unconscious when taken to the  Belknap Creek bridge, she could not move, and if unable to move, she therefore had no movements to restrain, and restraint of the victim is an integral component of [[kidnapping]]. As such, Bagwell contended, because the [[Texas Penal Code]] defines capital murder as "a level of murder that requires a kidnapping component", he could not be guilty of the level of murder for which he was convicted. This appeal was rejected on January 31, 2001.
* In January 2002, Curtis Gambill and Joshua Bagwell were transferred from [[state prison]] to the Montague County jail in order that Gambill could be additionally tried for [[conspiracy to murder|conspiracy to commit murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Last 2 Texas Escapees in Custody |date=February 7, 2002 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/US/02/07/texas.fugitives/index.html |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, he (Gambill) was additionally convicted and sentenced to a second, [[Sentence (law)|cumulative]], term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Amarillo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/013002/tex_escapees.shtml|title=Nationwide search continues for escapees|last=Brown|first=Angela K.|work=Amarillo.com|publisher=Amarillo Globe-News|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier [[Waiver|waived]] his legal right to a trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/01/29/manhunt-for-four-escapees-after-texas-jailbreak.html|title=Manhunt for Four Escapees After Texas Jailbreak|access-date=August 23, 2018|newspaper=Fox News|date=January 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Curtis Gambill, Joshua Bagwell and two other inmates briefly escaped from the Montague County Jail in which all four were held in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126380&amp;page=1|title=Victim's Mom Dismayed by Texas Jail Escape|work=ABC News|date=February 4, 2002|access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four escapees were arrested nine days later in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="bendriver" /&gt; The four individuals had held a member of public [[hostage]] at an Oklahoma gas station, but surrendered to authorities after several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killers who Escaped Texas Jail Caught in Oklahoma |date=February 7, 2002 |url=http://accesswdun.com/article/2002/2/203131 |publisher=Access WDUN |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, a cousin of Randy Wood named Denise Horner initiated a campaign for a [[commutation (law)|commutation]] of Wood's potential life sentencing. This campaign was endorsed and supported by the prosecutor at Wood's trial, Tim Cole, who was reportedly regretful that he had not tried Wood for the lesser charge of [[Conspiracy (criminal)#United States|conspiracy to commit murder]].&lt;ref name="Coloff" /&gt; Nonetheless, when Cole approached Montague County district attorney in 2010, he was reluctant to consider the proposal. He would later confirm his decision to Denise Horner in 2011, stating that following his consultations with the Sheriff and District Judge, it had been "my understanding from them that they are also unwilling to recommend a reduction of sentence."&lt;ref name="Coloff" /&gt;
* All three perpetrators of Heather's murder remain [[incarceration|incarcerated]] and all serve their sentences in different Texas prisons. Curtis Gambill is currently incarcerated at the [[Wynne Unit|John M. Wynne Unit]] in northern [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]]; Joshua Bagwell is incarcerated at the [[John B.

'''ORT Israel''' is a non-government organization devoted to [[education in Israel]].

"ORT Israel" (ORT is an acronym of the Russian Общество Ремесленного Труда – "Association for Vocational Crafts") is the largest educational network in Israel for science and technology education and has been operating in Israel since 1949 as a public benefit company.
The network operates some 210 educational institutions including engineering colleges, middle and high schools, and one elementary school, in over 55 local authorities.
Some 100,000 students attend ORT Israel schools and colleges and, to date, the network has trained some 600,000 graduates. Its students come from all sectors and populations in Israeli society.  

==History==
Ort Israel began functioning in 1948, when [[Aharon Syngalowsky]], then Chairperson of [[World ORT]], came to Israel. With the dramatic increase in immigration from North Africa, Europe and the Middle East, new challenges in absorption and rehabilitation emerged. Thousands of new immigrants needed to be integrated into the new society, and to this end, jobs and vocational training were needed. Many senior figures in the country supported this idea, such as [[Zalman Shazar]], then the Minister of Education, and later to become President, [[Zalman Aran]], later to become Minister of Education, and [[Mordechai Bentov]], the Minister of Housing. The management of ORT rented an abandoned building in [[Jaffa]] and another one on Nevi'im Street in [[Jerusalem]].

The first ORT school in Israel opened in Jaffa in 1949[1]. Its beginnings were modest, with only short courses for discharged soldiers, in order to make it easier for them to integrate into the country's economy. The school was headed by engineer Zvi Rivlin. Thus ORT Israel was founded, and this was also the beginning of technology education in the State of Israel. The school operated for seven consecutive years in extremely crowded conditions. The first courses were in welding, carpentry, pajama sewing, weaving, radio, electricity, and typewriter repair. Hundreds of discharged soldiers and new immigrants passed through the school, studying mainly in evening classes. At the end of the 1950s, ORT managed to open the new and very modern school in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Yad Eliyahu]] named ORT Syngalowsky.   

===Expansion of the organization===
During the 1960s, needs grew, and ORT decided to expand; the number of students in the network doubled, and doubled once again in the 1970s. The education authorities in Israel decided to make technological and vocational education a priority and demanded that more and more schools be built for this purpose. Between 1960 and 1975, 60 additional schools were added to the network to make a total of 80 schools. Thus, a decade later, the number of ORT students exceeded 70,000. The new schools were opened not just in the big cities, but also on kibbutzim, in development towns, in yeshivas and even among the Arab population. 

In 2003, Israel was [[World ORT]]'s largest sphere of operation, with 90,000 students enrolled in 159 schools, colleges and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ort.org/asp/article.asp?id=194 |title=The ORT Emergency Campaign for Israel|date=21 July 2006|publisher=World ORT|accessdate=21 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721212820/http://www.ort.org/asp/article.asp?id=194 |archivedate = 21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ORT Israel broke away from World ORT,&lt;ref name=jewishexponent-20070426&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/12772/|title=Israel vs. the World?

ORT Israel now raises funds in the United States through ''Friends of Israel Sci-Tech Schools''.&lt;ref name=JTA-20090709&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/07/09/1006420/two-orts-settle-name-dispute|title=ORTs settle name dispute|date=9 July 2009|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;Kadima Mada is investing NIS16 million to upgrade technology studies in 72 Jewish and non-Jewish schools in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ort.org/uploads/media/times_spring10.pdf Making Israel Smarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ORT Israel in the 21st century===
Since the turn of the century, the network has expanded considerably, making its main goal the cultivation of schools that define themselves as providing high-level science and technology education. ORT institutions are spread around the entire country. One in ten post-elementary students attends an ORT Israel school. Every year, some 100,000 students, youth and adults study in its institutions. The network serves the entire population of the country, both geographically and demographically, working in all the various communities: state schools (Jewish and Arab: Muslim, Christian and [[Druze]]), state-religious schools (yeshivot and ulpanot). The ORT Israel network has over 600,000 graduates, and employs 8,500 teaching and administrative staff.   

Today ORT is the largest non-state network of schools in Israel. Until a few years ago ORT primarily operated trade and vocational schools. Now the focus is on the advancement of [[science]] and [[technology]] education.

==ORT Israel institutions==

The network runs over 200 institutions, including dozens of 6-year '''comprehensive''' (middle and high) '''schools, industrial schools, and colleges for technicians and practical engineers,''' which train some 30% of the technology HR for Israel's economy. 
===Research and Development===
The Ort Israel Research and Development Center was established by Manya and Israel Moshinsky of [[Mexico]] [3] in 1972.

The Center was designed to train ORT teachers the work methods and applications of the new technologies used in ORT's more advanced study tracks. The Pedagogical Center became a model for other information centers worldwide. The Center was built on the campus of the [[ORT Syngalowsky]] High School, not by chance.

A very imaginative staff was selected to conduct research and be creative while teaching and learning materials were developed and tried out on the brightest in its adjacent labs. The R&amp;D Center supervised the writing of technology textbooks for students and teachers and these have reached ORT students everywhere and been translated into several languages.

Over the years, the ORT R&amp;D Center has continued to set standards of innovation and progress with changing technology. There has been a shift from textbooks to the development of online tools and information systems for teaching and learning. The R&amp;D Center currently has some 100 employees and is responsible for innovative pedagogical development for the entire network. The Center also exports curricula abroad to both Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Every year the ORT R&amp;D Center takes part in international science and technology projects and has an outstanding reputation as a center of quality and innovation.

==Pedagogy==
ORT Israel offers 40 different study tracks in science and technology, social sciences and humanities. About 60% of ORT Israel students study in science and technology tracks.
  
In recent years, ORT has been the first to launch study tracks in Israel in: [[biomedical engineering]], [[mechatronics]], [[biotechnology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[environmental studies]] and [[electro-optics]].
Parallel to their high school studies, some 1,200 outstanding ORT students also study n the ORT Academy program for a Bachelor's degree at the [[Technion]] and Israel's other research universities.    
===Online learning ===
Teaching methods at ORT include a combination of online learning systems that use the internet and social media platforms. Among these, ORT Israel has developed a Learning Management System based on an open source platform, launched a virtual school and supports over 100 websites specially developed and run by the network's teachers and students. 
===Projects===
In 1996, World ORT launched the "Science through Technology" in Israeli junior high schools (grade 7–9). In the "Young Investigators" program for seventh graders, the students build LEGO models to explore scientific phenomenon. In "Galileo, Newton and Me" for eighth graders, LEGO is used to study systems. In the "Design your own world" program, ninth graders attempt to solve real-life problems using LEGO bricks and programming. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iteea.org/Conference/PATT/PATT22/Dagan.pdf Science through Technology in Junior High Schools in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Kadima Mada embarked on a project to build high-tech classrooms, equipping 60 rooms on six campuses with Interactive Whiteboards, wireless Internet and other technological aids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iteea.org/Conference/PATT/PATT22/Dagan.pdf Science through Technology in Junior High Schools in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ORT Israel in the different sectors==
[[File:BirHAdaj04.jpg|thumb|ORT Bir Hadaj (بئر هداج) High School in the Bedouin dispersion]]

*'''Religious sector''' – 8 institutions in 2015, such as the ORT Tiberias Ulpanit for girls, the ORT Orot Neria Yeshiva in Tiberias for boys.
*'''Ultra-orthodox sector''' – 7 institutions in 2015, such as the Kfar Zeitim Youth Village, ORT Zoharim and ORT Derech Hayashar in [[Afula]], which are run in conjunction with the institutions of [[Rabbi Itzhak David Grossman]]. These institutions are for boys only.
*''' Muslim sector''' – 7 institutions in 2015, such as ORT Hilmi Shafi in Acco, and ORT Sciences &amp; Engineering in Lod.
*'''Druze sector''' – 3 institutions in 2015, such as ORT Sajur and ORT Gilboa
*'''Bedouin sector''' – 8 institutions in the south in 2016 for the clans of the Abu Basma (أبو بسمة) local council region and one in the north in Wadi Salame (سلامة).
*'''Christian sector'''– 2 schools, in Nazareth and Maalot-Tarshiha.
Each year the network continues to expand and take on more schools from these sectors.

==Collaborations==
===IDF===
Various ORT institutions maintain close ties with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). The two main ones are ORT Israel Aerospace Industries, which offers an UAV study track and ORT Air Force at Tel Nof, which trains students for technical support roles in the Air Force. Additional schools incorporate a cadet program.

This collaboration with the IDF has led thousands of ORT graduates to serve in engineering, technology and ICT positions in the IDF. Among other things, ORT graduates work on developing sophisticated combat systems for aircraft and helicopters and on programming information systems for the Air Force, the Navy and the Intelligence Corps. After their military service, many ORT Israel graduates take jobs in Israel's defense industries, including [[Elbit Systems]], [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael]], and the [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Industry and the Corporate Sector ===
Together with representatives from the Manufacturer's Association, ORT Israel heads a project of having schools adopted by industrial concerns to allow students to get to know them and gain hands-on experience while still studying. In addition, ORT Israel operates a track in conjunction with the Ministry of Economics and Industry to place practical engineers in the country's key corporations.      
===International projects ===
ORT represents Israel in collaborations with bodies and educational institutions around the world. For example, ORT Israel led the Consortium on [[nanotechnology]] as part of the FP-7 programs of the [[European Union]]. It is part of the e-learning initiative in which 10 Mediterranean Basin countries are participating, and has been involved in a project of the British Council to make connections between academia and industry.  

ORT Israel exports science and technology curricula to high schools and middle schools in Europe and the USA. In the USA, ORT Israel functions under the name of the Israel Sci-Tech Schools Network.

The '''Philadelphia Center for Architecture''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] founded in 2002&lt;ref name=About/&gt; by the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA). The Center opened a physical space on the ground floor of the [[Smyth Young Field Company Building]] in  2008.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;  The building, at 1218 Arch Street, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nrhp nom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McVarish|first1=Douglas C.|title=Young, Smyth, Field Company Building|url=http://www.dot7.state.pa.us/CRGIS_Attachments/SiteResource/H052754_01H.pdf|website=Pennsylvania CGRIS|publisher=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a venue for public programs on [[architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[design]], including various competitions and exhibitions, as well as home to offices for AIA Philadelphia, the Community Design Collaborative, and the AIA Bookstore.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.philadelphiacfa.org/about|website=Philadelphia Center for Architecture|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutAIA&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neon&gt;{{cite news|title=Neon art colors the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.theartblog.org/2012/06/neon-art-colors-the-center-for-architecture/|accessdate=24 September 2015|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
AIA Philadelphia is the second oldest Chapter of the AIA and a nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(6) status, designating it as a professional membership organization. The [[American Institute of Architects]] was founded in 1857, and the Philadelphia chapter received its charter in 1869. The Chapter includes members from Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester and Montgomery Counties.  AIA Philadelphia has a history of community engagement.  Activities include helping to create [[Independence National Historical Park]], the Charter High School for Architecture + Design, the Community Design Collaborative, and the Philadelphia Center for Architecture.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012&gt;{{cite web|title=AIA Philadelphia &amp;  Center for Architecture Strategic Plan 2013  – 2017|url=http://www.aaonetwork.org/system/files/resources/Architecture%20Center%20Strategic%20Plan%20-%20AIA%20Philadelphia%20and%20Philadelphia%20Center%20for%20Architecture.pdf|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Claypool became Executive Director of AIA Philadelphia in 2001.&lt;ref name=Massie/&gt; Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Center for Architecture was established as a separate nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(3) status, designating it as an educational non-profit. Its purpose was to support charitable and educational initiatives to benefit the community at large, on behalf of the architectural profession.  It developed programs in the community.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt;

The Center soon took advantage of the opportunity to create a physical space as well as providing a set of programs.  The Center at 1218 Arch Street opened in 2008.  In 2009 the Chapter and Center boards created a framework to coordinate the two organizations.  The Chapter board holds the authority for annually appointing the Board of the Center. The Center's mission involves engaging "the public, decision leaders, thought leaders, and allied design professionals" on issues related to design and architecture, to recognize and enhance the quality of architecture in the region,&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt; distinct from AIA Philadelphia's mission to provide architects with "opportunities for professional development, service, and collegiality among peers".&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://www.aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Trieste]], Mattessich obtained his degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1940 at the [[Vienna University of Technology|Engineering College, Vienna  IV]], his MBA in 1944 at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|Vienna School of Economics and Business Administration]], where in 1945 he also obtained his [[Dr. rer. pol.]] in Economics.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt;

After his graduation Mattessich in 1945 started as research associate at the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research]] in Vienna. In 1947 he moved to the [[University of St. Gallen|Rosenberg Institute of St. Gallen]], where he was appointed Instructor of Commerce. In 1952 he moved to Canada and was Department Head of Commerce from 1953 to 1959 at the [[Mount Allison University]]. From 1959 to 1967 he was Associate Professor of Accounting at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and from 1967 to 1987 Professor of Accounting at the [[University of British Columbia]], and since 1988 emeritus professor.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt;

Mattessich was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] (Complutense) in 1998, the [[University of Malaga]], Spain in 2006; from the [[Montesquieu University – Bordeaux IV|University of Montesquieu]] in Bordeaux in 2006; and from the [[University of Graz]] in Austria in 2007.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Simulation of the Firm,'' 1964 ===
In 1964 Mattessich published "Simulation of the Firm Through a Budget Computer Program." This book anticipated, by almost twenty years, major elements of such bestselling microcomputer programmes as [[VisiCalc]], [[SuperCalc]], [[Lotus 1-2-3]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mattessich, Richard. "Academic Research in Accounting: the Last 50 Years." ''Asia-Pacific Journal of Accounting'' 3.1 (1996): 3-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, J. D., and A. J. Robson. "Spreadsheets in Business." ''Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems'' 100.8 (2000): 379-388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy (1997) acknowledged that this work "foreshadows the basic principles behind today's computer spreadsheets: the use of matrices, (budget) simulation, and, most important, the calculations that support each matrix cell."&lt;ref&gt;George J. Murphy, "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/484 Mattessich, Richard V. (1922-)]," in [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]], eds., ''The History of Accounting--An International Encyclopedia'' (New York: Garland Publishing Co., Inc, 1997): 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Theory of Accounting, 1972 ===
Mattessich's 1972 article "Methodological Preconditions and Problems of a General Theory of Accounting", published in ''[[The Accounting Review]],'' received the international Award for Notable Contribution to Accounting Literature of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] in Cooperation with the [[American Accounting Association]].

=== ''Two-hundred Years of Accounting Research,'' 2009 ===
In the 2009 publication "Two-hundred Years of Accounting Research: An International Survey of Personalities, Ideas, and Publications from about 1800 to 2000," Mattessich summarized the development of accounting and accounting research in over 20 countries since early 19th century.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt; Mattessich specified:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Its main emphasis is on accounting research in the English, German, Italian, French and Spanish language areas; it also contains chapters dealing with research in Finland, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Russia, Poland and the Ukraine as well as Argentina and Japan. A separate chapter summarizes research activity in the rest of the globe from Eastern Europe to Israel, the Arab and African countries as well as India, China and other countries of the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Mattessich (2009, p. i)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore its "focus is not on the history of accounting, but on the history of its research and the publications underlying it (though, wherever necessary, accounting facts beyond research were taken into consideration)... A major goal was to offer a broad overview, covering the pertinent publications of an international spectrum, as wide as possible, under the given limitations."&lt;ref&gt;Mattessich (2009, p. xvii)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosa L. Dixon Bowser''' (January 7, 1855 – February 7, 1931) was an American [[Teacher|educator]]. She was the first black teacher hired in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. She organized the Virginia Teachers' Reading Circle, which became the Virginia State Teachers Association, the first organization representing black teachers in Virginia, serving as the organization's president from 1890 to 1892. Bowser was president of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Virginia, as well as founder and first president of the Richmond Woman's League. She was a correspondent for the magazine ''[[The Woman's Era]]'', and wrote essays for national publications. The first branch of the [[Richmond Public Library (United States)|Richmond Public Library]] to serve African-American patrons was named for Bowser.

==Early life==
Rosa L. Dixon was born in [[Amelia County, Virginia]], the daughter of Henry Dixon and Augusta Anderson Hawkins Dixon; she was "most likely born enslaved".&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Veronica Alease Davis and ''The Dictionary of Virginia Biography'', [http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Bowser_Rosa_L_Dixon_1855-1931 "Rosa L. Dixon Bowser"] ''Encyclopedia Virginia'' (Virginia Foundation for the Humanities 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; As a child she moved to post-war Richmond with her parents, and was educated by teachers from the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. She was identified as a promising student and trained as a teacher at the Richmond Colored Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe Alphus Majors, ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">In [[aviation]], the '''rule of three''' or "3:1 rule of descent" is that 3 miles of travel should be allowed for every {{convert|1000|ft}} of descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/article/top-10-rules-of-thumb/|title=Top 10 rules of thumb|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Plane and Pilot Magazine|author=|work=|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of aviation, few aircraft were pressurized. A pilot who descended rapidly would cause his passengers the discomfort of rapid pressure changes on their eardrums.

Transport pilots adopted this formula to assure a slow, steady and comfortable descent for their passengers. Many aircraft had a [[Cruise (flight)|cruising]] speed between {{convert|100|-|120|mph}}. Three miles would be traveled in about 1.5–1.8 minutes, resulting in a rate of descent of about 550–660 feet per minute. That was about as fast as passengers could comfortably adapt to the changing pressure on their eardrums. However, many pilots used a 300-feet-per-minute descent rate because doing so is almost unnoticed by passengers. A pilot cruising at 10,500 feet would calculate that in order to be at 1,000 feet at his destination, he would have to descend 9,500 feet. Dividing 9,500 feet by 300 feet per minute, that descent would require about 32 minutes. If his ground speed was {{convert|120|mph}}, he would begin his descent about {{convert|64|mi}} from his destination (traffic permitting).

The "rule of three" is used by pilots flying small, unpressurized aircraft as well as by those flying airliners and aircraft with [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cabins]]. These usually fly in a structured environment governed by [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) and may not have the luxury of choosing a descent rate, instead observing the altitude constraints assigned to them by [[air traffic controller]]s. Although rate of cabin pressurization change may be a consideration, this is usually managed automatically and for an airliner a larger consideration is fuel economy. A 3:1 descent gives an efficient glide descent from cruising altitude, and aids in planning; the company standard descent speed will be close to (usually slightly higher than) the optimum Lift/Drag ratio speed, and will give a descent ratio close to 3:1. 

An additional use of this rule-of-thumb is on final approach which generally has a 3 degree vertical angle. This corresponds to 3 nautical miles (nm) per 1000ft and again makes mental estimation simple.

A '''sixth form college''' is an educational institution in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Belize]], [[the Caribbean]], [[Malta]], [[Norway]], [[Brunei]], and [[Malaysia]], among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]], [[Business and Technology Education Council]] (BTEC) and the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]], or school-level qualifications such as [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) examinations. In [[Singapore]] and [[India]], this is known as a [[junior college]]. The municipal government of the city of [[Paris]] uses the phrase "sixth form college" as the English name for a [[lycée]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.paris.fr/portail/english/Portal.lut?page_id=8145&amp;document_type_id=5&amp;document_id=33668&amp;portlet_id=18796 Children &amp; families]."

In England and the Caribbean, [[education]] is currently compulsory until the end of year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18 (previously in England, education was compulsory only until year 11 before August 2013 and until year 12 between August 2013 and 2015).&lt;ref name="ESA2008"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080025_en_1 Education and Skills Act 2008], Office of Public Sector Information.&lt;/ref&gt; In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached [[sixth form]], transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational [[further education college]], although in some places there may in practice be little choice which of these options can be taken. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools ([[public schools (UK)|public schools]]), and there is also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11.

Students at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13, Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland and/or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS]] [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s at the end of the first year, and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. In addition, in recent years a variety of [[vocational]] courses have been added to the [[curriculum]].

There are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth form schools which function like sixth form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities. Unlike further education colleges, sixth form colleges rarely accept part-time students or run evening classes,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} although one boarding sixth form college exists.

== Brunei ==
There are a few schools in [[Brunei]] providing [[Sixth form|sixth form education]]. Five of them are dedicated sixth form colleges, with four located in [[Brunei-Muara District]] and one in [[Tutong District]]. [[Belait District|Belait]] has yet to have its own sixth form centre and sixth form education is presently housed in [[Sekolah Menengah Sayyidina Ali|Sayyidina Ali Secondary School]], sharing facilities with the secondary education. There is no sixth form education in [[Temburong District|Temburong]] — prospective students go to sixth form colleges in Brunei-Muara where they may stay in dormitories.

Almost all sixth form schools are [[State school|government schools]]. Five of them provide education leading up to [[GCE Advanced Level|Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level]] qualification. [[Jerudong International School]] is a [[Private school|non-government school]] which has sixth form education and its A Level is independent of those offered by its counterpart. Along with [[International School Brunei]] which offers the program [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]] instead of A Levels after the completion of [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] in their lower secondary year. 

Another school, [[Hassanal Bolkiah Boys' Arabic Secondary School]], is a government sixth form centre for students in the specialised Arabic stream. Instead of A Level subjects, students generally learn subjects pertaining to Islamic knowledge in Arabic medium. The schooling culminates in the sitting of ''Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Ugama Brunei (STPUB)'', translatable as the Higher Certificate of Brunei Religious Education. They may then proceed to Islamic universities, locally or abroad such as [[Al-Azhar University]].

==Caribbean==

In the English-speaking Caribbean, there are many sixth form colleges, usually attached to secondary schools. Students must usually attain a grade A-C in 1-3 in the [[Caribbean Examinations Council]] (C.X.C) CSEC examinations. Students that fail these exams are not accepted into the sixth form program and either can do courses in other tertiary facilities, or begin working with high school degrees. After sixth form, students are presented with an [[Associate Degree]].

==Scotland==

[[Scotland]] does not, in general, have separate sixth form colleges (or, indeed, the same concept of the terminal two years of secondary education as being distinct from the other time spent there); as such, Scottish students who opt to remain in full-time education will typically remain in the same school for fifth and sixth year (the equivalent to the English lower- and upper-sixth forms), studying [[Higher Grade]] and [[Advanced Higher]] qualifications. Higher Grade qualifications can be taken in both the fifth and sixth years.

==England==
The first comprehensive intake sixth form college in England was established in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and took its first intake of students in September 1964. Since then sixth form colleges have spread across the UK and have proved popular with students, their parents, and other groups in the community. Until 1992, these colleges were controlled and funded by [[local education authority|local education authorities]] (LEAs), but the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] transferred all institutions within the sector to the [[Further Education Funding Council for England]] (FEFC), a national agency with strategic responsibility for the operation of general further education (FE) colleges. Later the FEFC's functions were taken over by the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC), a reorganisation that included changes in the funding and supervision of sixth form colleges.

Sixth form colleges take responsibility for their own employment, pensions and pay arrangements with the support and advice of the [[Sixth Form Colleges' Association]] (SFCA, formerly SFCF). The SFCA is made up of representative principals from SFCs across the UK. The SFCA sets up several Committees to deliver its range of support services for SFCs as well as facilitating lobbying work with Central Government.
Colleges for the most part do not charge full-time daytime students; however, adult students (most of whom attend evening classes) may have to pay a fee (for examinations, tutors' time and other costs).

There are also some sixth form colleges in the independent sector, specialising in A levels for which fees are paid; these are unconnected with the SFCA.

==Wales==
{{Main|Further education#Wales|l1=Further education}}
In Wales, sixth form education falls under the remit of the [[Welsh Assembly]], and sixth form colleges are sources of further education alongside FE Colleges and sixth forms integrated into secondary schools.  They typically offer the [[Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification|Welsh Baccalaureate]] and [[Key Skills Qualification|Key Skills]] qualifications.

==Hong Kong==
Even though [[Hong Kong]] had changed from having two public examinations to one, its first sixth form college, [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]], remains in operation as an upper secondary college.

'''St. Athanasius – Linopetra Lyceum''' is a public [[secondary education]]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason=further done, prose suggests that school only goes through third grade}} school in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]].

Established and operated the [[academic year]] 2001–2002, the school promotes the objectives of education as these were defined by the government, but also the specific objectives of the school. The school's first principal was Georgios Chantzikonstantinou, a physicist.

==History==
During the first academic year 2001–2002, the school operated with first-grade students who were divided into nine sections with a total number of 240, from which 97 boys and 143 girls. The total number of teachers was 33. All the special classrooms and laboratories were used, as well as the library which is still being enriched. Then in subsequent years, the school's second- and third-grade classes were operating and all necessary instruments and equipment were completed in the special class rooms and laboratories.

At November 26, 2005, with the completion of the multi-use hall, the school was inaugurated by [[List of Ministers of Education and Culture of Cyprus|Minister of Education and Culture]] Mr. Pefkios Georgiades.

In the academic year 2006–2007, due to [[population growth]] in the surrounding areas and communities, the number of students increased to 789 of whom 348 were boys and 441 girls. There are eleven first-grade sections, eleven second-grade sections and eleven third-grade sections. There are 103 academics from different disciplines, four [[curator]]s and seven support staff employees.

==Facilities==
The school is a modern educational institution of the place and a model in building [[infrastructure]]. It has twenty-one general classrooms, nineteen special classrooms and laboratories and one support room, a library, a screening room, two [[basketball]] courts, two [[volleyball]] courts and one [[association football|football]] court, administration offices, ancillary areas and a modern multi-purpose hall which is the jewel of the region and serves the sports and cultural activities of the school, other schools of the district, [[school district]] championships, sports bodies and sports clubs in the region.

The St. Athanasius School Board operates within the area of the school.

'''TUTOR''' (also known as '''PLATO Author Language''') is a [[programming language]] developed for use on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] around 1965.  TUTOR was initially designed by [[Paul Tenczar]] for use in [[computer assisted instruction]] (CAI) and [[computer managed instruction]] (CMI) (in computer programs called "lessons") and has many features for that purpose.  For example, TUTOR has powerful answer-parsing and answer-judging commands, graphics, and features to simplify handling student records and statistics by instructors.  TUTOR's flexibility, in combination with PLATO's computational power (running on what was considered a supercomputer in 1972), also made it suitable for the creation of many non-educational lessons—that is, ''games''—including flight simulators, war games, dungeon style multiplayer role-playing games, card games, word games, and medical lesson games such as [[Bugs and Drugs]] (BND).

==Origins and development==
TUTOR was originally developed as a special purpose [[authoring language]] for designing instructional lessons, and its evolution into a general purpose programming language was unplanned.
The name TUTOR was first applied to the authoring language of the [[PLATO system]] in the later days of Plato III.
The first documentation of the language, under this name, appears to have been ''The TUTOR Manual'', CERL Report X-4, by R. A. Avner and P. Tenczar, Jan. 1969.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a snapshot of TUTOR from shortly before PLATO IV was operational.  Core elements of the language were present, but commands were given in upper case, and instead of using a general mechanism, support for alternative character sets was through special command names such as &lt;code&gt;WRUSS&lt;/code&gt; for "write using the Russian character set."

Through the 1970s, the developers of TUTOR took advantage of the fact that the entire corpus of TUTOR programs were stored on-line on the same computer system.  Whenever they felt a need to change the language, they ran conversion software over the corpus of TUTOR code to revise all existing code so that it conformed with the changes they had made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/idle-dev/2000-April/000138.html Forward progress with full backward compatibility] by Bruce Sherwood, in the Python [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/idle-dev/ IDLE-dev Archives] Apr. 9, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, once new versions of TUTOR were developed, maintaining compatibility with the PLATO version could be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Section 7.2 of ''Run-Time Support for the TUTOR Language on a Small Computer System,'' by Douglas W. Jones, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Control Data Corporation|CDC]], by 1981, had largely expunged the name TUTOR from their PLATO documentation.  They referred to the language itself as the ''PLATO Author Language''.  The phrase ''TUTOR file'' or even ''TUTOR lesson file'' survived, however, as the name of the type of file used to store text written in the PLATO Author Language.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, page 4-56 of the ''PLATO User's Guide'', Control Data Corporation, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of a TUTOR lesson==
A TUTOR lesson consists of a sequence of ''units'' where each unit begins with the presentation of information and progress from one unit to the next is contingent on correctly answering one or more questions.  As with [[COBOL]] paragraphs, control may enter a TUTOR unit from the preceding unit and exit into the next, but units are also callable as subroutines using the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; commands.

Here is an example unit from page 5 of the ''TUTOR User's Memo'', March 1973 ([[Computer-based Education Research Laboratory]], University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign):

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
unit    math
at      205
write   Answer these problems

        3 + 3 =

        4 × 3 =

arrow   413
answer  6
arrow   613
answer  12
&lt;/source&gt;

Several things should be immediately apparent from this example.

* First, TUTOR is a fixed format language.  Each line begins with a command name, with the arguments to that command (the ''tag'') following, after a tab.
* In some cases, such as the &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; command above, the tag may consist of multiple lines.  Continuation lines are either blank or have a leading tab.
* Screen coordinates are presented as single numbers, so 205 refers to line 2 column 5, and 413 refers to line 4 column 13.

What may not be apparent is the control structure implicit in this unit.  The &lt;code&gt;arrow&lt;/code&gt; command marks the entrance to a ''judging block''  This control structure is one of TUTOR's unique features.

==Unique features==
TUTOR contained a number of unique features.  The following list is not intended as a substitute for a TUTOR manual, but merely highlights the most interesting, innovative, and sometimes confusing features of the language.

===Answer judging===
A ''judging block'' in TUTOR is a control structure that begins with an &lt;code&gt;arrow&lt;/code&gt; command and ends with the next &lt;code&gt;arrow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endarrow&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; command. The &lt;code&gt;arrow&lt;/code&gt; command also prompts for input, with the special arrow character (resembling "▷") displayed as a prompt at the indicated screen coordinates.  In effect, a judging block can be thought of as a backtracking control structure where the student may make multiple attempts to answer a question until a correct answer allows forward progress.

====Judging pattern matching====
Each judging block consists of a sequence of [[pattern matching]] commands, each of which introduces a (possibly empty) block of commands to be executed if that pattern matches.  The two most common pattern matching commands were &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wrong&lt;/code&gt;.  These had identical pattern matching semantics except that &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; judged a student response to be correct if it matched, while &lt;code&gt;wrong&lt;/code&gt; judged a student response to be incorrect.

The tag fields on the &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wrong&lt;/code&gt; commands consisted of lists of optional, required and alternative words. consider this example from exercise 4-1 in the 1973 ''TUTOR User's Memo'':

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
answer  &lt;it, is,a, it's, figure,
        polygon&gt;
        (right, rt) (triangle, triangular)
&lt;/source&gt;

This would match answers such as "it is a right triangle" or "it's a triangular figure" or just "rt triangle".  It would not match "sort of triangular" because the words "sort of" are not listed as ignored, and it would not match "triangle, right?" because the
order is wrong.

The pattern matching subsystem recognized spelling errors, so the words "triangel" or "triangl" would match the example pattern. The lesson author could use the &lt;code&gt;specs&lt;/code&gt; command to set how pedantic the system was about spelling errors.

The pattern matching algorithms used by various TUTOR implementations varied in detail, but typically, each word in the input text and each word in the pattern were converted to [[bit vector]]s. To see whether a word of student input matched a word of the pattern, the [[Hamming distance]] between the two bit vectors was used as a measure of the degree of difference between the words. Bit vectors were typically 60 or 64 bits long, with fields for letter presence, letter pair presence, and the first letter. As a result, the number of one bits in the [[exclusive or]] of two such bit vectors approximated the extent of the phonetic difference between the corresponding words.&lt;ref&gt;Tenczar and Golden, ''Spelling, Word and Concept Recognition'', Computer-Based Education Research Laboratory Rep. X-35, University of Illinois at Urbana, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judging control structures====
All early presentations of the control structure of a TUTOR judging block were confusing.  In modern terms, however, a judging block can be described as an [[While loop|iterative control structure]] that exits when the student input is judged correct.  The body
of this control structure consists of a series of [[Conditional (programming)#Case and switch statements|cases]], each introduced by a [[pattern matching]] command such as &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wrong&lt;/code&gt;. All output produced by the body of the judging loop in the
previous cycle is erased from the screen prior to the next cycle.

Consider this example, from exercise 4-1 of the 1973 ''TUTOR User's Memo'':

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
wrong   &lt;it, is,a&gt; square
at      1501
write   A square has four
        sides.
&lt;/source&gt;

In the event that the student inputs "square" or "a square", the answer is judged to be incorrect, and the text "A square has four sides." is output starting at line 15 column 1 on the screen. This output remains on the screen until the student begins to enter
a new answer, at which point, it is erased so that the response to the new answer can be computed.  The mechanism by which the display screen rolls back to its previous state varies from implementation to implementation.  Early implementations operated by switching the terminal into erase mode and re-executing the entire case that had matched.  Some later implementations buffered the output produced during judging so that this output could be erased.

The &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; command was a unique form of subroutine call.  It was defined as being equivalent to textual substitution of the body of the joined unit in place of the join command itself (page 21, 1973 ''TUTOR User's Memo'').  As such, a joined unit could contain part of a judging block.  Thus, while the judging block is conceptually an [[While loop|iterator]] enclosing a series of [[Conditional (programming)#Case and switch statements|cases]], this block may be arbitrarily broken into subroutines.  (An alternative subroutine call, the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; command, conformed to the usual semantics associated with subroutine calls in other programming languages.)

===Graphic and display commands===
The PLATO IV student terminal&lt;ref&gt;''The Plato IV Student Terminal'' by Jack Stifle, Nov 1974&lt;/ref&gt; had a 512 by 512 [[pixel]] [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]],
with hardware support for [[point plotting]], line drawing, and text display.
Each pixel on the PLATO IV terminal was either orange or black.  The CDC PLATO V terminal used a monochrome black and white [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] to emulate the plasma panel.  The built-in character set had 4 sets of 63 characters, each 8 by 16 pixels, half of these were fixed, half were programmable.  The Tutor language provided complete support for this terminal.

There were two [[coordinate system]]s (see page II-1 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Bruce Sherwood):

* Coarse coordinates were specified in terms of the rows and columns of text.  The coarse coordinate 1501, for example, was a reference to line 15 character 1, where the upper left character on the screen was at location 101 and the lower right character was at 3264.
* Fine coordinates were specified as X and Y coordinates relative to the lower left corner of the screen.  The fine coordinate 0,511 specified the upper left corner of the screen, while 0,496 was equivalent to the coarse 101, allowing for the 16 pixel height of a character and the fact that characters were plotted relative to their lower left corner.

====Drawing commands====
The following example illustrates some of Tutor's drawing commands.&lt;ref&gt;from page II-11 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Bruce Sherwood, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
draw    1812;1852;skip;1844;1544
circle  16,344,288
draw    1837;1537;1535;1633;1833
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the use of semicolons to separate successive coordinates on the &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; command.  This allows unambiguous use of comma-separated fine coordinates.  Normally, the draw command connects consecutive points with line segments, but by putting &lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt; in the tag, the &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; command could be made to conceptually lift its pen.

The tags on the &lt;code&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; command give the radius and fine coordinates of the center.  Additional tags could specify starting and
ending angles for partial circles.

Hand composing draw commands is difficult, so a picture editor was included in the PLATO system by 1974 to automate this work.&lt;ref&gt;see page II-9 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Bruce Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  This could only deal with drawing commands with constant coordinates.

====Text rendering commands====
The following example illustrates some of the text rendering tools of Tutor.&lt;ref&gt;from page II-3 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Bruce Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
unit    title
size    9.5     $$ text 9.5 times normal size
rotate  45      $$ text rotated 45 degrees
at      2519
write   Latin
size    0       $$ return to normal writing
rotate  0
at      3125
write   Lessons on Verbs
&lt;/source&gt;

Text rendered in size zero rotation zero used the built-in character rendering hardware of the PLATO terminal, while rendering with nonzero size and rotation was done with line segments and therefore significantly slower due to the speed of the communication link to the terminal.

===Control structures===
Aside from its unique answer judging mechanisms, TUTOR's original set of [[Control flow|control structures]] was rather sparse.  In the mid 1970s, this shortcoming was addressed by introducing &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endif&lt;/code&gt; blocks with optional &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; sections.  The semantics of these control structures was routine, but the syntax was unique, with mandatory [[Indent style|indentation]] presaging that of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and a unique use of nonblank indent characters to distinguish indenting from continuation lines.

This is illustrated in the following example, from page S5 of the ''Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables (10th ed)'' by Elaine Avner, 1981:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
if      n8&lt;4
.       write   first branch
.       calc    n9⇐34
elseif  n8=4
.       write   second branch
.       do      someunit
else
.       write   default branch
.       if      n8&gt;6
.       .       write   special branch
.       endif
endif
&lt;/source&gt;

(The [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] arrow in the &lt;code&gt;calc&lt;/code&gt; statement is not rendered correctly in some browsers.  It appears similar to &lt;= but as one character.  It had a dedicated key on the PLATO IV keyboard.)

The same syntax was used for &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endloop&lt;/code&gt; blocks with semantics comparable to [[while loop]]s in conventional programming languages.  This is illustrated in the following example, from page S6 of the ''Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables (10th ed)'' by Elaine Avner, 1981:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
loop    n8&lt;10
.       write   within loop
.       sub1    n8
reloop  n8≥5
.       write   still within loop
.       do      someunit
outloop n8&lt;3
.       write   still within loop
endloop
write   outside of loop
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;code&gt;reloop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;outloop&lt;/code&gt; commands are somewhat analogous to the &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statements of languages based on [[C (programming language)|C]], except that they must sit at the indenting level of the loop they modify, and they have a condition tag that indicates when the indicated control transfer is to take place.

===Expression syntax===
TUTOR's expression syntax did not look back to the syntax of [[FORTRAN]], nor was it limited by poorly designed character sets of the era.  For example, the PLATO IV character set included [[control characters]] for [[subscript and superscript]], and TUTOR used these for exponentiation.  Consider this command (from page IV-1 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974):
 
 circle  (41&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+72.6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;,100,200

The character set also included the conventional symbols for multiplication and division, &lt;code&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;÷&lt;/code&gt;, but in a more radical departure from the conventions established by FORTRAN, it allowed implicit multiplication, so the expressions &lt;code&gt;(4+7)(3+6)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3.4+5(2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-3)/2&lt;/code&gt; were valid, with the values 99 and 15.9, respectively (op cit).

The language included a pre-defined constant named with the Greek letter pi (π), with the appropriate value, which could be used in calculations.   Thus, the expression &lt;code&gt;πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; could be used to calculate the area of a circle, using the built-in π constant, implicit multiplication and exponentiation indicated by a superscript.

In TUTOR, the floating-point comparison &lt;code&gt;x=y&lt;/code&gt; was defined as being true if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; were approximately equal (see page C5 of ''PLATO User's Memo, Number One'' by Avner, 1975).  This simplified life for mathematically naïve developers of instructional lessons, but it occasionally caused headaches for developers of numerically sophisticated code because it was possible that both &lt;code&gt;x&amp;lt;y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x≥y&lt;/code&gt; could be true at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;See page IX-3 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory management===
As an authoring language, TUTOR began with only minimal memory resources and only the crudest tools for manipulating them.  Each user process had a private data segment of 150 variables, and shared ''common blocks'' could be attached, allowing interuser communication through shared memory.

On the PLATO IV system, words were 60 bits, in keeping with the [[CDC 6600]] family of computers.  Some later implementations changed this to 64 bits.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Run Time Support of the TUTOR Language on a Small Computer System'' by [[Douglas W. Jones]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basic memory resources====
The private memory region of each process consisted of 150 words each, referred to as student variables; the values of these variables were persistent, following the individual user from session to session.  These were addressed as &lt;code&gt;n1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;n150&lt;/code&gt; when used to hold integer values, or as &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;v150&lt;/code&gt; when used to hold floating point values.&lt;ref&gt;see pages IV-2 and IX-17 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

A TUTOR lesson could attach a single region of up to 1500 words of shared memory using the &lt;code&gt;common&lt;/code&gt; command.  Each lesson could have an unnamed temporary common block containing variables shared by all users of that lesson.  Such blocks were created when a lesson came into use and deallocated when the lesson became inactive.  In contrast, named common blocks were associated with a block of a lesson (a disk file).  Shared memory was addressed as &lt;code&gt;nc1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;nc1500&lt;/code&gt; (for integers) or &lt;code&gt;vc1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;vc1500&lt;/code&gt; (for floating point numbers).&lt;ref&gt;see pages X-1 to X-3 and X-6 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Where 150 student variables was insufficient, a lesson could use the
&lt;code&gt;storage&lt;/code&gt; command to create an additional private memory segment of up to 1000 words.  This segment existed in swap space only, but it could be mapped to student variables or common variables.  For example (from page X-11 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974):

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
common  1000
storage 75
stoload vc1001,1,75
&lt;/source&gt;

This example defines &lt;code&gt;nc1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nc1000&lt;/code&gt; as a shared unnamed common block, while &lt;code&gt;nc1001&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nc1075&lt;/code&gt; are private storage.

====Defining symbolic names====
The Tutor &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; command was very similar to the [[C (programming language)|C]] &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; [[preprocessor]] directive.  This was the only way to associate mnemonic names with variables.  It was up to the programmer to statically allocate memory and assign names to variables.  Consider this example from page 17 of the ''TUTOR User's Memo -- Introduction to TUTOR'', 1973"

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
define  mynames
        first=v1, second =v2
        result=v3
&lt;/source&gt;

This creates a set of definitions named &lt;code&gt;mynames&lt;/code&gt; defining three floating point variables.  Users were advised that "&lt;u&gt;there should not be any v3's or v26's anywhere in your lesson except in the &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; statement itself&lt;/u&gt;.  Put all your definitions at the very beginning of the lesson where you will have ready reference to which variables you are using." (underlining from the original, page IV-5 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974.)

Functions could be defined, with macro-substitution semantics, as in this illustration from page IX-2 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
define  cotan(a)=cos(a)/sin(a)
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike C, the original [[Scope (programming)|scope rules]] of TUTOR were pure "definition before use" with no provisions for local definitions.  Thus, the formal parameter &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; used above must not have any previous definition.

Later in the development of TUTOR, with the introduction of multiple named sets of definitions, the programmer was given explicit control over which sets of definitions were currently in force.  For example, &lt;code&gt;define&amp;nbsp;purge, setname&lt;/code&gt; would discard all definitions in the named set.&lt;ref&gt;See page 15 of ''PLATO User's Memo -- Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables'', Avner, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrays, packed arrays, and text manipulation====
The original TUTOR tools for text manipulation were based on commands for specific text operations, for example, &lt;code&gt;pack&lt;/code&gt; to place a packed character string into consecutive variables in memory, &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; to search for one string within another, and &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; to move a string from memory to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Pages VII-52 to VII-55 of ''The TUTOR Language'', Sherwood, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1975, more general tools for arrays of integers and packed arrays were added.  Page 14 of ''PLATO User's Memo -- Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables'', Avner, 1975, gives the following:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
define  segment, name=starting var, num bits per byte, s
        array, name(size)=starting var
        array, name (num rows, num columns)=starting var
&lt;/source&gt;

''Segmented arrays'', defined with the keyword &lt;code&gt;segment&lt;/code&gt;, were comparable to packed arrays in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].  The byte size and whether or not the array elements were to be treated as signed or unsigned were entirely under user control.  Arbitrary text manipulation could be done by setting the byte size to the machine byte size, 6 bits on implementations using [[display code]], 8 bits on some later [[ASCII]] and [[extended ASCII]] implementations.  Note the lack of any specification of array dimensionality for segmented arrays.

====Parameter passing====
A general [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter passing]] mechanism was added to TUTOR early in the PLATO IV era.  Page IV-10 of ''The TUTOR Language'' by Sherwood, 1974 gives the following example:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
define  radius=v1,x=v2,y=v3
unit    vary
do      halfcirc(100,150,300)
do      halfcirc(50)
*
unit    halfcirc(radius, x,y)
circle  radius, x,y,0,180
draw    x-radius, y;x+radius, y
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the [[Parameter (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|formal parameters]] listed in the argument list to the &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; command are simply the defined names for statically allocated global variables.  The semantics of parameter passing was given as being equivalent to assignment at the time of the control transfer to the destination unit, and if [[Parameter (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|actual parameters]] were omitted, as in the second &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; command above, the effect was to leave the prior values of the corresponding formal parameters unchanged.

====Local variables====
[[Local variable]]s were added to TUTOR some time around 1980.  Lesson authors wishing to use local variables were required to use the &lt;code&gt;lvars&lt;/code&gt; command to declare the size of the buffer used for local variables, up to 128 words.&lt;ref&gt;Page C3 of ''Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables'', Avner, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Having done so, a unit using local variables could begin as follows (from Page C2 of ''Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables'', Avner, 1981):

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
unit    someu
        NAME1,NAME2,NAME3(SIZE)
        NAME4=CONSTANT
        floating:NAME5,NAME6,NAME7(SIZE)
        integer, NUM BITS:NAME8,NAME9
        integer, NUM BITS,signed:NAME10
        integer:NAME11
&lt;/source&gt;

The continuation lines of the &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; command given above are taken to be lines of an implicit &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; command with local [[Scope (programming)|scope]].  Conventional definitions in terms of student variables such as &lt;code&gt;n150&lt;/code&gt; could be used in such a local &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt;, but the forms illustrated here all automatically bind names to locations in the block of memory allocated by the &lt;code&gt;lvars&lt;/code&gt; command.  The available TUTOR documentation does not discuss how local variables are allocated.

==Other implementations==
There has been a sizable family of TUTOR-related languages, each similar to the original TUTOR language but with differences. In particular, TUTOR was a component of a system (the PLATO computer-based education system) that ran on particular CDC mainframe hardware. For efficiency, there were some hardware-specific elements in TUTOR (e.g. variables that were 60-bit words that could be used as arrays of 60 bits or as 10 six-bit characters, etc.). Also, TUTOR was designed before the advent of the windows-oriented graphical user interface (GUI).

The microTutor language was developed in the PLATO project at UIUC to permit portions of a lesson to run in terminals that contained microcomputers, with connections to TUTOR code running on the mainframe. The microTutor dialect was also the programming language of the Cluster system developed at UIUC and licensed to TDK in Japan; the Cluster system consisted of a small group of terminals attached to a minicomputer which provided storage and compilation. The [http://tencore.com Tencore Language Authoring System] is a TUTOR derivative developed by Paul Tenczar for PCs and sold by Computer Teaching Corporation. cT was a derivative of TUTOR and microTutor developed at Carnegie Mellon which allowed programs to run without change in windowed GUI environments on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux systems: [http://vpython.org/contents/cTsource/cToverview.html The cT Programming Language Archives]

The '''Test of English Proficiency developed by Seoul National University''' or '''TEPS''' is an [[English language|English]] proficiency test created by [[Seoul National University]]'s Language Education Institute to evaluate [[South Korea]]n test takers' English language skills. TEPS has been administered nationwide since January 1999. It consists of 200 questions which are divided into four sections: Listening (60 questions, 55 minutes), Grammar (50 questions, 25 minutes), Vocabulary (50 questions, 15 minutes), and Reading (40 questions, 45 minutes). TEPS scores are divided into the ten ratings ranging from 1 + to 5. It is designed to test applicants' communicative English skills and to minimize test-taker reliance on certain strategies such as rote memorization. A study&lt;ref&gt;Inn Chull Choi, 1999, "Test Fairness and Validity of the TEPS," ''Language Research'' 35(4):571-603&lt;/ref&gt; of the test indicated that it is [[Test validity|valid]] and fair.

TEPS score is valid to be converted into [[Test of English as a Foreign Language|TOEFL]] score and this conversion is used throughout many universities in the United States.

==Test structure==
TEPS consists of four sections: Listening Comprehension, Grammar, Vocabulary, and Reading Comprehension. The test has a total of 200 questions and takes approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to administer. Scores are assigned on a scale of 10 points to 990 points total and incorporate Item Response Theory, which is also called the IRT.
*Listening: Parts 1 to 3 consist of conversations, while Part 4 consists of short monologues in the form of lectures, broadcasts, announcements, advertisements, and so on. Dialogues for parts 1 and 2 are heard once, because the conversation fragments are consisted with a single or three spoken statements. In these two parts, the test taker should select the answer that best comes after the fragments. Also, part 3 dialogues and part 4 lectures and their corresponding questions are heard twice before the answer choices are presented. In these two parts, the test taker should answer the question about the main idea, supporting detail, and inference about the passage. All listening comprehension questions are presented solely in aural form, which prevents lucky guesses from seeing written options prior to listening to a question. The listening section consists of 60 questions (15 for each section), lasts for about 55 minutes, and is worth 400 points.
*Grammar: The grammar section has a time constraint of 30 seconds per question, which helps measure a test taker’s true ability to apply grammar knowledge in real-life situations. This comprehension section has four parts, idealized to measure both colloquial and literary abilities. The grammar section consists of 50 questions, lasts for 25 minutes, and is worth 100 points.
*Vocabulary: The TEPS vocabulary section measures a test taker’s ability to use vocabulary in authentic and practical contexts. The vocabulary section incorporates many items that test knowledge of collocations in order to measure the ability to distinguish among synonyms and related words, which could be confused when translated. This comprehension section has two parts, idealized to measure both colloquial and literary abilities. The vocabulary section consists of 50 questions, lasts for 15 minutes, and is worth 100 points.
*Reading: The set of reading skills required for the TEPS reading comprehension section is identical to that required for reading tasks in everyday, academic, and work contexts. A test taker will therefore achieve good scores if they have read a diverse range of articles and trained themselves to grasp the context of an entire passage as well as sentence-level meaning. The test taker has about one minute to read each short, self-contained passage and answer a single question based on it. Because the time limit is relatively short and the passages cover a wide range of topics, it is not possible to answer the questions with rote memorization or test-wise strategies. This comprehension section contains three parts. In part one, consisted with sixteen questions, the test taker is asked to fill in the blank in the text. In part two, consisted with twenty one questions, the test taker is asked to answer three types of questions about the text, which is main idea, correct detail, and inference question. In part three, the test taker is asked to answer three texts to identify the sentence that has a detail which does not belong to the whole text. The reading section consists of 40 questions, lasts for 45 minutes, and is worth 400 points.
The new revised version of the test was introduced in May 2018, which includes four section. The listening section divided in to five parts with total 240 points and 40 minutes test time. Vocabulary and grammar section each have 60 points, with 25 minute test time and divided into further 2 and 3 parts respectively. The comprehensive reading section complete in 40 minutes and 240 points with 4 parts. The overall new test have 14 parts, 135 questions, 105 minute test duration and 0 to 600 points.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.teps.or.kr/test_structure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tutorial''' is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a [[learning]] process. More [[interactivity|interactive]] and specific than a [[book]] or a [[lecture]], a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.

A tutorial can be taken in many forms, ranging from a set of instructions to complete a task to an interactive problem solving session (usually in academia).

== Academia ==

=== Tutorial class ===

In British [[academia|academic]] [[parlance]], a tutorial is a small class of one, or only a few [[student]]s, in which the [[tutor]], a [[lecturer]], or other academic staff member, gives individual attention to the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of 'tutorial'|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/tutorial|website=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[tutorial system]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is fundamental to methods of teaching at those universities, but it is by no means particular to them; [[Heythrop College]] ([[University of London]]), for instance, also offers a tutorial system with one-on-one teaching. It is rare for newer universities in the UK to have the resources to offer individual tuition &lt;!-- Did the author intend to use the word “tuition,” or based on the context,  should it rather read, “tutoring?” ~~~~Mark Halsey --&gt;;  a class of six to eight (or even more) students is a far more common tutorial size. However, at [[New College of the Humanities]], established in 2011, one to one tutorials are integral to its teaching method. At Cambridge, a tutorial is known as a '''supervision'''.

In [[Tertiary education in Australia|Australian]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Education in South Africa|South African]] universities, a tutorial (colloquially called a '''tute''' or '''tut''') is a class of 10–30 students. Such tutorials are very similar to the Canadian system, although, tutorials are usually led by [[Honours degree|honours]] or [[postgraduate]] students, known as 'tutors'.

At the two campuses of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, U.S.]] and a few other American colleges with a similar version of the [[Great Books]] program, a "tutorial" is a class of 12–16 students who meet regularly with the guidance of a tutor.  The tutorial focuses on a certain subject area (e.g., mathematics tutorial, language tutorial) and generally proceeds with careful reading of selected primary texts and working through associated exercises (e.g., demonstrating a Euclid proof or translating ancient Greek poetry).  Since formal lectures do not play a large part in the St. John's College curriculum, the tutorial is the primary method by which certain subjects are studied.  However, at St. John's the tutorial is considered ancillary to the [[seminar]], in which a slightly larger group of students meets with two tutors for broader discussion of the particular texts on the seminar list.

Some US colleges, such as [[Williams College]] in Williamstown, Massachusetts, offer tutorials almost identical in structure to that of an [[Oxbridge]] tutorial. At Williams, students in tutorials typically work in pairs alongside a professor and meet weekly, while alternately presenting position papers or critiques of their partner's paper.

=== Tutorial schools ===

There are also specialized schools for tutoring such as, [[Kumon]] and EduHub. These supplemental hands-on learning programs are especially popular in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC | title = Meet the 'tutor kings and queens' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20085558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times | title = Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/06iht-educlede06.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conference tutorials ===
Offered as a service or deliverables to its members, conference tutorials are one example of a continuing education activity sponsored by a technical and professional association.

===Private study===
A tutorial in high schools in the United States may also mean a session for [[homework]] or other private study. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.chs.fuhsd.org/cms/page_view?d=x&amp;piid=&amp;vpid=1231079660677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shorelineschools.org/domain/868&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet ==

Internet computer tutorials can take the form of a screen recording ([[screencast]]), a written document (either online or downloadable), interactive tutorial, or an audio file, where a person will give step by step instructions on how to do something.

Tutorials usually have the following characteristics:

* A '''presentation of the view''' usually explaining and showing the user the user interface
* A '''demonstration of a process''', using examples to show how a workflow or process is completed; often broken up into discrete modules or sections.
* Some '''method of review''' that reinforces or tests understanding of the content in the related module or section.
* A '''transition to additional modules or sections''' that builds on the instructions already provided.  Tutorials can be ''linear'' or ''branching''.

While many writers refer to a mere list of instructions or tips as a tutorial, this usage can be misleading.

== Computer-based tutoring ==
In [[computer-based education]], a tutorial is a computer program whose purpose is to assist users in learning how to use parts of a [[software]] product such as an [[office suite]] or any other application, operating system interface, programming tool, or [[video game]]. There are three kinds of software tutorials: 1) video tutorials that the user views,  2) [[interactive]] tutorials where the user follows on-screen instructions (and—in some cases—watches short instruction movies), whereupon he/she does the tutorial exercises and receives feedback depending on his/her actions; and 3) [[webinar]]s where users participate in real-time lectures, [[online tutoring]], or workshops remotely using web conferencing software.

==History==
[[File:Naturhist saml.jpg|thumb|University Museum of Bergen]] 
Although the university was founded as late as 1946, academic activity had taken place in [[Bergen]] since the founding of [[Bergen Cathedral School]] in 1153, the  [[Seminarium Fredericianum]] in 1750 and the establishment of the [[Royal Norwegian Naval Academy]] in 1817. Academia and higher education would also be significanlty advanced in the city with the establishment of [[Bergen Museum]], later renamed ''University Museum of Bergen'', in 1825. Founded by [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie|Wilhelm Frimann Christie]] and [[Jacob Neumann]], the museum became a venue for both research and education specialized on natural science, and featured prominent researcher like [[Michael Sars]], [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Fridtjof Nansen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uib.no/utdanning/49947/et-tradisjonsrikt-universitet|title=Et tradisjonsrikt universitet|work=Universitetet i Bergen|access-date=2017-10-27|language=nb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bergen would eventually become a city with several arenas for higher education and research with the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] being established in 1917, the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] in 1930, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] in 1936 and finally the university in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uib.no/aktuelt/99854/universitetet-i-bergen-er-70-%C3%A5r|title=Universitetet i Bergen er 70 år|work=Universitetet i Bergen|access-date=2017-11-13|language=nb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Welner table''' is a medical [[examination table]] designed to facilitate [[accessibility]] for both patients and doctors with [[physical disability|physical disabilities]]. It was designed by American [[obstetrician]]-[[gynecologist]] and [[disability rights]] activist [[Sandra Welner]].

Welner's work with disabled women patients led her to invent the Welner table, a [[universal design|universally accessible]] examination table with a wider than usual range of adjustments in position and height, down to as low as {{convert|20|in}} above floor level for easier transfers from a [[wheelchair]].&lt;ref name=Courant&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.courant.com/1998-03-03/features/9803030035_1_disabilities-health-care-clinics |date=1998-03-03 |first=Hilary |last=Waldman |title=New Equipment, New Outlook|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table also serves the needs of disabled physicians by allowing a wider range of positions for performing examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/obituaries/20011023welner1023p2.asp |title=Obituary: Dr. Sandra Welner / Obstetrician-gynecologist, champion for disabled women |date=2001-10-23 |first=Anita |last=Srikameswaran |newspaper=Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Courant/&gt;
