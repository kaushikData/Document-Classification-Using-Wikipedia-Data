== Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister ==
Following Acting Prime Minister [[Abdullah al-Thani]]'s call that he would resign on 13 April for an alleged attack on his family, he was persuaded to stay on till a new leader was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/60814/libya-prime-minister-quits/ |title=Libya PM Quits, Says He Was Targeted in Armed Attack |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=13 April 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014 |author=Frizell, Sam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531080848/http://time.com/60814/libya-prime-minister-quits/ |archive-date=31 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of voting on 28 April was disrupted by armed men firing in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27276153 |title=Libya appoints Ahmed Maitig as new prime minister |publisher=BBC |date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606095144/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27276153 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a voting session at the [[General National Congress]] that was described by ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'' as "chaotic," Maiteeq was elected, and took the oath, "I swear I will carry out my duties honestly and in devotion." Later MP Fathi al-Majbari told Libyan television station ''[[Al-Ahrar]]'': "There are violations in today's session" and that a certain alteration of the votes had occurred after the session was adjourned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/confusion-surrounds-libya-pm-election-201454195446967363.html |title=Confusion surrounds Libya PM's election |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=5 May 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521211535/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/confusion-surrounds-libya-pm-election-201454195446967363.html |archivedate=21 May 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately in the days that followed, the Libyan Supreme Court ruled that the election of Maiteeq had been invalid, and the previous Prime Minister, al-Thani, agreed to return to office.

al-Thani, had earlier signed an agreement with those holding the smaller oil export terminals of Hariga and Zueitina, those holding the larger Ras Lanuf and Es Sider terminals refused to recognise Maiteeq. Spokesman Ali Hasi said: "Maiteeq came to power illegally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=7 May 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014 |title=Libyan rebels refuse to deal with new PM |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/libyan-rebels-refuse-deal-with-new-pm-201457104123867408.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521211310/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/libyan-rebels-refuse-deal-with-new-pm-201457104123867408.html |archivedate=21 May 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">'''Bright Ideas Trust''' (BIT) is a [[registered charity]] founded in 2007 by Richard Morris and former ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' winner [[Timothy Campbell (businessman)|Tim Campbell]], established to help disadvantaged people aged 16-30 build their own businesses.

==Target group==

The charity was established to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get involved in enterprise. 

Bright Ideas Trust provides end-to-end business start-up support, mentoring and access to funding to disadvantaged 16- to 30-year-olds, including those who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.brightideastrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright Ideas Trust currently has staff located in London and the North East of England but is able to remotely support young people from across the UK.

==Charitable activities==

Despite being a charity, Bright Ideas Trust does not give away grants but instead helps beneficiaries access start-up finance via start-up loans. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/brightideastrust?fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity provides bespoke support for young people who want to start their own business. Each young person is matched with a mentor, who works with them during the business planning stage and for at least the first twelve months of the business trading. Mentors are usually experienced entrepreneurs from a wide variety of sectors.

Every 2 months Bright Ideas Trust hosts an informal networking event for young people and people interested in helping them set up in business. Each event includes an interview with a young person the charity has helped, a guest speaker who is usually an established business owner and an expert business panel q&amp;a session. 

Bright Ideas Trust also delivers enterprise awareness workshops and events in schools, colleges, universities and other youth organisations to help young people make fully informed decisions regarding their career choice. 

Bright Ideas Trust also engages with prisons, youth offending teams, housing associations and other organisations supporting employability projects for young people.

'''Christopher Kennedy "Chris" Lawford''' (March 29, 1955 – September 4, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/obituaries/christopher-kennedy-lawford-dead.html |title=Christopher Kennedy Lawford, Actor and Author Who Battled Addiction, Dies at 63 |first= Amie|last= Tsang|date=September 5, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author, actor, and activist. He was a member of the prominent [[Kennedy family]], and son of actor [[Peter Lawford]].

==Early life and education==
Lawford was born in [[Santa Monica, California]], at [[Saint John's Health Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawford|first=Christopher Kennedy|title='Symptoms of Withdrawal: Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/books/chapters/1030-1st-lawford.html|publisher=nytimes.com|date=October 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest child and only son of actor [[Peter Lawford]] (1923–1984) and socialite [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia "Pat" Kennedy Lawford]] (1924–2006). His three younger sisters are Sydney McKelvy (born 1956), Victoria Lawford (born 1958), and Robin Lawford (born 1961). Lawford was a nephew of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former cousin-in-law of actor/politician [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (appearing in two of his films, including ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]''). Peter and Patricia Lawford divorced in 1966 after which Patricia raised the children in New York City.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Charles E.|title=Peter Lawford Was His Dad, Pat Kennedy His Mom, and Heroin His Undoing—Now Christopher Lawford Is Back on Track|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20114648,00.html|publisher=people.com|date=March 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his parents' divorce, Lawford attended St. Martin of Tours Elementary School in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Gemma|title=Breaking the Curse of the Kennedys|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/breaking-the-curse-of-the-kennedys/story-fn6bqvxz-1226287785732|publisher=adelaidenow.com.au|date=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon moving to New York City with his mother, he attended the [[Middlesex School]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. He later earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Tufts University]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; In 1983, he earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Boston College Law School]], and a master's certificate in Clinical Psychology from [[Harvard University]], where he gained an academic appointment as a Lecturer in Psychiatry.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Bob|title=Lawford tells tale of privilege and pain|url=http://m.spokesman.com/stories/2005/oct/08/lawford-tells-tale-of-privilege-and-pain/|publisher=spokesman.com|date=October 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug and legal issues===
Lawford began taking drugs while attending the Middlesex School. By the late 1970s, he had developed a serious drug abuse problem. He briefly attended [[Fordham University School of Law]], but dropped out after several months due to his dependency on heroin. He later contracted [[Hepatitis C]] due to his drug abuse.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; In 1980, he was arrested in [[Aspen, Colorado]] for impersonating a doctor in order to get prescription medication. The charges were later dropped when Lawford completed his probation.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

In April 1984, Lawford's cousin [[David A. Kennedy|David Kennedy]], who also battled substance abuse issues and with whom Lawford had a close relationship, died of a drug overdose. David's death prompted Lawford to seek professional help for his issues. He attended addiction behavior classes at the [[Cambridge Hospital]] and became sober.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Career==

===Acting===
In 1988, Lawford decided to pursue a career in acting.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; He spent over fifteen years in the film and television business as an actor, lawyer, executive, and producer. As an independent producer Lawford arranged financing for and produced films including ''[[Kiss Me Guido]]'' (in 1997) which he also appeared as 'Dakota',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kiss Me, Guido, TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/kiss-guido/cast/132510/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; ''Drunks''; both films were selections in the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

Lawford's acting credits include ''Eavesdrop'', ''[[Slipstream (2007 film)|Slipstream]]'', ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'', ''[[Terminator 3]]'', ''[[Blankman]]'', ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', ''[[The Russia House (film)|The Russia House]]'', ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', and many others. His credits also include a three-year tenure on the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' and a role on ''[[General Hospital]]''.

===Writing===
In September 2005, [[HarperCollins]] published Lawford's memoir ''Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption'' (William Morrow 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073248-2}}), which immediately became a New York Times Bestseller. In 2009, he released ''Moments of Clarity: Voices from the Front Lines of Addiction and Recovery'', a series of essays by public figures, athletes and entertainers who have struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol. Almost every interviewee sought help from a [[twelve-step program]] such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], [[Narcotics Anonymous]] or another spiritually based means of support for recovery. In his own life, Lawford battled a drug and alcohol addiction for much of his early life.&lt;ref name="CADCA01"&gt;[http://www.cadca.org/pressreleases/detail/actor-author-and-activist-christopher-kennedy-lawford-joins-cadcas-board-direct "Actor, Author, and Activist Christopher Kennedy Lawford Joins CADCA's Board of Directors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229231243/http://www.cadca.org/pressreleases/detail/actor-author-and-activist-christopher-kennedy-lawford-joins-cadcas-board-direct |date=December 29, 2010 }} Press release, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (Alexandria, VA), February 26, 2010. Retrieved 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
Lawford worked extensively in politics, government and the non-profit sector holding executive staff positions with The [[Democratic National Committee]], The Community Action for Legal Services Agency and in the Washington office of Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]]. He has held staff positions on numerous national, state and local political campaigns, as well as with The [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]], [[Special Olympics]] and The [[Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse]] at [[Columbia University]]. He was later a Public Advocacy Consultant for Caron Treatment Centers, and was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to serve on the California Department of Public Health Advisory Board.&lt;ref name ="CADCA01" /&gt;

==Insight on Castro==
Lawford told Australian interviewers that he had been trying to make a film about the 1962 [[Cuban missile crisis]] from [[Cuba]]'s perspective but that he had been stymied by the U.S. embargo.

Lawford told the Australian newspaper that he sat next to Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Havana]] during a 2001 screening of ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', a film about the missile crisis. "It was incredible. I went there and sat next to the guy my uncles were trying to kill. But President Castro believes if President Kennedy had lived, the embargo would have been lifted and they would have normalized relations." In a separate interview with ABC, Lawford said Castro "got up at the end of the film and he said, 'You've made a great film, but you've ignored Cuba, now you have to make a film of what was happening here in Cuba during those thirteen days." Lawford said that he had returned to Cuba six times in an effort to do just that "but as you know we have an embargo against Cuba, which is one of the greatest foreign policy tragedies in the history of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Source: News Story from [[IMDB]] news briefings.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban government has not commented on this allegation.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
In November 1984, Lawford married Jeannie Olsson, a sales advertising assistant for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bly|first=Nellie|title=The Kennedy Men: Three Generations of Sex, Scandal and Secrets|year=1996|publisher=Kensington Books|isbn=1-575-66106-3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children: Christopher Kennedy Lawford Jr., Savannah Rose Lawford,  and Matthew LeMoyne Kennedy Lawford.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; They divorced in 2000.

On August 22, 2005, Lawford married Lana Antonova, a Russian actress and entrepreneur, in a small ceremony in Las Vegas, NV. The couple divorced in December 10, 2009.

In May 2014, Lawford married Mercedes Miller, a yoga teacher, in Maui, Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/christopher-kennedy-lawford-marries-mercedes-miller |title=Christopher Kennedy Lawford Marries in Hawaii|last=McNeil|first=Liz |publisher=Time Inc.|date=May 27, 2014 |website=People.com |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawford was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith.&lt;ref name=sheridan&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Patricia|title=Patricia Sheridan's Breakfast With ... Christopher Kennedy Lawford|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2009/02/02/Patricia-Sheridan-s-Breakfast-With-Christopher-Kennedy-Lawford/stories/200902020159|publisher=post-gazette.com|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview, Lawford claimed that he left the church in 1968 stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] I left the Catholic Church when I was 13 years old after my [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Uncle Bobby was assassinated]], saying I would never go back, and I didn't really have a need for God and I didn't really believe in God. He wasn't useful to me. But I had gotten an understanding that there were spiritual people. My grandmother, [[Rose Kennedy]], was a devout Catholic, but she was also a very spiritual person. She walked and meditated every day of her life. Her faith and spirituality got her through enormous trauma. That was not lost on me. My grandmother was this beacon of equilibrium in a world that was crazy. [...]That's [Roman Catholicism] just not something that speaks to me. I have my own tradition. I go to an [[ashram]]. I meditate. I chant. I do all that kind of stuff [...]&lt;ref name=sheridan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Art sale===
In March 2010, Lawford sold at auction a 1965 [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] painting, ''Femme au Grand Chapeau. Buste.'' The painting was estimated to sell at [[Sotheby's]] for between $8&amp;nbsp;million to $12&amp;nbsp;million and ended up bringing $8.2&amp;nbsp;million, or $9.3&amp;nbsp;million with Sotheby's buyer's commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/arts/design/06auction.html "A Sober Follow-Up to a Record Auction Night"] by Carol Vogel, ''The New York Times'', May 5, 2010 (May 6, 2010 on p. A24 of National ed.). Retrieved 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On September 5, 2018, Christopher's cousin [[Kerry Kennedy]] announced via her Twitter account that Lawford had died and paid tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/KerryKennedyRFK/status/1037353830424424448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://patch.com/california/hollywood/jfk-nephew-actor-christopher-lawford-dies-64&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, law enforcement officials in Hollywood, California told TMZ that Lawford suffered a heart attack at a yoga studio in Vancouver, British Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vancourier.com/author-actor-kennedy-scion-christopher-lawford-dead-at-63-1.23422469&lt;/ref&gt; the previous evening and later died.&lt;ref name=USAT&gt;https://people.com/politics/john-f-kennedy-nephew-christopher-lawford-dies-63/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://fox8.com/2018/09/05/reports-christopher-kennedy-lawford-dead-at-63/&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy is being performed to the determine the exact cause of death, which is believed to have been natural causes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Awards and honors==
Lawford supported Women in Recovery, Inc., a non-profit organization offering a live-in, [[12-step program]] of rehabilitation for women in need, based in [[Venice, California]]. This charity, which was founded by a longtime resident of Venice, Sister Ada Geraghty, annually honors those who have made a difference in helping women overcome substance abuse problems. Lawford was the 2006 honoree for Women in Recovery at their Gala; past honorees have included [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Angela Lansbury]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]].

'''Consumer NZ''', previously known as '''Consumers' Institute of New Zealand''', is an organization that covers a wide range of activities relating to [[consumer protection]] and information. Its work includes comparative tests and surveys of consumer goods and services, research into and advice on financial, food, health, safety, welfare and environmental matters, representation at parliamentary committees and public enquiries and an interest in [[consumer education]] and complaints advisory work. 

== History ==
The Consumers’ Council was established in 1959{{cn|date=July 2013}} ‘to protect and promote the interest of consumers of goods and services’.{{cn|date=July 2013}} In 1963 the name Consumers Institute was adopted{{cn|date=July 2013}} and in 1967 it became a separate government funded entity.{{cn|date=July 2013}} In 1986 the Ministry of [[Consumer protection|Consumer Affairs]] was established and the Consumers Institute lost its special legal protection and government funding.{{cn|date=July 2013}} The Consumers Institute became an incorporated society funded by members’ subscriptions in 1989{{cn|date=July 2013}} and in 2007 the Consumers’ Institute was renamed Consumer NZ.

In 2016 the organisation had over 100,000 members and supporters.

The [[Minister of Consumer Affairs (New Zealand)]] has cited Consumer NZ as a source of guidance for consumers wanting to understand the [[Consumer Guarantees Act (NZ)|Consumer Guarantees Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/legislation-policy/policy-reports-and-papers/disscussion-papers/consumer-law-reform-a-discussion-paper/12.-consumer-guarantees |title=12. Consumer Guarantees - Consumer Affairs |first= |last=|work=consumeraffairs.govt.nz |year=2010 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the [[Ministry of Consumer Affairs (New Zealand)]], Consumer NZ manages Powerswitch, which is a project to assist consumers in evaluating the costs of consuming electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/news-1/word-of-advice/2011/power-up-with-powerswitch |title=Power up with powerswitch - Consumer Affairs |first= |last= |work=consumeraffairs.govt.nz |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ea.govt.nz/consumer/powerswitch/ |title=Powerswitch » Electricity Authority |author=[[Electricity Authority (NZ)]] |work=ea.govt.nz |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==
Consumer commissions independent laboratories to carry out product tests.{{cn|date=July 2013}} Consumer does not accept [[free good]]s for testing or sponsorship.{{cn|date=July 2013}} The magazine is completely independent and has no ties with any commercial firm or organisation.{{cn|date=July 2013}} Their membership of [[Consumers International]] means they benefit from an exchange of information with [[Consumer organization|consumer organisations]] around the world.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

The organization does not permit any marketer to use its test results to promote their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swann|first=Allan|title=Consumer NZ gives Progressive the hard word|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/consumer-nz-gives-progressive-hard-word-35393|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=[[National Business Review]]|date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been criticized for emphasizing shortcomings in [[nursing homes]], with health care workers saying that Consumers NZ demands more from health care services than it is reasonable to expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watchdog group under fire over rest home criticism|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10897509|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Board ==
Consumer NZ is governed by an elected board of seven members who hold office for three years. The current chair is Richard Aston. The deputy chair is [[Sue Kedgley]].&lt;ref name=Board&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/cb | title=Consumer Board | publisher=Consumer NZ | accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Consumers’ work on behalf of all NZ consumers, they regularly make submissions to Government and statutory authorities on a wide range of issues affecting consumers.

Consumers' money comes from the sale of publications and subscriptions to ''Consumer'' and consumer.org.nz. When a customer subscribes to Consumer magazine or consumer.org.nz they become a member of Consumer NZ (unless they request otherwise) and have the right to nominate and vote for Board members. The style of the magazine has been critiqued and described as a "distinctive authorial" presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hannis |first=Grant |title=Visual communication in consumer journalism: The case of Consumer magazine in New Zealand |journal=[[PRism (journal)|PRism]] |year=2010 |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.prismjournal.org/hannis.html|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cupid's Span''''' is an outdoor sculpture by married artists [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]], installed along the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] in [[San Francisco]], California, in the United States. The {{Convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} sculpture, commissioned by [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]] founders [[Donald Fisher|Donald]] and [[Doris F. Fisher]], depicts a partial bow and piece of an arrow.&lt;ref name=Hoge&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoge|first1=Patrick|title=S.F. struck by love / Cupid's big bow gets rise out of passers-by|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/S-F-struck-by-love-Cupid-s-big-bow-gets-rise-2751612.php|accessdate=November 19, 2015|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
[[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]]'s ''Cupid's Span'', made of fiberglass and steel, was installed in the newly built Rincon Park along the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] in San Francisco in 2002.&lt;ref name=Hoge/&gt; The piece resembles [[Cupid]]'s bow and arrow, drawn, with the arrow and bow partially implanted in the ground; the artists stated that the piece was inspired by San Francisco's reputation as the home port of Eros, hence the stereotypical bow and arrow of Cupid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldenburgvanbruggen.com/largescaleprojects/cupidsspan.htm Cupid's Span].

'''Dan Grigore Adamescu''' (20 September 1948 – 24 January 2017) was a [[Romania]]n businessman who was the founder of The Nova Group, and was the second richest Romanian in 2013. In 2016, he was sentenced to four years and four months in jail for bribing judges at his companies' insolvency trials. Adamescu held Romanian and German citizenships.&lt;ref name=EJ&gt;{{cite news| url= http://ejpress.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56662&amp;catid=14| title= The new Communists: Romania is moving backwards| last=Black | first=Eldad| work=European Jewish Press| date=6 January 2017| accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Piata Unirii - Magazinul Unirea - Noaptea.jpg|thumb| 200px| The [[Unirea Shopping Center]], which was owned by Adamescu.]]
Born in [[Vaideeni]], [[Vâlcea County]], Adamescu entered business in 1971, after graduating from the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]].&lt;ref name=evz&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evz.ro/dan-grigore-adamescu-biografia-neromantata-a-unui-mogul-de-presa-1.html| title= Dan Grigore Adamescu.

In 2013, [[Forbes]] estimated Adamescu's [[net worth]] at US$900 million, making him the second-richest Romanian, after [[Ioan Niculae]]. At the time, he was the majority shareholder of The Nova Group, which owned companies including [[România Liberă]], Astra Insurance, [[ASC Oțelul Galați]], and the [[Unirea Shopping Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.viata-libera.ro/sport/48384-otelul-are-al-doilea-cel-mai-bogat-patron-din-liga-i-adamescu-e-pe-locul-doi-in-top-forbes-si-capital| title= Otelul are al doilea cel mai bogat patron din liga i adamescu e pe locul doi in top forbes si capital| last=Savastru| first=Marian| work=[[Viața Liberă]]| date=15 November 2013| accessdate=27 January 2017| language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Forbes Romania estimated his net worth to be €550 million.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; In October 2016, Alexander Adamescu, Dan's son, denied that his father had affiliations with [[Black Cube]].

==Arrest and trial==
In 2013, Adamescu's company Astra Insurance went bankrupt; his family blamed the Romanian state for causing the bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; During the bankruptcy trial, Adamescu was alleged to have bribed judges €20,000.&lt;ref name=Gulf&gt;{{cite news| url= http://gulftoday.ae/portal/53b772f2-b135-4549-a815-7dccf0b572a3.aspx| title= Dan Adamescu, Romania's businessman serving prison, has died| work=[[The Gulf Today]]| date=24 January 2017| accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.business-review.eu/news/romanian-millionaire-dan-adamescu-gets-jail-sentence-for-bribery-106964| title= Home » News » Romanian millionaire Dan Adamescu gets jail sentence for bribery Romanian millionaire Dan Adamescu gets jail sentence for bribery| work=Business Review| date=27 May 2016| accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BI&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-big-names-go-behind-bars-in-romanian-corruption-case| title= Romania Jails Four Judges and Mogul for Corruption| last=Chiriak| first=Marian| work=[[Balkan Insight]]| date=3 February 2015| accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, [[Victor Ponta]] predicted that Adamescu would be arrested for corruption.

==Illness and death==
In November 2016, Adamescu's [[parole]] request, based on ill health, was rejected by a local court.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; In December,  he had knee surgery, after which he developed infections.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; He was in an [[induced coma]] from December 2016 until his death on 24 January 2017, and had been suffering from [[septicemia]].&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Adamescu was buried in the Lutheran section of [[Bellu Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.b1.ro/stiri/eveniment/update-sotia-lui-dan-adamescu-rupe-tacerea-voi-lua-toate-masurile-necesare-drept-la-replica-al-lui-alexander-adamescu-foto-174955.html?page=1| title= Soția lui Dan Adamescu rupe tăcerea | last=| first=| work=[[B1 TV]]| date=25 January 2017| accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Adamescu was married to Carmen Palade, general manager of [[Unirea Shopping Center]] for "many years".&lt;ref name="Romania Insider"&gt;{{cite news |title=Late billionaire’s ex-wife held for embezzlement in Romania |url=https://www.romania-insider.com/late-billionaires-ex-wife-held-for-embezzlement-in-romania/ |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=Romania Insider |date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018, Palade is being held by Romanian authorities after "several hours of hearings" on suspicion of embezzlement and tax evasion.&lt;ref name="Romania Insider"/&gt; Palade had fought for control of the Nova Group with her husband and stepson, Alexander Adamescu, and was removed as head of Nova in 2017, with ALexander taking over after his father's death.&lt;ref name="Romania Insider"/&gt;

On 13 June 2016, he was arrested by British police. In an interview with [[The Times]], he said he “fears that he will die in prison like his father if the Romanian government secures his extradition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/playwright-snared-by-law-he-backed-cdt6cms86|title=Playwright snared by law he backed|last=Brown|first=Chad Greggor, David|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2017 during a hearing involving Adamescu's Dutch holding company Nova Group Investments and Romania, the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] tribunal recommended that Romania withdraw (or otherwise suspend operation of) the European Arrest Warrant against Adamescu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrwf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Romania-abuses-the-European-Arrest-Warrant-a-new-report-says.pdf|title=Romania-abuses-the-European-Arrest-Warrant-a-new-report-says|last=|first=|date=|website=hrwf.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called upon Romania to “refrain from reissuing or transmitting any other EAW against him”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeanbusinessreview.eu/page.asp?pid=1894|title=Questions asked of Romania’s cooperation with its international commitments - Analyses - EBR|website=www.europeanbusinessreview.eu|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 2017, Romania asked the ICSID to reconsider its recommendation but this was rejected and the recommendation upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeanbusinessreview.eu/page.asp?pid=1894|title=Questions asked of Romania’s cooperation with its international commitments - Analyses - EBR|website=www.europeanbusinessreview.eu|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Finance sidebar|instruments}}
In finance, a '''derivative''' is a contract that ''derives'' its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity can be an [[asset]], [[Index fund|index]], or [[interest rate]], and is often simply called the "[[underlying]]".&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Derivatives |publisher= [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] |url=http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/index-derivatives.html |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |quote = A derivative is a financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of some underlying market factors, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity, credit, or equity prices. Derivative transactions include an assortment of financial contracts, including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards, and various combinations thereof.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp "Derivative Definition"], [[Investopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes, including insuring against price movements (hedging), increasing exposure to price movements for speculation or getting access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Koehler |first1= Christian| title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk| journal= Working Paper|pages =10–11|ssrn =2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the more common derivatives include [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Option (finance)|options]], [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], and variations of these such as synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]]s and [[credit default swap]]s.&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt; Most derivatives are traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]], while most [[insurance]] contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the [[United States]], after the financial crisis of 2007–2009, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges. 
Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being [[stock]]s (i.e., equities or shares) and [[debt]] (i.e., [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and mortgages).&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt; The oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by [[Aristotle]], is thought to be a contract transaction of [[olive]]s, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher [[Thales]], who made a profit in the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=George |last1=Crawford |first2=Bidyut |last2=Sen |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NIIVeirctosC&amp;pg=PA7 |title=Derivatives for Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1996 |isbn=9780471129943 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bucket shop (stock market)|Bucket shops]], outlawed a century ago, are a more recent historical example.

==Basics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}

Derivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties' contractual obligations, and the [[notional amount]]) under which payments are to be made between the parties.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Mark Rubinstein]] |title= Rubinstein on Derivatves|year=1999|publisher=Risk Books |isbn=1-899332-53-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assets include [[Commodity|commodities]], stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm's capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm's assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.

From the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows, that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in the underlying asset is attached to the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal =Working Paper|pages=10|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying asset does not have to be acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows derivative designers to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

There are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivatives such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]] that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and [[Exchange-traded derivative contract|exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) that are traded through specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges.

Derivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the [[Dojima Rice Exchange]] since the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Rice_FT"&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9f45d80-6922-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as [[forward contract|forward]], [[option (finance)|option]], [[swap (finance)|swap]]); the type of underlying asset (such as [[equity derivative]]s, [[foreign exchange derivative]]s, [[interest rate derivative]]s, commodity derivatives, or [[credit derivative]]s); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]); and their pay-off profile.

Derivatives may broadly be categorized as "lock" or "option" products. Lock products (such as [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, [[futures contract|futures]], or forwards) obligate the contractual parties to the terms over the life of the contract. [[Option (finance)|Option]] products (such as [[interest rate swaps]]) provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation to enter the contract under the terms specified.

Derivatives can be used either for risk management (i.e. to "hedge" by providing offsetting compensation in case of an undesired event, a kind of "insurance") or for speculation (i.e. making a financial "bet"). This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.

Along with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010. The Act delegated many rule-making details of regulatory oversight to the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and those details are not finalized nor fully implemented as of late 2012.

==Size of market==
To give an idea of the size of the derivative market, ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that as of June 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market amounted to approximately $700 trillion, and the size of the market traded on exchanges totaled an additional $83 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Clear and Present Danger; Centrally cleared derivatives.(clearing houses) | work = The Economist | date = April 12, 2012  | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21552217  | publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd.{{Subscription required}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the fourth quarter 2017 the [[European Securities and Markets Authority|European Securities Market Authority]] estimated the size of European [[derivatives market]] at a size of €660 trillion with 74 million outstanding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-data-analysis-values-eu-derivatives-market-%E2%82%AC660-trillion-central-clearing|title=ESMA data analysis values EU derivatives market at €660 trillion with central clearing increasing significantly|website=www.esma.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, these are "notional" values, and some economists say that this value greatly exaggerates the market value and the true credit risk faced by the parties involved. For example, in 2010, while the aggregate of OTC derivatives exceeded $600 trillion, the value of the market was estimated much lower, at $21 trillion. The credit risk equivalent of the derivative contracts was estimated at $3.3 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Liu |first1= Qiao |authorlink1= |last2= Lejot |first2= Paul |authorlink2= |others= Douglas W. Arne |title= Finance in Asia: Institutions, Regulation and Policy|trans-title=|url= https://books.google.com/?id=NOBLXqkicKMC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=true+size+derivative+market#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20size%20derivative%20market&amp;f=false |year= 2013|origyear= |publisher= Routledge|location= New York|language= |isbn= 978-0-415-42319-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 343|pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= Debt, Derivatives and Complex Interactions|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Still, even these scaled down figures represent huge amounts of money. For perspective, the budget for total expenditure of the United States government during 2012 was $3.5 trillion,&lt;ref name="2012actual"&gt;{{cite book | url= http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf | title =The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023 |publisher= [[Congressional Budget Office]]| accessdate=March 15, 2013 |date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the total current value of the U.S. stock market is an estimated $23 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Swapping bad ideas: A big battle is unfolding over an even bigger market | work = The Economist | date = April 27, 2013 | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576681-big-battle-unfolding-over-even-bigger-market-swapping-bad-ideas }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world annual Gross Domestic Product is about $65 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = World GDP: In search of growth| work = The Economist | date = May 25, 2011 | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/05/world_gdp | publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And for one type of derivative at least, Credit Default Swaps (CDS), for which the inherent risk is considered high {{By whom|date=August 2017}}, the higher, nominal value, remains relevant. It was this type of derivative that investment magnate Warren Buffett referred to in his famous 2002 speech in which he warned against "financial weapons of mass destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Buffett warns on investment 'time bomb'|date=4 March 2003|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2817995.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDS notional value in early 2012 amounted to $25.5 trillion, down from $55 trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=600,000,000,000,000?|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187503475.html|publisher= Newsweek Inc. |last1= Sheridan |first1= Barrett| accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=April 2008}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derivatives are used for the following:

* Provide [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Shirreff |first=David| title=Dealing With Financial Risk |year=2004|publisher=The Economist |location= |isbn=1-57660-162-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwirEO_f1DkC|accessdate=September 14, 2011|page=23|chapter=Derivatives and leverage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Speculate and make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect (e.g. moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level)
* Switch asset allocations between different asset classes without disturbing the underlying assets, as part of transition management
* Avoid paying taxes.  For example, an [[equity swap]] allows an investor to receive steady payments, e.g. based on [[LIBOR]] rate, while avoiding paying [[capital gains tax]] and keeping the stock.

===Mechanics and valuation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Lock products are theoretically valued at zero at the time of execution and thus do not typically require an up-front exchange between the parties. Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e., "[[in the money]]") or a liability (i.e., "[[out of the money]]") at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its [[counterparty]] and is interested in protecting itself in an [[event of default]].

Option products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection ([[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]) over a given time period ([[Option time value|time value]]). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value).  Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e., if it is "in the money") or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e., if the option is "out of the money").

===Hedging===
{{Main article|Hedge (finance)}}

Derivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a [[wheat]] farmer and a [[miller]] could sign a [[futures contract]] to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will [[Revocation|renege]] on the contract. Although a third party, called a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]], insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.

From another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.

Hedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has [[coupon (bond)|coupon payments]], a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.

Derivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Sam (2010), [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/theres-a-derivative-in-your-cereal/60582 "There's a Derivative in Your Cereal"], ''The Atlantic''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.&lt;ref&gt;Chisolm, Derivatives Demystified (Wiley 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a [[forward rate agreement]] (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a [[notional amount]] of money.&lt;ref&gt;Chisolm, ''Derivatives Demystified'' (Wiley 2004) Notional sum means there is no actual principal.&lt;/ref&gt; If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.

===Speculation and arbitrage===
Derivatives can be used to acquire risk, rather than to hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the underlying asset, betting that the party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is less.

Individuals and institutions may also look for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a futures contract to sell the asset.

Speculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when [[Nick Leeson]], a trader at [[Barings Bank]], made poor and unauthorized investments in futures contracts. Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank's management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the [[Kobe earthquake]], Leeson incurred a $1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/375259.stm "How Leeson broke the bank"], ''BBC Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proportion used for hedging and speculation===
The true proportion of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sergey Chernenko|author2=Michael Faulkender|title=The Two Sides of Derivatives Usage: Hedging and Speculating with Interest Rate Swaps|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1727–1754|doi=10.1017/S0022109011000391|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.7302&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it appears to be relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;Knowledge@Wharton (2012).

[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=253036 "How Much do Firms Hedge with Derivatives?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, derivatives contracts account for only 3–6% of the median firms' total currency and interest rate exposure.&lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"&gt;Knowledge@Wharton (2006). [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1346 "The Role of Derivatives in Corporate Finances: Are Firms Betting the Ranch?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, we know that many firms' derivatives activities have at least some speculative component for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"/&gt;

==Types==

===OTC and exchange-traded===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Financial instrument]] --&gt;
In broad terms, there are two groups of derivative contracts, which are distinguished by the way they are traded in the market:

* '''[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivatives''' are contracts that are traded (and privately negotiated) directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]], [[forward rate agreement]]s, [[exotic option]]s – and other [[exotic derivative]]s – are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [[hedge fund]]s.  Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.

According to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995,&lt;ref name=BIS2007&gt;{{cite report |author1=Ryan Stever |author2=Christian Upper |author3=Goetz von Peter |title= BIS Quarterly Review |publisher=Bank for International Settlements |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0712.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the "[[gross market value]], which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices,&amp;nbsp;... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24)."&lt;ref name="BIS2007" /&gt; [[Position (finance)|Positions]] in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004. The total outstanding notional amount is US$708 trillion (as of June 2011).&lt;ref name="afgh"&gt;BIS survey: The [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) semi-annual [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.pdf OTC derivatives market report], for end of June 2008, showed US$683.7 trillion total [[notional amount]]s outstanding of OTC derivatives with a [[gross market value]] of US$20 trillion. ''See also [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.htm Prior Period Regular OTC Derivatives Market Statistics]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this total notional amount, 67% are [[interest rate derivative|interest rate contracts]], 8% are [[Credit default swap|credit default swaps (CDS)]], 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other.  Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty risk]], like an ordinary [[contract]], since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.

* '''[[Exchange-traded derivative contract|Exchange-traded derivatives]]''' (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt; A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes [[initial margin]] from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largest&lt;ref name="foweek"&gt;''Futures and Options Week'': According to figures published in F&amp;O Week October 10, 2005. See also [http://www.fow.com FOW Website].&lt;/ref&gt; derivatives exchanges (by number of transactions) are the [[Korea Exchange]] (which lists [[KOSPI]] Index Futures &amp; Options), [[Eurex]] (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate &amp; index products), and [[CME Group]] (made up of the 2007 merger of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and the 2008 acquisition of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]). According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world's derivatives exchanges totaled USD 344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported&lt;ref name="BIS2007" /&gt; that "derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion."&lt;ref name="BIS2007" /&gt;

===Common derivative contract===
Some of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:
# [[Forward contract|Forwards]]: A tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.
# [[Futures contract|Futures]]: are [[contract]]s to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.
# [[Option (finance)|Options]] are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a [[call option]]) or sell (in the case of a [[put option]]) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [[strike price]], and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a [[European option]], the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an [[American option]], the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: [[call option]] and [[put option]]. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. Similarly, the buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.
# [[Binary option]]s are contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.
# [[Warrant (finance)|Warrants]]: Apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. These are generally traded over the counter.
# [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, [[commodities exchange]], stocks or other assets. Another term which is commonly associated with ''swap'' is ''[[swaption]]'', a term for what is basically an option on the forward swap. Similar to call and put options, swaptions are of two kinds: ''receiver'' and ''payer''. In the case of a receiver swaption there is an option wherein one can receive fixed and pay floating; in the case of a payer swaption one has the option to pay fixed and receive floating.
::Swaps can basically be categorized into two types: 
::*[[Interest rate swap]]: These basically necessitate swapping only interest associated cash flows in the same currency, between two parties.
::*[[Currency swap]]: In this kind of swapping, the cash flow between the two parties includes both principal and interest. Also, the money which is being swapped is in different currency for both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Markets: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collateralized debt obligation===
A '''collateralized debt obligation''' ('''CDO''') is a type of [[structured finance|structured]] [[asset-backed security]] (ABS). An "asset-backed security" is used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets—including collateralized debt obligations and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (Example: "The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs".&lt;ref name="Securitization"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=2013|volume=88|pages=213|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1924831}}&lt;/ref&gt;(source: {{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis| title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis|url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf| work=August 2007 |publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=July 13, 2013}})&lt;br&gt;—and sometimes for a particular type of that security—one backed by consumer loans (example: "As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products—car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others—are called ABS. source {{cite web|last=Vink |first= Dennis| title= ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis| url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007| publisher= Munich Personal RePEc Archive |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}, &lt;br&gt;see also {{cite web|title=What are Asset-Backed Securities? |url= http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=10#sthash.roSaSia3.dpuf| publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=July 13, 2013|quote=Asset-backed securities, called ABS, are bonds or notes backed by financial assets. Typically these assets consist of receivables other than mortgage loans, such as credit card receivables, auto loans, manufactured-housing contracts and home-equity loans.}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security (MBS) markets.&lt;ref name="Lemke 2013"&gt;Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', §5:15 (Thomson West, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
Like other private-label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. The CDO is "sliced" into [[tranche|"tranches"]], which "catch" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Koehler| first1=Christian| title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk |journal=Working Paper| pages=17|ssrn= 2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most "junior" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, [[coupon (bond)|coupon]] payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches paying the lowest and the lowest tranches paying the highest rates to compensate for higher [[default risk]].  As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as "super senior"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.&lt;ref name="Lemke 2014"&gt;Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate [[Special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]]—rather than the parent [[investment bank]]—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration called "[[CDO-Squared]]" or the "CDOs of CDOs".&lt;ref name="Lemke 2014"/&gt; 
In the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,&lt;ref&gt;Bethany McLean and [[Joe Nocera]], ''All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis'', Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level ([[Credit ratings#Corporate credit ratings|BBB or A]]) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually non-prime mortgages.&lt;ref name="FCIR-p127"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf "Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States"], a.k.a. "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report", p.127&lt;/ref&gt; These CDOs have been called "the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain" for nonprime mortgages,&lt;ref name="FCIR-130"&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make non-prime loans&lt;ref name="FCIR-133"&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; leading up to the 2007-9 [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

===Credit default swap===
A '''credit default swap''' ('''CDS''') is a [[Swap (finance)|financial swap]] agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan [[Default (finance)|default]] (by the debtor) or other [[credit event]]. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults.&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt; It was invented by [[Blythe Masters]]  from [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|JP Morgan]] in 1994.
In the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the [[face value]] of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan.&lt;ref name="LBO CDS" /&gt;  However, anyone with sufficient collateral to trade with a bank or hedge fund can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct [[insurable interest]] in the loan (these are called "naked" CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a [[Credit default swap#Auctions|credit event auction]]; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/01/05/779501/why-do-they-exist |title=Credit event auctions: Why do they exist? |work= FT Alphaville |author = Lisa Pollack |date=January 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CDSs are documented using standard forms drafted by the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA), although there are many variants.&lt;ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/&gt;  In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are [[basket (finance)|basket]] default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (also called [[credit-linked note]]s), as well as loan-only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations and governments, the reference entity can include a [[special-purpose vehicle]] issuing [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]].&lt;ref name='Mengle Overview'&gt;{{cite journal |title= Credit Derivatives: An Overview |journal= Economic Review (FRB Atlanta) |date= 2007 |first=David |last=Mengle |volume= 92 |issue=4 |pages= |url= http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq407_mengle.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some claim that derivatives such as CDS are potentially dangerous in that they combine priority in bankruptcy with a lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt; A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.

===Forwards===
In finance, a '''forward contract''' or simply a '''forward''' is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;{{cite book|first1=John C. |last1=Hull |title=Options, Futures and Other Derivatives |edition=6th |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |year=2006 |isbn=978-0131499089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm "Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure"], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to a [[spot contract]], which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today.  The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a [[long position]], and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a [[short position]]. The price agreed upon is called the [[delivery price]], which is equal to the [[forward price]] at the time the contract is entered into.
The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the [[value date]] where the [[Security (finance)|securities]] themselves are exchanged.

The [[forward price]] of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the [[spot price]], which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the [[spot date]]. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the [[forward premium]] or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], or loss, by the purchasing party. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of [[speculation]], or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.

A closely related contract is a [[futures contract]]; they [[Futures contract#Futures versus forwards|differ in certain respects]]. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest:Forward Contract|Forward Contract on Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or "true-ups" in margin requirements like futures—such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}  In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain "trigger" events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually).

===Futures===
In [[finance]], a 'futures contract' (more colloquially, '''futures''') is a standardized [[contract]] between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the ''futures price'') with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the ''delivery date'', making it a derivative product (i.e. a financial product that is derived from an underlying asset). The contracts are negotiated at a [[futures exchange]], which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the "buyer" of the contract, is said to be "[[Long (finance)|long]]", and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the "seller" of the contract, is said to be "[[Short (finance)|short]]".

While the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the [[Futures contract#Margin|margin]]. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as "marking to market". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the [[spot price|spot value]] (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the "caller".

A closely related contract is a [[forward contract]]. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.
Unlike an [[option (finance)|option]], both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures [[position (finance)|position]] can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss..

===Mortgage-backed securities===
A '''mortgage-backed security''' ('''MBS''') is a [[asset-backed security]] that is secured by a [[mortgage]], or more commonly a collection ("pool") of sometimes hundreds of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that "[[securitization|securitizes]]", or packages, the loans together into a security that can be sold to investors.&lt;ref name="Securitization" /&gt;The mortgages of an MBS may be [[Residential mortgage-backed security|residential]] or [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial]], depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s like [[Fannie Mae]] or [[Freddie Mac]], or they can be "private-label", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as "pass-through", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 4 and 5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as [[tranche]]s (French for "slices"), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranches—especially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranches—of an MBS are/were often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Clark, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/mortgage-backed-security.htm "How can mortgage-backed securities bring down the U.S. economy?"], How Stuff Works&lt;/ref&gt; These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2006–2008
.
The total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and most other fixed-income securities, the [[Debt|principal]] in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS's "factor", the percentage of the original "face" that remains to be repaid.

===Options===
In [[finance]], an '''option''' is a contract which gives the ''buyer'' (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [[underlying]] asset or [[financial instrument|instrument]] at a specified [[strike price]] on or before a specified [[expiration (options)|date]]. The ''seller'' has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction—that is to sell or buy—if the buyer (owner) "exercises" the option. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy something at a certain price is a "[[call option]]"; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell something at a certain price is a "[[put option]]". Both are commonly traded, but for clarity, the call option is more frequently discussed.
Options valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance. In basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:
* The first part is the "intrinsic value", defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]] and the strike price of the given option.
* The second part is the "time value", which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multivariable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.

Although options valuation has been studied since the 19th century, the contemporary approach is based on the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was first published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title= Options pre-Black Scholes |url= http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Black |first= Fischer |first2= Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal =[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637–654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Options contracts have been known for many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, options were issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing house at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]. Today, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as [[derivative products]] or simply derivatives.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Swaps===
A '''swap''' is a derivative in which two [[counterparty|counterparties]] [[trade|exchange]] cash flows of one party's [[financial instrument]] for those of the other party's financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the benefits in question can be the periodic interest ([[Coupon (bond)|coupon]]) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to the exchange one stream of [[cash flow]]s against another stream. These streams are called the swap's "legs". The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are [[Accrual|accrued]] and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a [[floating interest rate]], [[foreign exchange rate]], equity price, or commodity price.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;

The cash flows are calculated over a [[notional principal amount]]. Contrary to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]], the notional amount is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].
Swaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.

Swaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th | last1=Ross |last2=Westerfield |last3=Jordan |year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding is more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, credit swaps, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s (there are many other types).

==Economic function of the derivative market==
Some of the salient economic functions of the derivative market include:
# Prices in a structured [[derivative market]] not only replicate the discernment of the market participants about the future but also lead the prices of [[underlying]] to the professed future level. On the expiration of the [[derivative contract]], the prices of derivatives congregate with the prices of the underlying.  Therefore, derivatives are essential tools to determine both current and future prices.
# The derivatives market reallocates risk from the people who prefer [[risk aversion]] to the people who have an appetite for risk.
# The intrinsic nature of derivatives market associates them to the underlying [[spot market]]. Due to derivatives there is a considerable increase in trade volumes of the underlying spot market. The dominant factor behind such an escalation is increased participation by additional players who would not have otherwise participated due to absence of any procedure to transfer risk.
# As supervision, reconnaissance of the activities of various participants becomes tremendously difficult in assorted markets; the establishment of an organized form of market becomes all the more imperative. Therefore, in the presence of an organized derivatives market, [[speculation]] can be controlled, resulting in a more meticulous environment.
# Third parties can use publicly available derivative prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts.&lt;ref name="CDS"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1632084 |author1=Michael Simkovic |author2=Benjamin Kaminetzky |title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution |publisher=Columbia Business Law Review, Vol. 2011, No. 1, p. 118, 2011 |date=August 29, 2010 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a nutshell, there is a substantial increase in savings and investment in the long run due to augmented activities by derivative [[market participant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Currency Derivatives: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market and arbitrage-free prices===
Two common measures of value are:
* [[Market price]], i.e. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract
* [[Arbitrage]]-free price, meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts (see ''[[rational pricing]]'')

===Determining the market price===
For exchange-traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.

===Determining the arbitrage-free price===
: ''See [[List of finance topics#Derivatives pricing|List of finance topics# Derivatives pricing]].''
The arbitrage-free price for a derivatives contract can be complex, and there are many different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of [[financial mathematics]]. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the cost of carry (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.

However, for options and more complex derivatives, pricing involves developing a complex pricing model: understanding the [[stochastic process]] of the price of the underlying asset is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical [[valuation of options]] is the [[Black–Scholes formula]], which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock [[Option (finance)|option]] can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the [[binomial options model]].

OTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price derivatives. Since these contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. Most of the model's results are input-dependent (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the pricing inputs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boumlouka |first=Makrem |year=2009 |title=Alternatives in OTC Pricing |work=Hedge Funds Review |date=Oct 30, 2009 |url=http://www.hedgefundsreview.com/hedge-funds-review/news/1560286/otc-pricing-deal-struck-fitch-solutions-pricing-partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, it is common that OTC derivatives are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).

==Criticisms==
Derivatives are often subject to the following criticisms:

=== Hidden tail risk ===
According to [[Raghuram Rajan]], a former chief economist of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), "...&amp;nbsp;it may well be that the managers of these firms [investment funds] have figured out the correlations between the various instruments they hold and believe they are hedged. Yet as Chan and others (2005) point out, the lessons of summer 1998 following the default on Russian government debt is that correlations that are zero or negative in normal times can turn overnight to one – a phenomenon they term "phase lock-in". A hedged position "can become unhedged at the worst times, inflicting substantial losses on those who mistakenly believe they are protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Risks===
{{See also|List of trading losses}}
The use of derivatives can result in large losses because of the use of [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], or borrowing. Derivatives allow [[investor]]s to earn large returns from small movements in the underlying asset's price. However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly. There have been several instances of massive losses in derivative markets, such as the following:

:* [[American International Group]] (AIG) lost more than US$18 billion through a subsidiary over the preceding three quarters on [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelleher |first=James B.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1837154020080918 |title="Buffett's Time Bomb Goes Off on Wall Street" by James B. Kelleher of Reuters |publisher=Reuters.com |date= September 18, 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve Bank]] announced the creation of a secured credit facility of up to US$85&amp;nbsp;billion, to prevent the company's collapse by enabling AIG to meet its obligations to deliver additional collateral to its credit default swap trading partners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html "Fed's $85 billion Loan Rescues Insurer"]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[2008 Société Générale trading loss|loss of US$7.2 Billion]] by [[Société Générale]] in January 2008 through mis-use of futures contracts.
:* The loss of US$6.4 billion in the failed fund [[Amaranth Advisors]], which was long natural gas in September 2006 when the price plummeted.
:* The loss of US$4.6 billion in the failed fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in 1998.
:* The loss of US$1.3 billion equivalent in oil derivatives in 1993 and 1994 by [[Metallgesellschaft AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Edwards | first = Franklin  | title = Derivatives Can Be Hazardous To Your Health: The Case of Metallgesellschaft | journal = Derivatives Quarterly | issue = Spring 1995 | pages = 8–17 | year = 1995 | url = http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/fedwards/papers/DerivativesCanBeHazardous.pdf | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

:*UBS AG, Switzerland's biggest bank, suffered a $2 billion loss through unauthorized trading discovered in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-15/ubs-loss-shows-banks-fail-to-learn-from-kerviel-leeson.html |title=UBS Loss Shows Banks Fail to Learn From Kerviel, Leeson |publisher=Businessweek |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This comes to a staggering $39.5 billion, the majority in the last decade after the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]] was passed.

===Counter party risk===
Some derivatives (especially swaps) expose investors to [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty risk]], or risk arising from the other party in a financial transaction.&lt;ref name="SimkovicSecret" /&gt; Different types of derivatives have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.

===Large notional value===
Derivatives typically have a '''large notional value'''. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses for which the investor would be unable to compensate. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis was pointed out by famed investor [[Warren Buffett]] in [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s 2002 annual report. Buffett called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator.[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)]

Under US law and the laws of most other developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions that make them a particularly attractive legal form to extend credit.&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1323190 |title=Michael Simkovic, Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008. |publisher=American Bankruptcy Law Journal, Vol. 83, p. 253 |year=2009 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties, in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency however, can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk. This can contribute to credit booms, and increase systemic risks.&lt;ref name=Secret /&gt; Indeed, the use of derivatives to conceal credit risk from third parties while protecting derivative counterparties contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 in the United States.&lt;ref name=Secret /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1738539 |author=Michael Simkovic |title=Bankruptcy Immunities, Transparency, and Capital Structure, Presentation at the World Bank |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1738539 |publisher=Ssrn.com |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of a 2010 examination of the [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE Trust]], an industry self-regulatory body, [[Gary Gensler]], the chairman of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] which regulates most derivatives, was quoted saying that the derivatives marketplace as it functions now "adds up to higher costs to all Americans". More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he also said. Additionally, the report said, "[t]he [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries', according to a department spokeswoman."&lt;ref&gt;Story, Louise, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?hp "A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives"], ''The New York Times'', December 11, 2010 (December 12, 2010, p. A1 NY ed.). Retrieved December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

For legislators and committees responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities has been a nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for "systemically significant" institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment.&lt;ref&gt;Zubrod, Luke (2011). The Atlantic. "Will the 'Cure' for Systemic Risk Kill the Economy?" https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/will-the-cure-for-systemic-risk-kill-the-economy/240600/&lt;/ref&gt;  
In this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as "systemically significant" whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.

Over-the-counter dealing will be less common as the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] comes into effect. The law mandated the clearing of certain swaps at registered exchanges and imposed various restrictions on derivatives. To implement Dodd-Frank, the [http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm CFTC developed new rules in at least 30 areas]. The Commission determines which swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and whether a derivatives exchange is eligible to clear a certain type of swap contract.

Nonetheless, the above and other challenges of the rule-making process have delayed full enactment of aspects of the legislation relating to derivatives. The challenges are further complicated by the necessity to orchestrate globalized financial reform among the nations that comprise the world's major financial markets, a primary responsibility of the [[Financial Stability Board]] whose progress is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Stability Board (2012).  "OTC Derivatives Market Reforms Third Progress Report on Implementation" June 15, 2012 http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120615.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., by February 2012 the combined effort of the SEC and CFTC had produced over 70 proposed and final derivatives rules.&lt;ref name="lexology1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Proskauer Rose LLP |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e7db9a60-9fca-449b-850b-b4a32d1e425d |title=SEC and CFTC oversight of derivatives: a status report |publisher=Lexology |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both of them had delayed adoption of a number of derivatives regulations because of the burden of other rulemaking, litigation and opposition to the rules, and many core definitions (such as the terms "swap", "security-based swap", "swap dealer", "security-based swap dealer", "major swap participant" and "major security-based swap participant") had still not been adopted.&lt;ref name="lexology1"/&gt;  SEC Chairman [[Mary Schapiro]] opined: "At the end of the day, it probably does not make sense to harmonize everything [between the SEC and CFTC rules] because some of these products are quite different and certainly the market structures are quite different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Younglai |first=Rachelle |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/06/19/idINIndia-40440620090619 |title=Interview – Not all SEC, CFTC rules must be harmonized |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released two final rules toward establishing a reporting and public disclosure framework for security-based swap transaction data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sec-swap-reporting-and-disclosure.pdf |title= First take: Ten key points from the SEC's swaps reporting and disclosure rules |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two rules are not completely harmonized with the requirements with CFTC requirements.

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev at G20 Pittsburgh summit-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Country leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]]]]
In November 2012, the SEC and regulators from Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Ontario, Quebec, Singapore, and Switzerland met to discuss reforming the OTC derivatives market, as had been agreed by leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]] in September 2009.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171486526 |title=Joint Press Statement of Leaders on Operating Principles and Areas of Exploration in the Regulation of the Cross-Border OTC Derivatives Market; 2012-251 |publisher=Sec.gov |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, they released a joint statement to the effect that they recognized that the market is a global one and "firmly support the adoption and enforcement of robust and consistent standards in and across jurisdictions", with the goals of mitigating risk, improving [[Transparency (market)|transparency]], protecting against [[market abuse]], preventing regulatory gaps, reducing the potential for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, and fostering a [[level playing field]] for market participants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; They also agreed on the need to reduce regulatory uncertainty and provide market participants with sufficient clarity on laws and regulations by avoiding, to the extent possible, the application of conflicting rules to the same entities and transactions, and minimizing the application of inconsistent and duplicative rules.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  At the same time, they noted that "complete harmonization – perfect alignment of rules across jurisdictions" would be difficult, because of jurisdictions' differences in law, policy, markets, implementation timing, and legislative and regulatory processes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

On December 20, 2013 the CFTC provided information on its swaps regulation "comparability" determinations. The release addressed the CFTC's cross-border compliance exceptions. Specifically it addressed which entity level and in some cases transaction-level requirements in six jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, and Switzerland) it found comparable to its own rules, thus permitting non-US swap dealers, major swap participants, and the foreign branches of US Swap Dealers and major swap participants in these jurisdictions to comply with local rules in lieu of Commission rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-dodd-frank-cftc-derivatives.pdf |title= Derivatives: A first take on cross-border comparability |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting===
Mandatory reporting regulations are being finalized in a number of countries, such as [[Dodd Frank Act]] in the US, the [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation]]s (EMIR) in Europe, as well as regulations in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Canada, and other countries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/suite/global_trade_repository_for_otc_derivs.php |title=DTCC's Global Trade Repository for OTC Derivatives ("GTR") |publisher=Dtcc.com |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OTC Derivatives Regulators Forum (ODRF), a group of over 40 worldwide regulators, provided trade repositories with a set of guidelines regarding data access to regulators, and the Financial Stability Board and CPSS [[IOSCO]] also made recommendations in with regard to reporting.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

[[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation|DTCC]], through its "Global Trade Repository" (GTR) service, manages global trade repositories for interest rates, and commodities, foreign exchange, credit, and equity derivatives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; It makes global trade reports to the CFTC in the U.S., and plans to do the same for ESMA in Europe and for regulators in Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  It covers cleared and uncleared OTC derivatives products, whether or not a trade is electronically processed or bespoke.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/12/derivatives-exposure-idUSL5N0BCHZ220130212 |title=U.S. DTCC says barriers hinder full derivatives picture |publisher=Reuters |date=February 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Release |first=Press |url=http://www.futuresmag.com/2010/08/05/derivatives-trades-will-be-tracked-by-depository-t |title=Derivatives trades will be tracked by Depository Trust |publisher=Futuresmag.com |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glossary==
* [[Bilateral netting]]: A legally enforceable arrangement between a bank and a counter-party that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual contracts. This means that a bank's obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.
* [[Counterparty]]: The legal and financial term for the other party in a financial transaction.
* [[Credit derivative]]: A contract that transfers [[credit risk]] from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as [[credit default swap]]s, credit linked notes and total return swaps.
* Derivative: A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards and various combinations thereof.
* [[Exchange-traded derivative contract]]s: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g., [[futures contract]]s and [[Option (finance)|options]]) that are transacted on an organized [[futures exchange]].
* Gross negative fair value: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank's counter-parties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counter-parties.
* Gross positive fair value: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counter-parties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counter-party collateral.
* High-risk mortgage securities: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, as determined by the U.S. [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.
* [[Notional amount]]: The nominal or [[face amount]] that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.
* [[over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized futures exchanges.
* [[Structured note]]s: Non-mortgage-backed [[debt securities]], whose cash flow characteristics depend on one or more indices and / or have embedded forwards or options.
* Total risk-based capital: The sum of [[Tier 1 capital|tier 1]] plus [[tier 2 capital]]. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, perpetual preferred shareholders equity with noncumulative dividends, [[retained earnings]], and [[minority interest]]s in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of [[subordinated debt]], intermediate-term [[preferred stock]], cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank's [[Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL)|allowance for loan and lease losses]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The '''dignity of labour''' is the philosophy that all types of [[Job (role)|jobs]] are respected equally, and no occupation is considered superior and none of the jobs should be discriminated on any basis . Though one's occupation for his or her livelihood involves physical work or mental labour, it is held that the job carries dignity compared to the jobs that involve more intellect than body. Social reformers such as [[Basava]] and his contemporary Sharanas, as well as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], were prominent advocates of the dignity of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suryanarayanan |first=A.

'''Engineering Economics''', previously known as '''engineering economy''', is a subset of [[economics]] concerned with the use and "...application of economic principles" &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the analysis of engineering decisions.&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as [[microeconomics]] in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Copied content from [[Microeconomics]]; see that page's history for attribution ...&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment.&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; But, it is also a simplified application of microeconomic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as [[statistics]], [[mathematics]] and [[cost accounting]]. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; 

[[Engineer]]s seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.
Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets''|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2193/mod_resource/content/0/LecturePresentation1.pdf|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. undergraduate [[civil engineering]] curricula, engineering economics is a required course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/civil/undergraduate Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering]. Retrieved 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topic on the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]ination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the [[Professional Engineering]] registration process.

Considering the [[time value of money]] is central to most engineering economic analyses.  [[Cash flow]]s are [[Discounting|''discounted'']] using an [[interest rate]], except in the most basic economic studies.

For each problem, there are usually many possible ''alternatives''. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the ''choice'', is the ''do nothing alternative''.  The ''opportunity cost'' of making one choice over another must also be considered.  There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed ''attributes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Economy'', 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

''Costs'' as well as ''revenues'' are considered, for each alternative, for an ''analysis period'' that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project.  The ''salvage value'' is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.

Some other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are [[inflation]], [[uncertainty]], replacements, [[depreciation]], [[resource depletion]], [[taxes]], [[tax credits]], [[accounting]], cost estimations, or [[Capital (economics)|capital financing]]. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of [[cost engineering]].

Since engineering is an important part of the [[manufacturing]] sector of the [[economy]], engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are:

* The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms;
* Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues;
* Engineering product markets and demand influences; and
* The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BE1v91Qlj64C&amp;dq=isbn:090632128X Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth &amp; Performance]'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd. Revised edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benefit–cost ratio]]

== Examples of Usage ==
Some examples of engineering economic problems range from value analysis to economic studies. Each of these is relevant in different situations, and most often used by engineers or project managers. For example, engineering economic analysis helps a company not only determine the difference between fixed and incremental costs of certain operations, but also calculates that cost, depending upon a number of variables. Further uses of engineering economics include:

* Value Analysis
* [[Linear programming|Linear Programming]]
* Critical Path Economy
* Interest and Money - Time Relationships
* Depreciation and Valuation
* Capital Budgeting
* Risk, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity Analysis
* Fixed, Incremental, and Sunk Costs
* Replacement Studies
* Minimum Cost Formulas
* Various Economic Studies in relation to both Public and Private Ventures

Each of the previous components of engineering economics is critical at certain junctures, depending on the situation, scale, and objective of the project at hand. Critical path economy, as an example, is necessary in most situations as it is the coordination and planning of material, labor, and capital movements in a specific project. The most critical of these "paths" are determined to be those that have affect upon the outcome both in time and cost. Therefore, the critical paths must be determined and closely monitored by engineers and managers alike. Engineering economics helps provide the Gantt charts and activity-event networks to ascertain the correct use of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;DeGarmo E., Canada J., Engineering Economy, fifth edition, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value Analysis ===
Proper value analysis finds its roots in the need for industrial engineers and managers to not only simplify and improve processes and systems, but also the logical simplification of the designs of those products and systems. Though not directly related to engineering economy, value analysis is nonetheless important, and allows engineers to properly manage new and existing systems/processes to make them more simple and save money and time. Further, value analysis helps combat common "roadblock excuses" that may trip up managers or engineers. Sayings such as "The customer wants it this way" are retorted by questions such as; has the customer been told of cheaper alternatives or methods? "If the product is changed, machines will be idle for lack of work" can be combated by; can management not find new and profitable uses for these machines? Questions like these are part of engineering economy, as they preface any real studies or analyses.  

=== Linear Programming ===
[[Linear programming]] is the use of mathematical methods to find optimized solutions, whether they be minimized or maximized in nature. This method uses a series of lines to create a polygon then to determine the largest, or smallest, point on that shape. Manufacturing operations often use linear programming to help mitigate costs and maximize profits or production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

=== Interest and Money - Time Relationships ===
Considering the prevalence of capital to be lent for a certain period of time, with the understanding that it will be returned to the investor, money-time relationships analyze the costs associated with these types of actions. Capital itself must be divided into two different categories, ''equity capital'' and ''debt capital''. Equity capital is money already at the disposal of the business, and mainly derived from profit, and therefore is not of much concern, as it has no owners that demand its return with interest. Debt capital does indeed have owners, and they require that its usage be returned with "profit", otherwise known as interest. The interest to be paid by the business is going to be an expense, while the capital lenders will take interest as a profit, which may confuse the situation. To add to this, each will change the income tax position of the participants. 

Interest and Money - Time Relationships comes into play when the capital required to complete a project must be either borrowed or derived from reserves. To borrow brings about the question of interest and value created by the completion of the project. While taking capital from reserves also denies its usage on other projects that may yield more results. [[Interest]] in the simplest terms is defined by the multiplication of the principle, the units of time, and the [[interest rate]]. The complexity of interest calculations, however, becomes much higher as factors such as compounding interest or [[Annuity|annuities]] come into play. 

=== Depreciation and Valuation ===
The fact that assets and material in the real world eventually wear down, and thence break, is a situation that must be accounted for. [[Depreciation]] itself is defined by the decreasing of value of any given asset, though some exceptions do exist. [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] can be considered the basis for depreciation in a basic sense, as any decrease in ''value'' would be based on an ''original value''. The idea and existence of depreciation becomes especially relevant to engineering and project management is the fact that capital equipment and assets used in operations will slowly decrease in worth, which will also coincide with an increase in the likelihood of machine failure. Hence the recording and calculation of depreciation is important for two major reasons. 

# To give an estimate of "recovery capital" that has been put back into the property.
# To enable depreciation to be charged against profits that, like other costs, can be used for income taxation purposes. 

Both of these reasons, however, cannot make up for the "fleeting" nature of depreciation, which make direct analysis somewhat difficult. To further add to the issues associated with depreciation, it must be broken down into three separate types, each having intricate calculations and implications. 

* Normal Depreciation, due to physical or functional losses.
* Price Depreciation, due to changes in market value.
* Depletion, due to the use of all available resources.

Calculation of depreciation also comes in a number of forms; ''straight line, declining balance, sum-of-the-year's,'' and ''service output''. The first method being perhaps the easiest to calculate, while the remaining have varying levels of difficulty and utility. Most situations faced by managers in regards to depreciation can be solved using any of these formulas, however, company policy or preference of individual may affect the choice of model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Capital Budgeting ===
[[Capital budgeting]], in relation to engineering economics, is the proper usage and utilization of capital to achieve project objectives. It can be fully defined by the statement; "... as the series of decisions by individuals and firms concerning how much and where resources will be obtained and expended to meet future objectives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition almost perfectly explains capital and its general relation to engineering, though some special cases may not lend themselves to such a concise explanation. The actual acquisition of that capital has many different routes, from equity to bonds to retained profits, each having unique strengths and weakness, especially when in relation to income taxation. Factors such as risk of capital loss, along with possible or expected returns must also be considered when capital budgeting is underway. For example, if a company has $20,000 to invest in a number of high, moderate, and low risk projects, the decision would depend upon how much risk the company is willing to take on, and if the returns offered by each category offset this perceived risk. Continuing with this example, if the high risk offered only 20% return, while the moderate offered 19% return, engineers and managers would most likely choose the moderate risk project, as its return is far more favorable for its category. The high risk project failed to offer proper returns to warrant its risk status. A more difficult decision may be between a moderate risk offering 15% while a low risk offering 11% return. The decision here would be much more subject to factors such as company policy, extra available capital, and possible investors. &lt;blockquote&gt;"In general, the firm should estimate the project opportunities, including investment requirements and prospective rates of return for each, expected to be available for the coming period. Then the available capital should be tentatively allocated to the most favorable projects. The lowest prospective rate of return within the capital available then becomes the minimum acceptable rate of return for analyses of any projects during that period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Economy|last=DeGarmo|first=E. Paul|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=209-210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Minimum Cost Formulas ===
Being one of the most important and integral operations in the engineering economic field is the minimization of cost in systems and processes. Time, resources, labor, and capital must all be minimized when placed into any system, so that revenue, product, and profit can be maximized. Hence, the general equation;

&lt;math&gt;C=ax +b/x+k&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is total cost, ''a b'' and ''k'' are constants, and ''x'' is the variable number of units produced.  

There are a great number of cost analysis formulas, each for particular situations and are warranted by the policies of the company in question, or the preferences of the engineer at hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Economic Studies, both Private and Public in Nature ===
Economic studies, which are much more common outside of engineering economics, are still used from time to time to determine feasibility and utility of certain projects. They do not, however, truly reflect the "common notion" of economic studies, which is fixated upon macroeconomics, something engineers have little interaction with. Therefore, the studies conducted in engineering economics are for specific companies and limited projects inside those companies. At most one may expect to find some feasibility studies done by private firms for the government or another business, but these again are in stark contrast to the overarching nature of true economic studies. Studies have a number of major steps that can be applied to almost every type of situation, those being as follows;

* Planning and Screening - Mainly reviewing objectives and issues that may be encountered.
* Reference to Standard Economic Studies - Consultation of standard forms.
* Estimating - Speculating as to the magnitude of costs and other variables.
* Reliability - The ability to properly estimate.
* Comparison between Actual and Projected Performance - Verify savings, review failures, to ensure that proposals were valid, and to add to future studies.
* Objectivity of the Analyst - To ensure the individual that advanced proposals or conducted analysis was not biased toward certain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ivana Marie Trump''' (''[[née]]'' '''Zelníčková'''; {{IPA-cs|ˈzɛlɲiːtʃkovaː|lang}}, born February 20, 1949) is a Czech former model and businesswoman, who was the first wife of [[Donald Trump]]. They married in 1977 and divorced in 1992. They have three children together, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump]], and [[Eric Trump]].

==Early life==
Ivana Zelníčková was born on February 20, 1949 in the [[Moravia]]n town of [[Zlín]] (formerly known as Gottwaldov), [[Czechoslovakia]], the daughter of Miloš Zelníček, who was [[Czech people|Czech]], and Marie Francová, who was [[Austrian people|Austrian]].&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;[http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a56426/ivana-trump-donald-trump-first-wife/ Prachi Gupta, "6 Things You Need to Know About Donald Trump's First Wife, Ivana"].

In this capacity Zelníčková was in [[New York City]] with a group of models in 1976 where she met [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt; They were married in 1977 in a lavish wedding officiated by [[Norman Vincent Peale]].&lt;ref&gt;MJ Lee: [http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/state/donald-trump-religion/ ''God and the Don.''] In: ''[[CNN.com]]'', June 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald and Ivana Trump became leading figures in New York society during the 1980s.

They had three children: [[Donald Trump Jr.]] (born December 31, 1977), [[Ivanka Trump]] (born October 30, 1981), and [[Eric Trump]] (born January 6, 1984). Donald Jr. learned to speak fluent Czech (with help of his maternal grandfather), while daughter Ivanka has only basic understanding of her mother's native tongue and Eric was not exposed to the language because at the time of his birth his grandparents were already comfortable enough in using English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ivana Trump Now Fashions Herself As Plaza's Innkeeper|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1989-05-14/features/2690591_1_trump-tower-skis-trump-castle/2|access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Did Their Father Really Know Best?|work=New York|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/10610/|access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; Ivana has nine grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corcoran|first1=Kieran|title=Dad for President!

In October 1990, Ivana Trump's 63-year-old father died suddenly from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

Lodge attended the [[Evans School for Boys]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]], [[Middlesex School]], [[Concord, Massachusetts]], Ecole de Droit, Paris, France, and [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]], Washington, D.C. In 1925, he graduated from [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of the [[Fox Club (Harvard)|Fox Club]]. In 1929, he graduated from [[Harvard Law School]]. In 1932, he was admitted to the New York [[bar (law)|bar]] and commenced practice in New York City.

==Acting career==
During the 1930s and after a brief career as a lawyer Lodge worked as an actor on screen and stage, appearing in starring roles in several notable productions, including some major Hollywood pictures.

Lodge was affiliated with the motion picture industry and the theater from 1933 to 1942, appearing in movies such as [[Little Women (1933 film)|''Little Women'']] and ''[[The Little Colonel (1935 film)|The Little Colonel]]'' in which he played [[Shirley Temple]]'s father. He was [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s co-star in  ''[[The Scarlet Empress]]''. Lodge appeared in several European-made films, in France and the United Kingdom, playing [[Bulldog Drummond]] in the 1937 film ''[[Bulldog Drummond at Bay (1937 film)|Bulldog Drummond at Bay]]''. A fluent French speaker, he performed his roles in French in [[Maurice Tourneur]]'s ''[[Koenigsmark (1935 film)|Koenigsmark]]'' (1935) and in [[Max Ophüls]]'s ''[[De Mayerling à Sarajevo]]'', in which he played the part of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] (1940). In 1941, after returning to the United States, he appeared in several Broadway stage productions, including [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Watch on the Rhine (play)|Watch on the Rhine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB title|id=1091|title=Watch on the Rhine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Lodge served in the [[United States Navy]] as a lieutenant and lieutenant commander from August 1942 to January 1946, and was a liaison officer between the French and American fleets. He was decorated with the rank of Chevalier in the [[French Legion of Honor]] and with the [[Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France)|Croix de Guerre 1939–1945]] with palm by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].  After the war he engaged in research work in economics. He retired from the United States Navy Reserve in 1966 with the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]].

==Political career==
Lodge was elected as a [[Republican (United States)|Republican]] from [[Connecticut's 4th congressional district]] to the [[80th United States Congress|80th]] and [[81st United States Congress|81st Congresses]], serving from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1951. He did not run for a third term in 1950, choosing instead to run for [[Governor of Connecticut]]. He ran against incumbent governor [[Chester Bowles]] and defeated him in what was described as a "bitter" election, in which Lodge sought to portray Bowles as an extreme left-winger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHESTER BOWLES IS DEAD AT 85; SERVED IN 4 ADMINISTRATIONS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/26/obituaries/chester-bowles-is-dead-at-85-served-in-4-administrations.html |first=Albin |last=Krebs |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lodge served as governor from January 1951 to January 1955; he was the first governor of Connecticut to serve after the state's rules were changed to have elections every four years instead of every two years.

He was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] from Connecticut in [[1952 Republican National Convention|1952]] and [[1960 Republican National Convention|1960]].

Lodge ran for re-election in 1954, but lost to Democrat [[Abraham Ribicoff]]. Local legend is that the proximate cause of Lodge's defeat was disenchantment on the part of [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] Republicans with the disruption caused by the construction of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]. The highway is now officially named the "Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/3954/ |title=Providence Journal: I-95 in Fairfield |format=uncredited blog entry |work=WestportNow.com |publisher=Westportnow Media, Inc. |date=April 23, 2003 |accessdate=February 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping down as governor, Lodge was appointed [[United States Ambassador to Spain]] by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], where he served from January 1955 until the end of Eisenhower's term in office in January 1961. Lodge was the national president of the non-profit organization [[Junior Achievement]], Inc. from 1963 to 1964.

Lodge ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 1964|1964 election]]. He won the Republican nomination, but lost to incumbent senator [[Thomas J. Dodd]], 35.34% to 64.66%. He served as chairman of the Committee [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1964–1969; delegate and assistant floor leader, Connecticut Constitutional Convention, in 1965; [[United States Ambassador to Argentina]], 1969 to 1974; and [[United States Ambassador to Switzerland]], 1983.

==Personal life==
He was married July 6, 1929, to actress and ballet dancer, [[Francesca Braggiotti]]; both of them appearing in the 1938 film ''Tonight at Eleven''. They had two daughters, Lily and Beatrice. [[Lily Lodge]] is the Director of the [http://www.actorsconservatory.org Actors Conservatory]. He was a resident of [[Westport, Connecticut]] until his death in New York City. He was interred in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jdlodge.htm|title=John Davis Lodge, Captain, United States Navy &amp; Member of Congress|first=Michael Robert|last=Patterson|website=www.arlingtoncemetery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after his death, the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] was renamed the Gov.

'''John Jay Jackson Jr.''' (August 4, 1824 &amp;ndash; September 2, 1907) was a [[United States federal judge]], first from [[Virginia]], and then from [[West Virginia]], at the time of its creation as a separate state.

==Early life and career==
Born in Parkersburg, Virginia (now [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Parkersburg-West-Virginia.html|title=Parkersburg, West Virginia |publisher=  City-Data.com|accessdate= June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1845, and [[read law]] to enter the Bar in Virginia in 1847. Jackson's father, General John Jay Jackson of [[Wood County, West Virginia|Wood County]], attended the [[Wheeling Convention]] on West Virginia statehood. Jackson's brother [[Jacob B. Jackson|Jacob Beeson Jackson]] served as governor of West Virginia and his other brother was Circuit Judge and Congressman [[James M. Jackson|James Monroe Jackson]]. He was a cousin of [[Stonewall Jackson]]. His grandfather, [[John G. Jackson (politician)|John George Jackson]], preceded him as judge of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia]]. His great-grandfathers included [[George Jackson (Virginia)|George Jackson]]. The [[Jackson Memorial Fountain]] at Parkersburg is dedicated to the Jackson family.&lt;ref name="dhr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/wood/84003686.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Jackson Memorial Fountain|date=January 1984|accessdate=2011-09-15 |author=Nimfa H. Simpson|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was in private practice in [[Wirt County, West Virginia|Wirt County, Virginia]] from 1847 to 1848, and a prosecuting attorney for Wirt County in 1848. He was a Commonwealth attorney of [[Ritchie County, West Virginia|Ritchie County, Virginia]] from 1849 to 1850, then returned to private practice in [[Wood County, West Virginia|Wood County, Virginia]] until 1851. He was a Member, of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] from 1851 to 1855, and then returned to private practice, in Parkersburg until 1861.

==Federal judicial service==
On July 26, 1861, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Jackson to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia]] vacated by [[John W. Brockenbrough]], who had resigned to join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government. Jackson was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on August 3, 1861, and received his commission the same day. At the time of Jackson's appointment, [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]] were still a single state. However, early in the course of the [[American Civil War]], the western portion of Virginia rejected Virginia's secession from the United States, and itself seceded from Virginia. This area largely coincided with the existing Western District of Virginia. [[West Virginia]] was thereafter admitted as a state on June 20, 1863, and on June 11, 1864, by 13 Stat. 124, the court for the Western District of Virginia became the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia. Those parts of the Western District that were not part of West Virginia were combined with the Eastern District to again form a single District of Virginia.&lt;ref name=fjcva&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/usdc_va_leg U.S. District Courts of Virginia, Legislative history], ''[[Federal Judicial Center]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1864, the only federal judge for Virginia was [[John Curtiss Underwood]]. There was no Western District of Virginia from 1864 until 1871, when [[Alexander Rives]] took the bench after the Western District was re-established following the War.

Jackson was reassigned by [[operation of law]] to the newly formed [[United States District Court for the District of West Virginia]]. Notwithstanding his status as a Republican appointee, Judge Jackson ruled in 1870 that West Virginia's ex-Confederates were eligible to vote under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], which had profound effects on the polity in West Virginia.

On July 1, 1901, the District of West Virginia was subdivided into the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia]] and the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia]]; Jackson was reassigned to the Northern District, until his retirement on March 15, 1905, at the age of 80. Because he had served from before the creation of the District of West Virginia until after its subdivision, Jackson was the only judge to ever sit on the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia. Having served for nearly forty-four years, including over forty years in the federal courts in West Virginia, Jackson was known as "the Iron Judge". He was the longest-serving judge appointed by Lincoln.

Jackson died in 1907, in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

'''John Ronan''' is an Irish businessman and property developer. Ronan began his education at [[Castleknock College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/boarding-school-for-boys-to-shut-doors-after-166-years-1.299928|title=Boarding school for boys to shut doors after 166 years|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to train as a Chartered Accountant with [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] and by his 20s was already involved in property deals with his father, who was also a developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/nominees-john-ronan-and-richard-barrett-1.1012378|title=Nominees: John Ronan and Richard Barrett|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/flash-brash-johnny-becomes-ronan-reborn-26754683.html|title=Flash, brash Johnny becomes 'Ronan reborn' - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronan teamed up with Richard Barret from Mayo to form [[Treasury Holdings]] in 1989. The company was one of the largest Irish commercial developers and known for landmark buildings on Dublin's skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/banking-inquiry/ronan-to-claim-battersea-sale-was-not-in-the-taxpayers-best-interest-31541790.html|title=Ronan to claim Battersea sale was not in the taxpayers' best interest - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury Holdings' first serious development was the Treasury Building on Grand Canal Street on Dublin’s southside.

The duo became a formidable force, running more than 50 projects in development including the [[Spencer Dock]] development, phase 2 of Central Park in [[Leopardstown]] and the development of 2,000 homes and an 11-acre public park near [[Foxrock]].

Among Treasury Holdings’ other high profile developments were the [[Google]] Headquarters, the [[Convention Centre Dublin]], the [[The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Ritz Carlton]] and the award winning residential tower Altro Vetro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/heres-johnny-ronan-returns-to-the-fray-with-a-300m-war-chest-31118721.html|title=Here's Johnny! Ronan returns to the fray with a €300m war chest - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention Centre Dublin was Ireland’s first purpose built international conference centre. It was developed as a public private partnership between Spencer Dock Development Company Ltd and the [[Office of Public Works]] (OPW). It opened in September 2010 and has since hosted numerous events including the European People’s Party Congress in 2014, which was attended by 17 heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/convention-centre-dublin-welcomes-new-ownership-1.2303295|title=Convention Centre Dublin welcomes new ownership|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Estate Opportunities, majority owned by Treasury Holdings, was responsible for building and agreeing with the sale of the Montevetro office building on Barrow Street in Dublin to Google for €99.9m in cash. It was Dublin's tallest commercial office building at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2011/0217/297780-reo/|title=REO to sell Montevetro building to Google|date=2011-02-17|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sligotoday.ie/details.php?id=35554|title=Sligo Today News for Sligo County  - Treasury Holdings 'to move out of NAMA within days'|last=Media|first=Dmac|website=www.sligotoday.ie|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Real Estate Opportunities (in which Treasury Holdings had a 60% stake) purchased [[Battersea Power Station]] and the surrounding land for €532 million (£400 million).&lt;ref name=landmark_sold&gt;{{cite news

It was subsequently sold to a Malaysian consortium led by [[SP Setia]], which had been in negotiations with Treasury Holdings prior to the Administration to buy the scheme. Setia hired the Treasury management team and have commenced building the Treasury scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/8926900/Administrators-lined-up-to-take-control-of-Battersea-Power-Station.html|title=Administrators lined up to take control of Battersea Power Station|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/power-to-the-people-a-last-lingering-look-at-battersea-before-the-cranes-move-in-8587948.html|title=Power to the people: a last lingering look at Battersea before the|date=2013-04-26|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 the High Court appointed liquidators to Treasury Holdings and 16 related companies. The move followed a decision by Treasury not to resist a winding-up application by one of its banks, KBC, over a debt of €55m. Treasury had debts of €2.7bn, €1.7bn of which was owed to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1009/340913-treasury-holdings-liquidators/ RTE News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnny Ronan retained substantial assets not in Treasury Holdings and in April 2015 these were refinanced in a €300 million deal with backing from [[Colony Capital]], [[M&amp;G Investments]], and Deutsche Bank. Ronan repaid his debts at par and exited NAMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/developer-johnny-ronan-exits-nama-with-backing-from-colony-and-m-g-1.2161537 | title=Developer Johnny Ronan exits Nama | work=Business | date=5 April 2015 | agency=The Irish Times | accessdate=5 April 2015 | author=O'Halloran, Barry | location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2015/0318/687963-developer-ronan-buys-back-treasury-building-loan/|title=Developer Ronan buys back Treasury Building loan|date=2015-03-18|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ronan-and-mckillen-in-control-of-namas-hq-office-31078882.html|title=Ronan and McKillen in control of Nama's HQ office - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/back-in-the-big-time-ronan-gets-to-work-on-600m-site-35096212.html|title=Back in the big time: Ronan gets to work on €600m site - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinancing for the deal was secured on RGRE’s portfolio of 24 assets in Dublin - including three Grafton Street retail properties, the Treasury Building, a number of other buildings in Dublin 2, Kilmore House in Spencer Dock, and Connaught House in Burlington Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/johnny-ronan-nama-exit-2025649-Apr2015/|title=He’s back!: Johnny Ronan, property and the Celtic Tiger|last=Duffy|first=Rónán|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/johnny-ronan-gets-go-ahead-for-200m-ballsbridge-build-424436.html|title=Johnny Ronan gets go-ahead for €200m Ballsbridge build|date=2016-10-06|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that had stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquired]].

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

 |publisher =Routledge

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

The '''Media-Analyse (ma)''' (''English'': '''Media Analysis (MA)''') by [[Media-Analyse AG]] (AGMA) is the largest annually conducted media analysis in [[Germany]] and the largest survey of media [[consumer behavior]] in Germany overall.  It examines the total population as well as its subgroups.  The survey occurs telephonically or with questionnaires given to a representative cross-section of the total population sample.

The yearly use of media is queried using dated surveys and daily routine studies.  Initially, only the [[German language|German-speaking]] population of Germany was questioned, limited to those living in private households which was the main place of residence, and limited to those at least 14 years old.  In 2008, the age limit was reduced to ten years old and [[European Union]] foreigners were incorporated. From 2010, “other foreigners” are also now questioned.  This includes approximately 50,000 young people and adults who are chosen by random selection according to the ADM sampling system.  They are subsequently questioned, some in person and some telephonically ([[Computer-assisted telephone interviewing|CATI]]).  In the process, the subgroups are described based on their demographic features such as age, sex, occupation, income, religion, and community size.

The results of the media analysis are issued on behalf of AGMA by its subsidiary Media Micro Census.  They have large practical relevance because they largely determine the booking behavior of the advertising industry.  The MA thus indirectly determines the price a media provider can charge for advertising.  It is hence regularly observed that some radio stations use a large part of their annual advertising budget during the survey period of the MA.

== MA Pressemedien ==
In ''MA Pressemedien'' (''English'': ''MA Press Media''), data is obtained on magazines, daily newspapers, supplements, city magazines, KONPRESS (denominational press; church newspapers), reading circles, and cinema.  ''MA 2006 Pressemedien II'', published on July 26, 2006, noted 170 magazines.  For this study, around 39,000 interviews were collectively carried out in two waves during a year (February 27, 2005 – February 4, 2006).  The MA 2007 Pressemedien I appeared in January 2007.

From the Second Wave MA 2004 (September 2003 – February 2004) on, some changes in the survey method were carried out, one of which was the launch of the Title Split Method (division of the approximately 180 titles submitted into three otherwise identical questionnaire versions) as well as (first only in approximately 10% of the interviews) the [[Computer-assisted self interviewing|CASI]] method.

Through the introduction of the title split models, the reach of the magazines increases over the two waves by an average of 7% - though with clear deviations for individual titles up or down.  A direct comparison of historical data is hence no longer justifiable because of methodological reasons.

As so-called “media currency”, the ''readers per issue (LpA)'' was established in the MA Pressemedien.  It shows how many readers an issue of a certain magazine or newspaper has.

== MA Radio ==
In ''MA Radio'', the radio consumption for individual stations is queried.  The MA Radio is conducted telephonically (the so-called CATI survey model), for which 58,011 people were questioned and appeared as ''MA 2006 Radio I'' on March 8, 2006.

As media currency, the so-called ''listeners per hour'' (for pre-determined hours) is reported as well as the ''average listeners per hour'' and the ''listeners per day''.

== MA Plakat ==
The first ''MA Plakat'' (''English'': ''MA Placard'') under the AGMA roof appeared on September 22, 2004.

On December 19, 2007 the MA 2007 Plakat was published.  The coverage method of the MA Plakat was completely revised in 2007.  The data is now based on a combined survey model, consisting of a CATI survey and a measurement method with a GPS receiver.

== Online Forschung AG (AGOF) ==
Since 2009, the collected ''Internet Facts'' of the ''Online Forschung AG (AGOF)'' (''English'': ''Online Research AG'') also fall under the methodological responsibility of the ''MA''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agma-mmc.de/files/PMma09Online_I.pdf Pressemitteilung der AG-MA (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223164524/http://www.agma-mmc.de/files/PMma09Online_I.pdf |date=2010-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGOF records internet usage behavior with the Three Pillar Model:
*First Pillar: Technical measurement (computer-level, units are individual visits and page views, obtained by [[IP Address]])
*Second Pillar: On-site surveys (Population is all internet users over 14 years old, reference to users in front of the computer, online questionnaires by pop-up window, query to place of use, time of use, sociodemographic data)
*Third Pillar: Phone surveys (CATI, population-level)

== MA Intermedia ==
In the fall of each year, ''MA Intermedia'' also appears, in which information for magazines, newspapers, TV, and radio is summarized.

== General queries ==
In addition to media use, sociodemographic characteristics, leisure time behavior, and shopping behavior are collected.  The questionnaire is largely identical to all MA studies (Press Media, Radio, Daily Newspaper).

== Licenses ==
The current data is only at the disposal of members of the ''Media-Analyse AG eV'' (publishing houses, radio stations, advertising agencies, advertisers, etc.).  However, one can create a free individual query, e.g. about advertising departments of the publishing houses.

== Publication ==
The Media-Analyse appears twice per year for Pressemedien and Radio, and once per year for Tageszeitungen (''English'': Daily Newspapers) and Plakat.  In [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], the MA Radio is expanded for local radio stations through the E.M.A. NRW, while in [[Bavaria]], it is expanded through the Radio Analysis.

The first ''Leser-Analyse'' (''English'': ''Reader Analysis'') appeared in 1954, and thus AGMA celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2004.

== Further analysis files ==
A whole series of further market and media studies of different providers are based on the MA-determined reach results, among them the TdW (Typologie der Wünsche (''English'': Typology of Desires) by Hubert Burda Media), VA (Verbraucher-Analyse (''English'': Consumer Analysis) by Axel Springer Publishers and Bauer Publishers), Communication Networks (Focus Magazine Publishers), MarkenProfile (''English'': BrandsProfile), VuMA, etc.

'''Nahum Manbar''' ({{lang-he|נחום מנבר}}, born April 18, 1946) is an [[Israel]]i businessman who was involved in arms trade with [[Iran]]. He was convicted in series of crimes against Israel's national security and served 14.5 years in prison, prior his release in October 2011.&lt;ref name="saban"&gt;{{Cite news |title = A-G: Manbar will be released early from prison |work= Jpost|accessdate= 2011-10-31|date= 2011-10-31 |url= http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=243833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Manbar was born in [[kibbutz]] [[Givat Haim]] in 1946. His parents were among the founders of the kibbutz. At age 16, he was in the reserve squad of the Israeli national basketball team. He served as an officer in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]] after being conscripted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). He also served as an instructor at the IDF Officers' College. Manbar fought in both the [[Six-Day War]], [[War of Attrition]], and [[Yom Kippur War]]. During the Yom Kippur War, he saved the life of Hanoch Saar, who would later serve on his defense team.&lt;ref name=bergman&gt;Bergman, Ronen: ''The Secret War with Iran: The Clandestine Struggle Against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After his military service, Manbar moved to [[Tel Aviv]] and opened up a series of businesses. His business ventures mostly ended with police investigations and indictments for crimes such as fraud, passing bad checks, and stealing checks from government employees. In 1984 he fled to the [[United Kingdom]] after being indicted for fraud, imposture, and theft, and was declared by Israel to be a fugitive from justice. He then began selling produce at the [[Covent Garden Market]] in [[London]], but soon left Britain and entered the arms trade. He set up weapons companies in [[Poland]] and [[France]]. During his career as an arms trader, he lived in France and [[Switzerland]] before settling in Poland and setting up his headquarters in [[Warsaw]]. Some of the weapons Manbar sold were purchased from the [[Polish Army]].&lt;ref name=bergman/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg1&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he became a sponsor of [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.]]&lt;ref name=guardia/&gt;

Manbar sold arms to [[Iran]], establishing contacts in the Iranian Defense Ministry. According to the charges at his trial, Manbar made contact through an Iranian mediator with Majed Abasbur, then the head of the Iranian chemical weapons development project.&lt;ref name=greenberg1/&gt; A deal was signed between Manbar's Mana Investments International company and Iran's section 105B, represented by Abashur. Manbar initially sold Iran a small number of shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. Through this deal, he became acquainted with Polish Defense Minister [[Florian Siwicki]]. Manbar later sold offensive weaponry such as [[T-54/55|T-55]] tanks purchased from the Polish military to Iran, explaining that "I would buy, say, T-55 tanks from the Polish army for $35,000 apiece, install some fire-control system I had bought from Israel for $20,000 apiece, and sell them to the Iranians for $200,000. The profits were fantastic".&lt;ref name=bergman/&gt;

Between 1992 and 1993, Manbar provided Iran with ingredients needed to make chemical weapons, equipment and expertise, and was paid $16 million by 1994 after providing elements of mustard gas and three types of nerve gas: [[Tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]], [[Sarin]] and [[Soman]], and set up a plant in Poland to manufacture chemical weaponry for Iran. He obtained the raw materials necessary to make chemical weapons that he sold to Iran from [[China]] and [[Hungary]]. He also provided Iran with information and know-how to produce mustard gas. The indictment stated that he had not reported to Israeli intelligence about his contacts until August 1992, despite several meetings with members of the security forces. Despite committing himself to stop his illegal activity, he continued to do so for over a year. Manbar, however, claims that he informed Israeli authorities of his activities, and that his arms sales to Iran were approved by the Israeli Defense Ministry.&lt;ref name="saban"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bergman/&gt; However, Manbar offered Israel information on military subjects, and also offered to use the high-level links he had with the Iranians to reveal the fate of [[Ron Arad (pilot)|Ron Arad]], exploiting [[Mossad]]'s desperation for any information on his fate. Manbar supplied the Mossad with a faked video and worthless leads.&lt;ref name=bergman/&gt; Manbar's activities, some of which were conducted in Britain, drew the attention of [[MI6]], which could not believe that an Israeli could be working so closely with Iran and concluded that Manbar was a Mossad agent trying to penetrate Iran's defense establishment.

Mossad began to investigate Manbar's dealings, and as part of the investigation , Mossad agents shadowed Abashur. On May 27, 1993, Manbar and Abashur met at the Marriott Hotel in [[Vienna]]. Abashur was tailed by two Mossad agents, and on his way there, he noticed he was being followed. When Abashur arrived, he told Manbar of the agents, and Manbar then confronted them and insinuated that he knew who they were, while Abashur, realizing that he had been discovered, left for an Iranian Embassy safe house. The two agents followed Abashur's car on a motorcycle, but due to heavy rain, they found it difficult to keep up with him, and as they emerged from an underpass, their motorcycle overturned. A car ran over the agents and killed them both. Their deaths reportedly increased the anger towards Manbar by the Israeli security services.&lt;ref name=kibbutznik&gt;{{Cite news

In 1997, Deputy Attorney-General for Security Affairs Dvorah Chen concluded that she could prosecute Manbar for harming the security of the state and aiding the enemy in war against Israel. Mossad officials managed to persuade a Polish businessman who served as his right-hand man to agree to testify against him. On March 27, 1997, Manbar arrived in Israel to watch Hapoel Jerusalem compete for the State Cup. Upon arrival, he was arrested by [[Shin Bet]] and the Serious Crimes Unit of the [[Israel Police]]. His detention was initially placed under a [[gag order]], and was cleared for publication several weeks later. In May he was indicted and his case was brought before the [[Israeli judicial system|Tel Aviv District Court]].&lt;ref name=greenberg2/&gt;

==Trial==
Manbar's trial began on 15 May. The trial was held behind closed doors, and much of the testimony was classified. His defense was based on the case that he did not act alone, and that Israeli businessmen were being allowed to sell weapons to Iran by the security authorities.&lt;ref name=bergman/&gt;

On July 16, 1998, he was unanimously convicted of collaboration with an enemy and providing information to an enemy. The court rejected his claims for lack of [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]] and established that he had known about Abbasfour's senior position. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He served his sentence at Nitzan Prison in [[Ramla]],&lt;ref name="saban"&gt;{{Cite news |last= Saban |first= Itzik |title= Israeli convicted of aiding Iran up for parole |work= Ynetnews |accessdate= 2008-03-08 |date= 2007-04-06 |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3408320,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later at HaSharon Prison at the Hadarim Interchange.

Manbar appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] but his appeal was denied on December 5, 2000. In 2007 applied a request for parole, having been described as a well-behaved prisoner.&lt;ref name="saban"/&gt; However, the Shin Bet and Mossad objected,&lt;ref name=luvitch&gt;{{Cite news|last= Luvitch|first= Vered|title= State against paroling Enemy of State|work= Ynetnews|accessdate= 2008-03-09|date= 2007-10-29|url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3465489,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2008 his request was denied by the Jerusalem District Court.&lt;ref name=yarkoni&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The trial was laden with controversy. Manbar's attorney, Amnon Zichroni, alleged that Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] had contacted the presiding judge in  the case, Amnon Straschnov, to lobby for a harsh sentence for Manbar.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zichroni further alleged that a female member of his defense team, attorney Pninat Yanai, passed along privileged information about Manbar to Straschnov—with whom, Zichroni claimed, she was having a sexual affair.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Yanai, who had been fired from her duties and was also a friend of Netanyahu's spokesman, denied those allegations as well.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

Ex-[[Mossad]] agent [[Victor Ostrovsky]] pointed out that Manbar was given a small pool of lawyers to choose from and that the trial was conducted behind closed doors. He also said Manbar had contacts in the Israeli security services and that several deals with Iran had been made in the past.&lt;ref name=ostrovsky&gt;{{Cite journal

Others also considered it a link in a chain of shady deals between Israel and Iran that goes back to the [[Iran-Contra affair]], and that he had taken the fall for the Israeli military and security industry.&lt;ref name=arabic&gt;{{Cite news

==Personal life==
In France, Manbar met a French woman, Francine. They married April 21. 1992 and had a son. 

Francine gave the Mossad information on her previous husband's dealings with the Condor Argentine Missile Program before her marriage.&lt;ref name=kibbutznik/&gt; On March 2. 2010 the couple obtained a divorce (Tel Aviv District Family Court DMC 13120-07). 

In 2003, while still in prison, Manbar was declared bankrupt, and appointed a [[Trustee in bankruptcy|trustee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/12/380/093/o03/12093380.o03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolae Malaxa''' ({{OldStyleDate|22 December|1884|10 December}} &amp;ndash; 1965) was a [[Romania]]n engineer and industrialist.

==Biography==
Born in a family of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origins in [[Huşi]], Malaxa studied engineering in [[Iaşi]] (at the [[University of Iaşi]]) and [[Karlsruhe]] (at the [[Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences|Polytechnic University]]). Late in his life, [[Petre Pandrea]], a Romanian intellectual who was for long a member of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] and later became a victim of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], wrote a memoir which, in part, dealt with Malaxa's biography, recording it with a dose of hostility. In it, he indicated that Malaxa's father died a young man, and that Nicolae was kept in university with money earned by his mother and sister.&lt;ref name=pandrea65&gt;Pandrea, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea, who called Malaxa "a mama's boy" and argued that this had shaped his character, also noted that, after graduation and contrary to his family's wishes, the engineer married a divorcée (who had been married to one of his early business partners).&lt;ref name=pandrea65/&gt; In time, he claimed, tensions grew between the two Malaxas, after the "[[Puritan]]" Nicolae came to resent his "frivolous" wife.&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaxa joined the [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways Company]] as a constructions engineer.&lt;ref name=pandrea65/&gt; Petre Pandrea implied that this went against procedure, and was the result of Nicolae Malaxa having befriended Chairman Alexandru Cottescu.&lt;ref name=pandrea65/&gt; The same source indicated that Malaxa continued to engage in business ventures, and that, upon the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], he was living in Iaşi and managing a grape-selling business.&lt;ref name=pandrea65/&gt; In 1918-1919, he quit his job at the Company and started a new business dealing with [[rolling stock]] maintenance &amp;mdash; the venture was instantly successful, a fact which Pandrea attributed to the infrastructure's decay under the previous occupation by the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Malaxa revitalized rail vehicles left into disrepair, which he sold back to the state at ten times the investment.&lt;ref name=pandrea66&gt;Pandrea, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Malaxa "parlayed a shoestring into a chain of arms factories and a partnership in Rumania's largest iron works".&lt;ref name=neworder&gt;"New Order", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', February 10, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s, the Malaxa factories were mass-producing [[steam locomotive]]s, [[diesel locomotives]], [[trainset]]s, rolling stock, steel [[piping|pipe]]s, and were one of the biggest industrial groups in [[Balkans|Southeastern Europe]], and the main provider of equipment for the Romanian Railways during the period. In several of his locomotive designs, Malaxa used innovative solutions (in locomotive design &amp;mdash; those developed in by [[George Constantinescu]] on the basis of his ''[[theory of sonics]]''; in factory design &amp;mdash; in collaboration with [[Horia Creangă]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anca Vlada, "Nicolae Malaxa, un industriaş vizionar" ("Nicolae Malaxa, a Visionary Industrialist"), in ''[[Curierul Naţional]]'', August 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Owning much of Romania's steel industry through his strong presence in [[Reşiţa]],&lt;ref name=jordanpopfr&gt;Nicole Jordan, ''The Popular Front and Central Europe: The Dilemmas of French Impotence, 1918-1940'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1992, p. 127, {{ISBN|0-521-52242-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he was chairman of the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s Romanian section, and arguably the richest man in Romania at the time.&lt;ref name=permahome&gt;"Malaxa Wins Permanent Home in U.S.", in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 9, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaxa was close to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Together with [[Aristide Blank]] and [[Max Auschnitt]], he was one of the major businessmen present in the king's ''[[Camarilla (history)|camarilla]]'' (''see [[National Renaissance Front]]'');&lt;ref name=neworder/&gt;&lt;ref name=godmaj&gt;"«God Help Your Majesty»", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 16, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pandrea6667"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; such political connections also implied that his success was partly ensured by preferential deals agreed with the state, and in some cases by the placement of inferior products on a [[captive market]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pandrea, Malaxa had made a habit of manipulating state officials into granting him preferential credits, which explained his interest in supporting Carol's moves.&lt;ref name=pandrea66/&gt; Reportedly, Malaxa and his wife were especially close to the king's mistress, [[Elena Lupescu]], and even became related through marriage (after Lupescu's nephew, an engineer, married the niece of Malaxa's wife).&lt;ref name=pandrea6667&gt;Pandrea, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1939, Carol's son [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]] was rumored to be in a relationship with Lulu Malaxa (Nicolae's daughter).&lt;ref name=godmaj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Carol Lunches with Michael's Girlfriend, Pretty Commoner", in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 1, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Petre Pandrea also alleged that, soon after turning 17, the virgin Lulu had been raped by Carol on board his ''Luceafărul'' [[yacht]] &amp;mdash; before her father decided to intervene, remove her from the circle of friends, and send her to study in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=pandrea6667/&gt; Pandrea also claimed that this was the origin of the notorious conflict between the engineer and Auschnitt, alleging that the latter's wife, was Carol's third mistress and resented Lulu's apparent success.&lt;ref name=pandrea66/&gt; He also claimed that Elena Lupescu was cheating on the king with his secretary [[Ernest Urdăreanu]], who was also an important figure of the ''camarilla'' and who kept close contacts with the Malaxas.&lt;ref name=pandrea66/&gt;

Unlike most other large industries in the country, Malaxa's was not tied to [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] or [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] interests.&lt;ref name=jordanpopfr/&gt; Instead, Nicolae Malaxa maintained business links with [[Nazi Germany]] as early as 1935.&lt;ref name=jordanpopfr/&gt; At a time when Nazi Germany was gaining more influence in Romania, Nicolae Malaxa collaborated with [[Hermann Göring]] in confiscating the assets of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] Auschnitt (who had been arrested and prosecuted on false charges in September 1939),&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 267, 278.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently placed his industrial empire in the service of the ''[[Reichswerke Hermann Göring|Reichswerke]]'' during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=permahome/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nazis Get Steel Works", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 22, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after Carol fell from power in 1940, Malaxa was briefly imprisoned on charges that he had resorted to [[extortion]] in previous years.&lt;ref name=godmaj/&gt; Probably sympathizing with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology, he had financed the activities of the Romanian [[far right]] [[Iron Guard]] organization as early as the mid-1930s,&lt;ref name=neworder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially throughout the [[National Legionary State]] the latter established.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Rebellion and Pogrom]] it provoked in January 1941, the Guard made use of arms manufactured by Malaxa, as well of his house (turned into a citadel and attacked by the [[Romanian Army]])&lt;ref name=neworder/&gt;&lt;ref name=triesarms&gt;"Rumania Tries Arms Maker in Guard Revolt", in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 29, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; he was consequently put on trial by [[Ion Antonescu]]'s government.&lt;ref name=triesarms/&gt;

In February 1945, several months after the [[King Michael Coup]] which toppled Antonescu, and following the start of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], his Bucharest factories were at the center of mysterious and violent events.&lt;ref name=cramptoneeur20&gt;R. J. Crampton, ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century'', [[Routledge]], London, 1994, p. 229, {{ISBN|0-415-05346-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, independent [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Nicolae Rădescu]] had come into conflict with the rising [[Romanian Communist Party]], and his frequent speeches to his supporters were disrupted by organized workers.&lt;ref name=cramptoneeur20/&gt; This occurred in Malaxa's plant, and the incident ended with shots being fired and several people killed.&lt;ref name=cramptoneeur20/&gt; The Communist Party claimed that they had been targeted by the Army, acting on orders from Rădescu, despite the fact that bullets recovered from the bodies were not of the kind used by the military.&lt;ref name=cramptoneeur20/&gt; Aggravated by another of Rădescu's addresses, in which he deemed Communists "foreigners without God or a nation", the crisis ended with the appointment of a new cabinet endorsed by the Communist Party and the [[Soviet Union]] and presided by [[Ploughmen's Front]] leader [[Petru Groza]].&lt;ref name=cramptoneeur20/&gt;

Malaxa used his opportunity to flee after being sent on an economic mission by King Michael, and settled in [[New York City]], where his family joined him after being expelled by the Groza government.&lt;ref name=permahome/&gt; Malaxa and his son Constantin (1922&amp;ndash;1999) had their Romanian citizenship revoked in by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;"Rumanians Lose Citizenship", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 6, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year, he met with the ousted Nicolae Rădescu, and financed him money to start issuing an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] magazine titled ''Luceafărul'' (of which philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] was editor).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Autobiography'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 1990, p. 126, {{ISBN|0-226-20411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside accusations involving his endorsement of the Iron Guard, it was alleged that he had been collaborating with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] during his last years in Romania. In 1955, while Malaxa was visiting [[Argentina]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] briefly revoked his reentry permit.&lt;ref&gt;"Romania's 'Ford' Wins Conditional Reentry to U.S.", in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 17, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Both charges were again voiced by [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] politicians during [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|1962 electoral campaign]] for [[Governor of California|Governor]] in [[California]], after focus was placed on the friendship and business connections between Nixon and Malaxa.&lt;ref&gt;"Nixon Is Accused of Aid to Ex-Nazi", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 7, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; A government investigation dismissed the accusations,&lt;ref name=nixmallink&gt;"Nixon-Malaxa Link Denied by Attorney", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; but, in 1979, his pro-Nazi past was again investigated by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (which claimed that high-ranking American officials close to Malaxa had been involved in a cover-up).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], "Nixon Helped Rich Nazi Stay in U.S.", in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 16, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspicions regarding Malaxa's alleged [[communism]], dismissed early in the era of [[McCarthyism]] by Rădescu,&lt;ref&gt;"Malaxa Record Cited", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; were investigated in 1958 by the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims|United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration]], and centered on rich gifts he had sent to Communist leaders such as [[Ana Pauker]] &amp;mdash; Malaxa defended himself by arguing that these had been sent in order to ensure his family's safe passage into America.&lt;ref name=permahome/&gt;

Having apparently never applied for American citizenship,&lt;ref name="nixmallink"/&gt; Malaxa died at his residence in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=permahome/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">'''Operational continuity''' refers to the ability of a system to continue working despite damages, losses or critical events. In the Human Resources and Organizational domain, including IT, it implies the need to determine the level of [[Resilience_(organizational)|resilience]] of the system, its ability to recover after an event, and build a system that resists to external and internal events or is able to recover after an event without losing its external [[performance management]] capability. Organizational Continuity is achieved only with specific corporate planning.&lt;ref&gt;Argenti, John (1974). Systematic Corporate Planning. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the material domain, it determines the need to adopt redundant systems, performance monitoring systems, and can even imply the practice to cannibalize or to remove serviceable assemblies, sub-assemblies or components from a repairable or serviceable item of equipment in order to install them on another, in order to keep the external system performance active.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
Operational continuity may be referred to single systems, single individuals, up to teams or entire complex systems such as IT infrastructures, implying the ability of an organization or system to continue to provide its mission.

'''Patrick Hally''' (1866 – 21 July 1938) was a Catholic bootmaker turned politician in [[Dunedin]] at the turn of the twentieth century. He was one of the three original conciliation commissioners appointed under the [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894|Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]] in 1909.

==Early life==
Hally was born in 1866 in Dunedin, the eldest son of John Hally. He was educated locally at the Christian Brothers' School before leaving to start an apprenticeship in the boot making trade. In 1891 he established his own shoemaking business in [[George Street, Dunedin]].&lt;ref name="McKee" &gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d2-d8.html |title=[[The Cyclopedia of New Zealand]] |last= | first= |chapter=Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts |publisher= | editor-first= Arthur |editor-last= McKee |editor-link=Arthur McKee |accessdate=29 February 2016 |year=1905 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Hally was involved in local politics much of his life. He was a Labour movement sympathiser, and in 1899 became the president of the New Zealand Federal Tailoresses' Union and later was a [[Dunedin City Council]]lor, elected to represent the Bell Ward in 1902.&lt;ref name="McKee" /&gt; He was a prominent member of the union-based Workers' Political Committee, an [[Otago]]-based organisation tasked with choosing political candidates to represent workers politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Boyd| first = Judi| last2 = Olssen| first2 = Erik| date = 1988| title = The Skilled Workers: Journeymen and Masters in Caversham, 1880-1914| url = http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/docs/1988/NZJH_22_2_03.pdf| journal = New Zealand Journal of History| publisher = Auckland University Press| volume = 22| issue = 2| pages = 129| access-date= 29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hally was also a member of the Dunedin Catholic Literary Society.

In 1901 Hally contested the [[Caversham by-election, 1901|Caversham by-election]] under a Labour banner. In a six-way contest he came third with a respectable 1,120 votes (nearly a quarter of the total vote) losing to the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]]'s candidate [[Thomas Sidey]].&lt;ref name="The Caversham By-election"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Caversham By-election |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MEX19011220.2.18 |accessdate=2 January 2016 | work=[[The Marlborough Express]] | volume=XXXV | issue=295 |date=20 December 1901 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Election Notices |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=ESD19011212.2.44.5 |accessdate=7 January 2016 |work=[[Evening Star (Dunedin)|Evening Star]] |issue=11729 |date=12 December 1901 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hally was one of the three original conciliation commissioners appointed under the [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894|Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]] introduced in 1908. He was appointed in 1909 and served alongside T. Harle Giles and James Richard Triggs.&lt;ref name="Herald obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Long service |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19380722.2.125 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXXV |issue=23096 |date=22 July 1938 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House and stables, 42 Innes Road, Christchurch |url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Photos/disc3/IMG0012.asp |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]] |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hally was a commissioner until 1916, and again from 1922 until 13 September 1936.&lt;ref name="Herald obit" /&gt;

==Family and death==
Hally's first wife died in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deaths |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT19070218.2.32 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |issue=13830 |date=18 February 1907 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married a second time. He lost a son in [[World War I]]. In 1936, Hally retired for health reasons. After having been ill for several weeks, he died in Auckland on 21 July 1938. He was survived by his wife and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP19380722.2.122 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXXIV |issue=22460 |date=22 July 1938 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piet Klijnveld (1874-1945).jpg|thumb|Piet Klijnveld (1874-1945)]]
'''Pieter 'Piet' Klijnveld''' (16 August 1874 – 9 February 1945)&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org/ Genealogical data from Familysearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] accountant who started a practice that after several mergers would grow into the international accounting firm [[KPMG]].

== Life and career ==
Pieter Klijnveld was born on 16 August 1874 in [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands. He was the son of Pieter Klijnveld Sr. and Maria Christina Klijnveld. He married Cristina Johanna Royaards on 2 August 1906 in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;

After working at the Amsterdam office of the Twentsche Bank (a precursor of [[ABN Amro]]), he opened a small accountancy practice in 1917 in his home on the Viottastraat. It would take a few years before a second office was in use on the Tesselschadestraat. Amsterdam was a bustling trade and investment hub for European and Asian industrialists.  Many foreign enterprises, including royalty, governments, and even the [[Bank of England]], traded extensively in the Netherlands at the time, making it an active market for financiers as well as importers and exporters of virtually everything.

Klijnveld became the chief accountant to many of these emerging businesses.  To meet the demands of his growing client roster, he teamed up with a local tax firm called Meijburg &amp; Company.  One of these accountants was Jaap Kraayenhof, who joined Klynveld and eventually become senior partner of the Dutch firm "Klijnveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co.", abroad usually written as [[Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Co.]] (KKC).

Klijnveld died just before the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945 and his wife died in September 1947. They had an art collection that included amongst others works by [[Piet Mondriaan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glerum.nl/catalogus.php?id=151&amp;lang=en Auctioneer information]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Specializing in banking and exporting, KKC kept its name and independence by serving Dutch clients who were expanding throughout Europe and South America.  In 1979, Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) was formed with the merger of Klynveld Kraayenhof &amp; Company, Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft (DTG), and McLintock Main Lafrentz to create a strong European-based international firm.

In 1987, KMG and Peat Marwick International (PMI) combined in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms forming [[KPMG]].

'''Pioneer Plaza''' is a large public [[park]] located in the [[Convention Center District, Dallas, Texas|Convention Center District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]). It contains a large sculpture and is a heavily visited tourist site. Adjacent to the plaza is the [[Pioneer Park Cemetery]] which features the [[Confederate War Memorial (Dallas, Texas)|Confederate War Memorial]]. Together, it is the largest public open space in the Dallas central business district.
[[File:6666 Ranch larger photo.png|thumb|Historic brands from Texas ranches are depicted in the sidewalk on the west side, this one from the [[6666 Ranch]].]]

==History==
The land on which the plaza sits, once railroad and warehouse property, was cleared for the {{convert|900|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall hotel and office Dallas Tower which was part of the failed Griffin Square development. The plaza and its accompanying sculpture were the idea of real estate developer [[Trammell Crow]], who wanted an iconic "Western" sculpture in the city of Dallas and assembled a group to donate the sculptures. The $9 million project was begun in 1992 on {{convert|4.2|acre|m2}} of land donated by the City of Dallas; $4.8 million of the cost came from private funds raised from individuals and local businesses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.texastreesfoundation.org/about.html Texas Trees Foundation, retrieved 01-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; Local artists sued to stop the project and claimed that it was historically inaccurate for the city, but the project opened on time in 1994&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/17/us/dallas-casts-new-image-in-bronze-as-a-cow-town.html?pagewanted=all New York Times, "Dallas Casts New Image, In Bronze, as a Cow Town", 01-17-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the park is maintained by the adjacent [[Dallas Convention Center]] and is the second most visited tourist attraction in downtown Dallas. As a work in progress, an additional steer is occasionally added to the herd.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Sculpture==
The large sculpture commemorates nineteenth century cattle drives that took place along the [[Texas Road|Shawnee Trail]], the earliest and easternmost route by which Texas longhorn cattle were taken to northern railheads. The trail passed through [[Austin]], [[Waco]], and Dallas until the [[Chisolm Trail]] siphoned off most of the traffic in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ays02 Handbook of Texas Online, "Shawnee Trail", retrieved 01-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; The 49 bronze steers and 3 trail riders [[sculptures]] were created by artist [[Robert Summers (artist)|Robert Summers]] of [[Glen Rose, Texas]]. Each steer is larger-than-life at six feet high; all together the sculpture is the largest bronze monument of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Set along an artificial ridge and past a man-made limestone cliff, native landscaping with a flowing stream and waterfall help create the dramatic effect.

'''Ralph Kimball''' (born 1944) is an author on the subject of [[data warehousing]] and [[business intelligence]]. He is one of the original architects of [[data warehousing]] and is known for long-term convictions that data warehouses must be designed to be understandable and fast. 
His methodology, also known as [[dimensional modeling]] or the Kimball methodology, has become the de facto standard in the area of [[decision support]].

He is the principal author of the best-selling&lt;ref name="2012-09-28_Informatica" /&gt; books ''The Data Warehouse Toolkit'',&lt;ref name="Whitehorn_2010-03-09_CW" /&gt; ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', ''The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit'' and ''The Kimball Group Reader'', published by Wiley and Sons.

==Career==
After receiving a Ph.D.&lt;ref name="2012-09-28_Informatica" /&gt; in 1973 from [[Stanford University]] in electrical engineering (specializing in man-machine systems), Ralph joined the [[PARC (company)|Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC). At PARC Ralph was a principal designer of the [[Xerox Star]] Workstation, the first commercial product to use mice, icons and windows.

Kimball then became vice president of applications at Metaphor Computer Systems, a [[decision support system|decision support software]] and services provider. He developed the Capsule Facility in 1982. The Capsule was a graphical programming technique which connected icons together in a logical flow, allowing a very visual style of programming for non-programmers. The Capsule was used to build reporting and analysis applications at Metaphor.

Kimball founded Red Brick Systems in 1986, serving as CEO until 1992. Red Brick Systems was acquired by Informix, which is now owned by [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="2015-12-11_IBM" /&gt; Red Brick was known for its [[relational database]] optimized for data warehousing. Their claim to fame was the use of bit-map [[Index (database)|Indexes]] in order to achieve performance gains that amounted to almost 10 times that of other Database vendors at that time.

Ralph Kimball Associates incorporated in 1992 to provide data warehouse consulting and education.

The Kimball Group, founded by Kimball,&lt;ref name="2012-09-28_Informatica" /&gt; formalized existing long-term relationships between Ralph Kimball Associates, DecisionWorks Consulting, and InfoDynamics LLC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">A '''Review Body''' in the United Kingdom is a government mechanism to replace [[collective bargaining]] for certain groups of employees in the [[public sector]], for example doctors and nurses in the [[National Health Service]]. A Review Body makes independent recommendations on pay after considering evidence from the relevant parties (typically government, employers and unions), with cherished expectations that the Government will honour those recommendations and the unions will not pursue national [[industrial action]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources include: Williams and Adams-Smith, "Contemporary Employment Relations", chapter 9, Oxford University Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Review Body system started in 1971 for doctors and dentists. There are currently six Review Bodies which together cover approximately 26% of the total 5.8 million employed in the UK public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Public Sector Employment Trends 2005, Office for National Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Senior Salaries Review Body]] (covering 6,000 personnel)&lt;ref&gt;SSRB 28th Report 2006, pages 7, 27 &amp; 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Review Body is established as a [[non-departmental public body]] (NDPB) that is sponsored by the relevant department of the UK Government (e.g. the Armed Forces Pay Review Body is sponsored by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]). However, the review bodies do have their own secretariat provided by the Government in the [[Office of Manpower Economics]]. 

The existence of a Review Body does not necessarily block the practice of collective bargaining, but its recommendations are required before a negotiated bargain is implemented. A major harmonisation of NHS pay structure, the [[Agenda for Change]], was provisionally agreed in 2003 by unions representing nurses and other health professions in the NHS, unions representing NHS staff not covered by a Review Body (e.g. office staff), NHS employers and government ''before'' the Nursing and Other Health Professions Review Body considered the issue: it recommended in favour of implementing the negotiated agreement.

'''Richard Davoud Donchian''' (born September 1905, [[Hartford, Connecticut]] – d. 1993) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-American [[commodity market|commodities]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] [[trader (finance)|trader]],  and pioneer in the field of [[managed futures]].

The first publicly managed futures fund, ''Futures, Inc.'', was started in 1949 by Richard Donchian. He also developed the [[Trend following|trend timing]] method of futures investing and introduced the [[mutual fund]] concept to the field of [[Investment management|money management]].

Richard Donchian is considered to be the creator of the managed futures industry and is credited with developing a systematic approach to futures money management. His professional trading career was dedicated to advancing a more conservative approach to futures trading.

==Biography==
Richard's parents were Armenian immigrants from [[Western Armenia]] which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] back in the 1880s and had come to settle in the USA. As a young man Richard went to school in Connecticut, later graduating from [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[Economics]]. He later receives his MBA from [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. Richard's first taste of the job market was as an assistant in his family’s [[Oriental rug]] business.

During this time Richard came across the fictionalized [[biography]] of stock market whiz [[Jesse Lauriston Livermore|Jesse Livermore]] titled ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'', After reading this book Richard became so fascinated that his interest turned to studying the financial markets. During the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|market crash of 1929]] he lost some money. This experience led him to study [[technical analysis]] and become a student of price history alone and for its own sake.

Richard began his [[Wall Street]] career in the 1930s. He published a very popular stock market service called ''Security Pilot'' which he sold to [[brokerage firm|brokerage houses]]. During the summer of 1933 he became an account executive and [[Securities research|securities analyst]] with ''Hemphill, Noyes and Co'', while still working as the Vice President of the ''Samuel Rug Company''.

World War II would take Richard into the US military and participation in the invasion of Sicily.  He was later promoted to Air Force statistical officer. After the War he became a private investment adviser and securities analyst. Richard was self-employed until 1960. In 1948 he changed his focus from securities analysis to active trading and developing his rule based technical system. He established the trading firm ''Futures, Inc.'', which was then one of the first publicly held commodity funds.

Richard developed a rule based trading approach which became known as [[Trend following]]. It is based on the assumption that commodity prices moved in long, sustained moves. Richard developed and used a trading system that incorporated ''Trading rules'', ''Trading guidelines'', and his ''weekly rule system'' based on [[Moving average (technical analysis)|moving averages]]. He wrote many articles on futures trading and securities and became known as ''the father of trend following''.

In 1960 Richard was appointed Director of Commodity Research with [[Hayden Stone]] where he commenced writing a weekly newsletter, Commodity Trend Timing, based on his 5-20 moving average method. His newsletter was very popular, reaching a weekly circulation of some 10,000 copies during the 19 years he wrote it. Richard wrote numerous articles which are considered industry classics, including ''Trend Following Methods in Commodity Price Analysis''.  Richard would remain with [[Hayden Stone]]'s various successors, including [[Shearson/American Express]], and later joined ''[[Shearson Lehman Brothers]]'', eventually becoming Vice President of the firm.

During his career he was a member of several exchanges, such as the ''New York Cotton Exchange'', and several professional market associations, such as the New York Society of Security Analysts.

Many modern trend following systems, such as the ''Turtle Trading system'', are based on his work. The '''Richard Davoud Donchian Foundation''' was established after his death in April 1993; its aim is to make improvements in Children's Health and to help its ultimate recipients become empowered to strengthen and build up their families and communities — passing onto others that which was given to them.

He served in several key posts including Consul-General in New York (1929–30), Delegate to the [[League of Nations]] (1930–32),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gaigokai.or.jp/attachment/kaiho/kaiho119_1.pdf|title=国際人の育成－初代学長･澤田節蔵について|last=Hashimoto|first=Fumio|date=|website=gaigokai.or.jp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonsea.de/pub/person/13033|title=LONSEA - League of Nations Search Engine|website=www.lonsea.de|language=de|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ambassador to Brazil (1934–38). As a pacifist, he opposed Japan's 1933 withdrawal from the League of Nations, and as a Roman Catholic, he made appeals to the Vatican in order to put an early end to [[World War II]]. He served as an advisor to the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Kantarō Suzuki|Kantaro Suzuki]] late in the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the wake of the war he was regarded, along with fellow veteran diplomat [[Naotake Satō|Naotake Sato]], as one of the remaining elder statesmen of his generation. He established [[Nippon Cultural Broadcasting]] and served as its chairman. He served as the first president of the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] from 1949 to 1955.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of his brothers served as Permanent Representative to the United Nations and was married to social worker [[Miki Sawada]], while another brother was an industrialist.

'''''Squawk Box''''' is a business news [[television program]] that airs at breakfast time on the [[CNBC]] network. The program is currently co-hosted by [[Joe Kernen]], [[Rebecca Quick|Becky Quick]], and [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in [[Investment banking|investment banks]] and stock [[broker]]ages for a [[Squawk box|permanent voice circuit]] or [[intercom]] used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a [[peacock]], which is the logo of CNBC.

|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''
|accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Squawk Box'' features early-morning analysis of and [[breaking news]] from the [[financial market]]s, along with considerable banter between the hosts and their guests – original host [[Mark Haines]] stressed the need to "inject a little fun" into business news in the early morning.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Another distinctive and long-running feature of the show has been its use of daily "guest hosts" – figures from the world of business and [[politics]] who join the team for much of the broadcast, questioning guests as well as offering their own opinions.

Regular contributors to the show include [[Sharon Epperson]] ([[NYMEX]]), [[Rick Santelli]] (Chicago), [[Steve Liesman]], [[Guy Adami]] and CNBC senior analyst [[Ron Insana]].

Meteorologists from [[The Weather Channel]] contribute to the "Business Travel Forecast" segments.

==History==
''Squawk Box''’s core on-air team remained intact for many years – the program was originally presented by [[New Jersey]] lawyer Mark Haines, along with in-studio reporters Joe Kernen, [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]] and [[Maria Bartiromo]] at the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman also became a frequent contributor. [[Alexis Glick]] joined the team as senior trading correspondent in May 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''
|accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rebecca Quick]] later replaced Glick as a reporter.

For many years the program covered the opening bells of the New York Stock Exchange and [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Stock Market]] at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Other regular segments included the ''Squawk Exchange'', where the team (particularly Faber and Kernen) shared banter on various topics, ''On the Box'' (rapid-fire summaries of the day's headlines) and ''Joe's World'', where Kernen sounded off on the day's notable [[stock]] stories.

During the period when CNBC's online presence was housed at [[MSN|MSN Money]], the show held its own daily ''Squawk Back Poll'' on the website, where viewers voted on a topical issue. In May 2005 the program established its own [[blog]] on [[Windows Live Spaces]], called ''SquawkBlog'', where the program hosts posted their thoughts, although this is no longer in use.

===2005 revamp===
The program underwent a significant revamp on December 19, 2005, with the show moving to the 6:00 am ET timeslot and Kernen, Quick and [[Carl Quintanilla]] helming a new tri-anchor format alongside on-air editor [[Charles Gasparino]]. Haines and Faber moved to a newly created program, ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'', anchored from the NYSE by Haines and [[Erin Burnett]] with Faber at CNBC headquarters. As a result of these changes, coverage of the market open at 9:30am ET passed to ''Squawk on the Street''. The "guest host" feature of ''Squawk Box'' was dropped immediately after the revamp but later reinstated.

There was a significant amount of initial negative feedback about the changes made to ''Squawk'', most notably the removal of Mark Haines from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===2011–present===
On July 8, 2011, Quintanilla left ''Squawk Box'' to become part of the new ''Squawk on the Street'' anchor team, following Haines' death on May 24 of that year. His new assignment began three days later, when he debuted with [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]] and Simon Hobbs.  [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', joined Kernen and Quick in order to succeed Quintanilla's anchoring duties.  Sorkin made his debut as co-anchor July 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/07/nyts-andrew-ross-sorkin-joins-cnbcs-squawk-box-147415/|title=NYT's Sorkin Joins CNBC's 'Squawk Box'|work=Deadline|author=Lieberman, David|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2014, ''Squawk Box'', along with CNBC's other trading-day shows, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on that same day.

On January 7, 2015, ''Squawk Box'' moved to a new street-side studio inside the [[Time-Life Building]] in [[New York City]] after almost two decades in New Jersey (at CNBC's original facilities in Fort Lee from its August 7, 1995, debut to October 10, 2003, and at CNBC's facilities in Englewood Cliffs from October 13, 2003, to January 6, 2015).

On January 4, 2016, ''Squawk Box'' debuted a remastered version of its logo used since October 13, 2014.  On February 8, 2016, both the Asian and European versions also started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo.

On November 14, 2016, it was officially announced by the [[NASDAQ]] that production of ''Squawk Box'' would be relocated to the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]] studio in Times Square; it began broadcasting from there on January 3, 2017. That same studio is also shared with CNBC's two other shows, ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''Options Action'' (the latter airing on Fridays only; both shows are hosted by [[Melissa Lee]]).

On November 15, 2017, ''Squawk Box'' moved downstairs to a new street-level studio overlooking Times Square, also at the NASDAQ MarketSite.

==Show times==
The program airs from 6 a.m. until 9 a.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] in the United States.

It is relayed in its entirety live on [[CNBC Europe]] although it is sometimes partially pre-empted for local programming, particularly to cover [[European Central Bank]] interest rate announcements and the subsequent [[news conference|press conferences]].

In Asia, the show is aired in its entirety on [[CNBC Asia]] from Mondays to Fridays (vary between time to time during U.S. Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time). Also, it can be air in New Zealand from Tuesdays to Saturdays during [[Time in New Zealand|Daylight Saving Time]] when U.S. is on Eastern Standard Time.

==Spin-offs==
===''Squawk Box Weekend Edition''===
CNBC once aired '''''Squawk Box Weekend Edition''''' weekends from 7:30 to 8 pm ET during c. 1999 to 2000, also hosted by Mark Haines.

===Worldwide ''Squawk Box''===
Around CNBC's global branches, there are many "Squawk Boxes" in the world:

Among the above, '''''Squawk Box Europe''''' and '''''Asia Squawk Box''''' are the counterparts which resemble the original '''''Squawk Box''''' the most:

*They are all three hours in duration.
*They all have a guest host appearing on the show, mostly after the first hour.
*In addition, Maria Bartiromo has served as a guest co-anchor on both ''Squawk Box Europe'' and ''Asia Squawk Box''.

(Karen Tso moved to the Asian version of ''Squawk Box'' (and was based in Singapore) and after [[Amanda Drury]] briefly replaced Tso on ''Squawk Australia'', Oriel Morrison moved into that role in 2010 while Drury is now based in CNBC World Headquarters in the U.S.). Tso moved to the European version of ''Squawk Box'' after joining CNBC Europe in 2011.

==''Fantasy Portfolio Challenge''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[CNBC]] --&gt;
150,221 players participated in the ''Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge'', a stock-picking contest that ran from April 4, 2006 through May 26, 2006. The winner of the ''Squawk Box Fantasy Portfolio Challenge'', which was announced live at the end of the 2 June 2006 episode, was Thomas Ko of [[California]]. His $5,015,735 [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] value outpaced all the other contenders. He was also the winner of a brand-new, limited-production, 2006 [[Maserati GranSport]].

The '''Transport and Logistics Centre''' ('''TALC''') is a national policy and practice research centre based in [[Sydney, Australia]]. Its prime objective is the building of capability in the transport and [[logistics]] sector in Australia.

The Transport and Logistics Centre was established in 2000. It acts as a "think tank" for new ideas in capability building in T&amp;L. It also provides advice to the T&amp;L industry in matters of [[workforce planning]] and skills development - especially mentoring, innovation and knowledge sharing.From 2007 TALC  became a [[not-for-profit]] company limited by guarantee with the same mandate as before, but with a greater capacity to undertake flexible programmes and projects.

TALC is currently working with companies and unions and in T&amp;L industry, and with the Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure and Transport, Infrastructure Australia, several industry Associations including the State-based Freight Councils, AFIF, LAA, CILTA, SCLAA, ARTIO, VTA, APICS and AITPM; and with State agencies including NSW RTA. TALC supports the Research Forum at the national SMART Conference. It also has a close working relationship in terms of research and field work with the Australian School of Business at the University of NSW, and the Workforce Futures Centre at Macquarie University.

==Programmes==
It has a range of programmes underway; the main ones are:

# Creation of two professional development accreditation programmes - [[Certified Transport Planner]] (CTP) and [[Certified Professional Logistician]] (CPL)
# Various awareness raising projects for schools across Australia to encourage young people to consider joining the transport and logistics industry as a career
# Research projects on request from Government - including analyses of collaborative infrastructure principles, and policy intermediation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">In [[Law of agency|agency law]], an '''undisclosed principal''' is a person who uses an agent for negotiations with a third party who has no knowledge of the identity of the agent's [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]. Often in such situations, the agent pretends to be acting for himself or herself. As a result, the third party does not know to look to the real principal in a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/undisclosed+principal&lt;/ref&gt;

Under United States law according to the [[Restatement (Third) of Agency]] §&amp;nbsp;2.06, an undisclosed principal may still be held liable to a third party who justifiably is induced to make a detrimental change in position, even if the agent lacked actual authority to act on behalf of the principal, so long as the undisclosed principal had notice of agent's conduct and that it might induce the third party to change its position, and the principal did not take reasonable steps to notify the third party of the facts. Even where an undisclosed principal has previously forbidden the agent to take some action or incur some debt, the undisclosed principal may be liable for the action or debt so long as the third party would reasonably believe the agent would have had the authority to take the action or incur the debt under the same circumstances had the principal been disclosed, i.e. so long as the transaction is in the usual course of business engaged in by the agent.

In [[English law]], the legal principle is that, where an agent acts for an undisclosed principal the position is “in much the same way as one who is disclosed”.&lt;ref&gt;G.H.L. Friedman, The Law of Agency (UK: Butterworths, 1996), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walt Disney World==
The undisclosed principal concept often arises in the context of real estate transactions, where a buyer risks a seller being less inclined to sell land, risks a seller demanding a higher price, or risks a seller becoming a [[Holdout problem|holdout]] if the seller knows or can guess the identity of the buyer or the buyer's intended purpose for the land which would afford the land a higher value.  The purchase of the land required to build the [[Walt Disney World]] resort in [[Orange County, Florida]] was accomplished with agents working for [[Walt Disney Productions]] as their undisclosed principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Business Law and the Regulation of Business | first1=Richard | last1=Mann | first2=Barry | last2=Roberts | edition=11th | page=607 | chapter=29: Relationship with Third Parties | isbn=1133587577 | date=2013-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over eighteen months in 1964 and 1965, agents secretly working for Disney attorneys purchased 27,400 acres of Florida ranchland, swamp, scrub woods and road frontage for an average price of only R5.20 per acre ($5 million total). It is unlikely that Disney would have been able to acquire the land except at prohibitively high prices of hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre had the sellers known their buyer's identity, given the prices at which nearby land sold after Disney completed its acquisitions and publicly announced its plan. (The project could also have been delayed for years or decades as owners of crucial pieces of land [[Holdout problem|held out]] for higher offers.)

}}
'''''Wall Street '''''is a platinum palladium print photograph by the American photographer [[Paul Strand]] taken in 1915.  There are currently only two vintage prints of this photograph with one at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] (printed posthumously) and the other, along with negatives, at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. This photograph was included in ''Paul Strand, circa 1916'', an exhibition of photographs that exemplify his push toward modernism.

It depicts a scene of everyday life in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].  Workers are seen walking past the [[23 Wall Street|J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. building]] in New York City on the famous Wall Street, of which the photograph takes its name.  The photograph is famous for its reliance on the sharpness and contrast of the shapes and angles, created by the building and the workers, that lead to its abstraction. This photograph is considered to be one of Strand's most famous works and an example of his change from [[pictorialism]] to [[straight photography]].  Strand moved from the posed to portraying the purity of the subjects.  It is one of several images that stand as marks of the turn to [[modernism]] in photography.
__NOTOC__

== Background ==

In 1907, as a young teen, the artist, [[Paul Strand]], enrolled in New York's [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]].  There, Strand was under the tutelage of documentary photographer [[Lewis Hine]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Tobin, "Paul Strand, the Early Years," Photo District News 18, no. 3 (March 1998): 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hine introduced Strand to the modernist photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]].  Stieglitz was heavily influential in the art world at the time, pushing for photography to be considered an art form and opening his own gallery, [[291 Gallery|the 291 Gallery]], with another influential photographer [[Edward Steichen]], to promote modernist art.  Stieglitz's colleagues were striving to receive acceptance for photography as a form of art.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;Tobin, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stieglitz would become a mentor and artistic comrade of Strand, with both influencing each other for the rest of their careers.

With Stieglitz's influence, Strand explored the pictorialist style, creating works with soft focus, and posed scenes.  Photographs aimed to look like paintings.  Around 1915, Strand and Stieglitz sought to change their aesthetics and made the march toward straight photography.  Stieglitz pushed Strand to involve real-life subjects and less manual manipulation of the print and utilized the style that was innate to the methods and materials of photography.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter, "Young Paul Strand: Impressionable, Experimental," New York Times, Mar 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strand interpreted this request from Stieglitz and created this new style that incorporated high contrasts, clean lines, and emphasis on shape.  These elements come from how Strand captured the real life and movements of subjects, not how he posed or manipulated them.

== Technique ==
This photograph depicts the J.P. Morgan building in New York City.  Strand photographed "people hurrying to work past the banking building"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Silberman, "Paul Strand Retrospective. Saint Louis Art Museum," The Burlington Magazine 133, no. 1061 (August 1991): 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; situated on Wall Street, from which the photo takes its name.  the subject depicted is a real-life subject without manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, "Young Paul Strand: Impressionable, Experimental."&lt;/ref&gt;  The depiction of the real nature of the medium and the subject is an example of straight photography. There is no focal point, with the lines converging off of the frame of the image.  The financial building take majority of the frame.  Emphasis is placed on the strong shapes created by the architecture of the building.  The workers are included in the image, but are faceless and are trumped in size by the massive square shapes from the building they walk past.  Also, the workers are captured in motion which on film makes them appear blurry. This aesthetic that Strand creates in Wall Street is his break toward the modern, the straight photography, demonstrating that pictorialism is no longer part of his aesthetic.  Strand captured the building with clean, sharp lines.  The building is covered in the high contrast, [[chiaroscuro]].  It is heavily in the shadows, but still creates an overwhelming presence over the people that walk past it.  These people are also shrouded in the contrast made evident with the clean lines and black and white nature of his photos and photography as a medium.  The people jump from their places, being the dark figures in the light of the sun that beams in from the left of the frame.

Strand fills the image with his recognizable aesthetic.  The photo is platinum print, one of the materials frequently used by photographers of the time.  Strand was unique in how he printed his photos.  As stated on the George Eastman House website section Notes on Photography, Strand would make large prints from small negatives.  He also left them in their matte condition that was inherent with platinum print.&lt;ref&gt;"Paul Strand/Technique," last modified on 12 March 2009, http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Paul_Strand/Technique#Method_of_printing.&lt;/ref&gt;   With his printing techniques, he "added a richness to the image."&lt;ref name="Tobin" /&gt;  As with the time, the photo is entirely black and white.  There is a heavy contrast with the black and white areas of the photo.  Strand creates diagonal shapes that pull emphasis to subject of the building and away from the people.

== Aspects ==
Having taken Hine's class at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, social change became important to Strand and appeared often in his art.  As a pupil of Hine, Strand learned of the social aspect his work could have.&lt;ref&gt;Leah Ollman, "Art Review: Paul Strand: A Transition, Caught on Film," Los Angeles Times, May 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;   With ''Wall Street'', he sought to portray a social message.  He captured the faceless people next to the looming financial building in order to give a warning.  Strand shows "the recently built J.P. Morgan Co. building, whose huge, dark recesses dwarf the passersby with the imposing powers of uniformity and anonymity."&lt;ref&gt;Ollman, "Art Review: Paul Strand: A Transition, Caught on Film."&lt;/ref&gt;   The people cannot escape the overwhelming power that this modern establishment will have on their future and the future of America.  He warns us to not be the small people that look almost ant-like next to this building that has a massive amount of control over the American economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">'''Yehuda Arazi''' ({{lang-he|יהודה ארזי}}; 1907–1959), code name ''Alon'', was an [[Israel]]i who was active in the [[Haganah]] in Palestine during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] era.

==Biography==
Arazi was born in [[Łódź]] to a Jewish family in 1907. He immigrated with his parents to [[Tel Aviv]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1924, studying in the [[Gymnasia Herzlia]].  While in Palestine, Arazi joined the [[Haganah]] and the [[Palestine Police Force]]. As a police officer, he was most notably involved as the investigating officer in the 1933 murder of [[Chaim Arlosoroff]]. In 1936, Arazi was sent back to Poland to help smuggle [[matériel]] to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commander of the Exodus |author=Yoram Kaniuk |year=2001|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3808-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aKk4E8Rcc8C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22Yehudah+Arazi%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html| page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 he married Rivka Albin, a year later their daughter Ruth was born. She married in 1955 the Supreme Court judge [[Gabriel Bach]]. His son Dan was born in 1941.

In 1943 he stole 5,000 rifles from the British Police for the Haganah, and had to go into hiding. In 1945, after two years of living in hiding as a wanted man in Palestine, Arazi and his partner Yitzhak Levy traveled to Egypt by train dressed as [[Royal Engineers]] sergeants. From there, they traveled through North Africa and into Italy, where they joined the [[Jewish Brigade]] of the British Army using falsified names. He was head of the Italy branch of the [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]], the Haganah agency involved in facilitating illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine, and was involved in the “[[La Spezia]]” affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New Jewry?: America Since the Second World War |author= Peter Medding|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the independence of [[Israel]] in 1948, Arazi became a private businessman and built the Ramat Aviv Hotel. He died of brain cancer in 1959. Shortly before his death, he befriended the artist Chaim Goldberg, also a Polish Jew, who was commissioned to execute several sculptures and a fully functional water fountain for the front of his hotel. The artist established his studio in a former munitions factory that he received from Arazi, that was located behind the hotel.

Arazi and the La Spezia affair gave the inspiration to [[Leon Uris]] for Ari Ben Canaan in ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.

Arazi was known as “King of Ruses” changing disguises and characters according to needs.
