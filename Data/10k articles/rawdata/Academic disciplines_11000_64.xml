==History==
The original format of 23 Things required participants to take part in an eight-and-a-half-week course where they kept up with coursework via a series of weekly blog posts that described Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hemment|first1=Drew|last2=Thompson|first2=Bill|last3=de Vincente|first3=Jose Luis|last4=Cooper|first4=Rachel|title=Digital Public Spaces|date=2013|publisher=Future Everything|isbn=9780956895851|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3ULz7m1f3UC&amp;pg=RA1-PA2000&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time participants were given 23 assignments (23 things) and were encouraged to work with other learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozarth|first1=Jane|title=Techniques for Enhancing and Extending Learning|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-87766-1|pages=84–85, 91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiWi4fuOOl0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the project was non-mandatory, participants took part in the coursework by posting their own blog entries for each week's coursework. The project was so successful that Blower held a 23 Things summit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergmann|first1=Julia|last2=Danowski|first2=Patrick|title=Handbuch Bibliothek 2.0|date=2010|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=9783110232103|page=357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpD-kVaDVSwC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception 23 Things has had over 500 iterations and the concept has broadened over time to include learning programs for other professionals and students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkinson|first1=L|last2=Cragg|first2=E|title=23 Things Oxford|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/38632|publisher=SCONUL Focus|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyer|first1=Roisin|last2=Stubbings|first2=Ruth|last3=Walton|first3=Graham|title=The Road to Information Literacy: Librarians as facilitators of learning|date=2012|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110281015|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arrQAVi0SzoC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also expanded to include more than 23 topics. 23 Things has also expanded beyond the United States and is currently used in multiple countries including [[Australia]] and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IFLA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Michael|title="23 Things" as Transformative Learning|url=http://conference.ifla.org/past-wlic/2012/150-stephens-en.pdf|publisher=IFLA|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, "23 Things"is a term used to describe a Web immersion experience for participants primarily supported by the participants themselves, where they are actively involved in a network of peers and colleagues, using digital communication tools, and using a blog to post reflections as they learn.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;

==Research==
In 2012 [[San Jose State University]] assistant professor Michael Stephens performed a research study of 23 Things programs in Australia. He found that even if people did not successfully complete the program, that the program still had the potential to positively impact library staff as the participants would still be likely to use what they did learn and/or to return to the program at a later date.&lt;ref name=IFLA /&gt; Stephens also noted that a strong majority of those who completed said they felt confident exploring and using new technologies: confidence and curiosity were identified as particularly notable outcomes.&lt;ref name=IFLA /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">In a [[storytelling|story]], we detect an '''''allotopy''''' when two basic meaning traits ([[Seme (semantics)|seme]]s) contradict each other, that is when they trace two incompatible interpretations. It was conceived as being the opposite of an [[Isotopy (semiotics)|isotopy]], which is the homogeneity resulting from repetition of the same seme.&lt;ref name="KlinkenbergAllodef"&gt;[[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (1996) ''Précis de sémiotique générale'', De Boeck, p. 118 [http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/isotopie.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been coined in the 1970s by the Belgian semioticians known as ''[[Groupe µ]]''.

==History==
In the 1970, the Belgian semioticians known under the name ''[[Groupe µ]]'', introduced the concept of Allotopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/allotopie.html Définition de : l'allotopie]&lt;/ref&gt; They first discussed the concept in publications like ''Isotopie et allotopie'',&lt;ref&gt;DUBOIS J. ; EDELINE F. ; KLINKENBERG J.-M. ; MINGUET P. (1976) ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=12751413 Isotopie et allotopie: le fonctionnement rhétorique du texte]'', no14, pp. 41-65 (2 p.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1976) ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie : le texte rhétorique'', Versus, 14, 1 976&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Rhetoric of Poetry'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allotopy and humor==
''[[Groupe µ]]'' discussed the relation of allotopy to [[jokes]] and [[humor]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Salvatore Attardo]], despite not using the term allotopy, formulated a theory of humor based on the idea of the "incompatible interpretations", called the [[isotopy-disjunction model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (2001) ''Humorous texts: a semantic and pragmatic analysis'',  sect.5.3.2, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (1994) ''Linguistic theories of humor'', chap.2&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the broader idea of defining humor as based on [[contradiction]]/[[wikt:incongruity|incongruity]].

==Disasters==
Impoundments for storage of blackwater and other coal-related wastes have a troubled history with often severe environmental consequences.

In February 1972, three dams holding a mixture of coal slurry in [[Logan County, West Virginia]] failed in succession:  {{convert|130000000|USgal|m3}} of [[toxic]] water were released in the [[Buffalo Creek Flood]].  As discussed in the book [[The Buffalo Creek Flood: An Act of Man]], out of a population of 5,000 people, 125 people were killed, 1,121 were injured, and over 4,000 were left homeless. The flood caused 50 million dollars in damages. Despite evidence of negligence, the [[Pittston Coal Company]], which owned the compromised dam, called the event an "[[Act of God]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Buffalo Creek Disaster | url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/Jones/buffalo.html#Problem | accessdate=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, a {{convert|900|ft|m|sing=on}} high, {{convert|2000|ft|m|sing=on}} long valley fill in [[Lyburn, West Virginia]] failed and slid into a sediment pond at the toe of the fill, generating a large wave of water and sediment that destroyed several cars and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Massey Valley Fill Disaster, Lyburn, WV | url=http://www.ohvec.org/galleries/mountaintop_removal/006/index.html | date=2002-07-19 | accessdate=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body image law''' is the  developing area of law that,  according to Dr Marilyn Bromberg of the [[University of Western Australia]] Law School and Cindy Halliwell, a law student at [[Deakin University]], "encompasses the bills, laws and government actions (such as establishing parliamentary inquiries and creating policies) that may help to improve the [[body image]] of the general public, and particularly of young people".&lt;ref name="mb/ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromberg|first1=Marilyn|last2=Halliwell|first2=Cindy|title=All About That Bass’ and Photoshopping a Model’s Waist: Introducing Body Image Law|journal=The University of Notre Dame Australia Law Review|date=2016|volume=18|url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/undalr/vol18/iss1/1/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for implementing law in this area is to prevent the images of unhealthily thin women causing poor body image which can, along with other factors, lead to an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name="mb/ch" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]] passed a body image law in 2012 which became operational the following year. The law requires models to have a minimum [[body mass index]] to work and if an image was photoshopped to make the model appear thinner, it must have a warning. The warning must state that the image was modified and it must take up at least seven percent of the image. Breaches can result in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel: Restrictions on Depiction of Underweight Models in Commercials|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-restrictions-on-depiction-of-underweight-models-in-commercials/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[French Government]]  passed a similar law in 2015 which came into effect in 2017. This law requires that models provide their employers with a "medical certificate, valid for up to two years, confirming their general physical well-being and the fact that they are not excessively underweight." &lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI of models older than 16 will also be taken into consideration, when determining their overall health.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; 

In contrast to the Israeli law, breaching it attracts criminal sanctions.&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Vanessa|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, any photo that has been digitally altered must be labeled as such; failure to label these photos will result in a "fine of 37,500 euros, or more than $41,000," and hiring a model without the verified medical certificate and requirements "carries a fine of €75,000 and six months in jail." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The law dictates that digitally altered images must be labeled "applies only to advertising, not to editorial images in magazines or newspapers." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

The [[Greater London Authority]] banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image on [[Transport for London]] public transport in 2016.&lt;ref name="ap/mo"&gt;{{cite news|title=London mayor bans Tube ads that promote unhealthy body image|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3640626/London-mayor-takes-aim-body-shaming-advertising-Tube.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[Mail Online]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Trondheim]] in Norway banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image in public places in 2017.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Gabriel|title=Norwegian city bans adverts featuring semi-nude models|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-trondheim-ban-adverts-semi-naked-models-negative-body-image-a7026421.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s position in this area is that it is up to industry to solve the problem of poor body image.&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Jessica|title=Skinny models: Australia welcomes Paris ban|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/skinny-models-australia-welcomes-paris-ban-20150319-1m36t7.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the previous Labor Government created a non-binding Voluntary Industry Code of Conduct on Body Image.&lt;ref name="apo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary industry code of conduct on body image|url=http://apo.org.au/node/21888|publisher=Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11070">[[File:Bumblebees.jpg|thumb|Two bumblebees foraging on a flower, taken at Bariloche, Argentina]]

[[Bumblebees]] (''Bombus'' spp.), like the [[honeybee]] (''Apis'' spp.) collect nectar and pollen from flowers and store them for food. Many individuals must be recruited to forage for food to provide for the hive. Some bee species have highly developed ways of communicating with each other about the location and quality of food resources ranging from physical to chemical displays. Honey bees are known for their specialized dances, such as the [[waggle dance]] which recruit other bees to the precise location of the food source.&lt;ref name="Winston"&gt;Winston ML, 1987. The biology of the honey bee. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bumblebees are not capable of transmitting this type of detailed information. Instead, the nest serves as a hub where bees receive information about the foraging bouts of her conspecifics.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dornhaus | first1 = A. | last2 = Chittka | first2 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Information flow and regulation of foraging activity in bumble bees | url = | journal = Apidologie | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 183–192 | doi=10.1051/apido:2004002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between the communication methods of honeybees and bumblebees are mainly due to differences in colony size and nest structure.&lt;ref name=" Winston " /&gt;  Bumblebees are distinct from honeybees because they lack receiver bees (bees in the nest which receive pollen and nectar from incoming foragers during unloading) and are not capable of [[trophallaxis]] (the transfer of nectar from one bee to another). They deposit collected nectar directly into the honey pots and don't share information of the quality of the resource with other bees through nectar transfer.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2" /&gt; Another bee may sample the nectar brought into the nest, and if the colony is in need of food or the nectar is high quality she will likely go out foraging herself.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2"&gt;Dornhaus A and Chittka L. 2005. Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) store both food and information in honeypots. Behavioural Ecology. 16:661-666.&lt;/ref&gt; Other means of alerting passive bees to a potentially rewarding resource include releasing pheromone signals and increasing physical activity.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2" /&gt; For information on communication methods in honey bees, see [[Bee learning and communication]].

==Pioneer research==
[http://www.dornhaus.de/ Anna Dornhaus] ([[University of Arizona]]) and [http://chittkalab.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/Chittka.html [[Lars Chittka]]] ([[Queen Mary University of London]]) began publishing their findings on the communication systems of bumblebees in 1999 when Ms. Dornhaus was an MSc. student in the [http://chittkalab.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/ Chittka lab].&lt;ref name=" Anna's "&gt;"Anna's past and current research projects." Anna's Homepage. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Apr. 2011. http://www.dornhaus.de/www.anna/aprojects.html&lt;/ref&gt; Their next major paper on the food alert system in bumblebees came in 2001 probing the potential evolutionary mechanisms of forager recruitment in a bumblebee nest.&lt;ref name=" Food alert "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dornhaus | first1 = A | last2 = Chittka | first2 = L | year = 2001 | title = Food alert in bumblebees, Bombus terrestris: possible mechanisms and evolutionary implications | url = | journal = Behav Ecol Sociobiol | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 570–576 | doi=10.1007/s002650100395}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 they, along with A. Brockmann (University of Wuzburg) published another paper regarding the pheromone released by bees upon returning to the nest and the type of information it provides other bees.&lt;ref name=" tergal glands "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dornhaus | first1 = A | last2 = Brockmann | first2 = A | last3 = Chittka | first3 = L | year = 2003 | title = Bumblebees alert to food with pheromone from tergal glands | url = | journal = J Comp Physiol A | volume = 189 | issue = | pages = 47–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring honey pots==
[[File:Bumblebee nest.jpg|thumb|Bumblebee nest with full visible honey pots]]

A bumblebee nest differs in size and structure from that of a honeybee. Bumblebee nests are smaller and contain far fewer individuals which is mostly due to differences in the method of colony reproduction.&lt;ref name=" Winston " /&gt; Honeybee colonies can contain up to 20000 individuals whereas bumblebee colonies usually only contain a few hundred.&lt;ref name=" Winston " /&gt; This means the number of bees available for foraging is low and resources must be allocated accordingly. Assessing the level of food stores is not seen in honeybees, likely because the large colonies make such assessment inefficient.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2" /&gt; Bumblebees only store enough honey for a few days.&lt;ref name=" Heinrich "&gt;Heinrich B, 1979. Bumblebee economics. Cambridge: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; By monitoring the levels of the honey pots a bumblebee colony can either up or down regulate the number of bees out foraging.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2" /&gt; Lab experiments by Anna Dornhaus and [[Lars Chittka]] in 2005 showed evidence of this up or down regulation by monitoring the activity level of the hive after the addition of 'nectar' to the honey pots. Hive activity increased when high quality nectar was injected into the honey pots, provided the wells weren't already full. When the honey pots were full, there was no significant change in activity regardless of whether the nectar imported was from a high or low quality source.&lt;ref name=" Dornhaus 2" /&gt; They hypothesized that either the foraging bee does not signal the nest or the nest bees ignore the signal because the demand for food is low. The tropical bumblebee ''[[Bombus transversalis]]'' has also been shown to respond to honey pot levels in a similar way.&lt;ref name=" Cameron "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dornhaus | first1 = A | last2 = Cameron | first2 = S | year = 2003 | title = A scientific note on food alert in Bombus transversalis | url = | journal = Apidologie | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 87–88 | doi=10.1051/apido:2002045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excited runs==
Honeybees have very controlled patterns of movement, such as the waggle or tremble dance which serve to deliver specific coordinates of fruitful sources to potential foragers. Bumblebee movement is comparatively random and does not supply coordinates to other bees.&lt;ref name=" Food alert " /&gt; Other experiments by Dornhaus and [[Lars Chittka|Chittka]] (2001) showed increased movement of successful foraging bees upon returning to the nest. Successful bees ran faster and longer compared to unsuccessful bees. A bee may spend several minutes running around the nest before flying out again.&lt;ref name=" Food alert " /&gt; As the bee runs, it has been hypothesized that the bee may also offer a form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made from her wings.&lt;ref name=" Anna's " /&gt; These 'excited' runs serve in part to rouse other bees into foraging.&lt;ref name=" Food alert " /&gt;

==Pheromones==

=== Pheromone distribution ===
Bumblebees produce a signalling pheromone from tergal glands located on their dorsal abdomen as discovered in experiments performed by A. Dornhaus, A. Brockmann and [[Lars Chittka|L. Chittka]] in 2003. They monitored the activity of bee colonies after exposure to products from several glands located along the bee's body. The only one yielding significant changes in activity level came from the tergites VI and VII.&lt;ref name=" tergal glands" /&gt; This is similar to a pheromone produced from the Nasanov gland in honeybees, but differs in the active compound.&lt;ref name=" tergal glands" /&gt; It has been suggested that this pheromone may facilitate learning of floral scents, since its release is coupled with the import of the floral scent from the nectar collected by the successful forager.&lt;ref name=" tergal glands" /&gt; Experiments by Molet, [[Lars Chittka|Chittka]] and Raine in 2009 showed that bumblebees may be able to learn floral scents associated with rewarding flowers better if the particular scent is found in nectar deposited in the honeypots.&lt;ref name="Molet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Molet | first1 = M | authorlink2 = Lars Chittka | last2 = Chittka | first2 = L | last3 = Raine | first3 = NE | year = 2009 | title = How floral odours are learned inside the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) nest | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 213–219 | doi=10.1007/s00114-008-0465-x | pmid=18949450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brood recognition pheromones ===
Many bumblebee species have been observed to use pheromones in the process of brood recognition. In the species ''[[Yellow-faced bumblebee|Bombus vosnesenskii]]'', brood recognition, and subsequently, brood clump incubation, has been shown to be pheromone induced. Queens will deposit chemical signals on a brood clump to help herself and her workers identify the eggs. However, these pheromones appear to be species' specific, as opposed to specific to individual queens, as queens will also incubate the eggs of conspecific bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pheromone Induced Brooding Behavior in Bombus vosnesenskii and B. edwardsii (Hymenoptera: Bombidae)|jstor = 25082666|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1974-07-01|pages = 396–404|volume = 47|issue = 3|first = Bernd|last = Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queen pheromones ===
As in other social Hymenoptera,&lt;ref name="VanOystaeyen"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Conserved Class of Queen Pheromones Stops Social Insect Workers from Reproducing|url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/287|journal = Science|date = 2014-01-17|pages = 287–290|volume = 343|issue = 6168|first = Annette|last = Van Oystaeyen|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1244899|pmid=24436417}}&lt;/ref&gt; bumblebee queens have also been shown to release characteristic pheromones to signal their presence and stop the workers from reproducing. In ''[[Buff-tailed bumblebee|Bombus terrestris]]'', for example, two studies have shown that workers resorbed oocytes more often&lt;ref name="VanOystaeyen" /&gt; and had fewer developing oocytes in their ovaries&lt;ref name="Holman2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bumblebee size polymorphism and worker response to queen pheromone|pmc = 4184022|journal = PeerJ|date = 2014-09-30|pages = e604|volume = 2|first = Luke|last = Holman|doi=10.7717/peerj.604|pmid=25289189}}&lt;/ref&gt; after treatment with the queen-characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon pentacosane. Similar activity of queen-specific cuticular hydrocarbons has also been documented in ''[[Common eastern bumblebee|Bombus impatiens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Conserved queen pheromones in bumblebees|url = https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2003v1|journal = PeerJ Preprints|date = 2016-04-26|pages = e2003v1|volume = 4|first = Luke|last = Holman|display-authors=etal|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.2003v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in several other species of ants and wasps.&lt;ref name="VanOystaeyen" /&gt;

The '''Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology''' ('''IGB''') is an interdisciplinary facility for [[genomics]] research at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The construction of the IGB, which was completed in 2006, represented a strategy to centralize biotechnology research at the University of Illinois.  A goal of the IGB is to provide a collaborative environment in which researchers with diverse backgrounds are drawn together by their pursuit of scientific questions related to genomics.  The interdisciplinary nature of the institute promotes the creation of innovative solutions to societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production. Current research at the IGB explores the genomic bases of a wide range of phenomena, including the progression of cancer, the ecological impact of global change, tissue and organ growth, and the diversity of animal behavior.&lt;ref name=igbweb&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institute for Genomic Biology: Where science meets society.|url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
Plans for what would become the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) were formed in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  Initially, the facility was to be named the Post-Genomic Institute; the name was changed to Institute for Genomic Biology in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tallon|first=Mary|title=U. Illinois trustees approve health benefits for same-sex partners.|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=2003-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Funds of $67.5 million were initially appropriated by the state of Illinois for construction in 2000.&lt;ref name=aps1stfunding&gt;{{cite news|title=Governor expected to unveil $1 billion technology initiative.|newspaper=Associated Press Services|date=2000-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to economic hardships, the state halted plans for construction in 2001 as part of a large set of budget cuts,&lt;ref name=stlouis&gt;{{cite news|last=McDermott|first=Kevin|title=Ryan pares $219 million from Illinois budget.|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=2001-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but in 2002, funds were re-appropriated.&lt;ref name=midconst&gt;{{cite news|title=State gives U. of I. $123 million for tech buildings.|newspaper=Midwest Construction|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Construction began in April 2004 and was completed in November 2006.  The building was dedicated in March 2007.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  The Institute, initially named the Institute for Genomic Biology, officially changed its name to the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology in 2015 to honor the scientific contributions of [[Carl Woese]].

===Leadership===
The IGB was initially led by [[Harris Lewin]], then a professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois.  Lewin served as the founding director until 2011, when he accepted the position of Research Vice Chancellor at [[University of California, Davis]].  [[Gene E. Robinson]], a professor in the Entomology department, took over as Interim Director, and was named the new Director of IGB in January 2012.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

==Research==

===Personnel===
The IGB houses over 130 faculty and 600+ graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research personnel.  IGB faculty are drawn from a broad range of departments, including Crop Sciences, Psychology, Entomology, Physics and Computer Science.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

===Aims===
The research goals of the IGB fall under one of three Program Areas ([[Systems Biology]], [[Biological engineering|Cellular]] and [[Metabolic engineering|Metabolic Engineering]], and Genome Technology).  Work at the IGB addresses societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production, both through basic science research and through exploration of ethical and legal issues.  Research is further organized into Themes, each of which occupies a customized lab and office space.  Each Theme contains multiple research groups.  These groups often pursue some research questions independently, but are unified by a common interest in the broader area of the Theme.  The multi-group space encourages communication and collaboration between researchers with diverse backgrounds and technical skills.  One senior faculty member acts as Theme leader, and is responsible for shaping and guiding the overall research initiative.  Themes are reviewed every five years; new Themes may be added or existing Themes modified to reflect the current state of genomics research.  Current Themes are listed below:&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11350">The '''Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute''' (formerly Institute for Psychoanalysis until it was renamed in May 2018) is a center for [[psychoanalytic]] research, training, and education that is located on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] in [[downtown Chicago]].  The institute provides professional training in the theory and practice of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]].  It was founded in 1932 by [[Franz Alexander]], a pioneer in psychosomatic medicine at the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]], who  moved to Chicago at the invitation of [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], then president of the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinker, R.R., Sr (1995). "The History of Psychoanalysis in Chicago, 1911–1975". ''Ann. Psychoanal.'', 23:155-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable [[psychoanalyst]]s that have been associated with the institute include [[Karl Menninger]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Thomas Szasz]], [[Therese Benedek]], [[Hedda Bolgar]], [[Roy R. Grinker, Sr.|Roy Grinker]], Maxwell Gitelson, Louis Shapiro, [[Heinz Kohut]], [[Arnold Goldberg]], [[Jerome Kavka]], Frank Summers, and Michael Franz Basch.

== History==

The Chicago Institute is the second oldest in the United States, preceded by New York five months earlier, and followed by Boston and Washington.  It was incorporated on February 25, 1932, with Franz Alexander as the first Director.  Alexander’s first associate was [[Karen Horney]], who had been another student at the Berlin Institute. Alexander and Horney appointed three more to form the first staff. They were: Thomas French as Lecturer and Clinical Associate, Helen McLean and Catherine Bacon as Clinical Associates. There were also two visiting lecturers: Karl Menninger and Lionel Blitzstein.

From the beginning, the Chicago Institute has nurtured innovative, and occasionally revolutionary, approaches to the psychoanalytic theory and practice originally formulated by [[Sigmund Freud]] in Vienna. Alexander wanted to experiment with frequency of sessions, length of treatment and how the analyst should optimally conduct himself. He published his ideas in several books, and became an outspoken advocate for such experimentation.  Alexander left Chicago for California in 1955. He was succeeded by Gerhard Piers  as the Director of the Institute. The group of analysts who became the dominant voices at the Institute had been greatly influenced by Lionel Blitzstein, who had analyzed them all. Though Blitzsten had been on the early faculty of the Institute, he and Alexander were at odds. With his ascendance the Institute reinstated practices that were considered more in line with the dominant American view of depth and intensity of psychoanalytic treatment. The intellectual leader of this group was Maxwell Gitelson. Joan Fleming became Dean of Education, and the curriculum emphasized a more thorough historical approach to teaching psychoanalysis.  

The 1960s witnessed one of the most vibrant creative periods in the Institute's history. Two important theoretical developments occurred. One was  a collective research project that concerned parent loss. Fleming's research group observed that there seemed to be an arrest of the personality at the age of the child when the parent died, associated with an absence of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(1966) ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]''. XLIV, 1963: Activation of Mourning and Growth by Psychoanalysis. Joan Fleming and Sol Altschul. Pp. 419-431. ''Psychoanal Q.'', 35:308&lt;/ref&gt; From these findings, the group reasoned that intervention at the time of the loss (i.e., in childhood) would effectively prevent later psychological problems. Ten years later, in 1976, the Barr-Harris Children’s grief center opened its doors.    

The second major development was the groundbreaking work of Heinz Kohut, who developed his very own ideas about the central role of empathy as defining the field of psychoanalysis - a position he staked out in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, H. (1959). "Introspection, empathy and psychoanalysis: An examination of the relationship between modes of observation and theory". ''[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]]'', 7:459-483&lt;/ref&gt;  Kohut  had observed the intense reactions that would occur when patients were engaged with others who had not functioned as a needed part of themselves and hence caused injury to that most vital part of their being. But it was this being-part-of that had deep implications for the understanding of both development and treatment. Paradoxically, the understanding of the essential role of the "other" became a psychology of the "self".&lt;ref&gt;Terman, D. (1980). "Object Love and the Psychology of the Self".  In A. Goldberg (Ed.), ''Advances in Self Psychology'', 349-365. New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All of this offered another, additional way of looking at what the classical theory had charted in its terms. [[Self psychology]] has had  (and continues too have) an enormous impact on psychoanalytic thought and practice throughout the world.

In the midst of all this groundbreaking intellectual work, the Institute also launched a number of innovative programs.  In 1962 it began the Child Therapy Program, the first of its kind in the country.  Graduates  of the Child Therapy Program have staffed and trained legions of agencies and treatment facilities of all kinds and have been the source of quality child psychotherapy over the last 45 years.   A few years later, in 1965, Kay Field began the Teacher Education Program that educated teachers and school personnel about the nature of emotional development and helped them recognize and deal with problems in that development. The program reached hundreds of school personnel.  In 1973, under the direction of then-director George H. Pollock, the Institute began the yearly publication of the Annual of Psychoanalysis. It remains the only Institute in the country - and the world - to sponsor, edit and produce an important academic journal.   The 70’s also saw the inauguration of the most complete catalogue of psychoanalytic literature assembled to that point, The Chicago Psychoanalytic Index. Begun in 1970 and continued until 1989, this was the standard reference work for most American psychoanalysts until the recent advent of centralized computer cataloguing. The psychoanalytic library out of which this work arose began with the founding of the Institute and grew to be one of the three most complete psychoanalytic collections in the world.

In 2013, [[Erika Schmidt]] became the first female director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://internationalpsychoanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ErikaSchmidtRelease.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education programs==

The Chicago Institute offers a variety of pathways to facilitate psychoanalytic learning. The fellowship program is open to advanced trainees and recent graduates in [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] who are interested in psychoanalysis as a framework with which to understand and carry out clinical work.   Participants meet for a monthly seminar.  Fellows also meet monthly with a mentor to discuss readings, cases and other relevant topics. The Adult [[Psychotherapy]] Program is a two year curriculum that is equally divided between clinical and didactic courses.  Students learn to do diagnostic evaluations from a dynamic point of view, including dynamic formulations.  They also have supervision with an analyst once a week to help with patients they currently have in treatment. The Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program is a 4 year program to train mental health workers who treat children and adolescents. Students complete a variety of diagnostic evaluations of children and their families with a dynamic perspective, in addition to several long-term psycho-analytically-oriented supervised cases. The core Psychanalytic Education Program provides training in the practice of psychoanalysis. This is a 5 year curriculum, but completion of the program frequently requires additional years to finish the clinical work required for graduation. Students must undergo a personal analysis that begins before matriculation into courses. Students treat at least three people in analysis under supervision of an analyst.

In collaboration with [[Rush University]], the Institute also offers the CORST program to Ph.D.s from a variety of non-clinical academic field, who wish to become psychoanalysts. It is designed to provide such students experience in general psychiatry and psychotherapy as preparation for psychoanalytic training.  CORST is a 17 month program in which the student shares many of the courses given to residents in Psychiatry at [[Rush Medical College]]. Concurrently, they see several patients in psychotherapy under the supervision of analysts on the faculty of the Institute.

==Clinical services==

The Clinics of the Institute for Psychoanalysis provide psychoanalytically informed services to adults, adolescents, and children in the Chicago area at a greatly reduced fee. All therapists and analysts are highly experienced clinicians trained in psychiatry, psychology, social work, or [[counseling]]. Many have advanced training in psychoanalysis or psychotherapy.
Psychoanalytic treatments are based on the belief that emotional difficulties are often the result of thoughts and feelings outside of a person's awareness. By exploring and working through these issues in the safety of a trusting relationship with a therapist, one can experience lasting changes. Present stresses and crises are also contributors to one's sense of well-being and can be an important focus for therapeutic intervention.

In 1976, the Institute for Psychoanalysis established the Barr-Harris Children's Grief Center to meet the needs of children who have lost a parent or significant loved one through death, divorce, or abandonment. The Center's mission is to provide therapeutic services to bereaved children and their families; to make intervention more accessible; to heighten awareness of the potentially harmful short- and long-term effects of loss; and to provide training and consultation for teachers, clergy, mental health workers, and other involved community members.

In addition to its main location at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in downtown Chicago, the Center has established programs at four Chicago area locations: [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]] Hospital serving the north suburbs, Little Company of Mary Hospital serving the south suburbs, La Rabida Children's Hospital serving the city's south side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital serving the city's north side. More recently, the Center has opened a sixth location at the Riverdale Community Resource Center in Riverdale, IL.

The '''cigarette smokers problem''' is a [[concurrent computing|concurrency]] problem in [[computer science]], originally described in 1971 by [[Suhas Patil]].

==Problem description==
Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of ''one'' of the three ingredients &amp;mdash; one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches.

There is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily ([[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministically]]) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table. This process continues forever.

Three [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]]s are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and smokers decrement the semaphore when removing items. Also, each smoker has an associated semaphore that they use to signal to the agent that they are done smoking; the agent has a process that waits on each smoker's semaphore to let it know that it can place the new items on the table.

A simple [[pseudocode]] implementation of the smoker who has the supply of tobacco might look like the following:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def tobacco_smoker():
    repeat:
        paper.wait()
        matches.wait()
        smoke()
        tobacco_smoker_done.signal()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

However, this can lead to deadlock; if the agent places paper and tobacco on the table, the smoker with tobacco may remove the paper, leaving the smoker with matches unable to make their cigarette. The problem is to define additional processes and semaphores that prevent deadlock, without modifying the agent.

==Argument==
Patil placed the following constraints on the cigarette smokers problem:

#The agent code is not modifiable.
#The solution is not allowed to use conditional statements.

Patil used a proof in terms of [[Petri net]]s to claim that a solution to the cigarette smokers problem using [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s semaphore primitives is impossible, and to suggest that a more powerful primitive is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Patil |first=Suhas S. | authorlink=Suhas Patil |title= Limitations and Capabilities of Dijkstra's Semaphore Primitives for Coordination among Processes |number=Memo 57 |institution=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Project MAC]], Computation Structures Group |date=February 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[David Parnas]] demonstrated that Patil's proof is inadequate if arrays of semaphore are used, offering a solution that uses helper processes that do arithmetic to signal the appropriate smoker to proceed.&lt;ref name="Parnas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnas |first=David L. |authorlink=David Parnas |title=On a solution to the cigarette smokers' problem (without conditional statements) |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=181–183 |date=March 1975 |doi=10.1145/360680.360709 |url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2992&amp;context=compsci |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Allen B. Downey]], the first restriction makes sense, because if the agent represents an [[operating system]], it would be unreasonable or impossible to modify it every time a new application came along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Downey |first=Allen B. |authorlink=Allen B. Downey |title=The Little Book of Semaphores |url=http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/ |edition=2nd |access-date=29 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Parnas argues that the second restriction is unjustified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The limitations reported by Patil are limitations of his primitives, but they are not limitations on the primitives described by Dijkstra. … It is important, however, that such an investigation [of Dijkstra primitives] not investigate the power of these primitives under artificial restrictions. By artificial we mean restrictions which cannot be justified by practical considerations. In this author's opinion, restrictions prohibiting either conditionals or semaphore arrays are artificial.&lt;ref name="Parnas"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Civil engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works such as Residences,Institutional Buildings,roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, and railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after [[military engineering]],&lt;ref name=CSCE&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Civil Engineering? |work=[[The Canadian Society for Civil Engineering]] |url=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/civil1.htm |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812030647/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/civil1.htm |archivedate=12 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | title=Civil engineering |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105844/civil-engineering |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.

==History==

=== Civil engineering as a discipline ===
Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stonemasons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Architect|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guild]]s and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.&lt;ref name="Saouma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture Notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E.

One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of [[buoyancy]], and practical solutions such as [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Colebrook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil engineering profession ===
{{See also|History of structural engineering}}
Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and [[Mesopotamia]] (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and [[Maritime history|sailing]].[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory explaining the [[buckling]] of columns]]

Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&amp;q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt {{ISBN|0805210822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in Egypt (circa 2700–2500 BC) were some of the first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the [[Qanat]] water management system (the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;p. 4 of {{Cite book | publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-9048186310| last = Mays| first = L.| title = Ancient Water Technologies| date = 30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the [[Parthenon]] by [[Iktinos]] in [[Ancient Greece]] (447–438 BC), the [[Appian Way]] by [[Roman engineering|Roman engineers]] (c. 312 BC), the [[Great Wall of China]] by General [[Meng Tian|Meng T'ien]] under orders from Ch'in Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang|Shih Huang Ti]] (c. 220 BC)&lt;ref name="Oakes"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Oakes | first = William C. | last2 = Leone | first2 = Les L. | last3 = Gunn | first3 = Craig J. | title = Engineering Your Future | publisher = Great Lakes Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1881018575 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stupas constructed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]] like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] and the extensive irrigation works in [[Anuradhapura]]. The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[insulae]], harbors, bridges, dams and roads.

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|A Roman [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] [built circa 19 BC] near [[Pont du Gard]], France]]
[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|[[Chichen Itza]] was a large pre-Columbian city in Mexico built by the [[Maya people]] of the Post Classic. The northeast column temple also covers a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] that [[funnels]] all the rainwater from the complex some 40 metres (130 ft) away to a rejollada, a former [[cenote]].]]

In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt; The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was [[John Smeaton]], who constructed the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="CSCE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt; In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.[[File:John Smeaton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[John Smeaton]], the "father of civil engineering"]]In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/about-ice/our-history|title=Our history|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|accessdate=12 April 2018|date=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1820 the eminent engineer [[Thomas Telford]] became its first president. The institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:{{quote|the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.&lt;ref name=ICE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ice.org.uk| title=Institution of Civil Engineers' website| accessdate=26 December 2007| date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Civil engineering education===
The first private college to teach civil engineering in the United States was [[Norwich University]], founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwich.edu/about/legacy.html|title=Norwich University Legacy Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first degree in civil engineering in the United States was awarded by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, Francis E Jr. "Amos Eaton was Right!". ''Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice'', Vol. 123, No. 1, January 1997, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rpi.edu/Archives/timeline/all_time/index.html RPI Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by [[Cornell University]] to [[Nora Stanton Blatch]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9124919/Nora-Stanton-Blatch-Barney | accessdate=8 October 2010 | title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering and military engineering (served by the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]), coupled with the demands of the Industrial Revolution, spawned new engineering education initiatives: the Class of Civil Engineering and Mining was founded at [[King's College London]] in 1838, mainly as a response to the growth of the railway system and the need for more qualified engineers, the private [[College for Civil Engineers]] in [[Putney]] was established in 1839, and the UK's first Chair of Engineering was established at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1840.

==Education==
{{Main|Civil engineer}}''Civil engineers'' typically possess an [[academic degree]] in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of technology]], or a [[bachelor of engineering]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move onto specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.&lt;ref name="CITE Postgrad"&gt;,{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title=Cite Postgrad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121950/http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|archive-date=2008-11-06|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]

== Practicing Engineers ==
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a [[professional engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.

The benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 August 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 5 October 2006 | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the United Kingdom. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of [[Queensland]]. Almost all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] which all members must abide by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ethics Codes and Guidelines | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers must obey [[contract law]] in their contractual relationships with other parties. In cases where an engineer's work fails, they may be subject to the law of [[negligence|tort of negligence]], and in extreme cases, criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore's Circle Line criminal trial started | work = New Civil Engineer | url = http://www.nce.co.uk/singapores-circle-line-criminal-trial-started/530302.article | accessdate = 16 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and [[environmental law]].

==Sub-disciplines==
[[File:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in Japan, currently the world's longest suspension span.]]
There are a number of sub-disciplines within the broad field of civil engineering. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.

===Coastal engineering===
{{Main|Coastal engineering|Coastal management}}
[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oosterscheldekering]], a [[storm surge barrier]] in the Netherlands.]]
''Coastal engineering'' is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.

===Construction engineering===
{{Main|Construction engineering}}
''Construction engineering'' involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and monitoring prices of supplies.

===Earthquake engineering===
{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}
''Earthquake engineering'' involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are&lt;ref&gt;Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0849300681}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.

===Environmental engineering===
{{Main|Environmental engineering}}
[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|left|upright=1.15|Water pollution]]
''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.

Environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.

===Forensic engineering===
{{Main|Forensic engineering}}
''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patent]]s.

===Geotechnical engineering===
{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}
[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]
''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt; Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional [[geologists]] and [[soil scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geotechnical/Geological Engineering |url=https://www.ausimm.com.au/content/docs/careers_booklet_geotgeoleng.pdf |website=Professional Careers in the Mineral Industry |publisher=The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials science and engineering===
{{Main|Materials science}}
''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and [[thermosetting polymer]]s including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.

''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].

===Structural engineering===
{{Main|Structural engineering}}
[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]
[[File:Construcción de una cimentación por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]
''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].

===Surveying===
{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}
[[File:Student using a dumpy level.jpg|thumb|A student using a [[dumpy level]]]]
''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.

;Land surveying

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]

;Construction surveying
Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:
* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;
* "lay-out" or "setting-out": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;
* Verifying the location of structures during construction;
* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

===Transportation engineering===
{{Main|Transportation engineering}}''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.

===Municipal or urban engineering===
[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]
{{Main|Urban engineering}}
[[File:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]
''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)

===Water resources engineering===
{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoover Dam]] ]]
''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifer]]s) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.

''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland]]
===Civil engineering systems===
Civil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering [[infrastructure]] requires a [[Holism|holistic]], coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering [[Project management|project life cycle]] from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Civil+Engineering+Systems%3A+A+Systems+Perspective+to+the+Development+of+Civil+Engineering+Facilities-p-9780470530634 Samuel Labi ''Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities''] 2014, John Wiley{{ISBN|978-0470530634}} Retrieved May 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icebookshop.com/bookshop_main.asp?ISBN=9780727760821 David Blockley and Patrick Godfrey ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)''] ICE Publications, London {{ISBN|978-0727760821}}" Retrieved May 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The fact that the concert saloons featured a kind of particularly tawdry, low-end theatre as well as liquor and the new fad of "waiter girls"—and, in the minds of many, [[prostitution]]—was too much for many so-called respectable people to bear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26306">A '''cost estimate''' is the approximation of the cost of a program, [[project]], or operation. The cost estimate is the product of the cost estimating process. The cost estimate has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a [[cost overrun]] can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate cost estimate. A cost estimator is the professional who prepares cost estimates. There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as [[building estimator]], or electrical estimator, or chief estimator. Other professionals such as [[quantity surveyor]]s and [[cost engineering|cost engineers]] may also prepare cost estimates or contribute to cost estimates. In the US, according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition, Cost Estimators, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/cost-estimators.htm (visited October 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors working in the UK.

==Overview==
The U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) defines a cost estimate as "the summation of individual cost elements, using established methods and valid data, to estimate the future costs of a program, based on what is known today". The GAO reports that "realistic cost estimating was imperative when making wise decisions in acquiring new systems."&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountabity Office, ''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', March 2009, Preface pg i&lt;/ref&gt; A cost estimate is often needed to support evaluations of project feasibility or funding requirements in support of planning. A cost estimate is often used to establish a [[budget]] as the cost constraint for a project or operation.

In [[project management]], [[project cost management]] is a major functional division. Cost estimating is one of three activities performed in project cost management.&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition, An American National Standard, ANSI/PMI 99-001-2004'', Project Management Institute, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1-930699-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cost engineering]], cost estimation is a basic activity. A cost engineering reference book has chapters on capital investment cost estimation and operating cost estimation. The fixed capital investment provides the physical facilities. The working capital investment is a revolving fund to keep the facilities operating.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In system, product, or facility acquisition planning, a cost estimate is used to evaluate the required funding and to compare with bids or tenders.

In construction contracting, a cost estimate is usually prepared to submit a [[construction bidding|bid]] or tender to compete for a contract award.

In facility maintenance and operation, cost estimates are used to establish funding or budgets.

In an attempt to manage liability risk, some firms avoid the use of the word estimate and instead refer to the estimate as an "Opinion of Probable Cost."&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Consulting Engineers, ''Risk Management Manual'', 1997, Pg 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost estimate types==
Various projects and operations have distinct types of cost estimating, which vary in their composition and preparation methods. Some of the major areas include:
*Construction cost        (i) detailed construction estimate    (ii) abstract construction estimate
*[[Manufacturing cost]]
*[[Cost estimation in software engineering|Software development cost]]
*Aerospace mission cost
*Resource exploration cost
*Facility operation cost
*Facility maintenance and repair cost
*Facility rehabilitation and renewal cost
*Facility retirement cost

==Cost estimate classifications==
Common cost estimate classifications historically used are
*Order of magnitude
*Preliminary
*Definitive
*Financial 
These correspond to modern published classes 5, 3, and 1, respectively. The U.S. Department of Energy and many others use a system of five classes of estimates:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Estimate class !! Name !! Purpose !! Project definition level
|-
| Class 5 || Order of magnitude || Screening or feasibility || 0% to 2%
|-
| Class 4 || Intermediate || Concept study or feasibility || 1% to 15%
|-
| Class 3 || Preliminary || Budget, authorization, or control || 10% to 40%
|-
| Class 2 || Substantive || Control or bid/tender || 30% to 70%
|-
| Class 1 || Definitive || Check estimate or bid/tender || 50% to 100%
|}

Methods used to prepare the estimates range from [[stochastic]] or judgment at early definition to deterministic at later definition. Some estimates use mixed methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Cost Estimating Guide for Program and Project Management'', U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Management, Budget and Evaluation, DOE G 430.1-1X, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost estimate classifications have been published by ASTM&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Classification for Cost Estimate Classification System'', ASTM E2516-11&lt;/ref&gt; and AACE International.&lt;ref&gt;''Cost Estimate Classification System'', AACE International Recommended Practice No. 17R-97&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society of Professional Estimators (ASPE) defines estimate levels in the reverse order as Level 1 – Order (Range) of Magnitude, Level 2 – Schematic/Conceptual Design, Level 3- Design Development, Level 4 – Construction Document, and Level 5 – Bid.&gt;.”&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACostE defines a Class I Estimate as definitive, a Class II Estimate as semi-detailed, and a Class III Estimate as pre-budget.&lt;ref&gt;"Provoc - Glossary of Common Project Control Terms," The Association of Cost Engineers (ACostE), http://www.acoste.org.uk, pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for estimates of different classes include:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class 1!! Class 3!! Class 5
|-
| Detailed estimate || Semi-detailed estimate || Conceptual estimate
|-
| Final estimate || Scope estimate || Pre-design estimate
|-
| Control estimate || Sanction estimate || Preliminary estimate
|-
| As-bid estimate || || Pre-budget estimate
|-
| As-sold estimate || || Evaluation estimate
|-
| CD estimate || DD estimate || SD estimate
|-
| || || Parametric estimate
|-
| || || Rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimate
|-
| || || Very rough order-of-magnitude (VROM) estimate
|-
| || || [[Scientific Wild-Ass Guess|SWAG]] (scientific, wild-ass guess) estimate
|-
| || || PIDOOMA (pulled-it-directly-out-of-my-ass) estimate
|}

==Estimate quality==
{{Over-quotation|date=December 2015}}
Estimate quality refers to the delineation of quality requirements for the estimate. These requirements are set out in accordance with formal [[quality assurance]] standards. There may also be other expectations for the estimate which are not specific requirements, but may affect the perceived quality of the estimate. Published quality requirements generally have to do with credibility, accuracy, confidence level, precision, risk, reliability, and validity of the estimate, as well as thoroughness, uniformity, consistency, verification, and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Provoc - Glossary of Common Project Control Terms," The Association of Cost Engineers (ACostE), http://www.acoste.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garold D. Oberlender and Steven M. Trost, "Predicting Accuracy of Early Cost Estimates Based on Estimate Quality", Journal of Construction Engineering and Management / Volume 127/ Issue 3/ TECHNICAL PAPERS, American Society of Civil Engineers, Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Number or The Result; Reliability, Accuracy, Precision, Confidence, or What?" Cost Engineering Vol. 37/No.1 January 1995, AACE International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The result of bidding without good estimates is certain: jobs that end up with less profit, no profit, or a loss. The bidder ultimately will go out of business; the only question is how long will it take.”&lt;ref&gt;Dan G. Brock, "Good estimating can keep you from going out of business," Roads &amp; Streets, March, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ConeOfUncertainty.png|thumb|400px]]Since a cost estimate is the approximation of the cost of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely the estimate is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the estimate accuracy. Predictions of the estimate accuracy may accompany the estimate. Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range.&lt;ref&gt;Larry R. Dysert CCC, "Is ‘Estimate Accuracy’ an Oxymoron?," AACE International Transactions, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality. Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the project.&lt;ref&gt;Garold D. Oberlender and Steven M. Trost, “Predicting Accuracy of Early Cost Estimates Based on Estimate Quality”, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management / Volume 127/ Issue 3/ TECHNICAL PAPERS, American Society of Civil Engineers, Abstract&lt;/ref&gt; For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.

High-quality cost estimates can be produced by following a rigor of 12 steps&lt;ref&gt;GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Twelve Steps of a High-Quality Cost Estimating Process, on the Internet at http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/GAO%2012-Step%20Estimating%20Process.pdf (visited 12/13/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by the U.S. GAO. Detailed documentation is recommended to accompany the estimate. “The documentation addresses the purpose of the estimate, the program background and system description, its schedule, the scope of the estimate (in terms of time and what is and is not included), the ground rules and assumptions, all data sources, estimating methodology and rationale, the results of the risk analysis, and a conclusion about whether the cost estimate is reasonable. Therefore, a good cost estimate—while taking the form of a single number—is supported by detailed documentation that describes how it was derived and how the expected funding will be spent in order to achieve a given objective.”&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009, Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; This documentation is often titled Basis of Estimate (or BOE). Additional documentation may accompany the estimate, including quantity takeoff documentation and supporting calculations, quotes, etc.

Although the pursuit of cost estimate accuracy should always be encouraged, a study in 2002 found that the estimates used to determine whether important infrastructure should be built were "highly and systematically misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flyvbjerg | first1 = Bent | year = 2002 | title = Underestimating Costs in Public Works Projects: Error or Lie? | url = | journal = Journal of American Planning Association | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 279–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contingency==
A contingency may be included in an estimate to provide for unknown costs which are indicated as likely to occur by experience, but are not identifiable. When using an estimate which has no contingency to set a budget or to set aside funding, a contingency is often added to improve the probability that the budget or funding will be adequate to complete the project. Being unable to complete a project risks public ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;Luke,''The Bible'', Luke 14:28, numerous publishers&lt;/ref&gt; See [[cost contingency]] for more information. The estimate or budget contingency is not intended to compensate for poor estimate quality, and is not intended to fund design growth, owner changes, or anything else unrelated to delivering the scope as defined in the estimate documentation. Generally more contingency is needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate accuracy.18

==Cost estimating methods and best practices==
Estimating methods may vary by type and class of estimate. The method used for most definitive estimates is to fully define and understand the scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost. Proper documentation and review are also important. Pricing transforms the cost estimate into what the firm wishes to charge for the scope. Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling. The basic characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task, broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data, standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties, recognition of inflation, recognition of excluded costs, independent review of estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes.&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009, Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[best practices]] helps ensure a high-quality estimate. “Certain best practices should be followed if accurate and credible cost estimates are to be developed. These best practices represent an overall process of established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that are comprehensive and accurate and that can be easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.”&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountabity Office, March 2009, Pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools that may be part of costs estimation are cost indexes.  These factors promote time adjustment of capital costs, following changes in technology, availability of materials and labor, and inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, K. K., 2005. Project and Cost Engineers' Handbook. 4th ed. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent unavailability of up-to-date cost literature, several inflation or cost indexes are available.&lt;ref&gt;Silla, H., 2003. Chemical Process Engineering: Design and Economics. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction cost estimates===
Estimates for the cost of facility construction are a major part of the cost estimate domain. A construction [[general contractor]] or [[subcontractor]] must normally prepare definitive cost estimates to prepare bids in the [[construction bidding]] process to compete for award of the contract. Although many estimators participate in the bidding and [[procurement]] processes, those are not a necessary function of cost estimate preparation. Earlier estimates are prepared by differing methods by estimators and others to support the planning process and to compare with bids. One way to make those estimates is by determining the resources needed (e.g., the amount of construction material quantities that are required) and then multiplying the estimated construction material quantities by the corresponding unit cost. One advantage of making estimates in this way is that it allows for the segregation of quantities and costs. This way they can be updated separately as new information becomes available. They can also be tracked separately allowing decision makers to make better decisions about the project during its conceptual phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = García de Soto | first1 = B. | last2 = Adey | first2 = B. T. | last3 = Fernando | first3 = D. | year = 2014 | title = A process for the development and evaluation of preliminary construction material quantity estimation models using backward-elimination-regression and neural networks | url = | journal = Journal of Cost Analysis and Parametrics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 180–218 | doi = 10.1080/1941658X.2014.984880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definitive Estimates (Class 1)====
[[File:Old handwritten estimate.png|thumb|400px|A handwritten spreadsheet.]]
A definitive estimate is prepared from fully designed plans and specifications (or nearly so), preferably what are called contract documents (CD). The contract documents also establish the Scope of Work (SOW). The standard method is to review and understand the design package and take off (or perform a quantity survey of) the project scope by itemizing it into [[line items]] with measured quantities. RSMeans refers to this as, "Scope out the project," and, "Quantify."&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Waier, PE, et al, ''RSMeans Building Construction Cost Data 70th Annual Edition'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-29-9}}, Pg vii&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions or areas of practice define the itemization and measuration in certain terms, such as [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|RICS]] and may have specific rules for development of a [[Bill of quantities]], or BOQ. The ASPE proposes a best practice standard method for the quantity survey. This includes using the [[Construction Specifications Institute]] Uniform Numbering System ([[MasterFormat]]) to ensure that all work is accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Then costs are applied to the quantified line items. This may be called costing or pricing. In estimating for contracting, the cost is what something costs you to build, and price is what you charge another party for building it. RSMeans refers to this as, "Price the quantities."&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Waier, PE, et al, ''RSMeans Building Construction Cost Data 70th Annual Edition'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-29-9}}, Pg vii&lt;/ref&gt; ASPE recommends the "quantity times material and labor costs format"&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 91&lt;/ref&gt; for the compilation of the estimate. This format is illustrated in the handwritten spreadsheet sample. For labor, the estimator should, "Determine basic production rates and multiply them by the units of work to determine total hours for the work."&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 95&lt;/ref&gt; and then multiply the hours by the per hour average labor cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 96&lt;/ref&gt; Labor burdens, material costs, construction equipment costs, and, if applicable, subcontractor costs are also extended on the estimate detail form.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 96-98&lt;/ref&gt; Other costs and pricing are added, such as [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], sales or use taxes, payment and performance bonds, [[Cost escalation|escalation]], and [[Cost contingency|contingency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs which are applied to the line-item quantities may come from a cost book (either internal or external) or [[cost database]]. For construction contractors or construction managers it is important to track and compile past data of trends, completed projects, production factors, equipment changes, and various labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;J. David Nardon, Bridge and Structure Estimating'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RGS Labor Norms.png|thumb|400px|Sample labor norms]]The labor requirements are often the most variable and are a primary focus of construction cost estimators. The labor hours required to construct each installation item are calculated by using a man-hour rate times the take-off quantity (a similar method is to divide the take-off quantity by the production rate). Many estimators use a man-hour norm reference for standard man-hours and apply an adjustment factor for project or task conditions, location, methods, equipment, labor skill, etc. to adjust for the anticipated effect on labor.

Direct costs are itemized for all necessary parts of the project. [[Indirect costs|Direct costs]] are all of the costs which can be attributed directly to the project. Direct costs include costs for general requirements (Division 1 of MasterFormat), which includes such items as [[project management]] and coordination, [[quality control]], temporary facilities and controls, cleaning and [[waste management]].&lt;ref&gt;MasterFormat Numbers &amp; Titles, April 2012,'' The Construction Specifications Institute and Construction Specifications Canada, Pg 8-14&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs may also include the costs of project planning, investigation, studies, and design; land or right of way acquisition, and other non-construction costs. Usually, a subtotal of total direct costs is provided in the estimate.

Provisions are made for [[Indirect costs]] in addition to the direct costs. Indirect costs include [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], sales or use taxes, payment and [[performance bond]]s, [[Cost escalation|escalation]], and [[Cost contingency|contingency]]. Profit is cost to the buyer, but is not a cost to the provider, rather a projection of anticipated income.

A well documented cost estimate includes a Basis of Estimate (BOE), which describes the scope basis, pricing basis, methods, assumptions, inclusions, and exclusions.

====Order-of-Magnitude Estimates (Class 5)====
An [[order of magnitude|order-of-magnitude]] estimate is prepared when little or no design information is available for the project. It is called order of magnitude because that may be all that can be determined at an early stage. In other words, perhaps we can only determine that it is of a 10,000,000 magnitude as opposed to a 1,000,000 magnitude. Various techniques are employed for these estimates, including experience and judgment, historical values and charts, rules of thumb, and simple mathematical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, Page 324&lt;/ref&gt; Factor estimating is one of the more popular methods. This involves taking the known cost of a similar facility and factoring the cost for size,&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, Page 333&lt;/ref&gt; place, and time. Cost modeling is another common technique. In cost modeling the estimator models the various parameters of the facility and applies costs to the derived scope.

Building estimators or architects may use the [[Uniformat]] system of breaking down the building into functional systems or assemblies during the schematic design (SD) phase of planning and design.&lt;ref&gt;"Uniformat," Construction Specifications Institute, http://www.csinet.org/uniformat&lt;/ref&gt; The RSMeans Square Foot Costs book organizes building costs according to the 7 divisions of the UNIFORMAT II classification system.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Phelan, AIA, et al, ''RSMeans Square Foot Costs'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-74-9}}, Pg v&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 divisions are:
*A Substructure
*B Shell
*C Interiors
*D Services
*E Equipment &amp; Furnishings
*F Special Construction
*G Building Site Work

'''Cultural studies''' is a field of theoretically, politically, and empirically engaged cultural analysis that concentrates upon the political dynamics of contemporary culture, its historical foundations, defining traits, conflicts, and contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency.

Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural studies" is not synonymous with either "[[area studies]]" or "[[ethnic studies]]," although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. [[American studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies|Latina/o Studies]], [[European studies]], [[Latin American studies]], etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and the interdisciplinary field of [[ethnic studies]], cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-studies|title=cultural studies {{!}} interdisciplinary field|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural studies was initially developed by British academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world.  Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cultural Studies as a field of research is not concerned with the linguistically uncategorized experiences of individuals, or, in a more radical approach, holds that individual experiences do not exist, being always the result of a particular social-political context.

Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including [[semiotics]], [[Marxism]], [[feminist theory]], [[ethnography]], [[critical race theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[social theory]], [[political theory]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film studies|film/video studies]], [[communication studies]], [[political economy]], [[translation studies]], [[museum studies]] and [[art history|art history/criticism]] to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[Structure or agency|agency]] have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related to processes of [[globalization]].

During the rise of [[neo-liberalism]] in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons.  Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena.  While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement that is to this day associated with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences, publications and students and practitioners from [[Taiwan]] to [[Amsterdam]] and from [[Bangalore]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, Michael (2009), [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334 "What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultstud.org/index.php?s=resources "Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs"], extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat distinct approaches to cultural studies have  emerged in different national and regional contexts such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Italy.

==Characteristics==
In his 1994 book, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'', [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:&lt;ref&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin and Van Loon, Borin (1994). ''Introducing Cultural Studies.'' New York: Totem Books&lt;/ref&gt;

*The aim of cultural studies is to examine cultural practices and their relation to [[power (sociology)|power]]. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London).
*The objective of cultural studies includes understanding culture in all its complex forms and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself.
*Cultural studies is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism/action. (For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but s/he would connect this study to a larger, progressive political project.)
*Cultural studies attempts to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of [[knowledge]] that purport to be grounded in nature.
*Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern [[society]] and to a [[Radicalization|radical]] line of political action.

==History==
As Dennis Dworkin writes,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Dennis. ''Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; "a critical moment" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when [[Richard Hoggart]] used the term in 1964 in founding the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] (CCCS) at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK, which was to become home for the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;see also Corner, John (1991), "Postscript: Studying Culture—Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart." ''Media, Culture and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 2, April.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at the university thus became the world's first institutional home of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/about.aspx|title=About the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggart appointed [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as his assistant, and Hall was effectively directing [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Davies, "British Cultural Marxism," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' 4(3) (1991): 323-344, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall formally assumed the directorship of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within.  Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley &amp; Chen (eds.)|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy, Grossberg and McRobbie (eds.)|title=Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall|date=2000|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in Sociology at the Open University in the UK, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre.

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999.  Then, in 2002, the University of Birmingham's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry.  The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to "inexperienced ‘macho management.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAE, a holdover initiative of the [[Margaret Thatcher]]-led UK government of 1986,  determines research funding for university programs.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Polly (2002), [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/socialsciences/story/0,,745058,00.html "Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Graeme|title=British Cultural Studies: An Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John|title=A Short History of Cultural Studies|date=2003|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham===
Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s pioneering work at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]], along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students including [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, [[Richard Dyer]], Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and [[Angela McRobbie]], gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies.  Many cultural studies scholars employed [[Marxist]] methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the superstructure]]) and that of the political economy ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the base]]).  By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period.  Also during the 70s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline.  Britain's manufacturing industries were fading and union rolls were shrinking.  Yet millions of working class Britons backed the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's victory.  Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, ''Policing the Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke &amp; Roberts|title=Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State, and Law and Order|date=1978|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other later texts such as Hall's ''The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left|date=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall &amp; Jacques (eds.)|title=New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of [[Richard Hoggart]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Paul Gilroy]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, [[Richard Dyer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/john_storey_what_is_cultural_studies_a_readerbookzz-org.pdf|title=What is Cultural Studies?|last=Storey|first=John|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies in the late-1970s and beyond===
By the late 1970s, scholars associated with [[The Birmingham School]] had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since.  Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention.  It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 90s.  As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas &amp; Erni (eds.)|title=Internationalizing Cultural Studies: An Anthology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field.

==Developments outside the UK==
In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally in the late 1970s, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism and race in the late 70s and 1980s, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in US universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|Nelson|Treichler|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren &amp; Vavrus (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley &amp; Pearson (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]'', the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], brought it there from Australia in 1987.

A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in [[Australia]] since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  A school of cultural studies known as "cultural policy studies" is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one.  Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frow &amp; Morris (eds.)|title=Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner (ed.)|first1=Graeme|title=Nation, Culture, Text: Australian Cultural and Media Studies|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Australia include ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'' and ''Cultural Studies Review''.

In [[Canada]], cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of [[technology and society]], continuing the emphasis in the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], and others.  Cultural studies journals based in Canada include ''Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies''.

In Africa, [[human rights]] and [[Third World]] issues are among the central topics treated.  Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the ''[[Journal of African Cultural Studies]]''.

In [[Latin America]], cultural studies has drawn on thinkers such as [[José Martí]], [[Ángel Rama]] and other Latin American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world.  Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Jésus Martín-Barbero]], and [[Beatriz Sarlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarto, Ríos &amp; Trigo (eds.)|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin &amp; Szurmuck (eds.)|title=Dictionary of Latin American Cultural Studies|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are [[decoloniality]], [[urban culture]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].  Latin American cultural studies journals include the ''Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies''.

Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is a significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain and Portugal.  The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the [[Frankfurt School]], which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as [[Axel Honneth]].  Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', the ''Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies'', ''[[French Cultural Studies]]'', and ''Portuguese Cultural Studies''.

In Germany, the term ''cultural studies'' specifically refers to the field in the Anglo-sphere especially British Cultural Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GEkqO--HndgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=cultural+studies+in+deutschen+Kontext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGHZhanE3M&amp;sig=QHeWMp6GMLv_WNbX3evkxYhTGcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2756p493QAhUGtRQKHRQSDxgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20studies%20in%20deutschen%20Kontext&amp;f=false|title=Normativität: Über die Hintergründe sozialwissenschaftlicher Theoriebildung|last=Ahrens|first=Johannes|last2=Beer|first2=Raphael|last3=Bittlingmayer|first3=Uwe H.|last4=Gerdes|first4=Jürgen|date=2011-02-10|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783531930107|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the German [[:de:Kulturwissenschaft|Kulturwissenschaft]] which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay persons.

Throughout Asia, cultural studies has boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen &amp; Huat (eds.)|title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Asia include ''[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]''. In India the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages University Hyderabad at two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies.

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] initially engaged deeply with the [[structuralism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982).

===Gramsci and hegemony===
To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at [[The Birmingham School]] turned to the work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian thinker, writer and communist party leader of the 1910s, 20s and '30s.  Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists?  What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions?  Gramsci modified [[classical Marxism]], and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle.  In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular "consent."  It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or "hegemony," involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense.  Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|title=Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|date=June 1986|volume=10|issue=2 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/019685998601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lash]] writes:
{{quote|text=In the work of Hall, Hebdige and McRobbie, popular culture came to the fore... What Gramsci gave to this was the importance of consent and culture.  If the fundamental Marxists saw power in terms of class-versus-class, then Gramsci gave to us a question of ''class alliance''. The rise of cultural studies itself was based on the decline of the prominence of fundamental class-versus-class politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lash|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edgar and Sedgwick write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of [[hegemony]] was of central importance to the development of British cultural studies [particularly [[The Birmingham School]]. It facilitated analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to political and economic domination.  The subordinate groups needed not to be seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar &amp; Sedgewick, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structure and agency===
The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring [[Structure and agency|agency]], a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated peoples (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration|date=1984|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, "Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'," "ordinary people are not cultural dopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guins &amp; Cruz (eds.)|title=Popular Culture: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated peoples runs counter to the work of traditional structuralists.  Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency.

Cultural studies often concerns itself with agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices,  meanings, and identities.

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure. It has marked a shift from a form of [[Althusser]]ian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Further Reflections on Conversations of Our Time|journal=Diacritics|date=1997|volume=27|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globalization===
In recent decades, as capitalist culture has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of [[globalization]], cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consumption===
Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people ''read,'' receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], and others have been influential in these developments.

A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, ''Cultural Studies'', examined "Anti-Consumerism" from a variety of cultural studies angles.  As Jeremy Gilbert noted in his contribution to this issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that “we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when ‘consumer confidence’ is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jeremy|title=Against the Commodification of Everything|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2008|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of "text"===
Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing [[semiotics]], uses the concept of ''[[wikt:text|text]]'' to designate not only written language, but also [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[photography|photograph]]s, [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]]s, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, [[Roland Barthes]], but also owes debts to other sources, such as [[Juri Lotman]] and his colleagues from [[Tartu–Moscow School]]. Similarly, the field widens the concept of "culture." "Culture," for a cultural studies researcher, includes not only  traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. ''The Dialogic Imagination.'' Austin, TX: UT Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but also everyday meanings and practices, which have, as noted above, become a central focus of cultural studies.  Cultural studies even approaches sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens and beaches, as "texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske, Hodge and Turner|title=Myths of Oz: Reading Australian Popular Culture|date=1987|publisher=Boston|location=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2008) Cultural Studies, Sage, London; Jeff Lewis, (2005) Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence, Pluto, London.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis, 'textual studies' use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts, and observe and analyse the ways the two interact with one another.  This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourses.

==Academic reception==
Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines—anthropology, media and communication studies, literary studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of "postmodern" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social and economic critique.  This critique is designed to "deconstruct" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Thus, while some scholars and disciplines like to dismiss cultural studies for its methodological openness and rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have had a profound influence throughout the more progressive and critical areas of the social sciences and humanities. Cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production, for example, has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as [[translation studies]], health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology, as well as across the range of disciplines that initially shaped the emergence of cultural studies, including literature, sociology, communication studies, and anthropology.

Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches such as deconstruction and postmodernism. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|During|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Blackwell ''Companion to Cultural Studies'', edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2006|p=index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary scholars===
Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature.  Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor [[Harold Bloom]] have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework.

Bloom stated his position during the September 3, 2000 episode of [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Booknotes]]'', while discussing his book ''How to Read and Why'':

{{quote|text=[T]here are two enemies of reading now in the world, not just in the English-speaking world. One [is] the lunatic destruction of literary studies...and its replacement by what is called cultural studies in all of the universities and colleges in the English-speaking world, and everyone knows what that phenomenon is. I mean, the...now-weary phrase 'political correctness' remains a perfectly good descriptive phrase for what has gone on and is, alas, still going on almost everywhere and which dominates, I would say, rather more than three-fifths of the tenured faculties in the English-speaking world, who really do represent a treason of the intellectuals, I think, a 'betrayal of the clerks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Why|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?157968-1/read|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as ''After Theory'' (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the "fundamental questions" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential.

===Sociologists===
Cultural studies has also had a substantial impact on sociology.  For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain.  The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners.  Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole.  While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], cultural studies has explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity.  Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies.

One sociologist whose work has had a major influence upon cultural studies is [[Pierre Bourdieu]].  Bourdieu's work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice''. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdieu|first1=Pierre|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward "scientificity," and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of "scientificity" as a basis for cultural studies.

Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, [[Chris Rojek]] and [[Bryan S. Turner]], argue in their article, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn", that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies has always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is "a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated" in cultural studies&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." ''The Sociological Review'' 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Alan Sokal===
{{Main article|Sokal affair}}
In 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] expressed his opposition to cultural studies by [[Sokal affair|submitting a hoax article]] to a cultural studies journal, ''[[Social Text]]''. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the "fashionable nonsense" of [[postmodernism]], was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described "academic gossip" magazine, ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', revealing his hoax on ''[[Social Text]]''. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:

{{quote|text="Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound historical ''volte-face''. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful -- not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique. Theorizing about "the social construction of reality" won't help us find an effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming. Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies"], [[Alan Sokal]], English translation of article from ''Lingua Franca'', 1996. Physics.nyu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Founding works==
Hall and others have identified some core originating texts, or the original "curriculum", of the field of cultural studies:
* [[Richard Hoggart]]'s ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]''
* [[Raymond Williams]]' ''[[Culture and Society]]'' and ''[[The Long Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[E. P. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''.

{{see also|Mizrach}}
The '''Eastern Wall''' is an ancient structure in [[Jerusalem]] that is both part of the eastern side of the city [[Walls of Jerusalem|wall of Jerusalem]] and the eastern wall of the ancient [[Temple Mount]].

The Eastern Wall is the oldest of the four visible walls of the Temple Mount; the Northern, [[Western Wall|Western]] and [[Southern Wall]]s date from the period of [[Herod the Great]], who expanded the area of the Temple Mount to the north, west and south.  Older walls on these sides are presumed to survive underground.  The Eastern Wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of [[Hezekiah]], during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], in the [[Hasmonean]] period and in the [[Herodian]] period.  Repairs and major renovations were made in later periods.  Major renovations to the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] were made in the [[Umayyad]] period.

==History of construction==

===First Temple period===

Architectural archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] identifies specific courses of visible [[ashlars]] located on to the northern and south of the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by [[King Hezekiah]].  More such stones are supposed to survive underground.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  According to [[Hershel Shanks]], "most scholars," think that Ritmeyer is "correct."&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;

Ritmeyer has pointed out that the [[Dome of the Rock]] is seated on a square platform atop the Temple Mount, the sides of which, defined by short flights of steps, are square and parallel to the modern walls of the Mount with one exception: the western steps deviate from parallel.  Moreover, the bottom step on the western side of the Dome of the Rock platform is composed of a single line of distinctively large and "beautifully polished" ashlars.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem, an Archaeological Biography|first=Hershel|last=Shanks|publisher=Random House|year=1995|pages=47–65|isbn=978-0-679-44526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ritmeyer, the measurements given in the [[Mishna]], tractate Middot, "The Temple Mount measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits," can be traced on the modern Temple Mount, with this step the outline of the western side of the square and the Eastern Wall the eastern side.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  The "precise" measurement of an ancient Judean royal [[cubit]], 20.67 inches, outlines these landmarks area exactly.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt; The northern edge of the ancient square was demarcated by [[Charles Warren]], the last archaeologist permitted by the local [[waqf]] to explore the underground areas of the Mount, in his{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=word(s) missing?}} the underground structure he labeled as No. 29 in surveys he carried out in the 1860s.  The southern side of the 500 cubit ancient platform square is marked by he the so-called "Straight Joint," a visible bend in the eastern wall.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=RitmeyerOriginal&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, “Locating the Original Temple Mount,” BAR, March/April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritmeyer proposes that this 500 cubit walled square was constructed by King Hezekiah c. 700 BCE to expand the flat area in which the faithful could gather at the Solomonic-era Temple.  The [[Foundation Stone]] around which is the ancient Jewish Temple was built and which is now sheltered under the Dome of the Rock, is a natural rock outcrop at the highest point of a [[Mount Moriah]]; the natural contour of the land fell away steeply on all sides, although on the eastern side the natural contour formed a flat plateau before falling sharply to the [[Kidron Valley]] along the line where the Eastern Wall stands.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Straight Joint" where the wall bends very slightly, demarcating the line between the Hezekiahan wall and the Hasmonean extension, is marked by a round column protruding from the wall near the top.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit Temple platform toward the south; distinctively Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt; The seam between the Hasmonean and Herodian extensions of the wall is visible as a vertical row of ashlars 32 meters north of the southeast corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Herodian expansion===
King Herod expanded the Temple Mount still further toward the south; distinctively Herodian ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall, in the last  stretch before the southeastern corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Gates in the Eastern Wall==

'''Electrical engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics &amp; waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int. J. For the History of Engineering &amp; Technology|volume=86|pages=42–55|doi=10.1080/17581206.2015.1119481|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=104|issue=7|pages=1489–1498|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]]s, and, from about 1890, [[wireless telegraphy]].

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised [[units of measure]]. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell’s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at [[University of Missouri]] soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.missouri.edu/ece/about/department-history/|title=Department History - Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780801873973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780883855706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920, [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albert W.

The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the [[Apollo program]] which culminated in [[moon landing|landing astronauts on the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The ENIAC Museum Online | url = http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/guys.html | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state electronics ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor.]]
The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and [[personal computer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main article|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main article|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&amp;nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
{{Main article|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

===Related disciplines===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]],{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.
{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}
''Electronic systems design'' is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images, and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.

[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=corp_level1&amp;path=education/faqs&amp;file=faqs1.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending on the university. The [[bachelor's degree]] generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]], and a [[list of electrical engineering topics|variety of topics in electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="Enterprise1986"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVHbRM6mU9gC&amp;pg=PA97|date=25 August 1986|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|An example [[circuit diagram]]. It is used as a powerful tool in [[troubleshooting]]. ]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055044/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html |date=16 January 2006 }}, study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicing engineers==

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].&lt;ref name="Labor2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|&lt;span id="demographics_back"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]], or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |accessdate=16 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |archivedate=13 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (see )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Radome]] at the Misawa Air Base Misawa Security Operations Center, Misawa, Japan]]
For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==

Ethnopluralism has been proposed by some in the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] as a means to facilitate nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf|title=The Sociology of the Radical Right|last=Rydgren|first=Jens|date=2007|website=|work=Annual Review of Sociology|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing this policy would require [[ethnic cleansing]] to establish separate territories for different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

Ethnopluralism emphasizes the separation of varying ethnic and cultural groups, in contrast to cultural [[Social integration|integration]] and intra-cultural diversity. It has been part of the ideological foundation of the [[European New Right]], which has used ethnopluralism to express its favoritism towards the cultural identity of individual groups, thus expressing its opposition to heterogeneity within states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Tom|date=2006-08-01|title=The Nouvelle Droite in the 1980s and 1990s: Ideology and Entryism, the Relationship with the Front National|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|journal=French Politics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=158–178|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|issn=1476-3419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views of culture, ethnicity and race have become popular among several right-wing and [[far right|far-right]] groups in [[Europe]] since the 1970s, and has been covered in some [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[left-wing politics|left]] sources (i.e. ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'') also.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003" /&gt;

Ethnopluralists use the concept of cultural differentialism to assert a "right to difference" to propose [[regionalism (politics)|regional policies]] of ethnic and racial [[separatism]]. Among ethnopluralists there is no agreed upon definition of group membership, nor where these hypothetical borders would lie. Some ethnopluralists advocate limiting Europe to "true Europeans", while others propose much smaller divisions, similar to an ethnically-based [[communitarianism]]. While some ethnopluralists would allow European Muslims to remain in Europe, Jews and [[Romani people|Romani]] are typically rejected by ethnopluralists.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt; French [[Nouvelle Droite]] philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]] claims that indigenous cultures in Europe are being threatened, and that [[pan-European nationalism]] based on ethnopluralism would stop this process.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003"/&gt; Benoist has proposed ethnic and social territories be as small as possible, such that Muslims would be allowed ghettos in Europe subordinate to [[sharia]].&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

According to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]], the term "ethnopluralism" was first coined by German sociologist [[Henning Eichberg]] in an essay that was written in opposition to both Western and European [[eurocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin (2013). "Come Hear Our Merry Song:" Shifts in the Sound of Contemporary Swedish Radical Nationalism. Ph.D. Dissertation, Brown University. pages 103-105&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Introduction'''

FIAN International - formerly, FoodFirst Information and Action Network - was founded in 1986 as the first international human rights organization to advocate for the realization of the right to food and nutrition.
Holding a consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, FIAN is active in more than 50 countries, through national sections and seeds groups, which account for 25 of these, as well as individual members and international networks. With no religious or political affiliation dictating its work, FIAN International exposes violations of people's right to food and related rights wherever they may occur and stands up against undue and oppressive practices that prevent people from feeding themselves. 

By holding governments accountable, FIAN International strives to secure people's access to and control over natural resources and means of subsistence, crucial to ensure a life of dignity, now and for future generations. Nutrition, as an inherent component of the right to food, and a fundamental act of food sovereignty, remains a core objective in FIAN's work. As the struggle against gender discrimination and other forms of exclusion is an integral part of its mission, FIAN works with and in favor of the most marginalized and affected groups: its vision is of a world free from hunger, in which every woman, man, boy and girl can fully enjoy their right to food, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. 

FIAN International's Secretariat is based in Heidelberg, Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland.

'''Organizational Structure'''

FIAN is an international membership based organisation. FIAN's institutional members are its national sections which are legal entities in their own right and have their own membership and elected decision-making bodies.

Current sections of FIAN can be found in some 25 countries, for updates look at [http://www.fian.org/about-us/worldwide/ Worldwide]. 

The overall mission, vision and the strategy of FIAN is defined and revised by the International Council (IC), and represented by delegates of the sections who meet once every three years. The IC elects the International Executive Committee (IEC) -headed by the president, which supervises the implementation of FIAN’s strategic plans. The IEC meets bi-annually to review and strategize FIAN programs, methods and budgets. 

The operative working unit being in charge of the execution of FIAN’s programs is its International Secretariat (IS) located in Heidelberg (Germany) and Geneva (Switzerland), and coordinated by the Secretary General.

'''FIAN International's work'''

FIAN uses various working tools to achieve the realization of the right to adequate food.

'''''Case-work and Interventions'''''

At international Fact Finding Missions, FIAN identifies and addresses human rights violations. FIAN interviews people threatened or affected by violations of their right to food and verifies the facts of a situation. Face-to-face contacts to local counterparts are established and serve as a basis for trustful co-operation. On request of those affected, FIAN reacts quickly, analyses the case and mobilises members and supporters worldwide to send out Urgent Action protest letters. Violations are also followed-up in long-term case-work by local FIAN action groups. In close co-operation with the affected communities, FIAN persistently approaches the responsible authorities and identifies breaches of right to food obligations. FIAN’s analysis is based on the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] as interpreted in the UN General Comments, in particular General Comment 12 on the right to adequate food. Existing recourse mechanisms and legal remedies under national and international human rights law are applied to provide redress to the victims.

'''''Lobby and Advocacy'''''

Reliable contacts and networks, a sound documentation of cases and two decades of experience provide a solid basis for effective lobbying and advocating the right to food. FIAN holds states, international institutions and private actors accountable at the national and international levels. The Right to Food Guidelines adopted by the [[FAO]] in 2004 is one of the tools FIAN uses to monitor states’ right to food policies. FIAN tries to improve the existing right to food protection system and to establish new instruments. Intense follow-up work strives to secure the effective implementation of existing instruments, making the right to food politically and judicially enforceable everywhere for everyone.

'''''Information and Education'''''

Targeted information campaigns and awareness-raising on the right to food are at the core of FIAN’s work - to empower social movements and non-governmental organizations to hold states accountable for violations of the right to food, to clarify for governments and other duty-bearers the content and implementation needs of their obligations, and to motivate supporters from civil society to join action against human rights violations. The systematic information gathered from more than 400 individual cases over the past two decades is analyzed and fed into various professional publications.

'''Impact'''

FIAN was involved prominently in the development of the human rights protection system, for instance in the strengthened procedure of State’s and parallel reporting on economic, social, and cultural human rights in the UN human rights system; the elaboration of the UN General Comment No. 12 on the Right to Food in 1999 as the most authoritative legal interpretation of the right to food in international law; and the adoption of the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food” by the FAO member states in 2004.

'''''FIAN’s commitment was awarded internationally:'''''

'''Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award:''' In 2006, FIAN International together with two partners won the Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award, which is given every year on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos, for their commitment in favour of the rights of workers of the Mexican tyre factory Euzkadi.

'''Silver Rose Award:''' In 2005, two staff members of the FIAN Section Germany received the Silver Rose Award for their commitment for the rights of workers in the flower industry, the participation in the development of the International Code of Conduct for the Production of Cut flowers (ICC) and its successful implementation in the framework of the Flower Label Programm (FLP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Fuzzy classification''' is the process of grouping elements into a [[fuzzy set]]&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1965). Fuzzy sets. Information and Control (8), pp. 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[membership function]] is defined by the truth value of a fuzzy propositional function.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, H.-J. (2000). ''Practical Applications of Fuzzy Technologies''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier, A., Schindler, G., &amp; Werro, N. (2008). Fuzzy classification on relational databases. In M. Galindo (Hrsg.), Handbook of research on fuzzy information processing in databases (Bd. II, S. 586-614). Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Amo, A., Montero, J., &amp; Cutello, V. (1999). On the principles of fuzzy classification. Proc. 18th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conf, (S. 675 – 679).&lt;/ref&gt;

A fuzzy class ~C = { i | ~Π(i) } is defined as a fuzzy set ~C of individuals i satisfying a fuzzy classification predicate ~Π which is a fuzzy propositional function. The domain of the fuzzy class operator ~{ .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of fuzzy propositional functions ~PF, and the range is the fuzzy [[powerset]] (the set of fuzzy subsets) of this universe, ~P(U):

~{ .| .}∶V × ~PF ⟶ ~P(U)

A fuzzy propositional function is, analogous to,&lt;ref name="Russel 1919"&gt;Russel, B. (1919). ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., S. 155&lt;/ref&gt; an expression containing one or more variables, such that, when values are assigned to these variables, the expression becomes a fuzzy proposition in the sense of.&lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975"&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1975). Calculus of fuzzy restrictions. In L. A. Zadeh, K.-S. Fu, K. Tanaka, &amp; M. Shimura (Hrsg.), Fuzzy sets and Their Applications to Cognitive and Decision Processes. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, fuzzy classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a ''fuzzy set''. A fuzzy classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its fuzzy classification predicate ~Π.

μ∶~PF × U ⟶ ~T

Here, ~T is the set of fuzzy truth values (the interval between zero and one). The fuzzy classification predicate ~Π corresponds to a fuzzy restriction "i is R" &lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975" /&gt; of U, where R is a fuzzy set defined by a truth function. The degree of membership of an individual i in the fuzzy class ~C is defined by the truth value of the corresponding fuzzy predicate.

μ~C(i):= τ(~Π(i))

==Classification==
Intuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.

A [[class logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Glubrecht, J.-M., Oberschelp, A., &amp; Todt, G. (1983). Klassenlogik. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich: Wissenschaftsverlag.&lt;/ref&gt; is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator { .| .}. A ''class''

C = { i | Π(i) }

is defined as a set C of individuals i satisfying a classification predicate Π which is a propositional function. The domain of the class operator { .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of propositional functions PF, and the range is the powerset of this universe P(U) that is, the set of possible subsets:

{ .| .} ∶V×PF⟶P(U)

Here is an explanation of the logical elements that constitute this definition:
* An individual is a real object of reference.
* A universe of discourse is the set of all possible individuals considered.
* A variable V:⟶R is a function which maps into a predefined range R without any given function arguments: a zero-place function.
* A propositional function is “an expression containing one or more undetermined constituents, such that, when values are assigned to these constituents, the expression becomes a proposition”.&lt;ref name="Russel 1919" /&gt;

In contrast, ''classification'' is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a set. A classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate Π.

μ∶PF × U ⟶ T

The membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership μ of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value τ of the classification predicate Π.

μC(i):=τ(Π(i))

In classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.

[[Image:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|''[[The Geographer]]'' (1668-69), by [[Johannes Vermeer]] ]]

A '''geographer''' is a scientist whose area of study is [[geography]], the study of [[Earth]]'s natural environment and human society. The Greek prefix, "geo," means "earth" and the Greek suffix, "graphy," meaning "description," so a geographer is someone who studies the earth. The word "[[geography]]" is a [[Middle French]] word that is believed to have been first used in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=geography (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/geography |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geographers are historically known as people who make [[maps]], map making is actually the field of study of [[cartography]], a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to the human society and how the human society affects the natural environment.

In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society. Modern geographers are the primary practitioners of the GIS ([[geographic information system]]), who are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms.

The paintings by [[Johannes Vermeer]] titled ''[[The Geographer]]'' and ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668–69.

== Famous Geographers ==
=== Eratosthenes (Greek) ===
The [[ancient Greeks]] discovered much of the knowledge that formed the basis for later scientific and geographical discoveries. [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (born circa 276 BCE in [[Cyrene, Libya]]; died circa 194 BCE in [[Alexandria, Egypt]]) was a Greek [[writer]], [[poet]], [[astronomer]], and geographer who created the first known measurements of the [[Earth#Infobox Physical characteristics|Earth's circumference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eratosthenes |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eratosthenes |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used the angles at which the sun's rays fall on the ground to calculate the curvature of the Earth's surface, which he then used to determine the full horizontal length around the Earth. According to the works of [[Aristotle]], other scientists had estimated the circumference of the Earth prior to Eratosthenes's discovery, but the records of the specific methods and calculations that they used did not survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eratosthenes |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eratosthenes |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hipparchus (Greek) ===
[[Hipparchus]] (born in Nicaea, Bithynia [now Iznik, Turkey]; believed to have died after 127 BC in [[Rhodes]]) is best known for using [[astronomical]] studies to predict the movements and positions of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Hipparchus |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095937997 |website=www.oxfordreference.com |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered the [[equinoxes]] ([[autumnal equinox]] and [[spring equinox]]) and calculated the length of the [[solar year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Collins English Dictionary |title=Hipparchus |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hipparchus |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus was also the first to correctly determine the distance between the earth and the moon (which he believed was equal to 63 times the earth's radius, although it is actually equal to 60 times the earth's radius). Building upon this knowledge, he developed the [[parallax]] theory to explain the apparent displacement of celestial bodies relative to the observer's vantage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Hipparchus |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095937997 |website=www.oxfordreference.com |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Hipparchus |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web. |date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alexander von Humboldt (German) ===
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (born Sept. 14, 1769 in Berlin; died May 6, 1859) was a German geographer, [[naturalist]] and [[explorer]] who made major contributions to the field of [[biogeography]] by producing break-through research on the connection between the [[climate]] of a region and the [[plant life]] growing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records he kept of his travels provided highly valuable data on the geography of [[Central Asia]], which was not very well understood by [[Europeans]] at the time. Furthermore, with the help of [[Sir Edward Sabine]], he was able to prove that the origin of [[storms]] is extraterrestrial by showing the relationship between magnetic storms on [[earth]] with the changing activity of [[sun spots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his latter years, Humboldt published a multi-volume series of books called ''[[Kosmos]]'', wherein he described the structure of the universe as it was then understood. Initially, he published four volumes, which were received with great success and were subsequently translated into almost every European language. Humboldt began work on the fifth volume, but died before it was completed (he was ninety years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humboldt Current]] (also known as the [[Peru Current]]), which was named after him, is an ocean current that holds warm air off a 600-mile coastal region between [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] in [[South America]], thereby keeping the [[climate]] cool. Humboldt had explored this region in 1802, and it is now known for containing the world's richest [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiger |first1=Patrick J. |title=Who Was Alexander von Humboldt and What Is the Humboldt Current? |url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/alexander-von-humboldt-and-humboldt-current.htm |website=science.howstuffworks.com |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web. |date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alfred Russel (A.R.) Wallace (British) ===
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]], also known as A.R. Wallace, (born on Jan. 8, 1823, in [[Usk]], Monmouthshire, Wales; died on Nov. 7, 1913, in Broadstone, [[Dorset, England]]), was a British [[naturalist]], [[geographer]], and [[social critic]] who is most known for formulating the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] before [[Charles Darwin]] published his famous work on the same subject, ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Camerini |first1=Jane R. |title=Alfred Russel Wallace |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Russel-Wallace |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avid traveler and explorer, Wallace became both rich and famous from the work he did identifying new animal [[species]] in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Amazon_rainforest|Amazon region]]. Importantly, Wallace discovered and defined the concept of "[[speciation]]," which he discussed in a paper he published around 1865 describing his research on [[butterflies]]. Speciation refers to defining animal [[species]] based on their interbreeding capabilities; animals within the same species can breed with each other, but not with animals from other species. In this way, individual species can be identified for [[scientific classification]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garrity |first1=Lyn |title=Out of Darwin’s Shadow |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/out-of-darwins-shadow-48274065/ |website=www.smithsonianmag.com |publisher=Smithsonian.com |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Francis Burton (British) ===
[[Sir Richard Francis Burton]] (born on March 19, 1821, in [[Torquay]], Devonshire, [[England]]; died on October 20, 1890, in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]] [now in [[Italy]]]) is known for being the first European to discover [[Lake Tanganyika]] in east Africa and for gaining access to [[Muslim]] cities, which Europeans had previously been forbidden to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brodie |first1=Fawn McKay |title=Sir Richard Burton |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Burton-British-scholar-and-explorer |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be the second deepest and the second largest freshwater lake in the world and is believed to be one of the oldest lakes in the world (approximately twenty million years old by evolutionary timelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lake Tanganyika |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/p/index.php?title=Lake_Tanganyika&amp;oldid=1012460 |website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strabo (Greek) ===
[[Strabo]] (born circa 64 BC in [[Amaseia]], Pontus; died some time after 21 AD) was a Greek geographer and historian who left a remarkably comprehensive written record of all the people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans around 27 BC-14 AD. This record, a book called ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'', also provides information on the technology geographers used to study the world at that time as well as the history of the many of the countries mentioned in his records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strabo: Greek Geographer and Historian |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Strabo |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopeadia Britannica |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Strabo's account is far from perfect (it assumes, for example, that the earth, then called [[oikoumene]], is one giant landmass consisting of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and their associated [[islands]] surrounded by a large [[ocean]]), his writing is highly valued for being a rich compilation of not only his own observations but also the research and ideas of other respected scientific figures and thinkers including [[Eratosthenes]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Polybius]], [[Artemidorus]], [[Apollodorus_of_Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strabo |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/strabo |website=www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muhammad al-Idrisi (Moroccan) ===
[[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (born in 1100 in Ceutah, [[Morocco]]; died around 1165-66 in Ceutah) is known for compiling an enormous  world geography for the Norman King of Sicily, [[Roger II]]. The book, subsequently named the ''[[Book of Roger]]'', was completed in January 1154 and was written as the commentary for a large map of the world created by al-Idrisi (also at the bequest of the King). An avid traveler himself, al-Idrisi relied on contemporary accounts of the world, the works of [[Ptolemy]], as well as geographical literature from Greek, Latin, and Arabic sources to create his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(author unknown) |title=Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Idrisi |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/muhammad-ibn-muhammad-al-idrisi |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography |accessdate=14 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of Roger'' contained fairly accurate information on the countries of Europe and was released in several editions although, as of the mid-1900s, the full text had never been edited.

=== Claudius Ptolemy (Ancient Roman) ===
Claudius Ptolemy, known simply as [[Ptolemy]], (born around 100 AD; died c. 170 AD) was an [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]], and [[geographer]] who lived in [[Alexandria]] and is known for (among other things) drawing detailed maps of what was known of the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Ptolemy |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=14 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's geographical works include tables of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] and a discussion of how such lines could be mathematically calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Science |title=Ptolemy (CA. 100-170) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/ancient-history-egypt-biographies/ptolemy-vii |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ptolemy's most famous work, ''[[Almagest]]'', he comprehensively describes the layout of the stars and other astronomical objects as understood by ancient Greek and Babylonian scientists. He also put forth the idea of an earth-centered universe, an idea widely believed until the 1500s when [[Copernicus]] began to suggest that the earth and other planets in the solar system actually revolve around the [[sun]] (called the ''[[heliocentric]]'' (Sun-centered) theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ptolemy |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ptolemy |website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Gerardus Mercator (Belgian) ===
[[Gerardus Mercator]], originally name Gerard De Cremer or simply Kremer(?) (born on March 5, 1512 in [[Rupelmonde]], [[Flanders]] [now in [[Belgium]]]; died on December 2, 1594 in [[Duisburg]], Duchy of Cleve [now in [[Germany]]]) was a [[cartographer]] famous for creating a heart-shaped representation of the earth (also called the "[[Mercator projection]]" of the earth) in response to a demand for flat [[maps]] that could accurately depict the earth as a [[spherical]] object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cavendish |first1=Richard |title=The Birth of Gerardus Mercator |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/birth-gerardus-mercator |website=https://www.historytoday.com |publisher=History Today Ltd. |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercator was also the first to begin using the term "atlas" to describe a collection of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Gerardus Mercator |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his work, travelers and explorers could maintain a course over long distances using straight lines, thus eliminating the need to constantly adjust their [[compass]] readings in order to keep track of their movements.

=== Charles Lyell (British) ===
[[Charles Lyell]] (1797–1875) was a British [[geologist]] whose theory of [[Uniformitarianism]] significantly impacted the way modern scientists understand the earth's structure and how this structure can change over time. Uniformitarianism overturned the previously accepted theory of [[Catastrophism]], which held that earth's features were formed by sudden, violent forces rather than by gradual changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=A Dictionary of Plant Sciences |title=catastrophism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/geology-and-oceanography/geology-and-oceanography/catastrophism |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell contended that major geological forces in effect today, including [[volcanic eruptions]], [[earthquakes]], and erosion due to [[wind]], [[water]], and [[gravity]], have happened throughout earth's history and are responsible changing its surface features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Sciences |title=Lyell, Charles (1797-1875) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/charles-lyell |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[evolution]] is believed to have gained acceptance in part because of Lyell's efforts to promote gradual biological change rather than change due to sudden, extreme events. Building upon the work of James Hutton, Charles Lyell is also responsible for spreading the idea that older rocks are buried underneath newer ones, which led scientists to begin studying [[fossils]] and [[rock layers]] in order to better understand the history of the earth's [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Sciences |title=Lyell, Charles (1797-1875) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/charles-lyell |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pytheas (Greek) ===
[[Pytheas]], a Greek geographer, astronomer, and explorer who lived around 300 bc near Massalia, [[Gaul]] (a region comprising mostly modern-day [[France]]) is known for producing the first known records of the history of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |title=Pytheas of Massalia |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/pytheas-massalia |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pytheas's most important work, [[Pytheas|''On the Ocean'']], has since been lost, but most of what is known about him was recorded by the Greek historian, [[Polybius]] (approx. 200-118 BC). Through travel and detailed observation, Pytheas noticed that the length of the days increased as he traveled northward and that the [[moon]] affects the [[tides]] in the water. His travels took him to the northernmost parts of [[Europe]] including [[Thule]] (the northernmost inhabited island, roughly six days sail beyond [[Great_Britain|Britain]]) and at least to the [[Arctic Circle]] (possible [[Norway]] or [[Iceland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Pytheas |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pytheas |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=13 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Douglas Mawson (Australian) ===
Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] (born in [[Yorkshire]], England in 1882; died in [[Brighton]], England in 1958) is known for his exploration of [[Antarctica]], although he also studied [[uranium]] and other radioactive materials as a preeminent professor of [[geology]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[Australia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Sir Douglas Mawson |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/sir-douglas-mawson |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=The Gale Group Inc. |accessdate=16 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Edgeworth David]] and Dr. A.F. Mackay, Mawson was the first man to reach the summit of [[Mount Erebus]], an ice-covered volcanic mountain approximately 11,400 feet high. His expeditions led Britain to surrender its claims over the Antarctic territory to [[Australia]] in 1936, and the methods he developed to survive in, and travel through, freezing climates paved the way for subsequent explorations of sub-zero regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Sir Douglas Mawson |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/sir-douglas-mawson |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=The Gale Group Inc. |accessdate=16 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piri Reis (Turkish) ===
[[Piri_Reis|Piri Reis]] (born in 1465 in [[Gelibolu]], Turkey; died in 1553 in [[Egypt]]) is famous for having made one of the oldest known maps (and the oldest Turkish map) of the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Editors, TheFamousPeople.com |title=Piri Reis Biography |url=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/piri-reis-32218.php |website=TheFamousPeople.com |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piri began his career in the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman]]-Turkish navy, rising to fame as an [[admiral]] ("Reis" is Turkish for "admiral" and is not actually part of Piri's birth name) and participating in many battles against Spanish, Genoese, Venetian, and Portuguese naval forces. In fact, it was during his time as a captain that he had the opportunity to show his world map to Sultan [[Selim I]] and Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], which helped to establish his fame as a geographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaimeche |first1=Salah |title=Piri Reis: A Genius 16th-Century Ottoman Cartographer and Navigator |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/piri-reis-genius-16th-century-ottoman-cartographer-and-navigator |website=MuslimHeritage.com |publisher=FSTC Limited |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513, Piri created his first [[Piri_Reis_map|world map]]. Only a third of this map has survived, and it has been found to accurately depict parts of [[North Africa]], the European west coast, and the South American east coast. Between 1524-1525, Piri put together his most well-known geographical work, called ''[[Piri_Reis#Kitab-.C4.B1_Bahriye|Kitāb-ı Baḥrīye]]'', which was 434 pages long and consisted of 290 maps. It was revised and gifted to Suleiman the Magnificent. In 1528, Piri drew a second world map, which was also gifted to Suleiman the Magnificent, and that shows [[Greenland]], parts of North America (from [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the north to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Florida]] in the south), and parts of [[Central America]]. In 1553, Piri Reis was beheaded for refusing to support Kubad Pasha, an Ottoman Vali (Governor), in his campaign against the Portuguese in the northern Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Editors, TheFamousPeople.com |title=Piri Reis Biography |url=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/piri-reis-32218.php |website=TheFamousPeople.com |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamshahri Corpus''' ({{lang-fa|'''پیکره همشهری'''}}) is a sizable [[Persian language|Persian]] corpus based on the Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'', one of the first online [[Persian language|Persian]] newspapers in Iran. It was in initially collected and compiled by Ehsan Darrudi at DBRG Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/ DBRG News] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of Tehran]]. Later a team headed by Ale Ahmad &lt;ref name=ham&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/hamshahri/ Hamshahri] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; built on this corpus and created the first Persian Text Collection suitable for information retrieval evaluation tasks.

This corpus was created by crawling the online news articles from the [[Hamshahri]]'s website and processing the HTML pages to create a standard text corpus for modern [[Information Retrieval]] experiments.

== Version 1.0 ==
The collection contains more than 160,000 articles covering the following subject categories: politics, city news, economics, reports, editorials, literature, sciences, Society, foreign news, sports, etc. The size of the documents varies from short news (under 1 KB) to rather long articles (e.g. 140 KB) with the average of 1.8 KB. 

The corpus is available in several formats for download:&lt;ref name=ham/&gt;
* Tagged Text: 560 MB
* In SQL Server 2000 Tables: 712 MB

== Version 2.0 ==
The second release of Hamshahri Corpus was launched on 20 October 2008. It offers several new features and improvements:
* '''More News:''' 323,616 Text Stories in 3206 XML files (a file for each day)
* '''Increased Time Span:''' From 22 June 1996 to 13 May 2007
* '''Bigger in Size:''' 1.42 GB uncompressed
* '''Standard Container:''' Unicode XML
* '''Included Images:''' images have been extracted from the news and preserved (available in an additional package), which makes it suitable for Image Retrieval tasks.
* '''Categorized News:''' the news stories have been categorized semi-automatically (appropriate for Text Categorization and Classification tasks).

The corpus is available for download in XML format.

'''''He Who Gets Slapped''''' is a [[1924 in film|1924]] American [[silent film|silent]] [[tragedy]] and [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Lon Chaney]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; November 12, 1924, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; November 8, 1924, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by [[Victor Sjöström]]. The film is based on the Russian play ''Тот, кто получает пощёчины'' ("He Who Gets Slapped", transliterated as ''Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny'') by playwright [[Leonid Andreyev]], which was published in 1914 and in English, as ''He Who Gets Slapped'', in 1922.&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/he-who-gets-slapped-12746 ''He Who Gets Slapped''] at the Internet Broadway Database, retrieved Oct. 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.

''He Who Gets Slapped'' was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for [[Goldwyn Pictures Corporation]] in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged.

The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sjöström. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paul Beaumont ([[Lon Chaney]]) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind.  Baron Regnard ([[Marc McDermott]]) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron.

On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.

Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself "HE who gets slapped", the star attraction of a small circus near [[Paris]]. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of Science.

Another of the performers is Bezano ([[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo ([[Norma Shearer]]), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo and her father, however, are planning to restore the family's fortunes with a marriage to her father's wealthy friend.

One night, during HE's performance, he spots the baron in the audience. The baron goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.

When her father leaves for a meeting with the baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The baron discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.

Later, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the baron and the count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the baron after the night's performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the baron. HE threatens the baron, but the count stabs him with a sword.

The baron and the count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.

'''''How Green Was My Valley''''' is a 1939 novel by [[Richard Llewellyn]], narrated by Huw Morgan, the main character, about his Welsh family and the [[Mining in Wales|mining]] community in which they live. The author had claimed that he based the book on his own personal experiences but this was found to be untrue after his death; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent.&lt;ref name="Wales Arts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/richard-llewellyn/index.shtml | title=Richard Llewellyn| publisher=BBC Wales | date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in [[Gilfach Goch]].&lt;ref name="Wales Arts"/&gt;

The title of the novel appears in two sentences. It is first used in Chapter Thirty, after the narrator has had his first sexual experience. He sits up to "...&amp;nbsp;look down in the valley." He then reflects: "How green was my Valley that day, too, green and bright in the sun." The phrase is used again in the novel's last sentence: "How green was my Valley then, and the Valley of them that have gone."

In the United States, Llewellyn won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1941&gt;
"Books and Authors", ''The New York Times'', 16 February 1941, page BR12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel is set in [[South Wales]] during the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It tells the story of the Morgans, a respectable mining family of the [[South Wales Valleys]], through the eyes of one of the sons, Huw Morgan.

Huw's academic ability sets him apart from his elder brothers and enables him to consider a future away from the dangerous coal mines. His five brothers and his father are miners. After his eldest brother, Ivor, is killed in a [[mining accident]], Huw moves in with his sister-in-law, Bronwen, with whom he has always been in love &lt;ref&gt;Due to this character, the female first name "Bronwen" - hitherto known only in Wales - was introduced to the English-speaking public at large (see Sheard, K. M. (2011), {{Google books|FVyHTUQnnBgC|Llewellyn’s Complete Book of Names|page=110}}, {{ISBN|9780738723686}}).&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of Huw's three sisters, Angharad, marries the wealthy mine owner's son – whom she does not love – and the marriage is an unhappy one. She never overcomes her clandestine relationship with the local minister.

Huw's father is later killed in a mine explosion. After everyone Huw has known either dies or moves away, and the town is reduced to a contaminated shell, he decides to leave, and tells the story of his life just before going away.

==Characters==
'''The Older Morgans:'''
*Gwilym Morgan, Huw's father: wants things done properly, with attention to manners, and a minding of one's own business
*Beth Morgan, Huw's mother: devoted to her children and husband, uneducated, struggles with her temper
*Bronwen, sister-in-law: A gentle character to whom Huw goes when he is troubled or wants to learn information that the adults hold from him.  She is the mother of Gareth.
*Ivor Morgan, Huw's eldest brother, marries Bronwen, sides with the father against the strike, defends Angharad against Iestyn Evans' initial familiarity.

'''The Middle Brothers:'''
These are Huw's young adult brothers.  Ianto goes to London to find work early in the book, but returns unhappily; Owen and Gwilym do the same later.

*Ianto Morgan, Huw's second oldest brother
*Davy Morgan, a leader in the union
*Owen Morgan, an inventor, often found in the shed behind the house working on an engine
*Gwilym Morgan (junior), with his wife, Marged

'''The Younger Morgans:''' 
*Angharad Morgan, Huw's sister, marries Iestyn Evans
*Ceridwen Morgan, Huw's sister, marries Blethyn
*Huw Morgan, the Narrator
*Olwen Morgan, Huw's youngest sister
*Gareth Morgan, Huw's nephew

'''Other Characters:'''
*Merddyn Gruffydd, the preacher who is loved by Angharad, helps Huw recover from his illness, and is supportive of the Morgans.
*Iestyn Evans, an arrogant dandy, son of the mine owner, who courts Angharad.  According to Young Gwilym, "a purse-proud ninny" (chapters 15, 22, 23, etc.)
*Master Jonas, an arrogant teacher who makes Huw's life miserable.  He is pro-English, and ashamed of his Welsh heritage (chapters 16, 18, 19, &amp; 21)
*Ceinwen Phillips, a manipulative young girl in love with Huw (chapters 24, 25, 26)
*Elias the Shop, enemy of the Morgan family (chapters 8 &amp; 14)
*Dai Bando, Huw's boxing teacher (chapter 16)

==First printing==
The first edition was published in 1939 by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph Ltd]], London, set and printed in Great Britain by William Brendon &amp; Son, Ltd., at the Mayflower Press, Plymouth, in Walbaum type, twelve point, leaded, on a toned opaque-wove paper made by [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]], and bound by [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=How+Green+Was+My+Valley "20th-Century American Bestsellers – Llewellyn, Richard: How Green Was My Valley" at www3.isrl.illinois.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004063515/http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=How+Green+Was+My+Valley |date=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[Octavo|8vo]] size.

*"Bookseller's Favorite Fiction" ([[Publishers Weekly|Publisher's Weekly]], v. 139, p.837) United States 1941--&gt;

==Sequels==
The author continued the story of Huw Morgan's life in three sequels:

*''Up Into the Singing Mountain'' (1960) – Huw emigrates to the [[Y Wladfa|Welsh colony]] in [[Patagonia]], Argentina
*''Down Where the Moon is Small'' (1966) – Huw's life in Argentina
*''[[Green, Green My Valley Now]]'' (1975) – Huw returns to Wales

==Adaptations==
{{main article|How Green Was My Valley (film)}}

The 1941 Hollywood film adaptation, which was highly successful, had a cast that included [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Anna Lee]], [[Roddy McDowall]] (as Huw), [[Donald Crisp]], and [[Barry Fitzgerald]]. None of the leading players was Welsh (though Welsh actor Rhys Williams made his screen debut in the film in a minor role). Directed by John Ford, ''How Green Was My Valley'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. ''How Green Was My Valley'' is available on DVD from [[20th Century Fox]] as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

The book has twice been adapted by the [[BBC]] for television, in 1960 and 1975. The [[How Green Was My Valley (mini-series)|1975 production]]– scripted by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]]&amp;nbsp;– starred [[Stanley Baker]], [[Siân Phillips]], and [[Nerys Hughes]].

The novel was adapted as a Broadway musical, called ''[[A Time for Singing]]'', which opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 21 May 1966. The music was by John Morris; book and lyrics were by Gerald Freedman and John Morris. The production was directed by Mr. Freedman, and it starred Ivor Emmanuel, Tessie O'Shea, Shani Wallis, and Laurence Naismith.

A stage version, adapted by [[Shaun McKenna]] was performed at the [[Royal Theatre (Northampton)|Theatre Royal]] in [[Northampton]] in 1990.  It marked the stage debut of [[Aled Jones]] as the teenage Huw. It was directed by [[Michael Napier Brown]] and designed by Ray Lett.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shaunmckenna.net/#/how-green-was-my-valley/4559746578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the book was also adapted as a short film for the use in the music video&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/564107696/alt-j-make-a-breathtaking-short-film-for-pleader|title=alt-J Make A Breathtaking Short Film For 'Pleader'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the song Pleader&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2017/11/15/alt-j-pleader-video-epic-share|title=Alt-J essentially make their own period drama for their 'Pleader' video|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the band [[alt-J]]. The music video adaptation takes some liberties in retelling the story, with the catastrophic family deaths being caused by a landslide, which was caused by a German V2 rocket during WWII rather than a mine explosion.

The '''ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility''' is a part of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in [[Padova]], [[Veneto]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/iter-neutral-beam-test-facility-construction-is-progressing-fast-in-padova/&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is being built to host the full-scale prototype of the reactor's neutral beam injector, MITICA, and a smaller prototype of its ion source, SPIDER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stacks.iop.org/0029-5515/55/i=8/a=083025 V. Toigo, D. Boilson, T. Bonicelli, R. Piovan, M. Hanada, et al. 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55:8 083025]&lt;/ref&gt; SPIDER is planned to start its operation in December 2017. SPIDER will be used to optimize the ion beam source, to optimize the use of cesium vapor, and to verify the uniformity of the extracted ion beam also during long pulses.

== ITER Heating Neutral Beams ==

To deliver power, two heating [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injectors]] provide the power of 17MW each to a four-meter diameter container containing burning fusion plasma. This is the main auxiliary heating system of the reactor. &lt;!-- To reach the container center, an about 1MeV deuterium beam having is required.  why is this important here? --&gt;Due to its low conversion efficiency, the neutral beam injector first needs to start a precursor negative ion beam of 40A, and then neutralizes it by passing it through a gas cell (&lt;60%), and then by a residual ion dump (the remaining 40% — 20% negative, 20% positive). The neutralized beam is then dumped on a [[calorimeter]] during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further reionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]
==The ITER Heating Neutral Beams==
The ITER Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the main auxiliary heating system of the [[ITER]] plasma: each of the two Heating Neutral Beam (HNB) injectors will provide 17MW to the fusion plasma. In order to reach the center of the burning plasma with radius of 2 meters, a

deuterium beam having energy of around 1MeV is required. Due to the low conversion efficiency of NBI systems, to provide the required power to the plasma a precursor negative ion beam of 40A is necessary. The ion beam crosses a gas cell where it is partially neutralized (&lt;60%) with the remaining ions (20% negative, 20% positive ions) removed by the next component of the beam line, the so called residual ion dump. The neutral beam is then dumped on a calorimeter during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further re-ionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.--&gt;

== Purposes ==

The role of the test facility includes research and development on the following topics:
* voltage holding: due to neutron environment, this will be the first beam source at -1MV with vacuum insulation instead of gas insulation (SF_6 gas is typically used);
* negative ion formation: the requirement on the extracted current density from the cesiated ion source is at the limit of the present technology of plasma ion sources. 
* beam optics: the precursor ion beam is generated in a multigrid electrostatic accelerator, having 1280 apertures in each of the 7 grids composing it. Since the overall width of the beam along the beam drift (about 25 meters) is due to the optics of each of the 1280 beamlets, the grid alignment and the disturbances produced by magnetic fields and electrostatic error fields are to be carefully verified.
* vacuum pumps: two 8m long, 1.6m high cryopumps will be installed on each side of the vacuum vessel. The fatigue life of components operating with cycles between 4K and 400K is to be verified.
* heat load on mechanical components: on the electrodes used for beam acceleration, and along the beam path, mechanical components are subject to very high thermal loads. These loads are continuously applied during long pulses, up to 1h. These loads are anyhow lower than the heat loads expected on the ITER divertor plates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">Policy '''Impact Assessments''' (IAs) are formal, evidence-based procedures that assess the economic, social, and environmental effects of [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelle|first=Camilla|author2=Weiland, Sabine |title=Policy assessment: the state of the art|journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal|date=2012|volume=30|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1080/14615517.2012.663256}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been incorporated into policy making in the [[OECD]] countries and the [[European Commission]].

Key types of impact assessments include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and [[environmental impact assessment]] (project level). Impact assessments can focus on specific themes, such as [[social impact assessment]]s and gender impact assessments.

IAs can improve legislation by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Klaus|author2=Ferretti, Johanna |author3=Guske, Anna-Lena |author4=Turnpenny, John |author5=Jordan, Andrew |author6= Adelle, Camilla |title=Sustainability in Impact Assessments A Review of Impact Assessment Systems in selected OECD countries and the European Commission|journal=OECD|date=2011|volume=SG/SD(2011)6/FINAL|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/Sustainability%20in%20impact%20assessment%20SG-SD%282011%296-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informing policy makers about potential economic, social, and environmental ramifications
* Improving transparency so that contributions to sustainability and "better regulation" are disclosed and [[Special Interest Group|special interest]] [[lobbying]] is discouraged
* Increasing public participation in order to reflect a range of considerations, thereby improving the legitimacy of policies
* Clarifying how public policy helps achieve its goals and priorities through policy indicators
* Contributing to continuous learning in policy development by identifying causalities that inform ex-post review of policies

== Procedure ==
The department which is responsible for the policy proposal usually has to carry out the IA. Although the purpose and orientation of IA procedures differ, IA guidelines in the various jurisdictions all follow a similar set of steps to be followed by desk officers:
# Planning of the IA
# Carrying out the impact analysis
# Consultation of affected stakeholders and the general public
# Coordination with affected departments
# Summary and presentation of findings in a report
# Forwarding findings to decision makers
# Publication of the IA report (not in all countries)

The analytical steps, which mainly relate to step 2, can be set out as
i.	Problem definition
ii.	Definition of policy objectives
iii.	Development of policy options
iv.	Analysis of impacts
v.	Comparison of policy options and recommendation of one option
vi.	Defining monitoring measures.

== Methods ==
Throughout the IA process, methods can be used for support. In recent years governments have increasingly invested in developing and applying methods and tools for IA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podhora|first=Aranka |author2=Helming, K |author3=Adenäuer, L. |author4=Heckelei, T. |author5=Kautto, P. |author6=Reidsma, P. |author7=Rennings, K. |author8=Turnpenny, J. |author9=Jansen, J.|title=).

Depending on usage, IA methods can be classified as methods for
* Scoping (e.g., checklists)
* For qualitative analysis (e.g., [[focus groups]])
* For quantitative analysis (e.g., [[life-cycle assessment]], [[material flow accounting]], modelling)
* Aggregation and comparison of options (e.g., [[cost–benefit analysis]])
* Analysing coherence (e.g., Gender IA)
* Supporting participation and involvement (e.g., internet consultation)
* Data presentation and involvement (e.g., [[GIS]])
* [[Monitoring and evaluation]] (e.g., indicators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LIAISE – Network of Excellence|title=LIAISE KIT – Knowledge for Decision Making|url=http://www.liaise-kit.eu/|accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Burden was born in [[Oxford]], the daughter of a [[stable]]man, Robert Burden, and his wife Ann Maizey, who was a laundress. At the time of her birth, her parents were living at St Helen's Passage, in the parish of [[St Peter-in-the-East]], off [[Holywell Street]] in Oxford which has since been marked with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola, Cinderella story and others''[[Oxfordshire Limited Edition]]'', no. 249, pages 23–25, October 2007; and [http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/burden.html picture of blue plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Ann was [[wikt:illiterate|illiterate]] and probably came to Oxford as a [[Domestic service|domestic servant]]. Little is known of Jane Burden's childhood, but it was poor and deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jane &amp; May Morris: A Biographical Story|last=Marsh|first=Jan|publisher=Printed Word|year=2000|isbn=|location=Horsham, UK|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1857, Burden and her sister Elizabeth, known as "Bessie," attended a performance of the [[Drury Lane]] Theatre Company in Oxford. Jane Burden was noticed by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who were members of a group of artists painting the [[Oxford Union murals]], based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tales. Struck by her beauty, they asked her to [[Model (art)|model]] for them. Burden sat mostly for Rossetti as a model for Queen [[Guinevere]] and afterwards for [[William Morris]], who was working on an easel painting, ''La Belle [[Iseult]]'', now in the [[Tate Gallery]]. During this period, Morris fell in love with Burden and they became engaged, though by her own admission she was not in love with Morris.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Burden's education was limited and she was probably destined to go into [[domestic service]] like her mother. After her engagement, she was privately educated to become a gentleman's wife. Her keen intelligence allowed her to recreate herself. She was a voracious reader who became proficient in French and Italian, and she became an accomplished pianist with a strong background in [[European classical music|classical music]]. Her manners and speech became refined to an extent that contemporaries referred to her as "Queenly." Later in life, she had no trouble moving in upper-class circles. She was possibly the model for the heroine of the 1884 novel ''Miss Brown'' by [[Vernon Lee]] upon which [[George Bernard Shaw]] based the character of Eliza Doolittle in his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1914) and the later film ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). She also became a skilled needlewoman who would be later renowned for her embroideries.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane married William Morris at [[St Michael at the Northgate]] in Oxford on 26 April 1859. Her father was described as a [[Groom (horses)|groom]], in stables at 65 [[Holywell Street]]. After the marriage, the Morrises lived at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent. While living there, they had two daughters, [[Jane Alice Morris|Jane Alice]] "Jenny," born in January 1861, and [[May Morris|Mary "May"]] (March 1862–1938), who later edited her father's works. They moved to 26 Queen Square in London, which they shared with the design firm of [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co]]., and later bought Kelmscott House in [[Hammersmith]] as their main residence.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1871, Morris and Rossetti took out a joint tenancy on [[Kelmscott Manor]] on the Gloucestershire–[[Oxfordshire]]–[[Wiltshire]] borders. William Morris went to [[Iceland]], leaving his wife and Rossetti to furnish the house and spend the summer there. Jane Morris had become closely attached to Rossetti and became a favourite muse of his. Their relationship is reputed to have started in 1865 and lasted, on differing levels, until his death in 1882. They shared a deep emotional relationship, and she inspired Rossetti to write poetry and create some of his best paintings. Her discovery of his dependence on the drug, [[chloral hydrate]], which was taken for insomnia, eventually led her to distance herself from him, although they stayed in touch until he died in 1882.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1884, Jane Morris met the poet and political activist [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] at a house party given by her close friend, [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]] (later Countess of Carlisle). There appears to have been an immediate attraction between them. By 1887 at the latest, they had become lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Their sexual relationship continued until 1894 and they remained close friends until his death.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane Morris was an ardent supporter of [[Irish Home Rule]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

A few months before her death, she bought Kelmscott Manor to secure it for her daughters' future. However, she did not return to the house after having purchased it. Jane Morris died on 26 January 1914, while staying at 5 Brock Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. She is buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church in [[Kelmscott]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

: 
'''Limmu''' was an [[Assyria]]n [[eponym]]. At the beginning of the reign of an Assyrian king, the limmu, an appointed royal official, would preside over the New Year festival at the capital. Each year a new limmu would be chosen.  Although picked by lot, there was most likely a limited group, such as the men of the most prominent families or perhaps members of the city assembly.  The Assyrians used the name of the limmu for that year to designate the year on official documents. Lists of limmus have been found accounting for every year between 892 BC and 648 BC.

During the [[Assyria|Old Assyrian]] period, the king himself was never the ''limmum'', as it was called in their language.  In the [[Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]] periods, however, the king could take this office.

The '''Maon Synagogue''' is a 6th-century [[synagogue]] and archaeological site located in the [[Negev Desert]] near Kibbutz [[Nirim]] and Kibbutz [[Nir Oz]].   It is noted for its "magnificent" [[mosaic]] floor.&lt;ref name=Schaalje&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/99mag/maon/maon.htm] "Mamshit &amp; the Ancient Synagogue of Maon, Jacqueline Schaalje, Jewish Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological finds==
[[Image:Nirim Mosaic1.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic detail]]
The original date of the synagogue is uncertain but is before the 6th century.  In a sixth-century renovation, the northern wall (closest to [[Jerusalem]]) was opened and a semi-circular [[apse]] to contain a [[Torah Ark]] was constructed.  The floor level was raised and marble columns and a "breathtakingly beautiful"  mosaic floor installed.&lt;ref name=IAA&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1513&amp;module_id=#as] "One of the Most Spectacular Mosaic Floors Ever Discovered in Israel was Restored and Renovated and Can Now be Seen by the General Public," (30/3/09), Israel Antiquities Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of the mosaic floor is an  [[amphora]] flanked by a pair of peacocks.  A vine flows out of the amphora, forming loops, in each loop is a bird, animal, fruit, or a depiction of steps in the wine making process.   The design is  so similar to the mosaics in the church floor at nearby Shallal that they are thought to have been designed by the same artist.  Both floors depict animals and have similar patterns: the synagogue floor is distinguished by a menorah flanked by two lions and several other Jewish ritual objects.  The seven-branched menorah stands on three legs, like the menorah in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The legs in Maon are shaped like a lion's paws. Alongside the menorah are the symbols of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], palm trees and lions.  [[Etrog]]s,  a [[shofar]] and a [[lulav]] are depicted nearby.   The Mosaic has an inscription in Aramaic.  The upper part of the inscription blesses all members of the community, the lower part honors three donors.&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land, Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  An identical floor was found in the ancient synagogue in Gaza.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue is built on the [[basilica]] plan.  The mosaic is in the central area, the two side aisles were paved with stone.  The ceiling was made of wooden beams and clay.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

A number of small objects were found by the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] on the floor facing the [[Torah Ark]].  These include coins and bone and metal [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that are thought to have been associated with the Torah Ark and its ornamental curtain.  There were also  fragments of glass and ceramic lamps.  Dozens of amulets were also found, some of them were used by women who were asking for good health.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

Adjacent to the ruins of the synagogue a cistern, water channels and a [[mikvah]].&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;

==History==
The synagogue was built at the site of Hellenistic [[Menois]], a city marked on the [[Map of Madaba]]. It is one of three ancient synagogues discovered in the western [[Negev]].&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue and its mosaic floor were discovered during the construction of a road in 1957. The mosaic was damaged, but the undamaged segment was preserved by a salvage excavation. After its discovery, the mosaic was neglected, causing deterioration.  Restoration work began in 2006, sponsored by the [[Jewish National Fund]], [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and Eshkol Regional Council, and paid for by philanthropist [[Sandy Galet]]. The mosaic was lifted off its original foundation and carefully cleaned.  A new foundation was installed and the mosaic was securely attached.  The mosaic is now protected and was opened to the public in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiannewstoday.com/christian_news_report_227.html ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE'S MOSAIC FLOOR RESTORED TO ORIGINAL BEAUTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121144/http://www.christiannewstoday.com/Christian_News_Report_227.html |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130674]"1,500-year-old Mosaic Floor Unveiled in Ancient Synagogue Ruins,"  03/30/09, Israel National News,   Hana Levi Julian.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''model spectrum''' is an artificial [[spectrum]] of a [[star]] made by recreating the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] features seen in the spectrum. A model spectrum will usually be of a specific [[spectral type]] of [[star]]. It may include other properties of the star, such as a surrounding [[nebula]], presence or lack of an extended [[atmosphere]], or a [[circumstellar dust]] [[accretion disk|disc]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

[[File:Moonfromoakland04052006.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] is the most often viewed major object in the night sky, while sometimes visible during [[daytime]].]]
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|The [[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The term '''night sky''', usually associated with [[astronomy]] from [[Earth]], refers to the [[night]]time appearance of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] like [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Moon]], which are visible in a clear [[sky]] between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], when the [[Sun]] is below the [[horizon]].

Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and [[airglow]], depending on location and timing. [[Aurora]]e light up the skies above the [[polar circle]]s. Occasionally, a large [[coronal mass ejection]] from the Sun or simply high levels of [[solar wind]] may extend the phenomenon toward the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="Northern Lights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yukon |first1=Northwestel |title=Aurora Borealis Explained |url=http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html |publisher=Northern Lights Centre |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, [[farmer]]s have used the status of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to [[agriculture|plant crops]]. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deity|deities]].

The [[history of astrology|anciently developed]] belief of [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The ''scientific'' study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of [[observational astronomy]].



The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by [[light pollution]]. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of [[sky brightness|ambient brightness]]. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. [[Optical filter]]s and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] seek locations far from [[urban area|urban]] [[skyglow]].

== Brightness ==
{{Main|Sky brightness}}

[[File:Starry Night at La Silla.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at [[La Silla Observatory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starry Night at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1333a/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight ([[Rayleigh scattering]]) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]] defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]],  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

[[File:Паранальские ночи.jpg|thumb|[[Paranal Observatory]] nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paranal Nights|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1401a/|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[noctcaelador]] tackles the aesthetic perception of the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99238.htm |title=Number of Stars in the Sky |last1=Hawley |work=NEWTON Ask A Scientist |publisher=US Department of Energy |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for [[stereopsis]] to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the [[rod cell]]s without triggering the [[cone cell]]s.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, [[averted vision]] may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because [[stargazing]] is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red [[flashlight]] (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See [[Purkinje effect]]).

[[File:Milky_way_-route_292_shiga_kusatsu_road-_1920x1080.webm|thumb|500px|center|Video of the night sky taken with [[DSLR camera]]s in [[Japan]].]]

=== Constellations ===
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many [[star chart|sky maps]] to aid stargazers in identifying [[constellation]]s and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html |title=Orion |first=Chris |last=Dolan |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Dipper]] (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to [[Polaris]], the north star.

The [[pole star]]s are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
[[Planet]]s, named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "wanderer," process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. [[Venus]] is the most prominent planet, often called the "morning star" or "evening star" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only "star" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are also visible to the naked eye.

=== The Moon ===
Earth's [[Moon]] is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified.  Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of [[lunar phase]]s.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the [[moon illusion]] which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
[[Comet]]s come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a [[great comet]] appears about once a decade.  They tend to be  visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

=== Clouds===
[[Cloud]]s obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects.  A very thin [[cirrus cloud]] in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down.  Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
{{wide image|Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|500px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a very large streak or arc across the night sky if the [[visibility]] conditions are good enough. This [[panoramic]] photo was taken at [[Death Valley]].}}

[[File:Where Heaven and Earth Collide.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: [[Milky Way#Halo|halo]] and [[Disc galaxy|disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Heaven and Earth Collide|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1635a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the [[Milky Way]], a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The [[Magellanic Clouds]] of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].

[[Zodiacal light]] is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial [[satellite]]s often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in [[low Earth orbit]] cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including [[space debris]], appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. [[Satellite flare|Satellite flares]] can appear brighter than [[Venus]], with notable examples including the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium Satellites]].

[[Meteor]]s (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a [[meteor shower]], they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

[[Aircraft]] are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to control engineering:

'''[[Control engineering]]''' &amp;ndash; engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed).

'''Production engineering''' is a combination of [[manufacturing]] technology, [[engineering]] sciences with [[management science]]. A production engineer typically has a wide knowledge of [[engineering]] practices and is aware of the management challenges related to production. The goal is to accomplish the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way.

Production engineering encompasses the application of [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]], machining processing, [[joiner|joining processes]], metal cutting &amp; tool design, [[metrology]], machine tools, [[machining]] systems, [[automation]], jigs and fixtures, die and mould design, material science, design of automobile parts, and machine designing and manufacturing.  Production engineering also overlaps substantially with [[manufacturing engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]].  The names are often interchangeable.

In [[industry]], once the design is realized, production engineering concepts regarding work-study, [[ergonomics]], [[operation research]], manufacturing management, [[materials management]], [[production planning]], etc., play important roles in efficient production processes. These deal with [[integrated design]] and efficient planning of the entire manufacturing system, which is becoming increasingly complex with the emergence of sophisticated production methods and control systems.

== Production engineer ==
The production engineer possesses a wide set of skills, competences and attitudes based on market and scientific knowledge. These abilities are fundamental for the performance of coordinating and integrating professionals of multidisciplinary teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.ufscar.br/curso.php |title=O  Engenheiro de Produção da UFSCar está apto a |trans-title=Production Engineer UFSCar is able to |language=Portuguese |publisher=Departamento de Engenharia de Produção (DEP) |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production engineer should be able to:
* '''Scale and integrate resources.''' Usually required to consider physical, human and financial resources at high efficiency and low cost, yet considering the possibility of continuous further improvement;
* '''Make proper use of math and statistics''' to model production systems during decision making process;
* '''Design, implement and refine products, services, processes and systems''' taking in consideration that constraints and particularities of the related communities;
* '''Predict and analyze the demand'''. Select among scientific and technological appropriate knowledge in order to design, redesign or improve product/service functionality;
* '''Incorporate concepts and quality techniques''' along all the productive system. Deploy organizational standards for control proceedings and auditing;
* '''Stay up-to-date with technological developments''', enabling them to enterprises and society;
* '''Understand the relation between production systems and the environment'''. This relates to the use of scarce resources, production rejects and sustainability;
* '''Manage and optimize flow''' (information and production flow).

Work opportunities are available in [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]] manufacturing organizations engaged in implementation, development and management of new production processes, information and control systems, and computer controlled inspection, assembly and handling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10457">In [[theoretical computer science]], and specifically [[computational complexity theory]], '''proof complexity''' is the field aiming to understand and analyse the computational resources that are required to prove or refute statements. Research in proof complexity is predominantly concerned with proving proof-length lower and upper bounds in various propositional proof systems. For example, among the major challenges of proof complexity is showing that the usual propositional-calculus does not admit polynomial-size proofs of all tautologies (the actual formalization of a propositional-calculus is immaterial here, since all natural formalizations have been proved to be polynomially-identical); here the size of the proof is simply the number of symbols in it, and a proof is said to be of polynomial size if it is polynomial in the size of the tautology it proves. 

Systematic study of proof complexity began with the work of Cook and Reckhow (1979) who provided the basic definition of a propositional proof system from the perspective of computational complexity. Specifically Cook and Reckhow  observed that proving proof size lower bounds on stronger and stronger propositional proof systems can be viewed as a step towards separating NP from coNP (and thus P from NP), since the existence of a propositional proof system that admits polynomial size proofs for all tautologies implies that NP=coNP.

Contemporary proof complexity research draws ideas and methods from many areas in computational complexity, algorithms and mathematics. Since many important algorithms and algorithmic techniques can be cast as proof search algorithms for certain proof systems, proving lower bounds on these proof sizes implies run time lower bounds on the corresponding algorithms.

Mathematical logic can also serve as a framework to study propositional proof sizes. Specifically weak fragments of Peano Arithmetic, which come under the name Bounded Arithmetic theories, serve as a uniform version of propositional proofs, corresponding to different propositional proof systems.

==Polynomiality of proofs==

Different [[propositional proof system|propositional proof systems]] for propositional logic, such as the [[sequent calculus]], the [[cutting-plane method]], [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]], etc., may provide different proofs for the same formula. Proof complexity measures the efficiency of the proof system usually in terms of the minimal size of proofs possible in the system for a given tautology (or dually, and unsatisfiable formula).

Two points make the study of proof complexity non-trivial:

# the size of a proof depends on the formula that is to be proved inconsistent;
# proof methods are generally families of algorithms, as some of their steps are not univocally specified; for example, resolution is based on iteratively choosing a pair of clauses containing opposite literals and producing a new clause that is a consequence of them; since several such pairs may be available at each step, the algorithm has to choose one; these choices affect the proof length.

The first point is taken into account by comparing the size of a proof of a formula with the size of the formula. This comparison is made using the usual assumptions of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]: first, a polynomial proof size/formula size ratio means that the proof is of size similar to that of the formula; second, this ratio is studied in the asymptotic case as the size of the formula increases.

The second point is taken into account by considering, for each formula, the shortest possible proof the considered method can produce.

The question of polynomiality of proofs is whether a method can always produce a proof of size polynomial in the size of the formula. If such a method exists, then [[NP (complexity)|NP]] would be equal to [[coNP]]: this is why the question of polynomiality of proofs is considered important in computational complexity. For some methods, the existence of formulae whose shortest proofs are always superpolynomial has been proved. For other methods, it is an open question.

==Proof size comparison==

A second question about proof complexity is whether a method is more efficient than another. Since the proof size depends on the formula, it is possible that one method can produce a short proof of a formula and only long proofs of another formula, while a second method can have exactly the opposite behavior.  The assumptions of measuring the size of the proofs relative to the size of the formula and considering only the shortest proofs are also used in this context.

When comparing two proof methods, two outcomes are possible:

# for every proof of a formula produced using the first method, there is a proof of comparable size of the same formula produced by the second method;
# there exists a formula such that the first method can produce a short proof while all proofs obtained by the second method are consistently larger.

Several proofs of the second kind involve contradictory formulae expressing the negation of the [[pigeonhole principle]], namely that &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; pigeons can fit &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; holes with no hole containing two or more pigeons.

==Automatizability==

A proof method is automatizable if one of the shorter proofs of a formula can always be generated in time polynomial (or sub-exponential) in the size of the proof. Some methods, but not all, are automatizable. Automatizability results are  not in contrast with the assumption that the [[polynomial hierarchy]] does not collapse, which would happen if generating a proof in time polynomial in the size ''of the formula'' were always possible.

==Interpolation==

Consider a tautology of the form &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z) &lt;/math&gt;.  The tautology is true for every choice of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and after fixing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are independent because are defined on disjoint sets of variables.  This means that it is possible to define an ''interpolant'' circuit &lt;math&gt;C(y)&lt;/math&gt;, such that both &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow C(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; hold.  The interpolant circuit decides either if &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is false or if &lt;math&gt;B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is true, by only considering &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  The nature of the interpolant circuit can be arbitrary.  Nevertheless, it is possible to use a proof of the initial tautology &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z) &lt;/math&gt; as a hint on how to construct &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  Some proof systems (e.g. resolution) are said to have ''efficient interpolation'' because the interpolant &lt;math&gt;C(y)&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently computable from any proof of the tautology &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; in such proof system.  The efficiency is measured with respect to the length of the proof: it is easier to compute interpolants for longer proofs, so this property seems to be anti-monotone in the strength of the proof system.

Interpolation is a weak form of automatization: a way to deduce the existence of small circuits from the existence of small proofs.  In particular the following three statements cannot be simultaneously true: (a) &lt;math&gt;A(x,y) \rightarrow B(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; has a short proof in a some proof system; (b) such proof system has efficient interpolation; (c) the interpolant circuit solves a computationally hard problem.  It is clear that (a) and (b) imply that there is a small interpolant circuit, which is in contradiction with (c).  Such relation allows to turn proof length upper bounds into lower bounds on computations, and dually to turn efficient interpolation algorithms into lower bounds on proof length.

==Non-classical logics==

The idea of comparing the size of proofs can be used for any automated reasoning procedure that generates a proof. Some research has been done about the size of proofs for propositional non-classical logics, in particular, intuitionistic, modal, and non-monotonic logics.

[[File:Delta 6920-10 launch with ROSAT.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Launch of the ROSAT in [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]].]]
'''ROSAT''' (short for '''Röntgensatellit''', in German X-rays are called Röntgenstrahlen, in honour of [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]) was a [[German Aerospace Center]]-led satellite [[X-ray telescope]], with instruments built by [[West Germany]], the United Kingdom and the United States. It was launched on 1 June 1990, on a [[Delta II]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral]], on what was initially designed as an 18-month mission, with provision for up to five years of operation. ROSAT actually operated for over eight years, finally shutting down on 12 February 1999.

In February 2011, it was reported that the {{convert|2400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} satellite was unlikely to burn up entirely while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere due to the large amount of ceramics and glass used in construction. Parts as heavy as {{convert|400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} could impact the surface intact.&lt;ref name="Earth reentry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drohender Absturz: Problem-Satellit beunruhigt Bundesregierung|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/weltall/0,1518,747899,00.html|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROSAT eventually [[re-entry|re-entered]] the Earth's atmosphere on 23 October 2011 over [[Bay of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-1779/#/gallery/3578|title=ROSAT re-entered atmosphere over Bay of Bengal|last=DLR|work=DLR Portal|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
According to NASA,&lt;ref name="NASA, ROSAT" &gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of ROSAT|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1990-049A|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Roentgensatellit (ROSAT) was a joint German, U.S. and British X-ray astrophysics project. ROSAT carried a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive [[Proportional counter|Proportional Counter]]s (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a [[angle of incidence (optics)|grazing incidence]] four-fold nested [[Wolter telescope|Wolter I telescope]] with an 84-cm diameter aperture and 240-cm focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5&amp;nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcsecond]] at half energy width (the "angle within which half of the electromagnetic radiation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci2.esa.int/glossary/glossary_h.html ESA Science Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; is focused). The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2&amp;nbsp;keV (one thousand [[Electronvolt]]).

In addition, a British-supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope, the Wide Field Camera (WFC), was coaligned with the XRT and covered the energy band from 0.042 to 0.21&amp;nbsp;keV (30 to 6&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]).

ROSAT's unique strengths were high spatial resolution, low-background, soft X-ray imaging for the study of the structure of low surface brightness features, and for low-resolution spectroscopy.

The ROSAT spacecraft was a [[Three-axis stabilisation|three-axis stabilized]] satellite which can be used for pointed observations, for [[Slew (spacecraft)|slewing]] between targets, and for performing scanning observations on great circles perpendicular to the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. ROSAT was capable of fast slews (180&amp;nbsp;deg. in ~15&amp;nbsp;min.) which makes it possible to observe two targets on opposite hemispheres during each orbit. The pointing accuracy was 1&amp;nbsp;arcminute with stability less than 5&amp;nbsp;arcsec per sec and jitter radius of ~10&amp;nbsp;arcsec. Two CCD star sensors were used for optical position sensing of guide stars and attitude determination of the spacecraft. The post facto attitude determination accuracy was 6&amp;nbsp;arcsec.

The ROSAT mission was divided into two phases:
# After a two-month on-orbit calibration and verification period, an all-sky survey was performed for six months using the PSPC in the focus of XRT, and in two XUV bands using the WFC. The survey was carried out in the scan mode.
# The second phase consists of the remainder of the mission and was devoted to pointed observations of selected astrophysical sources. In ROSAT's pointed phase, observing time was allocated to Guest Investigators from all three participating countries through peer review of submitted proposals. ROSAT had a design life of 18 months, but was expected to operate beyond its nominal lifetime.

== Instruments ==

=== {{anchor|XRT}} X-ray Telescope (XRT) ===
The main assembly was a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a grazing incidence four-fold nested [[Wolter telescope|Wolter I telescope]]  with an {{Convert|84|cm|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter aperture and {{Convert|240|cm|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5&amp;nbsp;arcsec at half energy width. The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref name="NASA, ROSAT" /&gt;

{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Abell 2256.png|thumb|upright|PSPC shot of [[Abell 2256]]]]
Each Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) is a thin-window gas counter. Each incoming X-ray photon produces an electron cloud whose position and charge are detected using two wire grids. The photon position is determined with an accuracy of about 120 micrometers. The electron cloud's charge corresponds to the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1990-049A-02|title=Position Sensitive Proportional Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}
The US supplied High Resolution Imager used a crossed grid detector with a position accuracy to 25 micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1990-049A-01|title=High Resolution Imager (HRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was damaged by solar exposure on 20 September 1998.

=== {{anchor|WFC}} Wide Field Camera (WFC) ===
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}
The Wide Field Camera (WFC) was a British-supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope co-aligned with the XRT and covered the wave band between 300 and 60 [[angstrom]]s (0.042 to 0.21&amp;nbsp;keV).&lt;ref name="NASA, ROSAT" /&gt;

== Launch ==
ROSAT was originally planned to be launched on the [[Space Shuttle]] but the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] caused it to be moved to the [[Delta rocket|Delta]] platform. This move made it impossible to recapture ROSAT with a Shuttle and bring it back to Earth.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== End of operations ==
Originally designed for a five-year mission, ROSAT continued in its extended mission for a further four years before equipment failure forced an end to the mission. For some months after this, ROSAT completed its very last observations before being finally switched off on 12 February 1999.&lt;ref name="GOC, End" &gt;{{cite web|title=ROSAT completes almost a decade of discovery|url=http://www.ledas.ac.uk/rosat-goc/rosat_pr.html|date=18 February 1999|publisher=[[#ROSAT UK GOC|UK ROSAT Guest Observer Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 1998, failure of the primary [[star tracker]] on the [[#XRT|X-ray Telescope]] led to pointing errors that in turn had caused solar overheating.&lt;ref name="ROSAT news 60, star tracker failure"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ROSAT/LEDAS electronic newsletter|issue=12|date=5 June 1998|url=http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/rosat-goc/rosnews12|publisher=[[#ROSAT UK GOC|UK ROSAT Guest Observer Centre]]|work=ROSAT News No. 60|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228232103/http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/rosat-goc/rosnews12|archivedate=28 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contingency plan and the necessary software had already been developed to utilise an alternative star tracker attached to the [[#WFC|Wide Field Camera]].

ROSAT was soon operational again, but with some restrictions to the effectiveness of its tracking and thus its control.&lt;ref name="ROSAT news 66, Damage to HRI" &gt;{{cite web|title=Severe Damage to ROSAT High Resolution Imager|url=http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/rosat-goc/mpenews66|work=star.le.ac.uk|date=15 October 1998|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was severely damaged on 20 September 1998 when a [[reaction wheel]] in the spacecraft's Attitude Measuring and Control System (AMCS) reached its maximum rotational speed,&lt;ref group="note" &gt;A [[reaction wheel]] operates by changing its rotational velocity, [[conservation of angular momentum]] then causing the more massive satellite to rotate in opposition. Their maximum speed is limited by design, which in turn means they are limited in the rotational velocity they can impart to a satellite.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} "Reaching maximum speed" means merely that it cannot impart any more velocity change, not that it's approaching mechanical damage to itself.&lt;/ref&gt; losing control of a slew, damaging the High Resolution Imager by exposure to the sun.&lt;ref name="ROSAT news 66, Damage to HRI" /&gt; This failure was initially attributed to the difficulties of controlling the satellite under these difficult circumstances outside its initial design parameters.&lt;ref name="ROSAT news 66, Damage to HRI" /&gt;

=== Allegations of cyber-attacks causing the failure ===
In 2008, NASA investigators were reported to have found that the ROSAT failure was linked to a cyber-intrusion at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="Businessweek, Cyber attacks on NASA" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Network Security Breaches Plague NASA
  |url=http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/08_48/b4110072404167.htm
  |date=20 November 2008
  |publisher=[[Business Week]]
  |quote=Without warning one day, the ROSAT satellite turned, seemingly inexplicably, toward the sun. The move damaged a critical optical sensor, rendering the satellite useless in its mission of making X-ray and ultraviolet images of deep space.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also reported through [[Bruce Schneier]]'s blog, a highly regarded commentary on IT security issues.&lt;ref name="Schneier" &gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberattacks Against NASA|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/12/cyberattacks_ag.html|date=4 December 2008|publisher=[[Bruce Schneier|Bruce Schneier's blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of this allegation is a 1999 advisory report by Thomas Talleur, senior investigator for cyber-security at NASA.&lt;ref name="Businessweek, Cyber attacks on NASA" /&gt; This advisory&lt;ref name="NASA, 2007, Talleur report" &gt;{{cite book
  |title=Russian Domain Attacks Against NASA Network Systems|last=Talleur|first=Thomas J.|date=18 January 1999|publisher=Inspector General's office, NASA|pages=26 |nopp=y|location=Not publicly published. Classified as "For Official Use Only—No Foreign Dissemination"}}&lt;/ref&gt; is reported to describe a series of attacks from Russia that reached computers in the X-ray Astrophysics Section (i.e. ROSAT's) at [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]], and took control of computers used for the control of satellites, not just a passive "snooping" attack. The advisory stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Hostile activities compromised [NASA] computer systems that directly and indirectly deal with the design, testing, and transferring of satellite package command-and-control codes."&lt;ref name="NASA, 2007, Talleur report" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The advisory is further reported as claiming that the ROSAT incident was "coincident with the intrusion"&lt;ref name="Businessweek, Cyber attacks on NASA" /&gt; and that, "Operational characteristics and commanding of the ROSAT were sufficiently similar to other space assets to provide intruders with valuable information about how such platforms are commanded,".&lt;ref name="Businessweek, Cyber attacks on NASA" /&gt; Without public access to the advisory, it is obviously impossible to comment in detail. While it does seem to describe a real intrusion, there is a plausible "no attack" explanation for ROSAT's failure, and the report is claimed to link the two incidents as no more than "coincident."

IT security remains a significant issue for NASA.  Other systems including the [[Earth Observing System]] have also been attacked.&lt;ref name="NASA, 2007, Challenges report" &gt;

== Re-entry ==
[[File:ROSAT one of the last images before reentry.jpg|thumb|ROSAT: one of the last images of ROSAT before reentry]]
In 1990, the satellite was put in an orbit at an altitude of {{convert|580|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and inclination of 53°.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpe.mpg.de/xray/wave/rosat/mission/rosat/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt; Due to atmospheric drag, the satellite slowly lost height until, in September 2011, the satellite was orbiting approximately {{convert|270|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the Earth. On 23 October 2011 ROSAT re-entered the Earth's atmosphere sometime between 1:45 UTC and 2:15 UTC over the [[Bay of Bengal]], east of India. There was no confirmation if pieces of debris had reached the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="reentry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10424|title=ROSAT - latest news|date=25 October 2011|work=DLR Portal|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heavens above"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSAT Information|publisher=[[Heavens-Above]]|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=20638|accessdate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20955-second-big-satellite-set-to-resist-reentry-burnup.html |title=Second big satellite set to resist re-entry burn-up - space - 23 September 2011 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2014}}

A '''relational database''' is a digital [[database]] based on the [[relational model]] of data, as proposed by [[E. F. Codd]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=codd/&gt;
A software system used to maintain relational databases is a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS). Virtually all relational database systems use [[SQL]] (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agiledata.org/essays/relationalDatabases.html |title=Relational Databases 101: Looking at the Whole Picture |first=Scott |last=Ambler}}{{better source|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relational model==
{{main|Relational model}}
This model organizes data into one or more [[table (database)|tables]] (or "relations") of [[Column (database)|columns]] and [[row (database)|rows]], with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called [[Record (computer science)|records]] or [[tuple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/overview/database.html|title=A Relational Database Overview|website=oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columns are also called attributes. Generally, each table/relation represents one "entity type" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as "Lee" or "chair") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).

== Keys ==

Each row in a table has its own unique key. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as [[foreign key]]s). Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Part of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table. Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique [[primary key]] (PK) for each table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs. Other, more [[natural key]]s may also be identified and defined as [[alternate key]]s (AK). Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK). Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table. Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world, a [[globally unique identifier]], when there are broader system requirements.

The primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table. When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a [[One-to-one (data model)|one-to-one]] or [[One-to-many (data model)|one-to-many]] relationship. Most relational database designs resolve [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables—the relationship becomes an entity; the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there is usually neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.

=== Relationships ===
Relationships are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.

== Transactions ==
In order for a database management system (DBMS) to operate efficiently and accurately, it must use [[ACID transactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{

== Stored procedures ==

Most{{dubious|date=January 2017}} of the programming within a RDBMS is accomplished using [[stored procedure]]s (SPs). Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system. For increased security, the system design may grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables. Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new and update existing data. More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data.

==Terminology==
[[Image:Relational database terms.svg|350px|thumb|right|Relational database terminology.]]
The relational database was first defined in June 1970 by [[Edgar F. Codd|Edgar Codd]], of IBM's [[IBM Almaden Research Center|San Jose Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=codd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Codd|first=E. F.|authorlink=Edgar F. Codd|year=1970|title=A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=13|issue=6|pages=377–387|doi=10.1145/362384.362685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codd's view of what qualifies as an RDBMS is summarized in [[Codd's 12 rules]]. A relational database has become the predominant type of database.  Other models besides the ''relational model'' include the [[hierarchical database model]] and the [[network model]].

The table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and the corresponding [[SQL]] term:

==Relations or tables==
{{main|Relation (database)|Table (database)}}
A ''[[relation (database)|relation]]'' is defined as a set of [[tuple]]s that have the same [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]]. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a [[Table (database)|table]], which is organized into [[Row (database)|rows]] and [[Column (database)|columns]]. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] and conform to the same constraints.

The relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples, in turn, impose no order on the attributes. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as ''select'' to identify tuples, ''project'' to identify attributes, and ''join'' to combine relations. Relations can be modified using the ''insert'', ''delete'', and ''update'' operators. New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query. Similarly, queries identify tuples for updating or deleting.

Tuples by definition are unique. If the tuple contains a [[candidate key|candidate]] or primary key then obviously it is unique; however, a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple. The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique, but does not require a primary key to be defined. Because a tuple is unique, its attributes by definition constitute a [[superkey]].

==Base and derived relations==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Relational database --&gt;
{{main|Relvar|View (database)}}
In a relational database, all data are stored and accessed via [[relation (database)|relations]]. Relations that store data are called "base relations", and in implementations are called "tables". Other relations do not store data, but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations. These relations are sometimes called "derived relations". In implementations these are called "[[View (database)|views]]" or "queries". Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation, even though they may grab information from several relations. Also, derived relations can be used as an [[abstraction layer]].

===Domain===
{{main|data domain}}
A domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set.
The character string ''"ABC"'', for instance, is not in the integer domain, but the integer value ''123'' is. Another example of domain describes the possible values for the field "CoinFace" as ("Heads","Tails"). So, the field "CoinFace" will not accept input values like (0,1) or (H,T).

==Constraints==
Constraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing [[business rules]] in the database and support subsequent data use within the application layer. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of [[check constraint]]s.
Constraints restrict the data that can be stored in [[relation (database)|relations]]. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a &lt;!-- do not change the capitalization of this link without first consulting, and replying to the talk page. Any such edits will be reverted. --&gt;[[Boolean data type|boolean]] value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations of attributes) or to an entire relation.
Since every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints ('''domain constraints'''). The two principal rules for the relational model are known as '''entity integrity''' and '''referential integrity'''.

===Primary key===
{{main|Unique key}}
A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table. In order for an attribute to be a good primary key it must not repeat. While natural attributes (attributes used to describe the data being entered) are sometimes good primary keys, [[surrogate key]]s are often used instead. A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it (for instance, in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them). The surrogate key has no intrinsic (inherent) meaning, but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple.
Another common occurrence, especially in regard to N:M cardinality is the [[Compound key|composite key]]. A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that (together) uniquely identify a record. (For example, in a database relating students, teachers, and classes.  Classes ''could'' be uniquely identified by a composite key of their room number and time slot, since no other class could have exactly the same combination of attributes. In fact, use of a composite key such as this can be a form of [[data verification]], albeit a weak one.

===Foreign key===
{{main|Foreign key}}
A foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table. The foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables. Foreign keys do not need to have unique values in the referencing relation. Foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation.
A foreign key could be described formally as: "For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes, there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes."

===Stored procedures===
{{main|Stored procedure}}
A stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database. Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations, like inserting a [[tuple]] into a [[relation (database)|relation]], gathering statistical information about usage patterns, or encapsulating complex [[business logic]] and calculations. Frequently they are used as an [[application programming interface]] (API) for security or simplicity. Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMS's often allow developers to take advantage of [[Procedural programming|procedural]] extensions (often vendor-specific) to the standard [[Declarative programming|declarative]] SQL syntax.
Stored procedures are not part of the relational database model, but all commercial implementations include them.

===Index===
{{main|Index (database)}}
An index is one way of providing quicker access to data. Indexes can be created on any combination of attributes on a [[relation (database)|relation]]. Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the index, without having to check each tuple in turn. This is analogous to using the [[Index (publishing)|index of a book]] to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found, so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for. Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques, each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution, relation size, and typical access pattern. Indices are usually implemented via [[B+ tree]]s, [[R-tree]]s, and [[Bitmap index|bitmaps]].
Indices are usually not considered part of the database, as they are considered an implementation detail, though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database. The use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance. This is because B-tree indexes result in query times proportional to log(n) where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries (no size dependency as long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory).

==Relational operations==
{{main|Relational algebra}}
Queries made against the relational database, and the derived [[relvars]] in the database are expressed in a [[relational calculus]] or a [[relational algebra]]. In his original relational algebra, Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each. The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical [[Set theory|set operations]]:
* The [[Union (set theory)|union]] operator combines the tuples of two [[relation (database)|relations]] and removes all duplicate tuples from the result. The relational union operator is equivalent to the [[Union (SQL)|SQL UNION]] operator.
* The [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] operator produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common. Intersection is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Intersect (SQL)|INTERSECT]] operator.
* The [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] operator acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation. Difference is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Except (SQL)|EXCEPT]] or MINUS operator.
* The [[cartesian product]] of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria, resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation. The cartesian product is implemented in SQL as the [[Cross join]] operator.
The remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases:
* The selection, or restriction, operation retrieves tuples from a relation, limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criterion, i.e. a [[subset]] in terms of set theory. The SQL equivalent of selection is the [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]] query statement with a [[Where (SQL)|WHERE]] clause.
* The [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection operation]] extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples.
* The join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join. In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes. MySQL's approximation of a natural join is the [[Inner join]] operator. In SQL, an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query. For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product. Thus, for N tables in an SQL query, there must be N−1 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product.
* The [[Relational algebra#Division|relational division]] operation is a slightly more complex operation and essentially involves using the tuples of one relation (the dividend) to partition a second relation (the divisor). The relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator (hence the name).
Other operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd's introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data, among others.

==Normalization==
{{main|Database normalization}}
Normalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model. It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate non-simple domains (non-atomic values) and the redundancy (duplication) of data, which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity.  The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the [[Database normalization#Normal forms|normal forms]].

==Distributed relational databases==

[[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinsch|first1=R.|title=Distributed database for SAA|journal=IBM Systems Journal|date=1988|volume=27|issue=3|pages=362–389|doi=10.1147/sj.273.0362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Distributed Relational Database Architecture Reference|date=1990|publisher=IBM Corp. SC26-4651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]].

'''Simon Rogerson''' is lifetime Professor Emeritus in [[Computer Ethics]] at the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR), [[De Montfort University]].&lt;ref&gt;Computer Ethics Pioneer Retires DMYou Issue 33 P8 available at https://issuu.com/ponderblog/docs/dmyou_33&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and is the current editor of the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/journals.htm?id=JICES Refs&lt;/ref&gt; He has had two careers; first as a technical software developer and then in academia as reformer (according to Huff and Barnard&lt;ref&gt;Description of Rogerson in Huff, Chuck, Barnard, Laura (2009), Good computing: Moral Exemplars in the Computing Profession, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Volume:28, Issue: 3, pp 47-54,. - Huff and Barnard define reformers as being crusaders attempting to change values in social systems and viewing individuals as victims of injustice and attempting to rectify that injustice. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5247002&lt;/ref&gt;). He was the founding Director of CCSR, launching it in 1995 at the first ETHICOMP conference which he conceived &lt;ref&gt;Companies offered ethics advice, Times Higher Education, April 7, 1995 https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/companies-offered-ethics-advice/97305.article&lt;/ref&gt; and co-directed until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-faculties-and-institutes/technology/centre-for-computing-and-social-responsibility/ethicomp-series.aspx|title=ETHICOMP Series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Europe's first Professor in Computer Ethics in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/awards-winners/rogerson|title=SIGCAS Making A Difference Award 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most important research focuses on providing rigorously grounded practical tools and guidance to computing practitioners. For his leadership and research achievements in the computer and information ethics interdisciplinary field he was awarded the fifth IFIP-WG9.2 Namur Award in 2000&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the official report: By giving Simon Rogerson ''the 5th IFIP-WG9.2 Namur Award'', we emphasise the need to place the study of ethics on the agenda of international ICT research and practices. https://staff.info.unamur.be/jbl/IFIP/winners.html&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the SIGCAS Making a Difference Award'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the official report: Professor Rogerson has made and continues to make a world-wide difference in how people view the complex interactions of computers and society. http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/awards-winners/rogerson&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial career ==
As a teenager Rogerson wanted to work in the computer industry. On graduating from the University of Dundee he joined Thorn Lighting as a Fortran Programmer in 1972. He progressed to Senior Systems Analyst before transferring to Thorn EMI in 1976 as Technical Systems Manager and where he became Computer Services Manager in 1981. He left his full-time post in 1983 to pursue a career in academia. However, he maintained his link with industry through freelance consultancy and membership of several professional bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dmu.academia.edu/SimonRogerson/CurriculumVitae|title=Simon Rogerson - De Montfort University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Rogerson joined the Department of Information Systems at Leicester Polytechnic (later to become De Montfort University&lt;ref&gt;Leicester Polytechnic became De Montfort University in accordance with the Further and Higher Education Act in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1983. He was appointed under a government initiative to attract IT industrialists in to Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;"… the government in 1983 … extra money for universities to spend on information technology courses and 'new blood' posts, mainly in science and technology" p100 in {{cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = Penny | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of government policy towards English higher education 1979–2007 | url = | journal = Learning and Teaching | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 96–122 | doi = 10.3167/latiss.2009.020206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he focused on lecturing about [[Project Management]], [[Systems Analysis]] and Management Support Systems. It was the latter which led him into research starting by co-authoring works with Dr Christine Fidler culminating in the book ''Strategic Management Support Systems'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson catalogue http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Strategic-Management-Support-Systems/9780273614180.page&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
Rogerson is an innovative educator. He created and was the founding course leader of a European-focused [[Business Information Systems]] Degree in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., European Language Education for information systems undergraduates, in: Student Skills for the New Europe, Cunningham, L., Editor, Higher Education for Capability, 1993, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; He developed student guides for undergraduates, publishing ''Project Skills Handbook'' &lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., Project Skills Handbook, Chartwell-Bratt, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authoring ''Successful Group Work''.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., RICE, J., SAUNDERS, C. &amp; O'SULLIVAN, T., Successful group work, Kogan Page, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a series of course modules focussing on computer and information ethics. Rogerson and Tugrul Esendal developed and delivered an innovative course module addressing quality assurance and ethics in Software Engineering for which they received a ''Research Informed Teaching Award'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;ESSENDAL, T. &amp; ROGERSON, S. (2011) A holistic approach to software engineering education.  In HUSSEY, M., WU, B. &amp; XU, X. (editors) Software industry oriented education practice and curriculum development: experiences and lessons. IGI Global. Chpt 5 pp83-97&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the Information Society Doctoral Programme which continues to attract research students worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-faculties-and-institutes/technology/centre-for-computing-and-social-responsibility/postgraduate-study/postgraduate-study.aspx|title=Postgraduate Study|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, funded by HEFCE (Higher Education Funding Council of England) Rogerson developed a virtual learning environment for doctoral students at De Montfort University where they could learn about and discuss research ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Research Ethics: Online (REST7 525 ) Course Description, Research training programme handbook 2010/11, p13. available at http://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/research-documents/graduate-school/current-students/research-development-programme/rtphandbook2010-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he ran a Masters Summer School on the Social Impact of Computing at Gdansk University of Technology, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;"Simon Rogerson: making a difference 2005" interviewed by Ken Himma,. ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society, Celebrating SIGCAS' 40th Anniversary - Interviews with Past SIGCAS Award Recipients, Volume 39, Issue 2 (September 2009) pp22-23. available at http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/interview-with-simon-rogerson&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Through sharing his IS/IT industrial experience with his students Rogerson realised that current professional practice was having little effect on reducing the risk of IS/IT system failure. This led him to focus his research on new interdisciplinary approaches to IS/IT project management, design and implementation which embraced computer and information ethics.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S. (2015) Future Vision, Special Issue - 20 years of ETHICOMP, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, Volume 13, Issue 3/4, pp.346 – 360.&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Donald Gotterbarn]] created the Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) process which encourages those involved in IS/IT project management to consider the wider ramifications of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Gotterbarn, D and Rogerson, S (2005), Responsible Risk Analysis for Software Development: Creating the Software Development Impact Statement, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, Volume 15, Article 40. at http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol15/iss1/40/&lt;/ref&gt; An associated decision support tool, SoDIS Project Auditor was developed and successfully used around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softimp.com.au/sodis/sodis_process.html|title=Software Improvements :: SoDIS Process®|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the BCS Ethics Strategic Panel, he was one of the creators of DIODE, an ethical assessment tool for new and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jennings | first2 = Richard C. | last3 = Pullinger | first3 = David | last4 = Rogerson | first4 = Simon | last5 = Duquenoy | first5 = Penny | year = 2011 | title = Ethical assessment of new technologies: a meta methodology | url = | journal = Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 49–64 | doi=10.1108/14779961111123223}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived and co-developed a dependency mapping method for the implementation of technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., WILFORD, S and FAIRWEATHER, N.B. (2013) A dependencies mapping method for personal health monitoring. in Schmidt, S. &amp; Rienhoff, O (eds).Interdisciplinary Assessment of Personal Health Monitoring. Vol 187 of Studies in Health Technology and Informatics. IOS Press, {{ISBN|9781614992554}}. available at http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/34521&lt;/ref&gt; Rogerson’s research extended to IS/IT application areas with notable work in [[electronic voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fairweather | first1 = NB | last2 = Rogerson | first2 = S | year = 2005 | title = Interfaces for electronic voting: focus group evidence | url = | journal = Electronic Government, an International Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 369–383 | doi = 10.1504/EG.2005.008329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal health monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson was a principal investigator on EU-funded PHM-Ethics project see http://ethics.p-h-m.org/consortium.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A second important focus of Rogerson’s research is [[professionalism]] in computing. His book ''Ethical aspects of information technology: Issues for senior executives'', published in 1998 for the Institute of Business Ethics, remains one the few to address ethics of computing from a corporate perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Simon, (1998), Ethical aspects of information technology: issues for senior executives, Institute of Business Ethics, {{ISBN|0952402041}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made significant contributions to the development of professional standards in several computer related bodies. He was a member of the executive team which developed the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) / [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS) Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice for which he received the ''IEEE Certificate of Appreciation'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;De Montfort University, RAE 2001 submission to Library and Information Management, RA6a: Additional observations, Evidence of esteem available at http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/Submissions/Textform.asp?route=2&amp;HESAInst=H-0068&amp;UoA=61&amp;Msub=Z&amp;Form=RA6a&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the code of ethics for the Institute for the Management of Information Systems &lt;ref&gt;MCROBB, S., ROGERSON, S., FAIRWEATHER, N.B., Code of Ethics, IMIS Journal, April, Vol 10 No 2, 2000, pp 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and the redevelopment of the Code of Good Practice of BCS, The Chartered Institute of IT.&lt;ref&gt;http://bcs.org/upload/pdf/cop.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2010 Rogerson led a longitudinal survey to explore the attitudes of information systems professionals. It provides a unique snapshot as seen through an ethical lens.&lt;ref&gt;IS IT Ethical? 2010 ETHICOMP Survey of Professional Practice https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299485534_IS_IT_Ethical_2010_ETHICOMP_Survey_of_Professional_Practice?ev=prf_pub&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioner access to Rogerson’s research was made possible through his regular ''ETHIcol'' column which he wrote for the IMIS Journal from 1995 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk/resources/general/ethicol.html|title=CCSR: ETHIcol by Simon Rogerson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Rogerson has been the prime instigator in establishing a computer and information ethics movement in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, Terrell, "Computer and Information Ethics", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition) available at http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/ethics-computer/&lt;/ref&gt; As founding director of the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR) his visionary leadership resulted in the ETHICOMP conference series, which he co-directed with [[Terrell Ward Bynum|Terry Bynum]], and the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society. Professor Krystyna Gorniak, who attended ETHICOMP 95, wrote to Rogerson on 10 April 1995, "… the newly established CCSR is one of the prominent steps towards the creation of a world-wide network of scholars who are concerned about humankind's wellbeing in the age of computers …" CCSR's web site, which was launched in 1997, became the world's leading portal for computer and information ethics. With over 2 million annual visits&lt;ref&gt;Total hits 2,117,448 worldwide, in last 12 months Usage statistics for www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk, generated 30 April 2003 23.58 BST, using Webalizer Version 2.01&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the advent of social media. There have been 15 ETHICOMP conferences to date with around 1,250 papers being presented.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, S. (2015) The ETHICOMP Odyssey: 1995 to 2015, ResearchGate. {{DOI| 10.13140/RG.2.1.2660.1444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ETHICOMP'' name has become recognised and respected in the field of computer and information ethics and in 1999 it was registered as a trademark by De Montfort University to control its use and ensure ongoing integrity on behalf of the ETHICOMP community.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark no. UK00002184304  details available at https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002184304&lt;/ref&gt; Now in its fourteenth volume, the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society aims to promote thoughtful dialogue regarding the wider social and ethical issues related to the planning, development, implementation and use of new media and information and communication technologies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/jices|title=EmeraldInsight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His leadership extends into professional bodies. As chairman of the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (2009-2013) he led its incorporation into BCS – The Chartered Institute for IT (formerly [[British Computer Society]]) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Following an overwhelming majority vote from its membership, the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (IMIS), has ratified its decision to merge with BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT, with immediate effect. The agreement will see all IMIS professional members transfer into BCS membership." http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/50485&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe he was one a five-person commission which undertook the review of FP6 (the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development for the period 2002 to 2006) reporting its findings and recommendations to the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Invited member of the 2005 FP6 Monitoring Review Panel of the European Commission see report at http://ec.europa.eu/research/reports/2005/pdf/final_report_monitoring_2005_response_commission_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the ethics guidelines for the ICT work programme of FP7 (European Union's Research and Innovation. funding programme for 2007-2013), making it mandatory for all [[European Union]] funded ICT research to address explicitly the ethical issues surrounding prospective research activity.&lt;ref&gt;Annex 5: Ethical Guidelines for undertaking ICT research in FP7, Guide for Applicants: Information and Communication Technologies ( FP7-ICT-2013-10), pp64-66. available at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/fp7/fp7-ict-2013-10/32886-gfa_cp-csa_for_pcp_v2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI)''' is a multi-campus research facility and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Oceanography|oceanographic institution]] headquartered in [[Terminal Island, California]].

==History==
In the late 1960s, marine scientists working at six campuses of the [[California State University|CSU system]] in the [[Los Angeles basin]] (Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona) proposed the formation of an institute that would provide the advancement of marine programs. It was until 1971, when the university system decided to purchase the naval vessel R/V Nautilus for that specific purpose. In 1972, the creation of the Southern California Ocean Studies Consortium (SCOSC) was approved by the Trustees and the Presidents of the founding campuses and the operation of the R/V Nautilus floating marine laboratory began.

The University of California Los Angeles is in partnership with the Institute, thereby increasing marine research in Los Angeles, and providing educational opportunities for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-joins-the-southern-california-188738.aspx |title=UCLA joins Southern California Marine Institute to revitalize marine research in Los Angeles |first1=Kim |last1=DeRose |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caltech-Submillimeter-Observatory (straightened).jpg|thumb|The [[Caltech Submillimeter Observatory]] at [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] was commissioned in 1988, and has a 10.4 m(34 ft) dish]]

'''Submillimetre astronomy''' or '''submillimeter astronomy''' (see [[spelling differences]]) is the branch of [[observational astronomy]] that is conducted at submillimetre wavelengths (i.e., [[terahertz radiation]]) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the [[far-infrared]] and [[microwave]] wavebands, typically taken to be between a few hundred [[micrometre]]s and a [[millimetre]]. It is still common in submillimetre astronomy to quote wavelengths in 'microns', the old name for micrometre.

Using submillimetre observations, astronomers examine [[molecular cloud]]s and [[Dark nebula|dark cloud]] cores with a goal of clarifying the process of [[star formation]] from earliest [[gravitational collapse|collapse]] to [[Stellar birthline|stellar birth]].  Submillimetre observations of these dark clouds can be used to determine [[Astrochemistry|chemical abundances]] and [[Interstellar medium#Heating and cooling|cooling mechanisms]] for the [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|molecules which comprise them]].  In addition, submillimetre observations give information on the mechanisms for the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]].

==Submillimetre astronomy from the ground==
[[File:ALMA’s World At Night.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the Chajnantor plateau, spanning about 180 degrees from north (on the left) to south (on the right) shows the antennas of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]].]]

The most significant limitation to the detection of astronomical emission at submillimetre wavelengths with ground-based observatories is atmospheric emission, noise and attenuation. Like the infrared, the submillimetre atmosphere is dominated by numerous [[water vapour]] [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption bands]] and it is only through "windows" between these bands that observations are possible. The ideal submillimetre observing site is dry, cool, has stable weather conditions and is away from urban population centres. There are only a handful of such sites identified, they include [[Mauna Kea Observatory|Mauna Kea]] ([[Hawaii]], United States), the [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory]] on the Atacama Plateau ([[Chile]]), the [[South Pole]], and Hanle in India (the Himalayan site of the [[Indian Astronomical Observatory]]). Comparisons show that all four sites are excellent for submillimetre astronomy, and of these sites Mauna Kea is the most established and arguably the most accessible. There has been some recent interest in high-altitude Arctic sites, particularly [[Summit Camp|Summit Station]] in Greenland where the PWV ([[precipitable water]] vapor) measure is always better than at Mauna Kea (however Mauna Kea's equatorial latitude of 19 degrees means it can observe more of the southern skies than Greenland).&lt;ref name=ellesmere&gt;{{cite web | url=http://almatelescope.ca/submmFuture-17feb2012/Presentations/Steinbring-Arctic.pdf | title=Recent Interest in Eureka on Ellesmere Island as a Submillimetre Observing Site | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703235656/http://almatelescope.ca/submmFuture-17feb2012/Presentations/Steinbring-Arctic.pdf | archivedate=2015-07-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summit&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~hirashita/dust_group/JuanCarlos220811.pdf | title=ASIAA sub-mm VLBI Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory]] site hosts the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), the largest submillimetre telescope operating in the southern hemisphere,
and the world's largest ground based astronomy project, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA), an [[Astronomical radio interferometry|interferometer]] for submillimetre wavelength observations made of 54 12-metre and 12 7-metre radio telescopes. The [[Submillimeter Array]] (SMA) is another interferometer, located at Mauna Kea, consisting of eight 6-metre diameter radio telescopes. The largest existing submillimetre telescope, the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], is also located on Mauna Kea.

==Submillimetre astronomy from near-space==
With [[high-altitude balloon]]s and aircraft, one can get above even more of the atmosphere.  The [[BLAST (telescope)|BLAST]] experiment and [[SOFIA]] are two examples, respectively, although SOFIA can also handle near infrared observations.

Space-based observations at the submillimetre wavelengths remove the ground-based limitations of atmospheric absorption.  The [[Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite]] (SWAS) was launched into low Earth orbit on December 5, 1998 as one of [[NASA]]'s Small Explorer Program (SMEX) missions.  The mission of the spacecraft is to make targeted observations of giant molecular clouds and dark cloud cores.  The focus of SWAS is five spectral lines: [[water]] (H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O), isotopic water (H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;18&lt;/SUP&gt;O), isotopic [[carbon monoxide]] (&lt;SUP&gt;13&lt;/SUP&gt;CO), molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;), and neutral [[carbon]] (C I).

The SWAS satellite was repurposed in June, 2005 to provide support for the NASA ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' mission.  SWAS provided water production data on the comet until the end of August 2005.

The [[European Space Agency]] launched a space-based mission known as the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] (formerly called Far Infrared and Sub-millimetre Telescope or FIRST) in 2009.  Herschel  deploys the largest mirror ever launched into space and studies radiation in the far infrared and submillimetre wavebands.  Rather than an Earth orbit, Herschel entered into a [[Lissajous orbit]] around {{L2}}, the second [[Lagrangian point]] of the Earth-Sun system.  {{L2}} is located approximately 1.5 million km from Earth and the placement of Herschel there lessens the interference by infrared and visible radiation from the Earth and Sun.  Herschel's mission focuses primarily on the origins of galaxies and galactic formation.

'''''The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night''''' is a 1994 [[non-fiction]] book written by ''[[The New York Times]]'' media reporter Bill Carter.&lt;!--different [[Bill Carter]] than WP article and writer of Miss Sarajevo--&gt; It chronicles the early 1990s conflict surrounding the American [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. The book was later made into a [[The Late Shift (film)|film of the same name]] by [[HBO]].

==Contents==
The book chronicles the behind-the-scenes corporate battle surrounding American [[late-night talk show]]s, leading up to, and after, [[Johnny Carson]]'s 1992 retirement as host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. The book primarily details the power struggle between [[David Letterman]] and [[Jay Leno]] to succeed Carson as the "King of Late Night", NBC choosing Leno over Letterman as the next ''Tonight Show'' host, and Letterman later moving to rival network [[CBS]].

==Cast of characters==
The following is a partial list of people featured in the book:

;Major principals
* [[Johnny Carson]]: Host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from 1962 to 1992.
* [[Jay Leno]]: Permanent guest host of ''The Tonight Show'' since 1987. Chosen by [[NBC]] to succeed Carson as host.
* [[David Letterman]]: Host of NBC's 12:30am show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' since 1982. After being bypassed as Carson's successor in favor of Leno, moves to rival network [[CBS]] in 1993.

;Others
* [[Helen Kushnick]]: Leno's tough manager who helps him secure his spot as Carson's successor. Becomes executive producer of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', but her fierce tactics eventually force both NBC and Leno to fire her.
* [[Peter Lassally]]: Executive producer of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and later ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. Becomes an unofficial counselor to Letterman after Leno is selected to succeed Carson.
* [[Michael Ovitz]]: Head of the [[Creative Artists Agency]] from 1975 to 1995. Hired by Letterman to negotiate his move from NBC to another network, studio, or syndicator (eventually CBS).
* [[Howard Stringer]]: President of CBS from 1988 to 1995. After several unsuccessful attempts to break NBC's ratings stranglehold on the late night hours, negotiates to bring Letterman to his network.
* [[Brandon Tartikoff]]: President of NBC's entertainment division from 1981 to 1991. Instrumental in helping to build NBC's 1980s late night lineup of Carson and Letterman, as well as signing Leno to be Carson's permanent guest host in 1987.
* [[Bob Wright]]: President of NBC from 1986 to 2007. Tries to negotiate to keep Letterman on NBC.
* [[John Agoglia]]: NBC executive from 1980 to 1998 and supporter of Leno.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Lowry |title=John Agoglia, Top NBC Exec in 'Must-See TV' Era, Dies at 76|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/people-news/john-agoglia-top-nbc-exec-in-must-see-tv-era-dead-at-76-1201138124/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher= |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a review of ''The Late Shift'' for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Jon Katz wrote, "[This] is a reporter's book, unfailingly balanced, thoroughly researched, filled with scoops and fresh details. Even though CBS's wooing and winning of Mr. Letterman was the subject of enormous publicity, Mr. Carter's book makes clear that we knew less than we thought about what was really going on."&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt; Katz criticized the book for not going into more depth about Letterman's switch to CBS, writing, "As readable as it is, 'The Late Shift' needed to take a more critical, detached look at the long-term significance of Mr. Letterman's move. A number of questions are not addressed."&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt;  He concluded, "'The Late Shift' is nonetheless a powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners. Mr. Leno, who has been made to seem a second choice by the very people who elevated him, has been betrayed by his employers in the most basic of ways, and he has not yet recovered."&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Katz| first=Jon|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|volume=99|page=11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| date =February 20, 1994 |issn=0028-7806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Campbell reviewed the book for ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', and commented, "More than just a play-by-play account of the actions that followed Johnny Carson's 1991 retirement announcement, Carter's well-written book is a look at the history of the late-night franchise, and of the men who host the shows that we would rather watch instead of going to bed."&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; Campbell described the book as revealing in its assessment of NBC's decision to pass over Letterman for ''The Tonight Show'', concluding, "Carter's eye-opening book leaves the impression that NBC will be remembered more for its loss of Letterman, than for its role as creator of late-night television."&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Campbell| first=Kim|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] (Eastern edition)|page=17| date = March 11, 1994|issn=0882-7729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
[[Helen Kushnick]], Jay Leno's manager at the time of Carson's retirement who was pushed out following her heavy-handed tactics, filed a $30 million lawsuit against Bill Carter, claiming [[libel]]. Specifically, her case related to a claim that she planted a story about Carson's retirement in a New York City [[Tabloid journalism#As a sensational.2C gossip-filled newspaper|tabloid]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR120352.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 "Dish: Fox backing off the gay buss"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 21 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The then-pending lawsuit was noted in the closing credits of the film, as the Broadway tune "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]" plays.  The lawsuit settled out of court for an undisclosed sum; Kushnick died of cancer in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Shales | first = Tom | coauthors =  | title = Tom Shales on the villains in the Leno-O'Brien fiasco at NBC | work = [[The Washington Post]] | language =  | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]] | date =  January 19, 2010| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803528.html | accessdate =  2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==

The '''Trevithick Society''' is a registered charity named for [[Richard Trevithick]], a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] engineer who contributed to the use of high pressure [[steam engine]]s for transportation and mining applications.

==History==
In 1935 the Cornish Engines Preservation Committee (CEPC) was formed to rescue the [[Levant Mine and Beam Engine|Levant winding engine]] which was deemed outdated and scheduled to be scrapped. CEPC were forerunners in the field of [[Industrial Archaeology]]. They acquired another winding engine and two [[Cornish engine|pumping engines]]. CEPC merged with the newly formed Cornish Waterwheel Preservation Society in 1971 and named the organisation the Trevithick Society after Richard Trevithick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-lectures.co.uk/Industrial-Archaeology-Societies/2918-Trevithick-Society-The/View-details.html ''Trevithick Society.''] Open Lectures and Talks.

===Dolcoath pumping engine===
[[Dolcoath mine|Dolcoath]] was the largest and deepest mine in Cornwall, with its principal shaft, known as New Sump Shaft, eventually reaching a depth of {{convert|3300|ft|m}} below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3030">[[File:Alkalarian Vegetable Box.jpg|thumb|250px|A vegetable box]]

A '''vegetable box scheme''' is an operation that delivers fresh fruit and vegetables, often locally grown and [[Organic food|organic]], either directly to the customer or to a local collection point. Typically the produce is sold as an ongoing weekly [[subscription]] and the offering may vary week to week depending on what is [[Seasonal food|in season]].

The first organic box scheme was created by [[Guy Watson]] in 1987,{{cn|date=October 2017}} who delivered fresh produce locally from [[Riverford]] farm. These schemes are usually operated by the grower or a small [[co-operative]]. There are approximately 600 such schemes operating in the UK&lt;ref name="BBC Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |title=Boxes of delight |publisher=BBC Green |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614075148/http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |archivedate=June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by early 2007, according to the [[Soil Association]], retail sales via such schemes were in excess of £100 million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0Bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce!OpenDocument |title=How to set up a vegetable box scheme |year=2007 |publisher=The Soil Association |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517015208/http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce%21OpenDocument |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schemes are run on a local or regional basis, delivering food direct from the producer to the consumer. Other schemes offer a nationwide delivery, with produce supplied by a network of growers, co-operatives and wholesalers negating the [[local food]] affiliation of these schemes. Some British [[supermarket]]s have also begun offering vegetable boxes.&lt;ref name="BBC Green" /&gt;

==How a vegetable box scheme works==
A box scheme usually works by subscription. A customer signs up to a weekly or fortnightly delivery of fresh vegetables and/or fruit. The contents will vary week to week as selected by the box scheme provider on the basis of [[seasonality]] and availability. Some schemes offer the option of purchasing extra goods to be delivered along with the vegetable box, such as dairy produce and meat.&lt;ref name="Timesonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article1380105.ece|title=Top 35 organic box schemes in the UK|date=March 3, 2008|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Wyke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}

Wireless Andrew is a 2-megabit-per-second wireless local area network connected through access points
to the wired Andrew network, a high-speed Ethernet backbone linking buildings across the Carnegie
Mellon campus.
