== Description of the organization ==
The organization was founded in 2002 and modeled after long-standing programs in Europe: Ireland ([[Tidy Towns (Ireland)|Tidy Towns]]) Britain ([[Britain in Bloom|Britain in Bloom and]] [[Britain in Bloom#Regions|Regions]]) Scotland ([http://www.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/local-environmental-quality/beautiful-scotland Beautiful Scotland]), Italy (Comune Fiorito), and originally France (Villes et Villages Fleuris), as well as Australia ([[Australian Tidy Town Awards|Australia Tidy Town Awards]]) and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americainbloom.org/About-AIB/About-AIB.aspx|title=
About AIB|publisher=America in Bloom|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Communities in Bloom]]). The US organization has grown to embrace 235 participating cities in 40 states and touches more than 22 million lives.

America in Bloom is a grass-roots urban renewal program which provides a framework and is a catalyst for community organizations to work together for visible improvements. It offers one-on-one mentoring to participating communities and provides an extensive written evaluation detailing recommended improvements and enhancements. Its website provides educational materials related to the benefits of quality landscapes and more..

Through its national awards and mentoring program, AIB helps towns harness untapped energy, talent, and resources to champion greening, enhance environmental awareness, promote economic development, and improve quality of life.

The AIB program is designed to bring people from every demographic together to create meaningful, visible, constructive projects, by combining efforts of residents, businesses, and local government. These groups work on common goals in areas including: floral displays, landscaped areas, urban forestry,  environmental awareness, heritage preservation, overall impression and community involvement.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Eligible program entrants include towns, communities, cities, neighborhoods of large cities, business districts, military bases, and college campuses. Due to the numerous cases of consistent community involvement since 2002, in 2015 a new category, "Circle of Champions", was created for those participants that won repeatedly in the past.  The 2015 Circle of Champion Winners were [[Holland, Michigan|Holland, MI]] (mid-sized city category) and [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes, DE]] (small city category).

The '''American University of Phnom Penh''' ({{lang-km|សាកលវិទ្យាល័យអាមេរិកាំងភ្នំពេញ}}; '''AUPP''') is a private English-medium [[university]] founded in August 2013, with a campus in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/new-university-to-offer-students-shot-at-american-education-41628/ |title=New University to Offer Students Shot at American Education |publisher=The Cambodia Daily |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university offers four-year American dual degree programs with majors in [[Architecture]], [[Business]], [[Communication]], [[Computer Science]], [[Global Affairs]], [[Graphic Design]], [[Interior Design]], [[Law]], and [[Tourism]] and [[Hospitality Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupp.edu.kh/academics/programs/the-aupp-program-model/ |title=The AUPP Program Model |publisher=Aupp.edu.kh |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The vision for AUPP originated with Dr. Chea Vandeth along with Dr. Kem Reat Viseth, the former Director of the School of Graduate Studies of the National School of Management and Dr. Kenneth Dunn, a Fulbright Scholar to [[Cambodia]], who together conceptualized a new university that would embody international best practices and offer academic programs of the highest quality. AUPP was organized as a [[non-profit institution]] with the mission of contributing to the human resource development of Cambodia. In 2013, AUPP began operations with 40 students at a temporary campus in [[Tuol Kouk District|Toul Kork]].

A Board of [[Trustee]]s was formed to direct the course of the University and oversee its development. At the same time an International Advisory Board was created including experienced educators, administrators and business leaders from the U.S. and Cambodia. This board was tasked with advising AUPP on its management, governance and academic structures, programs and services.

The U.S. Embassy offered its support with the following statement: “AUPP collaborates with the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia to enhance the academic, professional, and social opportunities for AUPP students”.

AUPP has further solidified a Micro Campus and Dual Degree agreement with the [[University of Arizona]] and a Dual Degree agreement with Fort Hays State University. These agreements will, for the first time, allow Cambodian students to  receive accredited American degrees without having to leave Cambodia.

AUPP’s first President, Dr. Sharon Siverts, was appointed in July 2014.

AUPP's new President, Dr. Kenneth Dunn, was appointed in 2016.

==Campus==
AUPP moved into its new campus in 2017, located at 278H Street 201R, Russei Kéo, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This modern facility has been designed to enhance and support a model academic teaching and learning environment, incorporating the newest technologies, a learning center library, a modern FIFA regulation football field and student services that will complement academic offerings. The environment will allow students to develop their full potential, and acquire the necessary education and relevant skills to be competitive in the 21st century.

==Academics==
AUPP’s management is composed of qualified and experienced administrators with experience in American and other western institutions. AUPP employs highly qualified faculty members who have terminal degrees in their respective fields and international experience.

AUPP signed a Micro Campus agreement with [[University of Arizona]] (U of A) and a [[Double degree|Dual Degree]] agreement with Fort Hays State University (FHSU) at the AUPP campus in Phnom Penh, under which they will enter into a cooperative arrangement to deliver dual degree programs to AUPP students. This is the first time that a U.S. degree can be completed by Cambodian students entirely in [[Cambodia]]. The programs offered by AUPP with U of A and FHSU are “dual degrees”, meaning that students who finish four years of study at AUPP will receive one bachelor's degree from AUPP and another one from an American Partner University. This agreement also allows AUPP students to study abroad at U of A or at FHSU in the United States for one or two semesters depending on their choice of Major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/university-arizona-inks-deal-micro-campus-american-university-phnom-penh-n649661/ |title=American University of Phnom Penh - AUPP |publisher=NBCNews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbcambodia.com/businesses/american-university-phnom-penh-aupp/ |title=American University of Phnom Penh - AUPP |publisher=Aupp.edu.kh |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUPP offers the following majors in partnership with University of Arizona or Fort Hays State University:

# Bachelor of Science in Business in Management, Marketing, Finance and Accounting (Dual Degree with University of Arizona)
# Bachelor of Arts in Law (Dual Degree with University of Arizona)
# Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (Dual Degree with University of Arizona)
# Bachelor of Business Administration in  Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management (Dual Degree with Fort Hays State University)
# Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Management (Dual Degree with Fort Hays State University)
# Bachelor of Arts in Architecture (Single Degree with AUPP)
# Bachelor of Arts in Global Affairs (Single Degree with AUPP)

==Student Life==
[[File:AUPP Students at Wikipedia workshop.jpg|thumb|right|AUPP students at a Wikipedia workshop in September 2018.]]
Student learning and development are promoted inside and outside of the classroom. In addition to AUPP’s rigorous academic programs, meaningful out-of-classroom learning opportunities further AUPP’s mission of developing [[Critical thinking|critical thinkers]] and socially responsible leaders. AUPP believes student involvement is a crucial part of the college experience and enhances students’ learning and preparation for successful careers.

AUPP’s student clubs include an IT club, yoga club, movie making club, football club, and several others.  Students are also involved in service-learning projects (social responsibility). The elected student government provides leadership opportunities, organizes [[field trip]]s, and organizes a speaker series which further round out students’ education.

AUPP’s internship program allows students to gain experience, build confidence, and enhance leadership capabilities by working as interns in various local organizations or on summer internship opportunities overseas.  The school also actively engages students in providing post graduate job opportunities and assists in getting students into advanced degree programs.

'''Amigos Library Services, Inc.''' is a membership-based [[United States|American]] not-for-profit chartered to serve [[libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Amigos|url=https://www.amigos.org/about|publisher=Amigos Library Services|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formed in 1974 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States, as the AMIGOS Bibliographic Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Barbara M.|title=Cooperation and Competition among Library Networks|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science|date=Nov 1980|volume=31|issue=6|pages=413–425|doi=10.1002/asi.4630310607}}&lt;/ref&gt; was included 22 libraries, united to bring [[OCLC]] access to the southwestern United States.  Today, Amigos is one of the [[United States|nation]]’s largest library resource-sharing networks and a provider of [[information technology]] to libraries.

In July 2012, Amigos merged with [[Missouri Library Network Corporation]] (MLNC), a member-based organization similar to Amigos and headquartered in St. Louis. The action followed votes to approve the merger in April 2012 by MLNC members and May 2012 by Amigos members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amigos/MLNC Merger Update|url=https://www.amigos.org/node/1210|publisher=Amigos Library Services|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=12 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime motivation of the MLNC Board was to meet the needs of MLNC's members and fulfill the organization's mission.  The Board conducted a thorough analysis of options and concluded that this merger best helps MLNC achieve that goal.

Both Amigos and MLNC brought strong continuing education programs to the new organization. MLNC and Amigos members immediately began to benefit from an increased ability to leverage library resources for purchasing thousands of library products and services from leading providers. The combined organization retained the Amigos name with Dallas as its headquarters and an office in the St. Louis area. The new organization became the largest library network west of the Mississippi River, comprising libraries and cultural heritage institutions in 22 states.

The Amigos membership consists of over 750 libraries and cultural-heritage institutions, located primarily in the [[southwestern United States]], who use Amigos' line of services, including cataloging, reference, resource sharing, preservation, digital imaging, consulting, and training.

The mission of Amigos Library Services is to:
* Provide services to libraries
* Promote library cooperation and resource sharing
* Strengthen libraries as leaders of their community
* Support libraries as education and information providers

Amigos Library Services is similar in scope to other library-oriented consortia such as [[Bibliographical Center for Research]], [[OhioLINK]], [[PALINET]] and [[LYRASIS]].

The site links to member press shopping carts, for immediate online purchase of the books listed. Accessibility offices can request files for students with disabilities from these pages as well.

Member presses visit BiblioVault's publishers' site, to submit and retrieve their files, edit metadata about their titles, and order deliveries of files and metadata to e-retailers, search sites, and printers. BiblioVault is also associated with a digital [[printing]] center within the [[University_press#Chicago_Distribution_Center|Chicago Distribution Center]] for short-run printing (and automated physical warehouse restocking) of titles stored in the repository.

Besides making more than file deliveries to e-retailers, such as [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]'s [[Nook]], Apple's [[iBooks]], [[Google Play]], etc., BiblioVault also fulfills ebooks directly using [[Adobe Digital Editions]] for member presses, via the Chicago Distribution Center's online shopping cart and several other independent press shopping carts.

'''William Alexander''' (2 April 1915 – 24 January 1997; born ''Wilhelm Alexander'') known as '''''Bill Alexander''''' on his TV show; was a [[Germany|German]] [[Painting|painter]], [[art instructor]], and [[television]] host. He was the creator and host of ''[[The Magic of Oil Painting]]'' (1974–82) television series that ran on [[PBS]] in the United States. He wrote ''The Art of Bill Alexander'' (1987–95), a series of books on [[wet-on-wet]] [[oil painting]]. He also taught the television painter [[Bob Ross]] the wet-on-wet technique.

==Biography==
Bill Alexander was born in [[East Prussia]], but his family fled to [[Berlin]] during [[World War I]]. Apprenticed as a carriage maker, Alexander was drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]]. Captured by Allied troops, he painted portraits of Allied officers' wives and he soon made his way to the United States.&lt;ref name="autob"&gt;{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = William | title = The Bill Alexander Story: An Autobiography | year = 1983 | publisher = Kendall Hunt Pub Co | location = Dubuque, IA | isbn = 0-8403-2990-3 | pages = 244 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Bill-Alexander-Story-Autobiography/dp/0840329903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324890717&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WWII, he became a refugee, and professional painter, pioneering the modern ''quick'' version of the [[wet-on-wet]] technique, and moving to North America. Later, he became a TV host on his painting education TV show.&lt;ref name=PaintersOnline-2015-10-27/&gt;

==Television career==
Alexander is best known for the television program ''[[The Magic of Oil Painting]]'' (1974-1982), which ran on [[PBS]] in the United States. In the tv series ''[[The Art of Bill Alexander &amp; Robert Warren]]'' (1984–1992), Alexander teamed with painters Lowell Speers, [[Robert Warren (artist)|Robert Warren]], Buck Paulson and Diane André. Alexander would introduce the episode, then hand it off to the hosting painter. This series is often erroneously listed either as a series of books or as a single documentary.

TV host and prolific painter [[Bob Ross]] studied under Alexander, from whom he learned his [[wet-on-wet]] technique, a method of painting rapidly using progressively thinner layers of oil paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=oh5p5f5_-7A|title=Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting; A Walk in the Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross dedicated the first episode of the second season of ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' to Alexander, explaining that "Years ago, Bill taught me this fantastic technique, and I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you [the viewer]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{YouTube|id=GARWowi0QXI|title="The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross: Meadow Lake", Season 2, Episode 1, 1 November 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained.  "He betrayed me," Alexander told the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' in 1991. "I invented 'wet on wet', I trained him, and ... he thinks he can do it better."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, A. (December 22, 1991). Bob Ross, the Frugal Gourmet of Painting. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=4&amp;src=pm ''New York Times'' archive], retrieved December 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historians have pointed out that the "wet-on-wet" (or [[alla prima]]) technique actually originated in Flanders during the 15th century, and was used by [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Paul Cezanne]], [[John Singer Sargent]], and [[Claude Monet]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, F.

The '''CK-12 Foundation''' is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization whose stated mission is to reduce the cost of, and increase access to, K-12 education in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="svbj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2014/03/28/the-reinvention-of-neeru-khosla.html?ana=sm_sjo_ucp27&amp;b=1395941537^14150321 |title=The reinvention of Neeru Khosla |publisher=Silicon Valley Business Journal |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CK-12 provides free and customizable [[K-12]] [[open educational resources]] aligned to state curriculum standards. The foundation's tools are used by 38,000 schools in the US, and additional international schools.&lt;ref name="svbj" /&gt;

CK-12 was established in 2007 by [[Neeru Khosla]] and [[Murugan Pal]] to support K-12 [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math]] (STEM) education.  The organization first generated and distributed educational content via a web-based platform called the "[[FlexBook]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Jane|title=CK-12 Foundation’s Neeru Khosla on Open Textbooks|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14141/|publisher=Creative Commons| accessdate =October 18, 2012|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CK-12 has updated its FlexBook platform and has begun to focus on concept-based, multi-modality learning.  CK-12 is being funded by the Amar Foundation and by [[Vinod Khosla|Vinod]] and Neeru Khosla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://flexbooks-wiki.ck12.org/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions/# |title=All about FlexBooks |access-date=2011-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609104707/http://flexbooks-wiki.ck12.org/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions# |archive-date=2012-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Neeru Khosla teamed with her husband, [[Vinod Khosla]], to think about how to make a positive impact in the educational sphere. Neeru chose to focus in particular on high school and middle school students and teachers, most notably in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Neeru found an enabling partner in Murugan Pal, whose strong technical and entrepreneurial skills helped the CK-12 idea manifest into a not-for-profit educational organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kamlashow.com/podcast/2008/08/05/murugan-pal-of-ck-12/# |title=Murgan Pal- Kamla Bhatt show |access-date=2011-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221101349/http://kamlashow.com/podcast/2008/08/05/murugan-pal-of-ck-12/# |archive-date=2011-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She then recruited teachers from all across America to author CK-12 textbooks, to be published under Creative Commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/|title=About The Licenses|work=creativecommons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining why she chose to provide open-source and collaborative content, Neeru says, “We can’t make all kids get an education, but we can make it simpler, easier, and more affordable. That’s the philosophy behind the openness as far as I’m concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/01/the-living-book-movement-free-education-for-all/|title=The "Living Book" Movement: Free Education For All|work=MindShift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "C" in CK-12 originally stood for "connect", indicating that the material was the missing connection in K-12 education.  The company's website now states that the C has an open meaning, and can stand for "content, classroom, customizable, connections, collaboration—the idea is that our content can be used by anyone, anywhere for free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.ck12.org/hc/en-us/articles/200344635-What-Does-The-C-in-CK-12-Stand-For-|title=What Does The "C" in CK-12 Stand For?|work=Help Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Microsoft]] announced a partnership with CK-12 to provide content to Microsoft's Windows 8 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edukwest.com/microsoft-emphasizes-student-privacy-partners-knewton-pearson-ck-12/|title=Microsoft emphasizes Student Privacy, partners with Knewton, Pearson|work=EDUKWEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FlexBook System ==

The [[FlexBook]] System is an online platform for assembling, authoring, and distributing interactive, multi-modal educational content.  Content is searchable by subject, grade-level, and state and national education standards.  FlexBooks can be downloaded and used as-is, or can be customized by teachers to match their students’ learning styles and their schools’ curricula.  Inside each book, entire chapters or bite-sized concepts can be rearranged, added, removed, and edited.  Any user can input text, photos, videos, exercises, study guides, assessments, notes, or highlights to their FlexBook.  FlexBooks can be shared, for free, with user-created groups in print, online, by email, or on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter.  Some Flexbooks are even available in Spanish and Hindi.

All FlexBooks conform to national and state curriculum guidelines, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core Standards]], and can be re-aligned to International standards. Flexbooks are offered under the [[Creative Commons]] by Attribution, Share-alike, and Non-commercial license, removing many of the restrictions that limit distribution of traditional textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolingtoday.com/flexbooks-challenge-textbooks-at-no-cost-to-students-or-schools/|title=FlexBooks challenge textbooks|work=schoolingtoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most CK-12 FlexBooks are created internally by authors with teaching and domain expertise. Additional FlexBooks are acquired through university donations and licensing partnerships. CK-12’s current{{when|date=December 2013}} library of 88 downloadable Flexbooks can be accessed in [[PDF]], [[ePub]], and [[Amazon Kindle]] optimized format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdmtech.blogspot.com/2011/07/ck-12-provides-free-electronic.html/ Electronic books]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept-based and multi-modal learning ==

CK-12 organizes its educational content into roughly 5000 concepts (e.g., "Two digit multiplication" or "Photosynthesis" or "Newton’s law"). CK-12 believes that these “Byte-Sized” units of 
content and modalities of learning (as well as varied styles of learning) are more important tools for facilitating learning than traditional educational materials like textbooks.  These concepts are further organized into "Learning Paths."&lt;ref name="ck12.org"&gt;http://www.ck12.org/about/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ck12-vision-document.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ck-12 content is available in a number of formats, which the organization describes as multiple “modalities of the concept.” Each modality is defined as “a different way to learn or explore” a specific concept and its relationship to other concepts. Examples include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref name="ck12.org"/&gt;

#Textual descriptions
#Video lectures
#Supplementary videos
#Multimedia simulations
#Interactive exploration models
#Quizzes/exams and question banks
#Examples of the concept in real-life use
#Maps of related concepts
#Web resources related to the concept
#Galleries of photographs
#Peer learning
#Labs or other experiments
#Flash cards
#Lesson plans

== Other products ==

In addition to its 88 FlexBooks, the CK-12 Foundation also offers the following resources to K-12 students:
* CK-12 Braingenie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://braingenie.ck12.org/|title=Braingenie|work=ck12.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Braingenie is the Web's largest{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and most comprehensive{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} repository of math and science practice materials.  Braingenie provides practice problems and video lessons relating to more than 4,000 skills. The system's adaptive learning system, which features games and awards, is intended to inspire students to achieve.
* CK-12 FlexMath&lt;ref&gt;[http://flexmath.com/ Flexmath]&lt;/ref&gt;  - The FlexMath system provides an online, interactive, year-long Algebra 1 curriculum.  In addition to its daily lessons, FlexMath offers a gamified system designed to help students practice core math skills at their own pace.
* CK-12 I Need a Pencil&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ineedapencil.com/ I Need A Pencil]&lt;/ref&gt;  - [[INeedAPencil]].com is a free, online SAT preparation website. The site features over 800 practice questions and lessons in math, reading, and writing. INeedAPencil.com was founded in 2007 by then high school student Jason Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/college/2010/profiles/jason-shah.html|title=America's Coolest College Start-ups 2010: Jason Shah - Harvard University - Inc.com|work=Inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to provide access to SAT prep to thousands of low-income students who cannot afford traditional test preparation.

In the future, CK-12 intends to expand its offerings by continuing to produce its own content, but also by asking for contributions from its active, engaged community.  CK-12 will continue to match its content to an expanding base of learning standards like McREL Compendium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcrel.org/standards-benchmarks/|title=McREL: Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning, Content Knowledge Standards and Benchmark Database|work=mcrel.org|access-date=2012-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104223216/http://www.mcrel.org/standards-benchmarks/#|archive-date=2012-01-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} '''Charles Holston Williams''' (1886–1978) was the founder, organizer and first director of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090415095843/http://www.hamptonu.edu/academics/schools/libarts/health/TERPS.htm Hampton Institute Creative Dance Group]. This company was the first national touring company composed of college students that was created by an American of any color.  Williams was also an associate professor and supervisor of the Physical Education Department at [[Hampton Institute]], located in Hampton, Virginia.

==Early life==
Charles Williams was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], on January 25, 1886. In 1904 he attended high school at [[Berea College]], but the following year Williams was forced to transfer to an all-black school, [[Hampton Institute]], because the state general assembly had passed the Day Law, stating that blacks and whites could no longer attend the same schools.  At Hampton Institute, Williams resumed his high school education and continued on to further his college education

In college, Williams excelled in football, basketball, and baseball and gained the reputation of being an outstanding athlete.  However, in 1910, he fell from a scaffold while painting a house, injured his knees, and was told that he would never be able to walk again. Williams' persistence, a trait that enabled him to complete several visionary projects during his lifetime, allowed him to recover and pull himself through this rough time.  That same year,  Williams became the director of physical training at Hampton Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Perpener | first=John | title=African-American Concert Dance: The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond  | year=2001 | publisher=University of Illinois Press | isbn=0-252-02675-6 |pages=82}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2009-04-12 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Williams' interest in dance came from his deep involvement in physical education and recreation.  He believed that athletic and social games, track and field meets, as well as other rhythmic movement activities served as a tool for self-improvement and development.  Furthermore, Williams thought that dance served an important purpose of connecting African Americans to their heritage.  This idea foreshadows the philosophy behind the [[Harlem Renaissance]], which came a few years after.

In 1917, Williams organized annual physical education demonstrations in which the students and faculty at the Hampton Institute performed drills, gymnastics, and dances for the public. Students performed L'Zoronta, a Spanish dance, and the Tarantella, an Italian folk dance.  At this point in time, Williams had not yet incorporated his idea about the heritage of African Americans and dance movement; this implementation was to come in subsequent years.

In 1925, the [[Denishawn Company]] performed at Hampton Ogden Hall.  The company's appearance allowed for a mutually supportive relationship between [[Ted Shawn]] and Williams during the 1930s.  In 1934, Ted Shawn even contributed one of his dances to the Hampton Creative Dance Group.

In 1930, Williams attended the Harvard University Summer School of Physical Training, earned his master's degree, as well as took dance classes.  In 1937 and 1938 he attended the Bennington Summer School of Dance where he observed classes and attended various performances. These two schools shaped his knowledge on dance as well as improved his dance technique, and choreography.

On Hampton's sixty-sixth anniversary celebration, on April 26 and 27, 1934, Williams presented a program of "interpretive dances." Two pieces, ''The Feast of Ramadan'', which was about the Muslim celebration after a month of fasting, and ''Ya Ma Wisee'', which was a dance of thanksgiving, were the first two dances to become a part of the Hampton Creative Dance Group repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Perpener | first=John | title=African-American Concert Dance: The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond  | year=2001 | publisher=University of Illinois Press | isbn=0-252-02675-6 |pages=84}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2009-04-12 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hampton Institute Creative Dance Group==
In 1934, Williams established the Hampton Institute Creative Dance Group. Williams, along with the help of some of his male African students, choreographed works that were to be performed by the company.  Frank O. Roberts from Liberia, was Williams' most outstanding student and was a featured soloist with the Hampton company. In the early stages, it was the male dancers who were predominantly featured throughout the Hampton group's repertoire. Williams exemplified his affinity for working with male students in his energetic, athletic work entitled ''Men of Valor'', which was also presented during the anniversary of Hampton Institute in 1934. Williams' background as an athlete served as inspiration for this work as he used the movements from sports such as boxing and shot-putting, as the basis of his choreography.

Through the years, Williams reached out to female faculty members to assist him.  His best known co-director was Charlotte Moten, who worked with the company from 1936 to 1942.  The addition of female dancers to the company increased when Moten began working with Williams.  In 1936, the company had become officially recognized as a welcome addition to the other performance groups on campus and embarked on its series of tours.

In 1937, the company went on a southern tour in April and performed at the major black colleges - Florida A&amp;M in Tallahassee, Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and North Carolina A&amp;T.  During the winter, they performed at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, high schools in New Jersey, the YM-YWHA's Theresa L. Kaufmann Auditorium in New York, and the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem.  Some of the works that were performed included:''Dis Ole Hammer – Water Boy'', ''Mama Parah'',  which involved Roberts doing West African movements on stilts, ''Wyomami'', a work that dealt with African marriage customs, and ''The Fangai Man'', which centered on the West Indian Obeah man.  The company continued touring and received favorable reviews from many popular periodicals such as [[TIME Magazine]], and the New York Sun Times.  They abruptly stopped, however, when America was drawn into [[World War II]], and many of the men dancing at Hampton had to leave school to defend their country.  The company resumed in 1946 but very slowly because Williams was too pressured from universities, the community, and his business responsibilities.  In 1951, Williams retired from Hampton.&lt;ref name="Emery 1998 244-245"&gt;{{cite book | last=Emery | first=Lynne Fauley | title=Black Dance From 1619 to Today  | year=1998 | publisher=Princeton Book Company | isbn= 0-916622-63-0 |pages=244–245}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2009-04-02 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the company on the development of Negro concert dance was very significant.  Even though the company was composed of amateurs who were Hampton Institute students majoring in physical education, these students were eventually going to go on teaching in the segregated Negro schools throughout the country.  Williams' students brought with them a dance training that had the potential for creating future programs as well as the ability to educate audience members

Today, the Hampton Institute is known as the Terpischorean Dance Company and performs at Hampton University and in the surrounding community.  They showcase the talents of Hampton students who have studied Tap, Ballet, African, Jazz, Modern, and other forms of dance.  Hampton University has "paid homage to the cultural significance of the Black Dance experience and provides students with diverse cultural opportunities in the predominantly African American Dance Company.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hampton University Terpischorean Dance Company |url=http://www.hamptonu.edu/academics/schools/libarts/health/TERPS.htm |publisher=Hampton University |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415095843/http://www.hamptonu.edu/academics/schools/libarts/health/TERPS.htm |archivedate=2009-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and Style==
Charles Williams was famous for his use of [[African diaspora]]s in his [[modern dance]] choreography.  His innovative style came from his ability to fuse cultural and spiritual themes with modern elements.  The Dance Group also used Haitian and African religious dance forms, as well as [[Negro spirituals]].  Apart from African dances, Williams also chose to infuse his works with black American material.  For example, he used some of the older plantation dances such as the ''Juba'' and ''Cake-Walk'' in his choreography.&lt;ref name="Emery 1998 244-245" /&gt;

==Literature==

''The Southern Workman'' (1917) - an article Williams published in Hampton's monthly journal that dealt with his ideas concerning the importance of movement in the lives of young people.

''Cotton Needs Pickin''' (1928) - explores the relationship between art, recreation, and the folklore of black Americans.  Williams also included a documentation of numerous folk dances native to southern blacks, and included written descriptions, lines of music, and photographs.

Other works include: ''Characteristic Negro Folk Dances'', ''Negro Soldiers in World War I: The Human Side'', ''Sidelights on Negro Soldiers'', and ''The Race Problem''.

The majority of lifelong smokers begin smoking habits before the age of 24, which makes the college years a critical time for tobacco companies to convince college students to pick up the habit of cigarette smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.missouri.edu/news/0147.php|title=Research Reveals When and Why Students Smoke in Effort to Help Them Quit|website=medicine.missouri.edu|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarette smoking in college is seen as a social activity by those who partake in it, and more than half of the students that are users do not consider themselves smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arnold H.|last2=Campo|first2=Shelly|last3=Gascoigne|first3=Jan|last4=Jolly|first4=Olivia|last5=Zakharyan|first5=Armen|last6=Tran|first6=Zung Vu|date=2007-08-01|title=Smoking, but not smokers: identity among college students who smoke cigarettes|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research: Official Journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco|volume=9|issue=8|pages=845–852|doi=10.1080/14622200701484987|issn=1462-2203|pmid=17654297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because most college students plan to quit smoking by the time that they graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.missouri.edu/news/0147.php|title=Research Reveals When and Why Students Smoke in Effort to Help Them Quit|website=medicine.missouri.edu|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of cigarette smoking by college students increased through the 1990s, but has since leveled off and seen decreases in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/12/08/college-campus-smoking-bans-work/IYolUcwwplOZnfuy2umzWL/story.html|title=Do college campus smoking bans work? - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education on the dangers of cigarettes is seen as a leading cause for this decrease. This activity is being seen as less socially acceptable than it was in the past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cigarette smoking on college campuses has become an important public health issue and there has been increase in campus wide smoking bans and other preventative programs to reduce the rates of students smoking. The cause of these bans are now starting to be discovered and there is controversy that goes along with implementing them across various schools in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2012/06/08/smoking-bans-spark-controversy/|title=Smoking bans spark controversy|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protests against smoking bans are seen as a possible threat at schools such as the University of Vermont and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some smokers may also choose to neglect the bans and continue to smoke cigarettes regardless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Statistics==
The percentage of college students that smoke has fluctuated greatly over the years. Studies in 1993 and 1997 showed that the percent of U.S. college students who smoked were 22 percent and 28 percent respectively. The Harvard School of Public Health concluded the percentage of college students who used tobacco products at least once a month was about 33 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schorr|first=Melissa|title=A Third of College Students Smoke|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=118065&amp;page=1#.UdZVsfmThoM|work=ABC|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Predictors associated with youth tobacco usage==
Certain social, economic, and environmental factors can be associated with the prediction of youth and an increased use in [[tobacco]]. [[Risk factor]]s include:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: A Report of the Surgeon General. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coordinating Center for Health Promotion, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower [[socioeconomic status]]
* Having parents, close relatives, friends, or guardians that smoke
* Acceptance and positive views of smoking by peers
* Incompletion of higher levels of [[education]]
* High availability of and exposure to tobacco products
* [[Violence|Violent behavior]]

===Stress and emotion===
Students note that smoking cigarettes reduces [[anxiety]], and smoking often occurs after stressful events or in stressful situations. Studies find that [[Depression (clinical)|depressed]] college students are more likely to smoke and have a more difficult time quitting than non-depressed college students. 31.9% of college smokers attribute their smoking behavior as a means to alleviate their depression.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, H.E.R., Cohen, L.M., McChargue, D.E. (2010) Depression vulnerability predicts cigarette smoking among college students: Gender and Negative reinforcement expectancies as contributing factors. Addictive Behaviors 35. 607-611&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is related to lower [[self-efficacy]], and depressed individuals are considered less able to resist smoking during times of low [[self esteem]], which leads to higher reports of smoking among depressed individuals.

===Weight loss===
{{ details|Cigarette smoking for weight loss }}
 
For women in particular, smoking is a tool for weight loss and weight management.&lt;ref name="Zucker, A.N. 2001"&gt;Zucker, A.N., Harrell, A., Miner-Rubino, K., Stewart, A. J., Pomerleau, C.S., Boyd, C. J. (2001)Smoking in College Women: The Role of the Thinness Pressures, Media Exposure and Crucial Consciousness.  Psychology of Women Quarterly 25. 233-241&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicotine]] in cigarettes is a successful [[appetite suppressant]], which contributes to the use of cigarettes as a [[dieting]] tool. The pressure to be thin along with a need for social approval drives many young college women to smoke.&lt;ref name="Zucker, A.N. 2001"/&gt; Body-conscious college women are also shown to be at higher risk for the continuation of smoking. Women who discontinue the use of nicotine as an appetite suppressant tend to gain weight initially, and women who are especially concerned with [[body weight]] will see this as a reason to continue smoking.&lt;ref name="Pomerleau, C.S. 1993"&gt;Pomerleau, C.S. et al (1993). The female weight-control smoker: A profile. Journal of Substance Abuse, 5, 391-400&lt;/ref&gt;
The media and tobacco [[advertising]] play an increasing role in perpetuating the thin body ideal. Studies show the more exposure women have to images of thin women, the lower their body satisfaction, and the more likely they are to want to diet.&lt;ref name="Pomerleau, C.S. 1993"/&gt;

===Field of study===
Some studies suggest even a student’s [[field of study]] may correlate to their smoking. The highest rates of smoking are found in students majoring in Communications, languages, or Cultural Studies, (37.4%) and the lowest rates of smoking are found in students majoring in Mathematics, Engineering, and sciences (21.0%).&lt;ref name="Berg, C.J. 2008"&gt;Berg, C.J., Klatt, C.M., Thomas, J.L., Ahluwalia, J.S., An, L.C. (2008). The Relationship of Field of Study to Current Smoking Status Among College Students. College Student Journal 43 (3). 744 -754&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study conducted at the University of Saint Joseph in Connecticut found that only 4% of nursing and bio-medical or health majors smoked cigarettes while up to 12% of students in other majors smoked.&lt;ref&gt;USJ Majors and Smoking Study 2012 (4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activity===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Smoking is viewed, by some students, as a way to socialize and take study breaks.&lt;ref name="Moran, S. 2004"&gt;Moran, S., Wechsler, H., &amp; Rigotti, N. A. (2004). Social Smoking Among US College Students. Pediatrics, 114 (4), 1028-1034&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is also correlated with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] use among college students. This is significant because alcohol use is highly prevalent among college students. Smoking is perceived by college students to aid in [[social interaction]]s, particularly with potential dating or sexual partners. Tobacco companies use this conception in their advertising. Companies produce ads depicting sexual images of men and women. Smoking after drinking is seen as a method of reorientation and an attempt to reduce feelings of inebriation, though smoking will not reduce [[blood alcohol level]]s. College students view smoking while drinking as a more acceptable practice relative to smoking while sober. Students who smoke while inebriated feel less judged by their peers. The most effective [[public health intervention]]s that aim to reduce cigarette smoking among college students target both alcohol and nicotine use.

==Social smokers==
Today’s [[smoking culture]] includes a subpopulation of smokers called “social smokers”.  Although there may be different explanations of what a social smoker is, many college students define “social smokers” as those who use tobacco in more social activities and find it essential for socializing, rather than using tobacco on a regular basis, dictated by [[nicotine dependence]].&lt;ref name="Moran, S. 2004"/&gt;  Social smokers are not [[Addiction|addicted]] to smoking, or worried about the social acceptability of their smoking habits.&lt;ref name="Moran, S. 2004"/&gt;  In a study conducted in 2004, 51% of current college smokers stated that they primarily smoked with other people and in social activities.  71% of occasional smokers smoked in a social situation, compared to daily smokers, 19% of which smoke in [[social environment]].  Students who started smoking within the past two years of the study were more than twice as likely to be social smokers than students who had been smoking for a longer period of time prior to the study.  Characteristics of social smokers have been found to include more females and non-Hispanic whites than other demographic characteristics, spent more time socializing with friends, were [[Binge drinking|binge drinkers]] and had a high importance for the arts.  Lastly, social smokers don’t perceive themselves at risk to tobacco related illnesses, nor believe they will ever become nicotine dependent.  Since social smokers don’t think they’ll become dependent on nicotine, they don’t plan on quitting during college, but have intentions to quit once they graduate.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Smoking and perceived gender disparities==
Studies have shown that there are social differences in the smoking behaviors of males and females in college.  In a 2006 study, [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]] data showed that males and females have certain perceptions of their sex or the opposite sex smoking.  From both male and female students’ perspectives, there were negative feelings towards women smoking and it was considered “unladylike”.  However, if men were smoking, the perception was positive, and they were considered cool or gave off a “tough guy” image.  In addition to drinking alcohol at parties, male students appeared in control if they had a cigarette in the other hand.  Even though there were negative perceptions of female students smoking, smoking at parties is considered more of a female behavior rather than a male behavior.  Despite negative perceptions of females smoking, students thought that when females smoke in groups of girlfriends it wasn’t trashy.  Rather, when female students smoked in groups of girlfriends it appeared as though individual’s smoking habits were regulated by the group, instead of the individual’s dependence on nicotine.
These perceived [[gender]] differences are inextricably linked with social environments where smoking and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption occur.  The perceptions of cigarette smoking in male and female students reflect similar perceptions of alcohol use in college students.&lt;ref&gt;Nichter, M., Nichter, M., Lloyd-Richardson, E.E., Flaherty, B., Carkoglu, A., Taylor, N. (2006). Gendered Dimensions of Smoking Among College Students. Journal of Adolescent Research, 215 (21), 215-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeting by the tobacco industry==
The [[tobacco industry]] is particularly concerned with younger audiences because they constitute the future of smoking and tobacco [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]. In an insider document from [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], the company states:
"It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes.  Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens... The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris." - Philip Morris Companies Inc., 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay J., &amp; Eriksen M. (2002). The Tobacco Atlas. World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;
Tobacco advertisements target youth and try to market cigarettes as a way to cope with changing environments (Ling). College is considered a crucial time in the lives of adolescents and is a time for change, experimentation, and discovery, which makes it an ideal time for tobacco companies to advertise and gain future [[consumer]]s.

===Replacement smokers===
The industry refers to new smokers as “replacement smokers” because they are in effect, replacing smokers who have quit or died, whether from smoking or other causes, over the years.&lt;ref name="media-awareness.ca"&gt;http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/tobacco_advertising/replacement_smoker.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Young people, including college students, constitute the majority of replacement smokers, and tobacco companies have created [[marketing]] campaigns targeting this [[age group]]. These advertisements show smoking as modern, hip, cool, fun, and adventurous.&lt;ref name="media-awareness.ca"/&gt; The [[Joe Camel]] cartoon character is famously known as [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJ Reynolds’]] tool to entice younger audiences towards cigarette smoking.

===Alternative press===
Tobacco companies use “alternative press” and [[brand recognition]] as another way to advertise toward college-aged students. Companies put their logo on everyday items like [[towel]]s, [[clothing]], and accessories, and this [[memorabilia]] is then given for free during events.&lt;ref name="media-awareness.ca"/&gt; These logos can also be seen in [[restaurant]]s and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, which are places young people frequent. During the 1980s and 1990s, tobacco companies aggressively advertised their products in bars and [[nightclub]]s, mostly targeting younger audiences.&lt;ref name="Sepe, E. P.M"&gt;Sepe, E., Ling, P.M., Glantz, S.A. (2002). Smooth Moves: Bar and Nightclub Tobacco Promotions that Target Young Adults American Journal of Public Health, 92 (3).  414-419&lt;/ref&gt; According to insider documents from tobacco companies RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris, tobacco companies had several strategies for targeting youth. They handed out free samples, sponsored parties at bars and fraternities on campuses, and hosted many events in popular [[spring break]] towns.&lt;ref name="Sepe, E. P.M"/&gt;
This aggressive advertising led to a general increase in smoking among young adults aged 18 to 24.

==Smoking bans==
Each year, approximately 440,000 deaths and $193 billion in [[healthcare]] costs are related to cigarette smoking, including smoking on college campuses&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5844.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (even though taxed tobacco amount to an excess of over $245 billion locally and is funded on the behalf of cancer research). Many campuses in the United States are attempting to reduce smoking rates among students by implementing [[Tobacco-Free College Campuses|campus-wide smoking bans]].  Various forms of smoking bans have been around for hundreds of years.  The first recorded [[legislation]] prohibiting tobacco use was in the [[Spanish colonies]] in 1575, passed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="sadireland.com"&gt;http://sadireland.com/smoking1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, smoking bans increased around the early twentieth century and have been increasing ever since.  In 1973, [[Arizona]] is the first state to pass a comprehensive law restricting smoking in public places in the current era.&lt;ref name="sadireland.com"/&gt;  The numbers of smoking bans on college campuses across the country have been increasing.  Between 2006 and 2008, the number of smoke-free campuses have quadrupled from 34 to 160,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/34309509.html?elr=KArksUUUU&lt;/ref&gt; but approximately 365 US colleges and universities have implemented some kind of [[Anti-smoking movement|anti-smoking]] rule, both indoor and outdoor &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1945356,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as around 500 campuses have smoke-free policies set in place for their residential housing.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-10-12-smokingban_N.htm?csp=34&lt;/ref&gt;  Smoking bans on college and university campuses have led to debates that bring forward a number of pros and cons.  For example, some pros to implementing campus wide smoking bans include creating a healthier environment and dramatically reducing the amount of [[environmental tobacco smoke]] (ETS) or [[secondhand smoke]] (SHS).  On the other hand, some students feel that these smoking bans violate their rights. The tobacco industry agrees that individuals should be able to avoid ETS or SHS, but believe that complete campus-wide bans "go too far".&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;
A study from 2005 found that other forms of intervention to decrease the rates of tobacco use on campus, such as restriction of tobacco distribution and restriction of smoking within 20 feet from entrances weren’t as effective as other programs like smoking cessation programs in influencing college students’ smoking behaviors.&lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com"&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/5/74#IDAAO1MHB&lt;/ref&gt; When prevention-oriented education was present on college campuses, students were 23% less likely to smoke compared to their peers who were not exposed to this kind of education.&lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com"/&gt; In addition to campus wide smoking bans, other interventions include health promotion programs that teach students the benefits of avoiding smoking and environments with smoke and create a general healthy college community.&lt;ref&gt;Martinelli, A. M. (1999). An Explanatory Model of Variables Influencing Health Promotion Behaviors in Smoking and Nonsmoking College Students. Public Health Nursing, 16 (4), 263-269&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Citadelle de Montpellier Bastion de VentadourA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Bastion de Ventadour'']] 
The '''Citadel of Montpellier''' is an [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern]] [[fortification]] in the city of [[Montpellier]], in the [[Hérault]] département of southern France.  It was built between 1624 and 1627, after several [[rebellion]]s under the orders of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in order to keep watch over the town.  In the 20th century it became the Joffre Barracks, named after [[Joseph Joffre]], and since 1947 the citadel has been an academic campus  - the nationwide famous '''Lycée Joffre'''.

==History==
[[Image:Citadelle de Montpellier Vestiges Bastion du Roi.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Remains of the ''Bastion du Roi'', as seen from within the citadel]]
===Military history===
In 1621&lt;!--1622?--&gt;, King Louis XIII arrived with soldiers to quell a [[Huguenot]] rebellion; he took over the city after an eight-month siege.  The king ordered that a royal citadel close to the city be constructed to control the city and the surrounding region, where there was a large Huguenot population.

The citadel was built between 1624 and 1627 between the fortifications of the ''Écusson'', or old town, and the coastal plain of the River Lez.  It was separated from the city proper by a wide [[esplanade]], looking over the floodplain of the Lez.  It comprised four [[bastion]]s organized in a square: facing the city was the ''Bastion du Roi'' ("King's Bastion") to the northwest and the ''Bastion de la Reine'' ("Queen's Bastion") to the southwest; facing the floodplain was the ''Bastion de Montmorency'' to the northeast and the ''Bastion de Ventadour'' to the southeast.

The buildings within the citadel have been reconstructed multiple times.  The last reconstruction before the citadel was converted into an educational building was in 1863. 

Under the [[Ancien Régime]], the citadel held royal troops as well as detachments of conscripted forces from [[Languedoc|Bas-Languedoc]].  Later, it became a barracks of the 2nd regiment of Génie.

[[Image:LyceeJoffre.jpg|left|190px|thumb|The Lycée Joffre as it appears today]]
===Scholarly history===
During the 19th century, it became clear that the [[Gymnasium (school)|high school]] for young men in Montpellier was too small: having been built near the esplanade in 1804 in the same place as a former [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school, by the later part of the century, the high school and its students were dispersed throughout two other sites north of the old town.

In 1947 city authorities decided to move the high school into the citadel, which had since become the Joffre Barracks.  The first classes were held there on 1 October 1948, and the last students were moved in during October 1959.

Since then, the buildings have been adapted to present-day life and new buildings for classrooms have been added.  The powder magazine of the ''Bastion de Montmorency'' has been converted into an olympic pool and large gymnasium, and the nearby fields into athletic fields.  The academic campus, constituted of the [[Secondary education in France|middle school]], high school and ''[[Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles|classes préparatoires]]'', occupies 15 hectares.

==Remains still intact==
[[Image:Citadelle de Montpellier Bastion du RoiA.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Remains of the ''Bastion du Roi'' near the [[Place de la Comédie]]]]
Of the original citadel, the following vestiges remain:
* The two southern bastions (''la Bastion de la Reine'' and ''la Bastion de Ventadour'') and the wall linking them have been preserved.  There is a palm grove planted at the base of the wall; the two bastions and the wall face the ''Allée Henri II de Montmorency '' ("Alley of Henry II of Montmorency") and the district of [[Antigone District|Antigone]].
* On the west side there remains the ''Bastion du Roi'', which has been broken in multiple places to allow for construction of automobile access roads and pedestrian footpaths between the northern parking lot and the center of Montpellier.  The walls and their [[embrasure]]s are still visible.  A railway coming from the [[Gare de Montpellier Saint-Roch]] crosses the base of the old wall in a tunnel.
* At the north, the ''Bastion de Montmorency'' is visible, standing over a parking lot and the adjoining Board of Education buildings.  It currently serves as the gymnasium of the Lycée Joffre.

'''Classroom Assessment Techniques''', also referred to as CATs, are strategies educators use to gauge how well students are comprehending key points during a lesson or a course. The techniques are meant to be a type of [[formative assessment]] that also allow teachers to make adjustments to a lesson based on students' needs. CATs are most commonly ungraded, unanimous, and are conducted during class time.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite web|title=Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs)|url=http://tlc.provost.gwu.edu/classroom-assessment-techniques|publisher=University Teaching &amp; Learning Center|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The incorporation of classroom assessment techniques is an age-old concept which teachers have been using and practicing for years. Whether a [[teacher]] uses a technique learned in training, or simply a strategy conjured up on their own, teachers need to know if their methods are successful and many feel that the desire to understand students' comprehension is instinctive. Despite this innate characteristic among teachers, the first real attempt to document such techniques for teachers didn't appear until 1988, when [[K. Patricia Cross]] and Thomas A. Angelo published “Classroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for Faculty”.

==Benefits for teachers==
By using [[corrective feedback|feedback]] attained through CATs, teachers gain insight into which concepts their students understand the best and which ones are most confusing. They can then use this information to decide when there needs to be more instruction, and when the class is ready to move on to the next topic. In this way, teachers are able to meet the needs of their students most effectively. These techniques can also help teachers understand the ways their students learn the best, as well as alert teachers when a certain teaching approach is not working very well. Other benefits include flexibility and timeliness.&lt;ref name="Mirham"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mirham|first1=Danielle|title=Classroom Assessment Techniques|url=http://www.crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/ClassroomAssessmentTechniquesHopkins.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the techniques, although not all, can be used in a variety of ways. They can be adapted to fit large or small class sizes, or modified depending on what subject matter is being taught; they can be used to assess students' recall or critical thinking skills. Also, CATs require very little time, if any, to be set aside - most of the activities can be conducted during regular instruction time.

==Benefits for students==
Classroom Assessment Techniques allow students a chance to see how they are progressing over time. Along with that, it shows students that their feedback can make a difference in what and how they learn, which in turn could lead students to take more ownership of their education. Students have reported that they feel more involved in the learning process when these techniques are used in the classroom because it requires them to focus on what they're learning&lt;ref name="Mirham"/&gt; – they become active participants rather than passive learners. The integration of CATs in the classroom can also serve as an example for how learning is an ongoing, highly adaptable process.&lt;ref name="Washington"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Background Knowledge Probe===
The Background Knowledge Probe consists of a few simple questions (and perhaps a couple focused ones) asked typically before the start of a unit or when introducing a new important topic. The purpose of this [[questionnaire]] is to inform the teacher of how much prior knowledge students have on a specific subject matter. This will help the teacher figure out an effective starting point for the lesson as well as an appropriate level of instruction.&lt;ref name="Mirham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Patricia K.|last2=Angelo|first2=Thomas A.|title=Classroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for Faculty|date=1988|publisher=Board of Regents of The University of Michigan|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED317097.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this strategy is most often used as an introduction to a lesson, it can also be beneficial halfway through and at the end to see what the students have learned.&lt;ref name="Mirham"/&gt; This particular technique can be easily modified to fit any subject matter – history, science, math, English, music, and so on. For example, a question that might be found on a Background Knowledge Probe questionnaire would be: "Explain what you know about the Louisiana Purchase."

===Traffic Light Cards===
The teacher distributes one red card and one green card to each student. Then, during the lesson while instruction is taking place, students can hold up either card to show how well they understand. If the teacher sees his or her students holding up all green cards, they know to continue their lesson. If the students are holding up red cards, the teacher knows that something was unclear and needs to be discussed further. This type of immediate feedback is helpful for the teacher to see how well students are learning, and it also gives the students an opportunity to engage and take control of their learning. This technique is typically practiced in elementary classrooms, although it can also be effective at the middle school and high school grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leahy|first1=Siobhan|last2=Lyon|first2=Christine|last3=Thompson|first3=Marnie|last4=William|first4=Dylan|title=Classroom Assessment: Minute by Minute, Day by Day|journal=Educational Leadership|date=November 2005|volume=63|pages=19–24|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov05/vol63/num03/Classroom-Assessment@-Minute-by-Minute,-Day-by-Day.aspx|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muddiest Point===
The Muddiest Point is another general CAT that can be used for any subject in any grade level. When using this technique, the teacher instructs students to briefly state what part of the lesson or assignment was most confusing for them. This allows the teacher to figure out which areas need to be reiterated. Reviewing every area that each student felt was unclear is a lot of work, and teachers may find themselves simply teaching the entire lesson all over again. As an alternative, teachers should focus on the top two or three most common responses. This technique also requires students to learn how to articulate their confusion, a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Mirham"/&gt;

=== What’s the Principle? ===
This method is effective in courses that call for problem-solving. Students determine the nature of the problem and decide on the theory to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/cats/|title=Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs) {{!}}   Center for Teaching {{!}} Vanderbilt University|website=cft.vanderbilt.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Problem Recognition Task ===
The rationale is to pinpoint issues that can be solved effectively using teaching methods in the classroom. The students must name the technique that suits the problem without solving said concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/2bgkackujmik/problem-recognition-tasks-cat/|title=Problem Recognition Tasks (CAT)|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student Generated Test Questions ===
These questions may be utilized one or two weeks before an examination. The teacher writes broad guidelines about the types of questions for the tests and shares them with students so they can answer at least one or two of these questions expected to appear on the actual exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edtechreview.in/trends-insights/insights/2868-classroom-assessment-techniques-for-teachers|title=Popular K-12 Classroom Assessment Techniques Teachers Need to Know|last=Gupta|first=Priyanka|work=EdTechReview|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classroom Opinion Polls ===
The teacher formulates brief two up to four items of questionnaires in helping find out opinions of students about issues related to the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clayton.edu/cid/The-Academy-For-Online-Course-Development/Online-Assessment/Class-Polls|title=Classroom Opinion Polls - Center for Instructional Design - Clayton State University|website=www.clayton.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory Matrix ===
This is a fundamental two-dimensional illustration or table. The rectangle is divided into rows and columns to systematize information as well as define relationships. It helps evaluate the students’ recollection of vital course content and skills in organizing information into different categories the teacher supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mghihp.edu/faculty-staff-faculty-compass-teaching-teaching-strategies/examples-classroom-assessment-techniques#MemoryMatrix|title=Examples of Classroom Assessment Techniques {{!}} MGH Institute of Health Professions|website=www.mghihp.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deen and his wife Kristin are the parents of nine children.  They live in [[Abita Springs, Louisiana]].

==Books==

Deen Kemsley is the author of '''''Trust in the Lord: Reflections of Jesus Christ.''''' Many prominent business leaders and others have endorsed his book. The following review came from Publisher's Weekly:

Kemsley, an accounting professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, posits that “the journey to know Christ is the journey to know the deepest, best element of ourselves.” In this brief book, Kemsley draws on personal experiences and anecdotes to demonstrate how he came to know Christ. His experiences are not miraculous or earth-shattering, but ordinary and real: seeing Christ reflected in a newborn, for example, or an act of service. As a father of nine children, many of these acts of service are unseen and unthanked late-night feedings or diaper changes; though they did not seem significant at the time, Kemsley now realizes that such simple deeds mean everything. Although Kemsley is a Mormon and the book is from an LDS publisher, it has a deeply ecumenical tone. The focus throughout is on knowing and loving Christ, not emphasizing denominational differences. Although it lacks the poetic nature of some other memoirish devotional books of this type, such as The Quantity of a Hazelnut, there is a simple honesty to this volume that makes it refreshing and quietly lovely. (Mar.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">The [[Israel]]i '''Education and Youth Corps''' ({{lang-he-n|חיל החינוך והנוער}}, ''Heil HaHinuh VeHaNo'ar'') is the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[Manpower Directorate]] corps responsible for the education of soldiers and commanders in [[Israeli military|Israel's military]]. It is designed to instruct and develop national values among the troops.

==Goal and designation==
According to former Chief Education Officer [[Avner Shalev]], the aims of the education system in the IDF are to increase the motivation and morale of the troops and units. This is achieved by introducing cultural activities into the lives of soldiers, teaching them about the country and its values—both national and universal—as well as by teaching them about the nature of their duties as soldiers and citizens of the state.&lt;ref name="IDF encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Goal of Education in the IDF|author=Shalev, Avner|publisher=Revivim Publishing|year=1982|volume=Volume 12|encyclopedia=IDF in Its Corps: Army and Security Encyclopedia|pages=151|editor=Shif, Yehuda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Education and Youth Corps is divided into two main brigades - the ''Magen'' division and the education division - as well as 6 independent units directly subordinate to the Chief Education Officer:
*The Jerusalem College
*Planning and organization branch
*Education and youth [[Bahad|training base]] ({{Hebrew|בה"ד החינוך והנוער}}, ''Bahad HaHinukh VeHaNo'ar'')
*The School for Leadership ({{Hebrew|בית הספר למנהיגות}}, ''Beit HaSefer LeManhigut'', abbr. '''''Bisl'''a'''m''''')
*The army weekly magazine ''[[Bamahane]]''
*[[Israeli Army Radio]] ({{Hebrew|גלי צה"ל}}, ''Galei Tzahal'', abbr. '''''G'''a'''l'''a'''tz''''')

===Magen division===
The ''Magen'' (an abbreviation for '''''M'''orot-Hayalot'' (teacher soldiers), '''''M'''akam'', ''[[Gadna (Israel)|'''G'''adna]]'' and ''[[Nahal|'''N'''ahal]]''), comprises four IDF education programs:
*''Mak'am'' (an abbreviation for ''Merkaz Kidum Ukhlusiyot Meyuhadot'' - Center for the Advancement of Special Population Groups), a program initiated by [[Rafael Eitan]] to call up and support soldiers who would otherwise not be called up, such as those with serious educational deficiencies (lack of compulsory education), long criminal histories, etc. These are termed 'adaptation problems' in the IDF, and those with a rating of 40-60 are considered ''Mak'am'' youth. The ''Mak'am'' base is called Havat HaShomer and located in the north of the country, and trains those ''Mak'am'' youth with the most serious problems.
*Teacher soldiers, a program to train soldiers to become teachers in the civilian sector.
*Gadna, short paramilitary training programs for high school youth. The Gadna program has 3 such training bases - Tzalmon in the north, Ju'ara in the center, and Sde Boker in the south of the country.
*[[Nahal#Nahal and Youth Command|Nahal Nucleus]] ({{Hebrew|גרעין נח"ל}}, ''Gar'in Nahal''), another pre-military-age program.

Mihve Alon, a training base for new immigrants not proficient in the Hebrew language, is also subordinate to the ''Magen'' division.

===Education division===
The education division serves as the professional guide for the other units of the corps, and of the IDF in general. It is divided into 6 branches:
*''Mak'am'' branch
*Education and [[Hasbara]] branch
*Culture branch
*[[Aliyah]] branch
*Arm and corps branch
*''Moriah'' branch &lt;!-- מורי"ה = ??? --&gt;
&lt;!-- מחצ"בים - מד"צים חונכים צעירים? זה גם כפוף למח' חינוך, אבל מה זה? --&gt;

== Education and youth training base ==
The Education and youth training base, or by its name ''Sha'arei Avraham'' (Abraham's gates) was built near the Re'em Junction in the Lachish Valley near [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]].

Many of the soldiers in various roles in the Education Corps get their training in the Youth Education Training Base.

Among these roles:
#Mashakit Hod מש"קית הו"ד - teaching and command NCO
#Madan Merhav and Basis מד"ן מרחב ובסיס - a youth guide in the base and region
#Mashakit Hinukh מש"קית חינוך - education NCO
#Mashakit Aliya מש"קית עלייה - immigration NCO
#Military ensemble
#Museum guides

*The teacher-soldiers who are also a part of the Education Corps don't get their training in the Youth Education Training Base, but in a civic seminary called Ramot Shapira, which is in [[moshav]] [[Beit Meir]], next to Jerusalem. this is a result of the "lending agreement" with the Education Minister of Israel.

== Insignia ==
[[Image:Tag hinuh.png|right|thumb|Education and Youth Corps logo]]
The emblem of the Education and Youth Corps is composed of four stripes integrating into one flame.

Three of them (different shades of blue) represent the three different centers of the corps and the fourth (colored white) represents the headquarters of the corps.

&lt;!-- == Bases ==
'''Mikhv"e Alon''' ("[[Yigal Alon]] Education and Learning Center") - for new immigrants and minorities lacking proficiency in the Hebrew language. In this base the commanders are immigration/[[aliyah]] specialists (singular: {{lang-he|מש"קית עליה}} ''Mashakit aliya'') and immigration officers.

'''Havat HaShomer''' - for soldiers with adaptation problems (which may or may not include deficiencies in education).

CLEANUP AND EXPLAIN: In this base the commanders are mash"akit ho"d עברית: מש"קית הו"ד- (commander that is not an officer for teaching and command) and Ktsinat ho"d עברית: קצינת הו"ד - (officer for teaching and command).
*Usually this role are done by female commanders and officers there for named in female gender.

The corps also runs three [[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]] bases. These bases offer a week-long experience for teens aged 16-17. Schools from all over Israel send their 11th and 12th graders for a week of [[recruit training|boot camp]] experience. In this week the teens experience military discipline, arms lessons, weapon use, physical exercises and more.

The three bases are:
*Tsalmon - [[Galilee]], east of [[Karmiel]]
*Ju'ara - [[Lower Galilee]], next to [[Yokneam Illit]]
*Sde Boker - in the [[Negev]], beside [[Kibbutz]] [[Sde Boker]] --&gt;

'''Education graphics''', or '''edugraphics''', are graphic visual representations of educational information intended to simplify [[Economic, social and cultural rights|social-cultural]] content, communication related content, [[Linguistics|linguistic]] content, etc. The use of rich visual content improves [[cognition]], as the students [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] is enhanced when both visual and text-based cues are combined.

Edugraphics have existed since learning manuals began to be used in elementary schools, high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Histoire Géographie Education civique 2de Bac Pro - Livre élève consommable - Ed. 2013; De Michel Casta, Michel Corlin, Thierry Falconnet, Gilles Labadou, Alain Prost&lt;/ref&gt; These edugraphics, known by the term [[infographic]]s or "information graphics", are used to explain different subjects (geography, history, science, biology...).&lt;ref&gt;Durandeau Hachette, 13 Mai 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to illustrate some aspect of the lesson (map of invasions, timelines, internal organs, etc.), and they were drawn or made by computer graphics.

== Origin ==
[[Image:orbispictus.JPG|thumb|right| A late 18th-century reprint of ''Orbis Pictus'', published in Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]).]]
The term "edugraphic" is born from its cousin "[[infographic]]" which is relatively recent and the result of considerable debate in the design community. The [[Society for Technical Communication]] group describes infographics as "the translation of complex, unorganized or unstructured data into valuable, meaningful information".&lt;ref&gt;Kim Baer (2008), Information Design Workbook, Graphic Approaches, solutions and inspiration + 30 case studies. Rokport, p,12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comenius]] used a visual education with the publication of ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' in 1658.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Writing for Children|last=Epstein|first=Connie C.|year=1991|publisher=Archon Books|isbn=0-208-02297-X|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infographics made significant developments thanks to the journalistic use old newspapers&lt;ref&gt;Colmes N. (1984) ''Designer's Guide to Creating Charts and Diagrams'', New York: Watson-Guptill&lt;/ref&gt; nowadays infographics are now being used in several media and they serve to condense large amounts of information gathered from data banks that are nowadays easily found on the internet.

The First International Conference on Graphics Education was held in [[Alvor (Portimão)|Alvor]], Algarve, [[Portugal]] 1993 with the name Edugraphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Santo|first1=Harold P.|title=Edugraphics '93 : First International Conference on Graphics Education|date=1993|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|location=Lisbon|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/edugraphics-93-first-international-conference-on-graphics-education-compugraphics-93-third-international-conference-on-computational-graphics-and-visualization-techniques-5-10-december-1993-alvor-algarve-portugal-combined-proceedings/oclc/496721591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edugraphics, even though the term has not yet been widely spread, were used first in textbooks in every country. For example, in history textbooks, the use of [[timeline]]s was highly effective for its power to illustrate several historical information elements in one straight line. Maps showed the population of a country, its social status, etc. The images used were called "graphics", "pie-charts", "bar-charts", "maps".

== Differences ==
[[Mooc|MOOC]]s will make edugraphics - which are highly adapted for these open courses - necessary.

The difference between [[infographic]]s and edugraphics are basically the way contents are treated because they are not data but pedagogical content, like theories, process, rules, (grammar and maths), etc. Infographics may be used in school for pedagogical purposes but are not intended to explain pedagogical facts.

Edugraphics combines 3 basic elements: visual content (icons, images, colors), pedagogical content, and a learning scenario (story).

===Visual content===
Visuals are a basic and important element. Basic notions of design should be used to create an edugraphic, for instance how to use colors properly (contrast), how to use fonts meaningfully and how to organize every single element in a canvas.

===Pedagogical content===
Pedagogical content is the main reason for creating an edugraphic. The contents have to be related to a specific subject for the course. For example, in a French course, if the teacher is explaining the vocabulary of the body (head, mouth, eyes, etc.), instead of listing the vocabulary, a simple edugraphic will use a picture or a drawing of a character's body and each part will be pointed out with arrows. But that is a simple edugraphic. What about explaining the use of an auxiliary verb in French (‘avoir’: to be) to the student? The edugraphic could show illustrations of someone's birthday: "j'ai 15 ans", someone who is showing a car as if it were his: "j'ai une voiture", or someone who is really cold : "j'ai froid".

===Scenario===
As interesting as the content should be, the way it is told or explained to students is often as important as the content. Students are going to engage more if the content is appealing to them.

== Categories ==
They are 5 types of edugraphics{{according to whom|date=February 2014}}: Oneshot subject, timeline, process, gameboard, instructions.

'''Oneshot subject:''' Edugraphic that puts a simple educational fact into illustration. One single image equals a rule or a notion.

'''Timeline: '''When dealing with historical issues, a great way of showing each step in history is through a timeline. It is easy to understand the facts when represented in such a manner.

'''Process:''' Explaining to students how the water cycle works is a perfect example of a process-type edugraphic.

'''Gameboard:''' Gameboard edugraphics allow teachers to use a model where students can interact. This representation is used to show a certain type of process mixed with timeline elements.

'''Instructions :''' An edugraphic that helps students follow simple steps that are well illustrated with icons and images.  A sort of Ikea instruction manual but for education.

'''FSU Young Scholars Program (YSP)''' is a six-week residential [[science]] and [[mathematics]] summer program for 40 [[Florida]] [[Secondary education in the United States|high school students]] with significant potential for careers in the fields of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]]. The program was developed in 1983 and is currently administered by the Office of Science Teaching Activities in the [[Florida State University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Florida State University]].

==Academic program==
Each young scholar attends a total of three courses in the fields of mathematics, science, and computer programming. The courses are designed specifically for this program—they are neither high school nor college courses.

==Research==
Each student who attends YSP is assigned an Independent Research Project (IRP) based on his or her interests. Students join the research teams of [[Florida State University|FSU]] professors, participating in [[scientific research]] for two days each week.  The fields of study available range from [[robotics]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[physics]], to [[zoology]]. At the conclusion of the program, students present their projects in an [[academic conference]], documenting their findings and explaining their projects to both students and faculty.

==Faculty==
The program is co-directed by Dr. Erica Staehling, Barbara Shoplock, and Teresa Callahan, members of the Office of Science Teaching Activities, [[Florida State University]]. Instructional faculty includes Dr. Steve Blumsack, Emeritus Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Dr. Dan Oberlin, Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Drs. Harrison Prosper and Horst Wahl, Professors of [[Physics]]; and Dr. Lloyd Epstein, Professor of [[biology|Biological Science]]. Twenty additional Florida State science and engineering faculty members mentor the students in their independent research projects.

==Selection process==
YSP admits students who have completed the eleventh grade in a Florida [[public high school|public]] or [[private high school]].  A few exceptionally qualified and mature tenth graders have been selected in past years, though this is quite rare.

All applicants must have completed [[Pre-Calculus]] and maintain at least a 3.0 unweighted [[Grading (education)|GPA]] to be considered for acceptance. Additionally, students must have scored at the 90th percentile or better in science or mathematics on a nationally standardized exam, such as the [[SAT]], [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], or [[PLAN (test)|PLAN]].  Students are required to submit an application package, including [[Transcript (education)|high school transcripts]] and a letter of recommendation.

Selection is extremely competitive, as there are typically over 200 highly qualified applicants competing for only 40 positions.  The majority of past participants graduated in the top ten of their respective high school classes, with over 25% of students entering their senior year ranked first in their class.  The average [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] score of past young scholars was in the 97th percentile in math and 94th percentile in critical reading nationally.

'''GoUNESCO'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Incredible, historic India|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/incredible-historic-india/article4294664.ece|accessdate=8 June 2015|work=The Alternative}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an umbrella of initiatives that help promote awareness  and provide tools for laypersons to engage with heritage. GoUNESCO was created by Ajay Reddy in 2012. It is supported by [[UNESCO]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Support for GoUNESCO by Unesco New Delhi|url=http://www.gounesco.com/unesco-new-delhi-support-gounesco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
GoUNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prasad|first1=Usha|url=http://www.thealternative.in/lifestyle/gounesco-making-heritage-travel-in-india-fun/|accessdate=8 June 2015|title=Making heritage travel in India fun|work=The Alternative}}&lt;/ref&gt; began when Ajay Reddy saw a tweet posted by Pallavi Savant [https://twitter.com/pallavisavant/statuses/158931173018570753 Pallavi Savant] of a photo from a World Heritage Site and asked how many people had been to the heritage sites whose photographs were printed at the back of the entry pass. Ajay Reddy realized that he himself was not aware of half the places. He took it upon himself as a challenge and in 2012, he visited 9 out of the then 28&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasure Hunters|url=http://www.gounesco.com/treasure-hunters}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Heritage Sites in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How GoUNESCO Started|url=http://www.gounesco.com/how-it-started}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CyArk Engages GoUNESCO Campus Ambassadors|url=http://www.cyark.org/news/cyark-engages-gounesco-campus-ambassadors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longingtravel.com/2013/08/ajay-reddy-guy-who-started-gounesco.html|title=LONGING TRAVEL: Ajay Reddy- The guy who started GoUNESCO|work=LONGING TRAVEL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth ki awaaz article on GoUNESCO|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2014/03/love-traveling-17-reasons-join-gounesco-travel-challenge/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel challenges ==
Participants can choose to participate in different country challenges such as the GoUNESCO India Challenge, GoUNESCO Germany Challenge, GoUNESCO South Africa Challenge. Everyone automatically is enrolled into the lifetime challenges - GoUNESCO Culture Challenge and the GoUNESCO Epic Challenge. A country-specific challenge such as The India Challenge mandates participants to visit all the World Heritage Sites located in India within one calendar year. The first person who visits all the world heritage sites, or the person with the most points at the end of the year, wins the challenge.

There are 316 intangible cultural heritage elements listed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]] and The Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Every participant entering the Cultural Challenge has to experience cultural heritage elements and capture proofs in the form of pictures, videos and personal notes. Every proof of experiencing an intangible cultural heritage element can earn them points and, in turn enable them to learn about the unique aspects of cultures from across the world. The Epic Challenge, like The Culture Challenge is a lifetime challenge – meaning all the proofs from a participant's travel any time will be eligible even if a participant takes a lifetime to visit all the 1,031 Heritage Sites in the world.
Jai Bharathi was the winner of the first ever travel challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyderabad girl jai bharathi wins GO-Unesco challenge|url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130113/news-current-affairs/article/hyderabad-girl-jai-bharathi-wins-go-unesco-challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go UNESCO challenge winner - Jai Bharti Interview - Youtube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e27OFrex7xY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Go Heritage Runs ==
[[Go Heritage Run]]s began as an offshoot of GoUNESCO in 2014.

== Student program ==
In January 2014, GoUNESCO started a student program in which students are chosen from throughout the world through an open application process. The 6 month program is held in two sessions every year - January through June and July through December. Once chosen, the students are assigned fun tasks that help them explore and at the same time, build awareness of heritage around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/incredible-historic-india/article4294664.ece|title=Incredible, historic India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Make Heritage Fun' campaigns ==
In June 2015, GoUNESCO started #makeheritagefun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeheritagefun.com/|title=Make Heritage Fun}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a distributed series of events and distributed social media campaigns occurring simultaneously at cities around the world to draw attention to heritage. This initiative by GoUNESCO is yet another way for laypersons to engage with heritage. Experiences from across the world will be collated and amplified through social media using the hashtag #makeheritagefun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10778">The {{nihongo|'''Information-Technology Engineers Examination'''|情報処理技術者試験|jōhō shori gijutsusha shiken|or '''ITEE'''|lead=yes}} is a group of [[information technology]] [[examinations]] administered by the [[Information Technology Promotion Agency]], Japan (IPA). The ITEE was introduced in 1969 by Japan's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI), and it has since changed hands twice, first to the [[Japan Information Processing Development Corporation]] (JIPDEC) in 1984, and then to the IPA in 2004. At first there were two examination categories, one for lower-level programmers and one for upper-level programmers, and over the years the number of categories increased to twelve as of 2016.

The examinations are carried out during the course of one day; candidates sit a morning test and an afternoon test. The morning test assesses the breadth of the candidate's subject-matter knowledge, and the afternoon test assesses the candidate's ability to apply that knowledge. The examinations have a low pass rate: between 1969 and 2010 15.4 million people took them, but only 1.7 million were successful (an average success rate of 11 percent).

The questions are developed by a committee of experts, and are continually updated to reflect changes in the computer industry. The examination categories are also subject to change based upon industry trends. The ITEE examinations are recognized as qualifications in several Asian countries, including India, Singapore, South Korea, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Taiwan, and Bangladesh.

== History ==

The Information Technology Engineers Examination was founded in 1969 as a national examination by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). At first, two categories of examination were offered: Class I Information Technology Engineer, aimed at upper-level programmers, and Class II Information Technology Engineer, aimed at lower level programmers. These two categories were followed in 1971 by the Special Information Technology Engineer Examination.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsubara|first=Keiji|journal=IT Architect|volume=24|title=情報処理技術者試験「システムアーキテクト」のすべて|trans-title=Everything there is to know about the "Systems Architect" Information Technology Engineers Examination|language=Japanese|year=2009|publisher=IDG Japan|isbn=978-4-87280-295-5|pages=28–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNQ5C7Npay8C&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, MITI (then known as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI) handed over the administration of the examinations to Japan Information Processing Development Corporation (JIPDEC).&lt;ref name="Ellis2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Heidi J.C.|title=Software Engineering: Effective Teaching and Learning Approaches and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnZ63wlEhEoC&amp;pg=PT383|date=31 October 2008|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-103-2|pages=383–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; JIPDEC received most of its funding from METI, and while the two organizations were technically independent, they shared close ties with each other.&lt;ref name="McWilliams1985"&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=McWilliams|first=John|title=Jipdec guiding Japan's information processing growth|newspaper=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBXQZbbSyeQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA128|date=11 February 1985|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; JIPDEC founded the Japan Information Technology Engineers Examination Center (JITEC) to oversee the actual running of the examinations.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

The 1980s saw the introduction of two new examination categories: the Information Technology Systems Audit Engineer Examination in 1986, and the Online Information Technology Engineer Examination in 1988. The former was aimed at systems auditors, and the latter at network engineers.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt;

The examination categories underwent a major upheaval in 1994. The Special Information Technology Engineer Examination was expanded into four separate examinations: the Applications Engineer Examination, the Systems Analyst Examination, the Project Manager Examination, and the Systems Administration Engineer Examination. The Online Information Technology Engineer Examination became the Network Specialist Examination, the Information Technology Systems Auditor Examination became the Systems Auditor Examination, and three new categories of examination were introduced: the Production Engineer Examination, the Database Specialist Examination, and the Basic Systems Administrator Examination.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt; These were followed by a further two new categories in 1996: the Advanced Systems Administrator Examination and the Applied Microcontroller Systems Engineer Examination.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt;

There was another major change to the categories in 2001. The Class I Information Technology Engineer Examination became the Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination, and the Class II Information Technology Engineer became the Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination. The Production Engineer Examination was discontinued, and the Information Security Administrator Examination was introduced.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt;

In 2004, the administration of the examinations changed hands from JIPDEC to the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA).&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt; This was followed in 2006 by the introduction of a new examination category, the Technical Engineer (Information Security) Examination.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt;

2009 saw the introduction of a new test, the IT Passport Examination, while others examination categories were consolidated. The Systems Analyst Examination and the Advanced Systems Administrator Examination were merged to form the IT Strategist Examination, and the Technical Engineer (Information Security) Examination and the Information Security Administrator Examination were merged to form the Information Security Specialist Examination.&lt;ref name="Matsubara2009" /&gt;

== Format ==

The examinations are all carried out in one day, with a morning test and an afternoon tests. The morning test is multiple choice, and aims to test the candidate's breadth of knowledge of the material being examined. The afternoon test tests the candidate's ability to apply that knowledge and with a series of case studies and essay questions. The afternoon test also aims to test the candidate's past experience.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

After the examinations are over, candidates are allowed to take their question papers home with them, and the answers to some of the questions are made available online. Candidates who pass the examinations receive certificates from METI. These certificates show the date that they were awarded, but they have no expiration date.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

Between 1969 and 2010, 15.4 million people took one of the ITEE examinations, and only 1.7 million people passed, giving an average success rate of 11 percent.&lt;ref name="D'Costa2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Costa|first=Anthony P.|title=International Mobility, Global Capitalism, and Changing Structures of Accumulation: Transforming the Japan-India IT Relationship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3_4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-35726-1|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==

{{as of|July 2016}} there are 13 examination categories, divided into four levels.&lt;ref name="JITEC-categories"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jitec.ipa.go.jp/2_01english/02examcategories.html|title=Examination Categories and Typical Examinees|publisher=Information Technology Promotion Agency|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==

JITEC bases the scope and the difficulty of the exams on the advice of a committee of experts from the computer industry and from academia. This committee investigates the skills currently used by engineers in the relevant examination category, and uses that to base their recommendations on. In this way, the questions in the exams are kept up to date with new and evolving technologies. The knowledge areas that are tested are taken from [[software engineering]], [[information system]]s and [[computer science]].&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

The examination categories are also constantly reviewed to ensure that they are both relevant to current trends in information technology and to keep them consistent with previous exams.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

The examination questions themselves are also developed by committee consisting of around 400 experts. Subcommittees are put in charge of question development, of checking, and of question selection, and are given independent authority to create questions. New questions are made for each exam, but some questions intended to test the breadth of candidates' knowledge may be altered and reused.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;

In addition to its national examination status in Japan, the ITEE is also recognized as a professional credential in several Asian countries, including India, Singapore, South Korea, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Taiwan, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bdnews2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/09/02/it-engineers-exam-now-in-bangladesh|title=IT engineers exam now in Bangladesh|publisher=bdnews24|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Quentin Hejduk''' (19 July 1929 – 3 July 2000) was an American architect, artist and educator of [[Czechs|Czech]] origin who spent much of his life in [[New York City]], United States. Hejduk is noted for having had a profound interest in the fundamental issues of shape, organization, representation, and reciprocity.

Hejduk studied at the [[Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture]], the [[University of Cincinnati]], and the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. He worked in several offices in New York including that of [[I. M. Pei]] and Partners and the office of A.M. Kinney and Associates. He established his own practice in New York City in 1965.&lt;ref name="GreatBuildings"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/John_Hejduk.html/
|publisher=Great Buildings Collection |title=John Hejduk |accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

===As a professor===
Hejduk was Professor of Architecture at [[Cooper Union|The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, School of Architecture]] from 1964 to 2000 and Dean of the School of Architecture from 1975 to 2000. His arrival including the cooperation of many other influential professors (including [[Raimund Abraham]], [[Ricardo Scofidio]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Charles Gwathmey]], [[Diana Agrest]], Diane Lewis, [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]], Don Wall and many others) transformed the practice and critical thought of architecture in ways that might be compared to [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s transformation of the Armour Institute into the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Approach==
His early work and curriculum grew from a set of exercises exploring cubes, grids, and frames, through an examination of square grids placed within diagonal containers set against an occasional curving wall, towards a series of experiments with flat planes and curved masses in various combinations and colors.&lt;ref name="GreatBuildings"/&gt; To aid his research he was awarded a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1967. Eventually, John Hejduk's "hard-line" modernist space-making exercises, heavily influenced by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]], moved away from his interests in favor of free-hand "figure/objects" influenced by mythology and spirituality, clearly expressing the nature of his poetry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The relationship between Hejduk's shape/objects and their surroundings is a controversial subject, raising questions similar to those raised by the early houses of [[Peter Eisenman]].

The architectural historian K. Michael Hays has described Hejduk's architecture as one of "Encounter", describing Hejduk's objects as seeming "impossibly, to be aware of us, to address us. And yet we see not the gratifying reflection of ourselves we had hoped for but another thing, looking back at us, watching us, placing us", articulating Hejduk's work from a post-modern Lacanian perspective as more "literary" than that of his peers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture's Desire|last=Hays|first=K. Michael|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51302-9|location=55 Hayward Street, Cambridge MA 02142|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hejduk is associated with several schools, including the [[The New York Five|New York Five]] (with architects [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Michael Graves]], and [[Charles Gwathmey]]) whose early works are described in ''Five Architects'' (1973),&lt;ref name=Goldberger&gt;{{cite journal| author=Goldberger, Paul | title =Architecture View: A Little Book That Led Five Men to Fame | journal =[[The New York Times]] | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location =| date =February 11, 1996| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E2DB1539F932A25751C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink| accessdate =August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Iovine, Julie V. | title =Michael Graves | publisher =Chronicle Books | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2000 | location =San Francisco | pages =9–10 | url =  | isbn =0-8118-3251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of innovative architects and professors at the Texas School of Architecture, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], whose other well-known participants include [[Colin Rowe]] and [[Werner Seligmann]].

"The school started after vintage in 1787". (historic document [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105101/http://picasaweb.google.com/dbforum01/KrisztinavarosIskola100Eves] Hofecker, Ferencz 1887)

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Krisztinater-Zograf és Zinsler 1872 elott.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Krisztina tér around 1872. First school building from 1772 on the right side of the church{{Pufc|1=Krisztinater-Zograf és Zinsler 1872 elott.jpg|log=2011 September 21}}]] --&gt;

'''1783''' [[Krisztinaváros]] quarter had 730 inhabitants.  By such a number of inhabitants the authority of Buda city found it necessary to provide for a school, in 1787 "after the vintage it started the normal education". (Quotation by Ferencz Hofecker 1887).

The first school building was a pub building on the site of present 1–3 Gellérthegy Street.  The first teacher of Krisztinaváros was Ferenc Zonner. The school had been running in this building until 1810.

'''1810''' The school was moved into a new building built in 1772 on the site of the present 63. Krisztina Boulevard.

'''1883''' The present building was built on the ground enlarged towards the church.  In 1883 education started in the school building which is still existing.

'''1887''' The one hundredth anniversary of the school.  Ferencz Hofecker 1887, Budapest Hundred-year-old History of the school of Krisztinaváros.

'''1945''' In January 1945 the Tabán school in the Czakó Street was destroyed by a bomb. The inhabitants of Naphegy attended the school on Krisztina Square.

"… we placed our cannons in firing position on the highest part of Tabán, the Czakó Street was right behind us . … The troops took cover in the uninhabited villas in Czakó Street and" put our unlucky, exhausted horses into the garden. … We placed our observation post a little bit lower, into the school Tabán. … my commander told me he would replace the observation post to the house number 2 in Hegyalja Street because the school was striking too much, it could be bombed. He told us we would shoot the northern corner of the Margaret island over the castle area during the crossing trial of the Soviets. … In the meantime we learned that the school of Tabán, where we had our previous observation post, was hit by a chain-bomb, everybody died in the cellar. The Russians haven't got such large bombs, so it was clear tc that the attack was executed by the English." (history, see also [[Naphegy]], [[Tabán]], [[Krisztinaváros]])

Between 1945 and 1958 instead of the demolished Tabán school, the inhabitants of Naphegy attended the school on Krisztina Square. In August 1958 the school in Lisznyai Street was completed on Naphegy, right near the former Tabán school.

'''Lekotek''' is an international program to lend [[Assistive Technology]], toys and expertise to disabled children. The first lekotek opened in 1963 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. From there the concept spread to other Scandinavian countries, Europe and the rest of the world. For example, there are over 50 lekoteks in the United States. The first American lekotek opened in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1980. The first US lekoteks were founded by Sally DeVencentis and Sharon Draznin.

The name is a mix of the Swedish root word “lek,” meaning toy or play, and the Greek suffix “tek” that connotes library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lekotek.org/general-info/about-lekotek About Lekotek]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying concept==
The underlying concept is that early intervention through play with adapted toys and technology can teach [[disabled]] children to deal with the "normal" world. Some of theoretical basis for the lekotek movement comes from work done by a British psychologist, Elizabeth Newson. Her book "Toys and Playthings, " ({{ISBN|0-394-42830-7}}) discusses the effect of play on child development.

==Launch of AblePlay==
In November 2005, the National Lekotek Center launched their new AblePlay website at www.AblePlay.org providing access to authoritative ratings and detailed reviews from National Lekotek professionals on loads of toys and other play products. Lekotek's unique evaluation process yields product information categorized by disability category to further simplify the toy-buying experience. Parents and professionals can benefit from insightful play ideas for each toy, as well as from the online forums to allow them to share experiences and provide personal advice to each other. Launching AblePlay was an important step in realizing Lekotek's goal to be the central source of information and support services involving toys and play for kids with special needs. National Lekotek is a division of Anixter Center which provides services to more than 5,000 adults and children with disabilities through 70 programs at 35 locations annually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">'''Maktab-e Tawhid''' (also '''Maktab-e Tawhīd''') was a [[Shi'i]] seminary for women, established in [[Qom]], [[Iran]]'s clerical center in 1975, as a wing of the [[Haghani school]]. 

The founding of the seminary followed similar institutions in Qom, Fasa, Shiraz and Isfahan. In Fasa, Maktab-e Fatema was opened in 1961, [[Maktab-e Zahra]] in Shiraz in 1964, [[Maktab-e Fatimah]] in Isfahan in 1965,&lt;ref name=MK&gt;See Mirjam Künkler and Roja Fazaeli, "The Life of Two Mujtahidas: Female Religious Authority in 20th Century Iran", in ''Women, Leadership and Mosques: Changes in Contemporary Islamic Authority'', ed. Masooda Bano and Hilary Kalmbach (Brill Publishers, 2012), 127–160. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1884209_code1321417.pdf?abstractid=1884209&amp;mirid=1&lt;/ref&gt; in Tehran, Zahra-i Athar was opened in 1966, and in Mashhad, [[Fatemeh Khamooshi]] (d. 2010) opened [[Madrase-ye ‘Elmīyya Narges]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Keiko Sakurai, “Women’s empowerment and Iranian-style seminaries in Iran and Pakistan,” in Keiko Sakurai and Fariba Adelkhah (eds.), The Moral Economy of the Madrasa, Islam and Education Today, (Oxon &amp; New York: Routledge, 2011), p. 32-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, it took a number more years until finally, a women's seminary was established in Qom. [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] added a women's section to his hawza [[Dar al-Tabligh]], called [[Dar al-Zahra]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Michael M. J 2003, p.196"&gt;Michael M. J. Fischer, ''Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution'',  Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

Partially in order to rival the women's section of the [[Dar al-Tabligh]] school, Ayatollah [[Qoddusi]], the director of the [[Haghani school]], set up Maktab-e Tawhid. In its first year, the girl's madrasa had thirty students and five female teachers.&lt;ref name="Michael M. J 2003, p.196"/&gt; These included [[Monir Gorjih]], [[Masumeh Golgiri]], and [[Zohreh Sefati]], who had come to Qom from Abadan earlier in the decade in search of a hawza education. 

Among the male lecturers at Maktab-e Tawhid were Sheikh [[Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi]], the author of “Shahid-e Javid,” and [[Morteza Haeri]], the son of Sheikh [[Abdul-Karim Ha'eri Yazdi]]. Morteza Ha'eri taught akhlāq at the maktab.

After the [[1979 revolution]], Maktab-e Tawhid was incorporated together with other women's seminaries in Qom into the larger school, [[Jamiat al-Zahra]].

'''Jerusha Booth Barber''', in religion, '''Sister Mary Augustine''' (née Jerusha Booth; also Mrs. Jerusha Barber; Sister Mary Austin; Sister May Augustin; 1789 - January 1, 1860) was a 19th-century American educator and [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitation]] [[Religious sister|sister]]. She entered the [[Georgetown Visitation Monastery|Georgetown Visitation Convent]] in 1818, with her husband entering the [[Jesuits]]. She founded a convent of visitation in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], in 1836, remaining there till 1844. She taught in a convent in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], from 1844 till 1848, and in [[Mobile, Alabama]], until the time of her death.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=53}} Her only son, Samuel, became a [[Jesuit]], and her four daughters entered the convent.

==Early years==
Barber was born in [[Newton, Connecticut]], in 1789.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=53}} Her parents were pious Protestants, strict members of their church.{{sfn|Goesbriand|1886|p=85}}

==Career==
She married [[Virgil Horace Barber]] on September 20, 1807, when she was 19 and he was about 25.{{sfn|Goesbriand|1886|p=85}} The husband and wife did not precipitately embrace the Catholic religion, but the husband thought Protestantism too superficial, too recent, too worldly and too inconsistent. He had been an [[Episcopalian church in the United States|Episcopalian]] clergyman and principal of their academy in [[Fairfield, New York]]. He determined to become a [[Roman Catholic]] and moved to New York where his mentor, [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], received his family into the Catholic Church in 1816. Jerusha was 28 and they had five children: Mary (b. 1810); Abigail (b. 1811); Susan (b. 1813); Samuel (b. 1814); and Josephine (b. 1816).{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=162}}{{sfn|Herbermann|1913|p=287}}{{sfn|Kingsbury|1907|p=31-32}} For support they opened a school, but after eight months both determined to join the religious life and, under Fenwick's direction, moved to [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown in Washington, D.C.]]{{sfn|Goesbriand|1886|p=85}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwIjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|last=Herbermann|first=Charles George|date=1913|publisher=Encyclopedia Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Washington, D.C., the couple went through the process of separation. Jerusha and her children were placed in a convent while the husband went to [[Rome]] to study towards ordination.{{sfn|Kingsbury|1907|p=31-32}} In 1818 Jerusha entered the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitation convent]] of [[Georgetown D.C.|Georgetown]] which also housed her three eldest daughters, while the baby, Josephine, was placed in the home of [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick|Fenwick]]'s mother. When she thought she was pregnant, she left the community for a short period, but soon returned.  On February 23, 1820, husband and wife took their religious vows, she as Sister Mary Augustine.{{sfn|McGuinness|2015|p=15}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Mary was a woman of superior education, and the convent and school progressed rapidly during her residence. In 1836 she founded a visitation convent in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], where she remained until 1844. She was especially successful in training the younger sisters to be accomplished teachers, and was engaged in this occupation in the convent of St. Louis from 1844 till 1848, and in Mobile up to the time of her death.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=162}} She died in Summerville, near Mobile, in 1860.  Their only son, Samuel, became a Jesuit, and their four daughters entered the [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] convent.{{sfn|Maes|1880|p=427}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''National Coding Week''' was founded by former headteacher [[Richard Rolfe]] and tech entrepreneur Jordan Love, who was appointed EU Code Week Ambassador for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Love|first1=Jordan|title='DIGITAL JERSEY HUB RESIDENT APPOINTED AS EU CODE WEEK AMBASSADOR'|url=https://www.digital.je/news/eucodeweekambassador|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Digital Jersey|publisher=Digital Jersey|date=16 September 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place during the week commencing September 21, 2014 with the aim of helping adults to improve their digital literacy  in order to fill the growing skills gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bateman|first1=Kayleigh|title='Training firm Codex DLD launches National Coding Week for Adults'|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227952/Training-firm-Codex-DLD-launches-National-Coding-Week-for-Adults|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Computer Weekly|publisher=TechTarget|date=2 September 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week is run by volunteers in hubs, libraries, schools, businesses and NGOs with the intention of supporting adults to learn digital skills including coding. [[Richard Rolfe]] and Jordan Love were inspired to create the week when they trained a group of unemployed people in coding skills which eventually led to many of them getting jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Training course for coders launched'|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2014/Pages/CodingTrainingCourse.aspx|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Gov.je|publisher=Government of Jersey|date=28 March 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU predicts a significant number of digital jobs being unfilled by 2020 due to a skills shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs'|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs-0|website=DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and Jordan saw an opportunity to try to inspire adults to gain the skills necessary to fill the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Coding Week|url=http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/business/national-coding-week/#.VrcrA_mLTIU|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Bailiwick Express|publisher=Bailiwick Express|date=22 September 2014|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Lovejoy]].

[[Boris Johnson]] the Mayor of London stated that “Coding is a language that is increasingly important for both young people and adults to understand, but it can be an intimidating prospect. National Coding Week will help to make whole generations of Brits more comfortable with coding, allowing them to embrace the business opportunities of the future.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='National Coding Week aims at adult learners'|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/design/legislation/national-coding-week-aims-adult-learners-2015-09/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Electronics Weekly|publisher=Electronics Weekly|date=8 September 2015|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the week was to also encourage women to get involved in coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atcheson|first1=Sheree|title='National Coding Week - A Great Opportunity to Reflect on the State of Play for Women in Tech'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sheree-atcheson/national-coding-week_b_8170292.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Huffington Post Tech|publisher=Huffington Post|date=22 September 2015|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Lane Fox’s drive to bridge the gender gap in tech gave prominence  to the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Card|first1=Jon|title='Gender imbalance in tech sector must change for startups to thrive'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/apr/13/gender-imbalance-tech-sector-martha-lane-fox|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=13 April 2015|ref=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 events and 1000 people took part in 2015. Events occurred all over Wales in libraries and hubs and was supported by [[WEA YMCA Community College Cymru]] and the [[Welsh Government]]

Speaking at the launch event in [[Cardiff Central Library]] Hub’s new digital floor, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, [[Ken Skates]], said “Learning new skills such as coding can open new doors to people. We are increasingly moving into an online world and it is important that people do not miss out on opportunities to develop these skills, which have the potential to create employment opportunities. I’m delighted to launch the National Coding Week in Wales and am pleased this is taking place in a library, which is the ideal place to get support to learn new skills. It’s particularly good to launch it in the new digital floor of Cardiff Central Library, which received a grant from the Welsh Government towards its modernisation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Developing Wales as a nation of Coders'|url=http://www.weacymru.org.uk/en/news/109/0/developing-wales-as-a-nation-of-coders|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|publisher=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|date=28 August 2015|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he grew up in Nigeria and attended [[St Gregory's College, Lagos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/specials/the-toast-of-st-gregorys-college-lagos/|title=The toast of St. Gregory’s College, Lagos|work=The Sun|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to the United Kingdom to study architecture at the Glasgow School, Kingston College of Art (now [[Kingston University]]) and graduated in 1966.

==Career==
After graduation, Femi worked for some years with firms in [[Washington, D.C.]] Afterwards, he returned to Nigeria and worked with [[Godwin and Hopwood Architects]], Lagos before establishing his architectural firm, then Femi Majekodunmi Associates, now [[FMA Architects Ltd]], in Nigeria in 1973. The firm has grown to a large practice, with branch locations in [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]]. 
He has worked with various architectural organizations to advance the practice of architecture in countries across Africa. He has been closely associated with many architectural organizations. He was the first president of the [[Nigerian Institute of Architects]], the first secretary of the African Union of Architects and a past president of the [[International Union of Architects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=b-OqVJk5R0kC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Olufemi+Majekodunmi+Architect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-Eg6VY-MCo6tacmwgagO&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Olufemi%20Majekodunmi%20Architect&amp;f=false|page=15|title=Architecture: The AIA Journal|publisher=American Institute of Architects|year=1993|volume=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0209newbuild-5.asp|title=New Building Systems Mimic Nature and Return to a Biocentric Approach to Design|last=Solomon, AIA|first=Nancy B.|work=Architectural Record|publisher=McGraw Hill Financial|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=291|year=2005|title=Almanac of Architecture and Design|isbn= 9780967547794|author1=James P.

'''An Oral History of British Science''' is an [[oral history]] project conducted by [[National Life Stories]] at the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bl.uk/historyofscience Oral History of British Science webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project began in 2009 with funding from the Arcadia Fund, the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]] and a number of other private donors and has grown into a major  archive of in-depth, life story audio interviews with figures from the history of science and engineering in Britain.

== Project background==
An Oral History of British Science is collecting 200 audio interviews, each 8 to 15 hours in length, with scientists, engineers and others linked with science and technology in Britain, as well as shorter on-location video recordings.  The project is split into four themed strands: '''Made in Britain''', '''A Changing Planet''', '''Cosmologies''' and '''Biomedicine'''. Importantly, the project seeks to identify lesser-heard voices, for example women scientists, laboratory technicians, and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsreports/nlsreport2009.pdf Blyth, Tilly (2010), ‘Introducing An Oral History of British Science’, Tilly Blyth, National Life Stories Review and Accounts 2009/2010, p.22']&lt;/ref&gt;   The project Advisory Committee, which meets at least three times a year to discuss progress and to advise on future direction, comprises Dr Jon Agar, Lord [[Alec Broers]], Dr Tilly Blyth, Georgina Ferry, Professor Dame [[Julia Higgins]], Dr Maja Kominko, [[Sir Harry Kroto]], John Lynch, Professor [[Chris Rapley]] and Dr Simone Turchetti.

An Oral History of British Science is conducted by [[National Life Stories]] at the [[British Library]], and forms part of a wider institutional initiative to better document contemporary history of science and technology through the addition of audio visual sources as well as written sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/oralhist/scienceprojprop.pdf ''An Oral History of British Science project proposal'', British Library, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;  National Life Stories, a charitable trust and limited company within the British Library, was established by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)]] and Jennifer Wingate in 1987 to capture the life stories of British people whose experiences would not otherwise be recorded.  Since then NLS has recorded over 2,200 interviews totalling some 22,000 hours, all of them accessible at the British Library.  Other NLS projects focus on the lives of visual artists, authors, craftspeople, architects, those involved in the UK water industry, and key individuals connected to social welfare, social policy and charity work.   Previous NLS projects focused on the British fashion industry, the post office, the steel and oil industries, Jewish experiences in Britain, the British press, and those involved in the UK food industry, from production to consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls National Life Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The case for the project ==
Despite a significant oral history tradition in science studies in other countries, the field in Britain is not well developed.  In April 2005 NLS hosted an exploratory roundtable conference at the British Library.  Chaired by Sir Nicholas Goodison, ‘Personal Testimonies of Contemporary Science, Technology and Medicine’ was attended by representatives of the UK’s leading history of science archives and libraries, and distinguished researchers.  The meeting concluded that very few scientific testimonies were held collectively and that a major programme of recording needed to be initiated to capture rich personal memory not available in any printed or manuscript sources.  Following this, NLS commissioned a mapping and scoping study, 'The Oral History of Science in Britain: A Scoping Study'.  The study confirmed that there were currently very few oral history collections in Britain looking specifically at professionals working in science and technology; that those projects that were developed in the past were short-lived and narrow in scope; and that many of these recordings are not properly archived or publicly accessible.  The scoping study found one exception, which was that the history of medicine seemed to be better documented through oral history than other fields of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;'The Oral History of Science in Britain: A Scoping Study' (Dr Simone Turchetti, Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Manchester for NLS, September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
An Oral History of British Science follows the biographical, or life story, oral history approach with each audio interview averaging 8 to 15 hours in length.  This biographical approach is valuable for researchers seeking a more rounded view of an individual and their contribution.  The interviews cover the individual’s career history, education, background and family.

In addition to the life story audio interviews a number of supplementary, follow-up video interviews are being conducted; these focus on particular instrumentation, specific geographical settings or key turning points in a scientist’s career.  Edited extracts from the videos are being made available via the British Library YouTube Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/britishlibrary Oral History of British Science videos on the British Library YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Vega Science Trust]] have conducted similar interviews since 1997; they provide access to short interviews with scientists, as well as access to science documentaries, lectures and educational videos, via their website and YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/ The Vega Science Trust Videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to interviews ==
All interviews are catalogued on the Sound and Moving Image Catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadensa.bl.uk British Library Sound and Moving Image Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviews which are complete and open are accessible onsite at the Library in St Pancras, London and in Boston Spa, Yorkshire via the Library’s Listening &amp; Viewing Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/listening The British Library Listening &amp; Viewing Service]&lt;/ref&gt;   Interviews which are open are also made accessible via the [[Archival Sound Recordings]] website under the ‘Oral history of British science’ content package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Browse.aspx?category=Oral-history&amp;collection=Eminent-scientists&amp;browseby=Browse+by+interviewee 'Oral history of British science' interviews on the Archival Sound Recordings website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project strands ==

'''‘A Changing Planet’''' considers the advancement of the earth system sciences in the light of recent concerns associated with environmental and climate change.  Two chief points are explored: how, when and why the Earth has become a subject of scientific investigation; and how this investigation has been pivotal to the rise of concerns about the impact of humans on the environments.  Those interviewed for the strand are those involved in the earth sciences: climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, geochemists, ecologists, glaciologists and oceanographers.

'''‘Made in Britain’''' examines important discoveries in science and technology that have led to new industrial applications.  The strand covers computing, aerospace engineering, some applied sciences (such as condensed matter physics) as well as engineering fields (chemical, electrical, civil and structural).  The title refers to the fact that an analysis of these breakthroughs in science should also be looked at as something that has boosted national pride, while arising from research conducted by experts of different ethnic backgrounds.

'''‘Biomedicine’''' aims to investigate the transformations that have typified biomedicine, paying special attention to how new technologies have changed medical practices and provided a new understanding of biological objects.  This strand investigates the industrialisation of the processes of treatment and cure, as well as the idea that these processes can be engineered.  Advances in genetic engineering are central to this study, especially in relation to the rise of ‘big Pharma’.  This strand is currently unfunded.

'''‘Cosmologies’''' considers new systems of thought that have emerged in correspondence with the development of a number of theoretical fields: mathematics, mathematical physics, cosmology, astronomy, statistics, and high-energy physics. This strand is currently unfunded.

==History==
[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 26.JPG|thumb|2008 conference booth]]

[[Eugene Power]], a 1930 M.B.A. graduate of the [[Ross School of Business|University of Michigan]], founded the company as University Microfilms in 1938, preserving works from the [[British Museum]] on microfilm. By June 1938, Power worked in two rented rooms from a downtown Ann Arbor funeral parlor, specializing in microphotography to preserve library collections. In his autobiography ''Edition of One'', Power details the development of the company, including how University Microfilms assisted the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Power |first1=Eugene B. |author2=Robert Anderson  |title=Edition of One: The Autobiography of Eugene B. Power |year=1990 |publisher=University Microfilms |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |isbn=0-8357-0898-5 |pages=128–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work mainly involved filming maps and European newspapers so they could be shipped back and forth overseas more cheaply and discreetly.

Power also noticed a [[niche market]] in [[dissertation]]s publishing. Students were often forced to publish their own works in order to finish their [[doctoral degree]]. Dissertations could be published more cheaply as microfilm than as books. ProQuest still publishes so many dissertations that its [[ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|Dissertations and Theses]] collection (formerly called Digital Dissertations) has been declared the official U.S. off-site repository of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/1999/99-007.html |title=Library of Congress and Copyright Office Sign Landmark Agreement with UMI  |publisher=Library of Congress |date=January 22, 1999 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of universal adoption of microfilm publication of doctoral dissertations was furthered considerably by two articles researched and written by a then recent recipient of the doctorate in History at Stanford University.  Vaughn Davis Bornet seized on the idea and published "Doctoral Dissertations and the Stream of Scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;College and University. October 1952, pp. 11–30&lt;/ref&gt; and "Microfilm Publication of Doctoral Dissertations".&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors''. Autumn, 1953. pp. 503-513.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the dissertations market grew, the company expanded into filming newspapers and [[periodical]]s. The company's main newspaper database is [[ProQuest NewsStand]].

[[Xerox]] owned the company for a time in the 1970s and 1980s; the name of the company changed several times in this period, from '''University Microfilms''' to '''Xerox University Microfilms''', to '''University Microfilms International''', then shortened to '''UMI'''. In 1985 it was purchased from Xerox by [[Bell &amp; Howell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Christine|title=Bell, Howell Acquires Two Data Firms|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-14/business/8503180622_1_umi-gerald-schultz-bekins-records-management|accessdate=Sep 10, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 14, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, UMI began producing [[CD-ROM]]s that stored [[Bibliographic database|databases]] of periodicals abstracts and indexes. At a time when modem connections were slow and expensive, it was more efficient to mail database CD-ROMs regularly to subscribing libraries, who installed the discs on dedicated PCs. The ProQuest brand name was first used for databases on CD-ROM. An online service called ProQuest Direct was launched in 1995; its name was later shortened to just ProQuest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/brand/proquest.shtml |title=ProQuest (brand)|publisher=proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliographic databases are mainly sold to schools, universities and libraries.

In 1998, the company announced the "[[Digital Vault Initiative]]", purported to include 5.5 billion images digitized from UMI microfilm, including some of the best existing copies of major newspapers dating back 100 to 150 years, and Early English books dating back to the 15th century. While work continues to digitize the contents of the microfilm vault, ProQuest is already providing navigation of 125 billion digital pages, including nearly 20 million pages of newspaper content dating from pre-Revolutionary War America.

In 1999, the company name changed to '''Bell &amp; Howell Information and Learning''', and then in 2001 to '''ProQuest Information and Learning'''; Bell &amp; Howell renamed itself the ProQuest Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbReader.asp?ArticleId=17575 |title=Bell &amp; Howell Becomes ProQuest Company |date= June 11, 2001 |publisher=Information Today |accessdate=June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1999, the company acquired [[Chadwyck-Healey]], a one-time microfilm publishing company that was one of the first to produce full-text CD-ROM databases. This acquisition gave Proquest ownership of a 100+ person publishing operation based in Cambridge, England and became the basis for a substantial overseas expansion.

During the 2000–2004 fiscal years, as well as the first three quarters of the 2005 fiscal year, ProQuest systematically overstated its net income.  Cumulatively, pre-tax profits were overstated by 129.9 million dollars (or about 31 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20650.pdf |title=SEC Complaint vs. Scott Hirth and ProQuest Company [in 2008] known as Voyager Learning Company |publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Voyager Learning Company and ProQuest's CFO (from the time of the earnings overstatements) settled SEC "charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's complaint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-147.htm |title=Press Release: SEC Charges Ann Arbor-Based Company and Former Executive in Accounting Fraud Scheme |publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Proquest acquired Norman Ross Publishing, a small New York based microfilm publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosspub.com/normanbio.html|title=Untitled Page|website=www.rosspub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 ProQuest acquired bigchalk.com, a company founded in 1999 with the combined assets of ProQuest's K-12 division and Infonautics Inc.'s K-12 business..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/proquest-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bigchalk-77209637.html|title=ProQuest Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire bigchalk|last=Company|first=ProQuest|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ProQuest Information and Learning acquired Seattle start-up [[Serials Solutions]], a venture providing access management and search services for content hosted by other companies.

Also in 2004, the company acquired Copley Publishing Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3328/is_/ai_n26177247 |title=ProQuest Information and Learning has acquired Copley Publishing Group, Inc. |date= May 2004 |publisher=findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ProQuest Company, then the parent company of ProQuest Information and Learning, sold it to [[Cambridge Information Group]], owner of [[R.R. Bowker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Information Group Timeline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141020173911/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/CIG.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=October 2014 |url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/index.htm |work=The Academic Publishing Industry: A Story of Merger and Acquisition |author= Mary H. Munroe |year=2004 |via= Northern Illinois University }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the time of this sale, this article follows the history of ProQuest Information and Learning, not ProQuest Company.  (ProQuest Company subsequently renamed itself to Voyager Learning Company, and later became part of [[Cambium Learning Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cambiumlearning.investorroom.com/index.php?s=52&amp;cat=1 |title=Cambium Learning Group Inc. - Investor Relations - Management Team |accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2007, ProQuest Information and Learning was merged with [[CSA (database company)|CSA]] to form ProQuest CSA. Later that year it was renamed ProQuest LLC.

In 2008, ProQuest LLC acquired complete ownership of [[RefWorks]], a web-based [[citation manager]] of which it had been part owner since 2001. RefWorks was merged with ProQuest's existing COS business to form RefWorks/COS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.co.uk/en-UK/aboutus/pressroom/08/20080118.shtml |title=ProQuest acquires RefWorks |publisher=ProQuest LLC  |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, ProQuest acquired [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]], a major online database firm, from [[Thomson Reuters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/en-US/aboutus/pressroom/08/20080701.shtml |title=ProQuest acquires Dialog |publisher=ProQuest LLC. |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scientific.thomsonreuters.com/press/2008/8458603/ |title=ProQuest signs agreement to acquire Dialog business from Thomson Reuters |publisher=scientific.thomsonreuters.com |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ProQuest acquired two properties from LexisNexis, Congressional Information Service (CIS) and University Publications of America (UPA). CIS produced one of the world's most exhaustive online collections of legislative content and highly respected statistical works, while UPA included deep historical content sets. The acquisition included digital products and an expansive microfilm vault that would leverage ProQuest's strength in conversion from film to searchable electronic formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/en-US/aboutus/pressroom/10/20101130.shtml |title=ProQuest Acquires Acclaimed Congressional Information Service and University Publications of America from LexisNexis |publisher= ProQuest LLC. |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ProQuest acquired [[Ebrary]], an online digital library of full texts of over 170,000 scholarly [[e-book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = ProQuest acquires ebrary | journal = American Libraries | date = January 8, 2011 | first = Sean | last = Fitzpatrick| id = | url = http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/news/01082011/proquest-acquires-ebrary | accessdate = 2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ProQuest acquired Ebook Library (EBL), with plans to combine ebrary and EBL into a single e-book platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/about/news/2013/ProQuest-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-EBL.html |title=ProQuest Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire EBL |publisher=ProQuest LLC  |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2014, ProQuest acquired Pi2 Solutions, a privately owned company specializing in Drug Safety Triager (DST) &amp; Product Literature Database (PLD) systems for the biopharmaceutical industry. The company aligned Pi2 Solutions with its ProQuest Dialog corporate information service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/about/news/2014/ProQuest-Acquires-Pi2.html |title=ProQuest Acquires Pi2 |publisher= ProQuest LLC. |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate= May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ProQuest acquired SiPX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sipx.com/proquest-acquires-sipx/ |title=ProQuest Acquires SIPX |publisher= ProQuest LLC. |date=April 8, 2015 |accessdate= September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Coutts Information Services, including the MyiLibrary platform and the Online Acquisitions and Selection Information System (OASIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/about/news/2015/ProQuest-to-Acquire-Coutts-Information-Services-and-MyiLibrary-from-Ingram-Content-Group.html |title=ProQuest to Acquire Coutts Information Services and MyiLibrary from Ingram Content Group |publisher= ProQuest LLC. |date=April 30, 2015 |accessdate= September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ProQuest acquired [[Ex Libris Group|Ex Libris]]. It was to merge the Workflow Solutions division of ProQuest, which included the former Serials Solutions, into Ex Libris, with the enlarged entity to be named "Ex Libris, a ProQuest Company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breeding |first=Marshall |date=6 October 2015 |title=ProQuest to Acquire Ex Libris |url= http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/the-scoop/proquest-to-acquire-ex-libris/ |journal=[[American Libraries]] |location=Chicago |publisher=[[American Library Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, ProQuest acquired [[Alexander Street Press]], a provider of streaming videos and ebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.proquest.com/about/news/2016/Alexander-Street-Press-Joins-the-ProQuest-Family-of-Companies.html |title=Alexander Street Press Joins the ProQuest Family of Companies

Hart]] and is the oldest [[digital library]].&lt;ref name=USINFO/&gt; Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of [[public domain]] [[book]]s. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, [[open format]]s that can be used on almost any computer. {{As of|2018|06|23}}, Project Gutenberg reached 57,000 items in its collection of free eBooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20151003/project-gutenberg-releases-ebook-50000/|title=Project Gutenberg Releases eBook #50,000|last=|first=|date=25 February 2017|work=Project Gutenberg News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225103832/http://www.gutenbergnews.org/20151003/project-gutenberg-releases-ebook-50000/|archivedate=25 February 2017|deadurl=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The releases are available in [[text file|plain text]] but, wherever possible, other formats are included, such as [[HTML]], [[PDF]], [[EPUB]], [[Mobipocket|MOBI]], and [[Plucker]]. Most releases are in the [[English language]], but many non-English works are also available. There are multiple affiliated projects that are providing additional content, including regional and language-specific works. Project Gutenberg is also closely affiliated with [[Distributed Proofreaders]], an Internet-based community for proofreading scanned texts.

== History ==
[[File:Michael Hart and Gregory Newby at HOPE Conference.jpg|thumb|Michael Hart (left) and Gregory Newby (right) of Project Gutenberg, 2006]]

Project Gutenberg was started by Michael Hart in 1971 with the digitization of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Hobbes_netTL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline |accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart, a student at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], obtained access to a [[SDS Sigma series|Xerox Sigma V]] [[mainframe computer]] in the university's Materials Research Lab. Through friendly operators, he received an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000.&lt;ref name="GP_history"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael S. |last=Hart |authorlink=Michael S. Hart |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_History_and_Philosophy_of_Project_Gutenberg_by_Michael_Hart |title=Gutenberg:The History and Philosophy of Project Gutenberg |date=August 1992 |accessdate=5 December 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129155623/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AThe_History_and_Philosophy_of_Project_Gutenberg_by_Michael_Hart |archivedate=29 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart has said he wanted to "give back" this gift by doing something that could be considered to be of great value. His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge, and to do so by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Day, B. H. |author2=Wortman, W. A. |year=2000 |title=Literature in English: A Guide for Librarians in the Digital Age |page=170 |publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8389-8081-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular computer was one of the 15 [[Node (networking)|nodes]] on [[ARPANET]], the computer network that would become the [[Internet]]. Hart believed that computers would one day be accessible to the general public and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg [[e-text]]. He named the project after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the [[movable type]] [[printing press]] revolution.

By the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from [[Benedictine University|Illinois Benedictine College]]. More volunteers had joined the effort. All of the text was entered manually until 1989 when [[image scanner]]s and [[optical character recognition]] software improved and became more widely available, which made [[book scanning]] more feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Vauhini |last=Vara |title=Project Gutenberg Fears No Google |work=Wall Street Journal |date=5 December 2005 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113415403113218620 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart later came to an arrangement with [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg's finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project's day-to-day operations that Hart had run.

Starting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and [[hyperlink]]. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by [[ibiblio]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Italian volunteer Pietro Di Miceli developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994–2004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in "best of the Web" listings, and contributing to the project's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=8 June 2006 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Credits |title=Gutenberg:Credits |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711033646/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3ACredits |archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart died on 6 September 2011 at his home in Urbana, Illinois at the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 September 2011 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |title=Michael_S._Hart |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917035457/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |archivedate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affiliated organizations ===
In 2000, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]], the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in [[Mississippi]], [[United States]] to handle the project's legal needs. Donations to it are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]]. Long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer Gregory Newby became the foundation's first [[chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref name="it21" /&gt;

Also in 2000, Charles Franks founded [[Distributed Proofreaders]] (DP), which allowed the proofreading of scanned texts to be distributed among many volunteers over the Internet. This effort greatly increased the number and variety of texts being added to Project Gutenberg, as well as making it easier for new volunteers to start contributing. DP became officially affiliated with Project Gutenberg in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date=August 2007 |url=http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/dpf.php |title=The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation |publisher=Distributed proofreaders |accessdate=10 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821001333/http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/dpf.php |archivedate=21 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, the 36,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost two-thirds of the nearly {{Num PG books}} books in Project Gutenberg.

== CD and DVD project ==
In August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a [[Compact disc|CD]] containing approximately 600 of the "best" e-books from the collection. The CD is available for download as an [[ISO image]]. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.

In December 2003, a [[DVD]] was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this represented almost the entire collection. In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail.

In July 2007, a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items.

The majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project, were recorded on recordable media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. {{As of|2010|10}}, the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs. As of 2017, the delivery of free CDs has been discontinued, though the ISO image is still available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_CD_and_DVD_Project |title=The CD and DVD Project |publisher=Gutenberg |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005200927/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AThe_CD_and_DVD_Project |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of collection ==
[[File:Project Gutenberg total books.svg|thumb|Growth of Project Gutenberg publications from 1994 until 2015]]

{{As of|2015|08}}, Project Gutenberg claimed over {{Num PG books}} items in its collection, with an average of over 50 new [[e-book]]s being added each week.&lt;ref&gt;According to
[https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt gutindex-2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113114837/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt |date=13 November 2012 }}, there were 1,653 new Project Gutenberg items posted in the first 33 weeks of 2006. This averages out to 50.09 per week. This does not include additions to affiliated projects.&lt;/ref&gt; These are primarily works of [[literature]] from the [[western culture|Western cultural tradition]]. In addition to literature such as novels, poetry, short stories and drama, Project Gutenberg also has [[cookbook]]s, [[reference work]]s and issues of periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;For a listing of the categorized books, see: {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project Gutenberg collection also has a few non-text items such as audio files and music-notation files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesterpl.org/music/project-gutenberg-sheet-music/ |title=Project Gutenberg Sheet Music &amp;#124; Manchester-by-the-Sea Public Library |publisher=Manchesterpl.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144216/http://www.manchesterpl.org/music/project-gutenberg-sheet-music/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most releases are in English, but there are also significant numbers in many other languages. {{As of|2016|04}}, the non-English languages most represented are: French, German, Finnish, Dutch, Italian, and Portuguese.&lt;ref name=USINFO&gt;{{cite web | last=Thomas | first=Jeffrey | date=20 July 2007 | url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/July/200707201511311CJsamohT0.6146356.html | title=Project Gutenberg Digital Library Seeks To Spur Literacy | publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of International Information Programs | accessdate=20 August 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314164013/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/July/200707201511311CJsamohT0.6146356.html | archivedate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever possible, Gutenberg releases are available in [[text file|plain text]], mainly using [[ASCII|US-ASCII]] [[character encoding]] but frequently extended to [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]] (needed to represent accented characters in French and [[ß|Scharfes s]] in German, for example). Besides being copyright-free, the requirement for a [[ISO 8859|Latin]] ([[character set]]) text version of the release has been a criterion of Michael Hart's since the founding of Project Gutenberg, as he believes this is the format most likely to be readable in the extended future.&lt;ref&gt;Various Project Gutenberg FAQs allude to this. See, for example: {{cite web|title=File Formats FAQ |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:File_Formats_FAQ |accessdate=2 November 2012 |author=Staff |quote=You can view or edit ASCII text using just about every text editor or viewer in the world. [...] Unicode is steadily gaining ground, with at least some support in every major operating system, but we're nowhere near the point where everyone can just open a text based on Unicode and read and edit it. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102071414/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AFile_Formats_FAQ |archivedate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of necessity, this criterion has had to be extended further for the sizable collection of texts in East Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese now in the collection, where [[UTF-8]] is used instead.

Other formats may be released as well when submitted by volunteers. The most common non-ASCII format is [[HTML]], which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing them to be much easier to read. But some formats that are not easily editable, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], are generally not considered to fit in with the goals of Project Gutenberg. Also Project Gutenberg has two options for master formats that can be submitted (from which all other files are generated): customized versions of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] standard (since 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=12 April 2005 |url=http://pgtei.pglaf.org/marcello/0.3/doc/20000-h.html |title=The Guide to PGTEI |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=7 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518140059/http://pgtei.pglaf.org/marcello/0.3/doc/20000-h.html |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reStructuredText]] (since 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=25 November 2010 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/181 |title=The Project Gutenberg RST Manual |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=8 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126113034/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/181 |archivedate=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2009, the Project Gutenberg catalog began offering auto-generated alternate file formats, including HTML (when not already provided), [[EPUB]] and [[plucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=4 April 2010 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Help_on_Bibliographic_Record_Page |title=Help on Bibliographic Record |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917121302/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AHelp_on_Bibliographic_Record_Page |archivedate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideals ==
Michael Hart said in 2004, "The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: 'To encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks'".&lt;ref name="hart1" /&gt; His goal was, "to provide as many e-books in as many formats as possible for the entire world to read in as many languages as possible".&lt;ref name=USINFO /&gt; Likewise, a project slogan is to "break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Project Gutenberg is intentionally decentralized. For example, there is no selection policy dictating what texts to add. Instead, individual volunteers work on what they are interested in, or have available. The Project Gutenberg collection is intended to preserve items for the long term, so they cannot be lost by any one localized accident. In an effort to ensure this, the entire collection is backed-up regularly and mirrored on servers in many different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Information Technology and Collection Management for Library User Environments | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-ZGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=information+technology+and+collection+management+for+library+user+environments&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q-A2NfMGSz&amp;sig=ThaBrAL1UgS3IjXW9beYXrmv5Oo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XVFFVJXXA4rHgwS_pIGYDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20technology%20and%20collection%20management%20for%20library%20user%20environments&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright ==
Project Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to [[Copyright law of the United States|United States copyright law]]. Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are saved for future reference. Project Gutenberg does not claim new copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free reproduction and distribution.&lt;ref name=USINFO/&gt;

Most books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as [[public domain]] under United States copyright law. There are also a few copyrighted texts, like of [[science fiction]] author [[Cory Doctorow]], that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder, although they generally tend to be licensed under [[Creative Commons]].

"Project Gutenberg" is a [[trademark]] of the organization, and the mark cannot be used in commercial or modified redistributions of public domain texts from the project. There is no legal impediment to the reselling of works in the public domain if all references to Project Gutenberg are removed, but Gutenberg contributors have questioned the appropriateness of directly and commercially reusing content that has been formatted by volunteers.&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt; There have been instances of books being stripped of attribution to the project and sold for profit in the [[Kindle Store]] and other booksellers, one being the 1906 book ''Fox Trapping''.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/11/amazon_charges_kindle_users_fo.html|title=Amazon charges Kindle users for free Project Gutenberg e-books|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the U.S. annual copyright term set to expire in 2019, items published in 1923 will be added to the public domain effective January 1, 2019.

{{As of|2018|2|28}}, Project Gutenberg is no longer accessible within [[Germany]] to comply with a court order from [[S. Fischer Verlag]] regarding the works of [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Alfred Döblin]]. Although they were public domain in the United States, the court recognized the infringement of copyrights still active in Germany, and asserted that the Project Gutenberg website was under German jurisdiction because it hosts content in the German language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cand.pglaf.org/germany/index.html|title=Court Order to Block Access in Germany|publisher=Project Gutenberg Library Archive Foundation|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The text files use the format of [[plain text]] encoded in [[UTF-8]] and wrapped at 65–70 characters, with paragraphs separated by a double line break. In recent decades, the resulting relatively bland appearance and the lack of a markup possibility have often been perceived as a drawback of this format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boumphrey |first=Frank |date=July 2000 |url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue1/gutenberg/ |title=European Literature and Project Gutenberg |publisher=Cultivate Interactive |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714145517/http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue1/gutenberg/ |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2015}}
Project Gutenberg attempts to address this by making many texts available in HTML, ePub, and PDF versions as well, but faithful to the mission of offering data that is easy to handle with computer code, plain ASCII text remains the most important format, and the ePub version still contains extra line breaks between paragraphs.

In December 1994, Project Gutenberg was criticized by the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] for failing to include apparatus (documentation) of the decisions unavoidable in preparing a text, or in some cases, documenting which of several (conflicting) versions of a text has been the one digitized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]], "Textual Criticism and the Text Encoding Initiative", 1994, {{cite web|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/sperb-mla94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112335/http://xml.coverpages.org/sperb-mla94.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}, retrieved July 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of works (and editions) available has been determined by popularity, ease of scanning, being out of copyright, and other factors; this would be difficult to avoid in any crowd-sourced project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Sebastian | last = Hoffmann | year = 2005 | title = Grammaticalization And English Complex Prepositions: A Corpus-based Study | edition = 1st | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-36049-8 | oclc = 156424479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, a new initiative was begun by Michael Hart and John S. Guagliardo&lt;ref&gt;Executive director of the World eBook Library.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide low-cost intellectual properties.

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tropico 5''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] video game developed by [[Haemimont Games]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en/games/tropico5/index.shtml |title=kalypso media Tropico 5 product details |publisher=kalypso media |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407023410/http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en/games/tropico5/index.shtml |archivedate=7 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with versions for [[Linux]], [[OS X]] and [[Xbox 360]] released later in 2014 as well as versions for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] released in April 2015 and May 2016 respectively.

For the first time in the [[Tropico|Tropico series]] the game features cooperative and competitive multiplayer for up to four players. The players are able to build cities on the same island, allowing the choice of working with one another, or against.&lt;ref name=EuroGamerAnnouncement&gt;{{cite web|last=Purchese |first=Robert |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-15-tropico-5-announced-for-2014-on-pc-mac-xbox-360 |title=Tropico 5 announced for 2014 on PC, Mac, Xbox 360 • News • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/08/16/the-little-scamp-tropico-5-announced/ |title=The Little Scamp: Tropico 5 Announced |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date= |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Tropico 5 Lumber Mill.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of a lumber mill with the all new artwork of ''Tropico 5'']]
There are a number of additions to the ''Tropico 5'' game mechanics from the previous iteration of the series, notably the ability to advance to a new era if certain requirements are met; such as having written the constitution of Tropico. Tropico 5 includes 4 different eras, starting from Colonial Era, World Wars, Cold Wars and progressing up to Modern Times which allows progress from the 19th to the 21st century.&lt;ref name="cinemablend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Tropico-5-Rule-Your-Island-200-Years-58332.html|publisher=cinemablend.com|title=Tropico 5: Rule Your Island For 200 Years - CINEMABLEND|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another gameplay mechanic is 'El Presidente' now has a dynastic family which will be present on the island.&lt;ref name=EuroGamerAnnouncement/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"/&gt; The trading, research, renovation and exploration features have also been overhauled.&lt;ref name=EuroGamerAnnouncement/&gt; With multiplayer, diplomacy allows the players to share resources, construction workers, and electricity. Additionally, they are able to help each other with cash. Finally, players are able to compete and even declare war on each other.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamingbolt.com/tropico-5-interview-gameplay-changes-multiplayer-campaign-more-and-more#i5qxMWQbfOsgcBOC.99|publisher=gamingbolt.com|title=Tropico 5 Interview: Gameplay Changes, Multiplayer, Campaign And More &amp;laquo; GamingBolt.com: Video Game News, Reviews, Previews and Blog|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to series producer Bisser Dyankov, Tropico 5 is designed to be much denser than its predecessors. The citizens are the lifeblood of the island to grow the island empire and for the sustainable growth, the players need to make them happy. Due to the needs of the 10 different in-game factions, one man's happiness may be another man's frustration. And their allegiances may change depending on the sort of government you run or the buildings you build. Due to the constitutional changes, some of the faction happiness may drop or rise depending on their allegiance to their factions.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-best-laid-plans-won-t-work-in-tropico-5/1100-6417767/|publisher=gamespot.com|title=Your Best-Laid Plans Won&amp;#039;t Work in Tropico 5 - GameSpot|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===
''Tropico 5'', in the base game, comes with 15 missions, split into two parts. In both parts, you advance through all of the four eras, completing various objectives with one final objective for each mission.

In the first part of the game, Tropico must declare independence from the Crown, a spin on the [[British Empire]]. The player is also introduced to the campaign's primary antagonist, Leon Kane, the leader of The Order. Once the island has gained its independence (and thus ending the Colonial Era), the player, represented by "El Presidente" and his dynasty, must win three bets against the US President to befriend him; at the same time, a real estate tax must be paid continuously to the Crown. In the next mission, the island must build and maintain a large army in order to fend off a pending invasion. Once the invasion is defeated, the player must accrue a large sum in their Swiss Bank Account in order to purchase Switzerland and get "Dr. Zweistein" onto the island. This leads onto a demonstration of the tourism mechanic, in which the player is tasked with paying fees to The Order while, at the same time, trying to get enough tourists onto the island. Once that is accomplished, the player must build a Nuclear Program building to avoid World War III. Then, the island must produce and export Uranium for The Order, while at the same time, stopping the protests and increasing strikes from destroying the economy. At the end of this mission, Kane's plan is revealed: he wants to use the uranium to build enough nuclear missiles and launch an attack on the entire world, killing most of the population. The player must then generate enough research points to build a time machine (thanks to Zweistein from earlier) and travel back in time, thus beginning part two and averting the nuclear war.

In the second part, Tropico must produce and export gold to the Pirate King in order to free the King's son, for the Crown, all while dealing with constant pirate attacks. The next mission has the player exporting food to the King. After this, the island must amass a fortune high enough to become the richest country in the Caribbean. Once this has been done, the second military-themed mission has the player building a large army, not to defend, but to invade the island of ''Cayo de Fortuna''. The location of Kane is discovered, before he has the opportunity to start a nuclear war, and the player must complete a variety of tasks that help to assassinate him. After this has been completed, Tropico must export resources in order to dissolve the USSR, and then bring all the modern superpowers together and dealing with constant military threats to end the campaign.

===Sandbox===
In the game's sandbox mode, the player has a choice between choosing a pre-generated island provided by the developers or from the [[Steam Workshop]], or they may generate a new, random island with a variety of options. Once their island has been created, they work through all the ages, receiving small and large tasks alike to help them advance through the ages and build a stable island. Each of the eras are endless, and may be progressed to whenever the player would like, by completing each of the three main tasks that are given at the end of the first three eras.

As leader, players can decide their country's independence and write a full [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/tropico-5-first-look-guide-a-baby-dictatorship-from-the-colonial-era-to-the-modern-age/ | title=Tropico 5 first look: guide a baby dictatorship from the colonial era to the modern age | publisher=[[Future plc]] | work=[[PC Gamer]] | date=22 October 2013 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Senior, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
''Tropico 5'' was made available for pre-purchase on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 17 April 2014.

The game was banned in [[Thailand]] by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]]. The country's [[military junta]] government said that the game's storyline "might affect peace and order in the country." The game's distributor in Thailand, New Era Thailand, explained that "In the fifth installment, the storyline has developed further and there might be some part of it that's not appropriate in the current situation [in Thailand]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/222522/Tropico_5_banned_in_Thailand_as_it_might_affect_peace_and_order.php|title=Tropico 5 banned in Thailand, as it 'might affect peace and order'|last=Rose|first=Mike|date=4 August 2014|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's ''Complete Edition'', which includes all the released [[downloadable content]] and expansion packs (''Espionage'' and ''Waterborne''), was released digitally on 29 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/tropico-5-pc-complete-collection-revealed/1100-6433760/|title=Tropico 5 PC Complete Collection Revealed|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=13 January 2016|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game forumers discovered that the vanilla games have the working models inside the game which are later sold and "unlocked" in the DLC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">The '''UK Chess Challenge''' is an annual four-stage [[chess]] competition for school-age children from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Michael Basman]] is credited with creating the original challenge back in 1996 and is still closely connected with the competition. The director of the tournament is Sarah Longson (née Hegarty) supported by her husband Alex Longson. Longson is former British Ladies Chess Champion and represents England at Olympiads.  {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
Over 40,000 children play in the competition at the school stage and the eventual winner wins £2,000 and is crowned as UK Schools' Chess Challenge Champion. In 2017 Harry Grieve won the event and was presented his prize by [[Mark Price, Baron Price|Lord Price]]. The competition is generously sponsored by Delancey.

==Stages==
===School===
The first stage involves school chess clubs holding a qualifying competition to determine the strongest player for each gender-year combination, e.g. U-11 boys, U-12 girls. Each such player qualifies to enter the county Megafinal competition. For schools without chess clubs, there are alternative competitions within the county that will also enable qualification to the Megafinal.

===Megafinal===
A one-day Megafinal is held within each UK county to determine the strongest player from the county within each gender / year combination. Each such player is titled '''Supremo''' (boys) or '''Suprema''' (girls). The top player plus all those scoring 4/6 or better qualify for the Gigafinal.

===Gigafinal===
There are two one-day Gigafinals - one for Northern counties; one for Southern counties. As with the Megafinal, each Gigafinal is held to determine the strongest player for the qualifying region within each gender / year combination. Each such player is titled '''Ultimo''' (boys) or '''Ultima''' (girls). The Ultimo / Ultima players from each Gigafinal qualify to enter the Terafinal Champions competition. Until 2002, the two runners-up in each category qualified to enter the Terafinal Challengers competition. From 2003, each player scoring 5/6 or better qualifies for the Terafinal Challengers competition.

===Terafinal===
There are two two-day Terafinal competitions - the '''Terafinal Champions''' competition for the Ultimo / Ultima qualifiers from the Gigafinals, and the '''Terafinal Challengers''' competition for the runners-up. Over two days, the Champions competition identifies the strongest player in each category. Such players are titled '''Strat''' (boys or girls) and usually win a substantial prize.

==History==
{{for|pre-1833 history|Carolinum, Zürich}}
The University of Zurich was founded on April 29, 1833,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; when the existing colleges of theology, the [[Carolinum, Zürich|''Carolinum'']] founded by [[Huldrych Zwingli]] in 1525, law and medicine were merged with a new faculty of Philosophy. It was the first university in Europe to be founded by the state rather than a monarch or church.

In the University's early years, the 1839 appointment of the German theologian [[David Strauss|David Friedrich Strauss]] to its Chair of Theology caused a major controversy, since Strauss argued that the miracles in the Christian [[New Testament]] were mythical retellings of normal events as supernatural happenings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'' by David Friedrich Strauss 2010 {{ISBN|1-61640-309-8}} pages 39–43 and 87–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the New Spirituality'' by James A. Herrick 2003 {{ISBN|0-8308-2398-0}} pages 58–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fami81&gt;''Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'' by Michael J. McClymond (March 22, 2004) {{ISBN|0802826806}} page 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.chora-strangers.org/article/mcgaughey1994 Douglas R McGaughey, "On D.F. Strauß and the 1839 Revolution in Zurich"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204703/http://www.chora-strangers.org/article/mcgaughey1994 |date=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the authorities offered Strauss a pension before he had a chance to start his duties.

The university allowed women to attend philosophy lectures from 1847, and admitted the first female doctoral student in 1866. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was added in 1901, the second-oldest such faculty in the world. In 1914, the university moved to new premises designed by the architect [[Karl Moser]] on Rämistrasse 71.&lt;ref name=History&gt;

'''Utah's Dual language immersion program''' was created in 2008 to help students achieve proficiency in a second language in preparation for future careers and the global economy. In the early school years, the students are immersed in a target language for half a day – Mandarin Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German – and half a day in English. In high school, students can participate in a Bridge Program, allowing them to take language classes that would give them concurrent college credit at certain universities throughout Utah. Over 160 schools in Utah currently participate in the program. Proven benefits include an increased performance on standardized tests, fluency in a target language, and an increased cultural awareness and sensitivity.

== Background ==
Senate Bill 80 (S.B. 80), The Critical Languages Program, sponsored by [[Howard A. Stephenson|Senator Howard Stephenson]], was passed in 2007, leading to the creation of initiatives that established a Governor's World Language Council; the Utah World Language Roadmap; and eventually the passing of S.B. 41 International Initiatives in 2008, the last of which lead to the creation of Utah's dual language immersion program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schools.utah.gov/legislativematerials/2013/Critical_Language_Dual_Immersion_Legislative_Repor.aspx|title=Critical Languages: Dual Language Immersion Education Appropriations Report|last=Hales|first=Brenda|last2=Dickson|first2=Sydnee|date=August 28, 2013|website=Utah State Board of Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
The program's goal is to help students achieve a high enough proficiency level in a second language to be used in a future career as they become participants in a global economy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://l2trec.utah.edu/utah-dual-immersion/|title=Utah Dual Immersion  - L2 TReC - The University of Utah|website=l2trec.utah.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Languages available in the program include Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, French, and German.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/dualimmersion/|title=USOE - Dual Immersion -  Home|website=www.schools.utah.gov|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are being made to add Russian and Arabic to the program.

== Model ==
The students are immersed in a foreign language for half of the day, and in English for the other half.

In the immersion language half of the day for grades 1-3, students spend 20% of their school day learning math; 15% in Social stud, Science, Physical Education (P.E.), Art, Health, and Music; and 15% of their day in the target language literacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For the other half of the day, students spend most of their time in English Language Arts, with the remaining 15% of the school day in English reinforcement of the subjects learned in their immersion language.

In grades 4 and 5, the percentage changes: 25% of the day is spent learning Math and Science in the immersion language, 25% in immersion language literacy, 25% in English Language Arts, 25% in Math and Social Studies in English, while Music, Art, P.E., and Health are taught in both languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In sixth grade, the learning schedule is mostly the same as in grades 4 and 5, but with a switch; the science and social studies classes have now switched places. Science is now taught in English, and Social Studies is now taught in the immersion language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the junior high years, students spend more time learning in English, but must take two courses taught in the immersion language: a world languages class, and either Foundations of Social Studies, Health/Humanities, or World Geography.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Beginning in Fall 2016, high school students who pass an AP language course and exam in ninth grade will have the option to enroll in the Bridge Program, where they can enroll in one of three courses per school year that, if passed, will award them with concurrent upper-division university credit, leaving students only two credits shy of a minor in their immersion language by the time they arrive at the university.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seven of Utah's universities are involved in this Bridge Program. It began first with the [[University of Utah]], but has expanded to include [[Brigham Young University]], [[Utah State University]], [[Weber State University]], [[Utah Valley University]], [[Southern Utah University]], and [[Dixie State University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Participating Districts ==

Several charter schools are also involved in the DLI program, in Lehi (Chinese), Bluffdale (German), Spanish Fork (Spanish), and Layton (Spanish), Utah.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The program is expanding by 20 to 25 schools every year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/3752079-155/as-utahs-first-dual-immersion-students-are|title=As Utah's first dual-immersion students are prepping for college, so is their language program|last=Wood|first=Benjamin|date=April 29, 2016|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most classes in the program are for English-native speakers. However, in areas of the state where there is a higher concentration of Spanish-speaking immigrants, an English Language immersion-style program is available.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/us/language-programs-flower-in-utahs-schools.html|title=Language Programs Flower in Utah’s Schools|last=Healy|first=Jack|date=2013-04-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah's DLI program has inspired similar dual language immersion programs throughout the United States, in places like Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, and South Carolina.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Benefits ==
Along with second language skills, proven benefits of the DLI program include improved performance on standardized tests, where they perform better, or as well as, students on in an immersion program; increased cultural sensitivity as they become more aware of other world cultures; and more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It is not only the language that the students are immersed in, but the culture as well. In schools where Mandarin is taught, for example, Chinese lanterns decorate the halls, Taiwanese music is played, and native food, like dumplings and pot stickers, is served in the cafeterias.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In one school where Spanish is taught, classrooms are decorated with flags from Spanish-speaking countries, posters of Spanish artists, and clocks that show the time in those countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''World Maths Day''' (''World Math Day'' in American English) is an online international mathematics competition, powered by educational resource provider 3P Learning (the same organisation behind the school resources Mathletics, Spellodrome and IntoScience). Smaller elements of the wider Mathletics program effectively power the World Maths Day event.

The first World Maths Day was held on March 14, 2007 ([[Pi Day]]), and has been held on the 1st Wednesday in March in subsequent years. Despite these origins, the phrases "World Maths Day" and "World Math Day" are trademarks and not to be confused with other competitions such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] or days such as [[Pi Day]]. In 2010, World Maths Day created a Guinness World Record for the ''Largest Online Maths Competition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_The-Largest-Online-Maths-Competition/blog/2335137/7691.html |accessdate=March 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307112042/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_The-Largest-Online-Maths-Competition/blog/2335137/7691.html |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/fun/top10facts/382049/Top-ten-facts-about-maths |title=Top ten facts about maths |newspaper=Express |date=March 6, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the team behind the competition added a second event World Spelling Day - and officially rebranded as the [[World Education Games]]. In 2012, a third event was added - [[World Science Day]]. The World Maths Day and [[World Education Games]] are now sponsored by Samsung, and supported by UNICEF as global charity partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org.au/Business/Existing-Partners/3P-Learning.aspx |title=3P Learning - World Education Games |publisher=[[Unicef]] |date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No event was held in 2014, and the schedule was changed to hold the event in October 2015.

==Overview==
World Maths Day involves participants playing 60 second games, with the platform heavily based on "Live Mathletics" found in Mathletics.
The contests involve mental math problems appropriate for each age group which test the accuracy and speed of the students as they compete against other students across the Globe. The simple but innovative idea of combining the aspects of multi-player online gaming with math problems has contributed to its popularity around the world. Nowadays there are 10 levels. Level 1 is simple addition to 10, while the higher levels involve converting units for area and volume, Cartesian graphs and factorizing algebraic expressions to name a few.

==History==
The inaugural World Maths Day was held on March 13, 2007. 287 000 students from 98 countries answered 38 904 275 questions.The student numbers and the participating countries have steadily increased in the following years as evidenced by the Guinness Record created in 2010, though since then Game limits have caused the number of questions answered to drop each year(In 2015 the number was less than in 2008). In 2012 as the World Education Games, over 5.9 Million students from 240 Countries and Territories around the World registered to take part in the games with the World Maths Day being the biggest attraction.
In 2013, it was held between 5–7 March and the awards were presented at the Sydney Opera House to the Champions. In 2015 it was held for 96 hours in October and a similar prize-giving is planned.

==Awards==
A number of awards are offered to the students who take part and for those who do well in the event. Additionally the Champions and the Top Ten students in the world are awarded Gold medals every year.

There are also a number of National lead-up events in different regions around the world which are also based on the Mathletics format.The winners  may become the Ambassadors of their Country for the World Education Games the following year and help to promote the event.

==Champions==
The complete list of individual Champions, School, Class and other winners over the years could once be found in the World Education Games website. The new 2015 website no longer has the archive of Hall of Fames and other statistics.

The Individual Gold Medal Winners through the years are listed below
