The '''25L6''' is an [[Tube socket|octal-based]] [[vacuum tube]] of the [[Beam tetrode]] type. It found common application in AC/DC [[radio receiver]]s  - such as those of the [[All American Five]] type - and was also found in large numbers in early [[computers]], such as the [[UNIVAC I]].

[[Image:BPT Pinout.png|thumb|left|125px|The EIA 7AC pinout]]The tube used EIA base 7AC in common with many other power tubes.  The tube was identical in design and ratings with the '''50L6''' with the exception of having a 25 volt 300 mA heater, whereas the 50L6 has a 50 volt 150 mA heater.  The 12L6 and identical 12W6 were made with a 12 volt, 600 mA heater, and the 6W6 was made with a 6.3V, 1200mA heater. There was also a 35L6 with a 35V, 150 mA heater.  Because of the slightly lower-power heater, the 35L6 has slightly lower output than the rest of the family.  

This family is not to be confused with the [[6L6]], which has the same [[basing diagram]], but has more than twice the power capability of the 25L6. 

[[Image:25L6Tu-g-gt.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Size comparison of a 25L6G with a 25L6GT]]
The 25L6 was introduced as a metal tube on November 4, 1936, but most examples of this family were made of glass. The ST14 glass 25L6G came out on March 30, 1937. The T9 size GT version came out on April 11, 1938. There was also a 25L6G in the smaller ST-12 glass envelope.

Computer equipment used this tube as a relay driver or to run the [[solenoid]]s in [[key punch]] machines.  The heater in this case ran off the 24 volt power line in the equipment, resulting in long life and slightly lower power output. The industrial type 6046 is a 25L6GT rated for that application.

[[File:1893 Arid regions of the western united states.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Arid regions of the Western United States as mapped in 1893]]
 
A region is '''arid''' when it is characterized by a severe lack of available water, to the extent of hindering or preventing the [[Individual growth|growth]] and [[morphogenesis|development]] of plant and animal life. Environments subject to arid climates tend to lack vegetation and are called [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric]] or [[desert]]ic. Most "arid" climates straddle the [[Equator]]; these places include most of [[Africa]] and [[Arid Diagonal|parts of South America]], [[Central America]], and [[Australia]].

== Change over time ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}
{{Main|Aridification}}
The distribution of aridity observed at any one point in time is largely the result of the general circulation of the [[atmosphere]]. The latter does change significantly over time through [[climate change]]. For example, temperature increase (by 1.5–2.1 percent) across the Nile Basin over the next 30–40 years could change the region from [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to arid, resulting in a significant reduction in agricultural land. In addition, changes in land use can result in greater demands on soil water and induce a higher degree of aridity.

'''Asteroseismology''' or '''astroseismology''' is the study of oscillations in stars.  Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.  Asteroseismology is closely related to [[helioseismology]], the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the [[Sun]].  Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.

Between about 100 and 400 µHz, modes would potentially have two oscillating regions: these are known as ''mixed'' modes.  The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]

By linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four [[differential equations]] whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation.  The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by [[spherical harmonics]], indexed by an angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and azimuthal order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis.  The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.

By additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the ''Cowling'' approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction &lt;math&gt;\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\xi_r}{dr^2}=\frac{\omega^2}{c_s^2}\left(1-\frac{N^2}{\omega^2}\right)
\left(\frac{S_\ell^2}{\omega^2}-1\right)\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial co-ordinate in the star,
&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,
&lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sound speed inside the star,
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the Brunt-Vaisala or buoyancy frequency and
&lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the Lamb frequency.
The last two are defined by

&lt;math&gt;N^2=g\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma_1P}\frac{dp}{dr}-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{dr}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;S_\ell^2=\frac{\ell(\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively.  By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,
this implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either
greater or less than both &lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  We identify the former case
as high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency
gravity modes (g-modes).

This basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)
where we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star.  By plotting the
curves &lt;math&gt;\omega=N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega=S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; (for given
&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both
curves or frequencies above both curves.

== Excitation mechanisms ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism ===

{{main|Kappa mechanism}}

Under fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature.  This opacity ''bump'' can drive oscillations through the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism (or ''Eddington valve''). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.

Pulsations driven by the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes.  It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] and [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae variables]].

=== Surface convection ===

In stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Goldreich | last2 = Keeley | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Solar seismology.

Because the modes are intrinsically stable, they have low amplitudes and are relatively short-lived.  This is the driving mechanism in all solar-like oscillators.

=== Convective blocking ===

If the base of a surface convection zone is sharp and the convective timescales slower than the pulsation timescales, the convective flows react too slowly perturbations{{clarify |date=April 2018}} that can build up into large, coherent pulsations.  This mechanism is known as ''convective blocking''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Pesnell | first1 = W.

=== Tidal excitation ===

Observations from the ''Kepler'' satellite revealed eccentric binary systems in which oscillations are excited during the closest approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Everett | first2 = M. | last3 = Mullally | first3 = F. | last4 = Barclay | first4 = T. and | title = A Class of Eccentric Binaries with Dynamic Tidal Distortions Discovered with Kepler | year = 2012 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume = 753 | pages = 86| bibcode = 2012ApJ...753...86T | doi=10.1088/0004-637x/753/1/86|arxiv = 1203.6115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are known as ''heartbeat'' stars because of the characteristic shape of the lightcurves.

== Types of oscillators ==

=== Solar-like oscillators ===

{{main|Solar-like oscillations}}

Because solar oscillations are driven by near-surface convection, any stellar oscillations caused similarly are known as ''solar-like oscillations'' and the stars themselves as ''solar-like oscillators''.  However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not ''Sun-like''.

=== Cepheid variables ===

{{main|Cepheid variable}}

Cepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star.  They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses.  They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months.  Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.

Cepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.

=== RR Lyrae variables ===

{{main|RR Lyrae variable}}

RR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. [[Population II]]) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar).  They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone.  The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium.  Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the [[Blazhko effect]].

=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===

{{main|Delta Scuti variable|Gamma Doradus variable}}

Delta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence.  They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.

SX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.

Gamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type.  The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes.  Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.

Following results from ''Kepler'', it appears that nearly all Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Grigahc\`ene | first1 = A. | last2 = Antoci | first2 = V. | last3 = Balona | first3 = L. | last4 = Catanzaro | first4 = G. and | title = Hybrid $\gamma$ Doradus-$\delta$ Scuti Pulsators: New Insights into the Physics of the Oscillations from Kepler Observations | year = 2010 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume = 713 | pages = L192| bibcode = 2010ApJ...713L.192G|arxiv = 1001.0747 |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Balona | first1 = L. A. | title = Low frequencies in Kepler $\delta$ Scuti stars | year = 2014 | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume = 437 | pages = 1476| bibcode = 2014MNRAS.437.1476B | doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars ===

{{main|Rapidly oscillating Ap star}}

Rapidly oscillating Ap stars have similar parameters to Delta Scuti variables, mostly being A- and F-type, but they are also strongly magnetic and chemically peculiar (hence the ''p'' spectral subtype).  Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the ''oblique pulsator model'': the modes frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth).  The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 μHz and amplitudes of a few mmag.

=== Slowly-pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables ===

{{main|Slowly pulsating B-type star|Beta Cephei variable}}

Slowly-pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism.  Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours.  Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly-rotating stars.

=== Variable subdwarf B stars ===

{{main|Subdwarf B star}}

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core-helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen burning shell.  They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light.  The oscillations are low-order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump.

=== White dwarfs ===

{{main|Pulsating white dwarf}}

White dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way.  Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB.  Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough.  White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate.  The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables).  All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes.  The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute.  GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be  excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.

==Space missions==

A number of past, present and future spacecraft have asteroseismology studies as a significant part of their missions (order chronological). 

*[[Wide Field Infrared Explorer|WIRE]] – A [[NASA]] satellite launched in 1999. A failed large infrared telescope, the two-inch aperture star tracker was used for more than a decade as a bright-star asteroseismology instrument. Re-entered Earth's atmosphere 2011.
*[[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] –  A [[Canadian Space Agency|Canadian]] satellite launched in 2003. The first spacecraft dedicated to asteroseismology.
*[[CoRoT]] – A [[CNES|French]] led [[ESA]] planet-finder and asteroseismology satellite launched in 2006.
*[[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] – A [[NASA]] planet-finder spacecraft launched in 2009, repurposed as ''K2'' since the failure of a second reaction wheel prevented the telescope from continuing to monitor the same field.
*[[BRITE]] – A constellation of nanosatellites used to study the brightest oscillating stars. FIrst two satellites launched Feb 25, 2013.
*[[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] – An [[NASA]] planet-finder that will survey bright stars across most of the sky launched in 2018.
*[[PLATO (spacecraft)|PLATO]] – A planned [[ESA]] mission that will specifically exploit asteroseismology to obtain accurate masses and radii of transiting planets.

'''British counter-intelligence against the Indian revolutionary movement during World War I''' began from its initial roots in the late-19th century and ultimately came to span in extent from Asia through Europe to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. It was effective in thwarting [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|a number of attempts]] for insurrection in [[British India]] during [[World War I]] and ultimately  in controlling the [[Indian revolutionary movement]] both at home and abroad.

==Background==
{{Main|Indian Political Intelligence Office|Madan Lal Dhingra}}
{{See also|Shyamji Krishna Varma|The Indian Sociologist|Curzon Wyllie|Har Dayal|Hindu–German Conspiracy}}
During [[World War I]], although Indian political bodies and populace largely came to support the British war effort, [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] remained hotbeds of [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|anti colonial activities]]. Terrorism in Bengal, increasingly closely linked with the unrests in Punjab, was significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration.&lt;ref name=Gupta12&gt;{{Harvnb|Gupta|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from the beginning of the war, expatriate Indian population, notably from United States, Canada, and Germany, headed by the [[Berlin Committee]] and the [[Ghadar Party]], attempted to trigger insurrections in India on the lines of the [[1857 uprising]] with [[Irish Republican]], German and Turkish help in a massive conspiracy that has since come to be called the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy]]&lt;ref name=Strachan798&gt;{{Harvnb|Strachan|2001|p=798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoover252&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoover|1985|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBrown300&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1948|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conspiracy also attempted to rally Afghanistan against British India.&lt;ref name=Strachan788&gt;{{Harvnb|Strachan|2001|p=788}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of failed attempts were made at mutiny, of which the [[Ghadar Conspiracy#February 1915|February mutiny plan]] and the [[1915 Singapore Mutiny|Singapore Mutiny]] remains most notable. This movement was suppressed by means of a massive international counter-intelligence operation and draconian political acts (including the [[Defence of India Act 1915]]) that lasted nearly ten years.&lt;ref name=Hopkirk41&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkirk|2001|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Popplewell 1995 234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter-intelligence==

===Beginnings===
{{See also|W.C Hopkinson}}
Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911.&lt;ref name="Hopkirk41"/&gt; Incidents like the [[Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy]] and the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-Indian militant unrest. Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal—the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time—and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of ''Komagata Maru''.&lt;ref name=Popplewell168&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popplewell200&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were "cleaned up" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case.&lt;ref name=Popplewell200/&gt;

===In Asia===
{{Main|Ghadar Conspiracy|German plot}}
''See also: [[Charles Tegart]], [[Kirpal Singh (spy)|Kirpal Singh]], [[Oren (spy)|Oren]], [[Vincent Kraft]].''

At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives.&lt;ref name=Popplewell168/&gt; These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts. Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=Popplewell194&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members [[Liaqat Hayat Khan]] (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence.&lt;ref name=Popplewell173&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature.&lt;ref name=Popplewell173/&gt;

In Bengal, counter-intelligence, especially against the activities of [[Jugantar]] was led by [[Charles Tegart]] while the role of German or Baltic-German double-agents, especially the agent named [[Oren (spy)|''Oren'']],  was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year. Jatin is believed to be personally shot by Tegart in his final battle on the banks of the river Burha Balang. Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured. Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Strachan802&gt;{{Harvnb|Strachan|2001|p=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also arrested in November was a Javanese revolutionary by the name of Dekker while he travelled under the directions of the Berlin committee from Europe to Siam. He intended to work on publishing German war news and Indian revolutionary material to be smuggled into India via Burma.&lt;ref name=McKale125&gt;{{Harvnb|McKale|1998|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence.&lt;ref name=Strachan788/&gt;

{{See also|John Wallinger|Somerset Maugham|Tomas Masaryk|E.V. Voska|Virendranath Chattopadhyay}}
British efforts against the Indian revolutionary movement and gainst German spy networks involved both the [[Special Branch]] as well as the [[MI5]]. A branch of the [[MI5]] was formed early in the war to address the war time espionage operations &lt;ref name=Popplewell219&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MI5 itself, working under [[Vernon Kell]], had a number of India experts at the beginning of the war. In September 1916, a special section, the MI5(d), section was formed to operate counter-espionage networks throughout the [[British empire]]. Another subsection, the MI5(b), was formed in January 1917 to deal specifically with Indians and "other oriental races". The MI5(g) subsection was formed through renaming the MO5(g) in 1916.  The MI5(g) had 27 officers in its staff, eight of whom had served in India before the war. Among them were ex-Indian civil servants including [[Robert Nathan (Indian civil servant)|Robert Nathan]] and H.L. Stephenson. Nathan began his work for British intelligence against Indian revolutionaries in October 1914. After retiring from the ICS in 1915, Nathan joined the MI5(g). Nathan's fellow officer at the time was another ex-Indian police official by the name of HL Stephenson.&lt;ref name=Popplewell218&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; He headed at the time the political branch of the Secret service,&lt;ref name=Popplewell232&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and along with [[Basil Thomson]] who headed the Special Branch of the [[Scotland Yard]], Nathan was closely involved in the interrogation of Indians who worked along with the Germans during the war.&lt;ref name=Popplewell220&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main emphasis of this counter-espionage network was to prevent the subversion of Indian troops in the European theatre. The organisation, especially under Nathan, worked closely with the Special Branch of the [[Scotland Yard]] in Britain and with the [[Indian Political Intelligence Office]] headed by [[John Wallinger]], which operated a network of spies in neutral Switzerland which a number of the Indian revolutionaries and members of the Berlin Committee used as a base.&lt;ref name="Popplewell220"/&gt;

[[File:Chatto01.jpg|thumb|[[Virendranath Chattopadhaya]] ]]

By the time the war broke out an Indian Intelligence office, headed by John Wallinger, had been opened in Europe. In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the [[Secret Service Bureau]]. This network already had agents in [[Switzerland]] against possible German intrigues. After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Headquarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the [[Sûreté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=216,217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe. A British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate [[Virendranath Chattopadhaya]] while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet [[Mahendra Pratap]] to offer Kaiser Wilhelm II's invitation. It is said that [[Somerset Maugham]], who was in the British Secret Service in Europe during the war, based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modelling the character of [[Ashenden: Or the British Agent|John Ashenden]] after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath. The short story of ''Giulia Lazzari'' is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and [[Mata Hari]]'s story. Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories.&lt;ref name="Popplewell 1995 234"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barooah|2004|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MI5(g)'s work at the time identified the plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in 1915 through an associate of [[Har Dayal]], [[Gobind Behari Lal]].&lt;ref name=Popplewell224&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, for the capture of Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin Committee) and turning him into a double agent.&lt;ref name=Popplewell227&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Harish Chandra was also identified plans for obtaining information of Ghadarite intrigues in Japan and China. Among other works, Nathan was responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya]] through an agent by the name of Donald Gullick.&lt;ref name=Popplewell229&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan's efforts, along with those of [[John Wallinger]]'s [[Indian Political Intelligence Office]] (who Nathan worked closely with), were key in the British counter-espionage work.&lt;ref name=Popplewell220/&gt; Nathan's work at the time identified the plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in 1915 through an associate of [[Har Dayal]], Gobind Behari Lal.&lt;ref name="Popplewell224"/&gt; He was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, to turn Harish Chandra (who was associated with the [[Berlin Committee]]) into a double agent.&lt;ref name="Popplewell227"/&gt;
Among other works, Nathan was responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya]] through an agent by the name of Donald Gullick.&lt;ref name="Popplewell229"/&gt;

===Middle East===

In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of ''The Caliph's Jihad'', while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the [[Kabul Mission]]. The [[Seistan Force|East Persian Cordon]] was established in July 1915 in the [[Sistan|Sistan province]] of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan and to protect British supply caravans in [[Sarhad District|Sarhad]] from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who might be tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was [[Reginald Dyer]] who led it between March and October 1916.&lt;ref name=Collett144&gt;{{Harvnb|Collett|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popplewell182&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=182,183,187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seidt4&gt;{{Harvnb|Seidt|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{Main|Ghadar Conspiracy}}
{{See also|Guy Gaunt|Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet}}
In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels. The activities of [[Ghadar Party|Ghadar]] on the Pacific coast were noted by [[W. C. Hopkinson]], who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi. Initially W.C.H. had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of [[Taraknath Das]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as early as 1910. Francis Cunliffe Owen, the officer heading the Home Office agency in [[New York City]], had become thoroughly acquainted with [[George Freeman (newspaper editor)|George Freeman]] alias Fitzgerald and [[Myron Phelps]], the famous New York advocate, as members of the [[Clan-na-Gael]]. Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS ''Moraitis'' plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an exclusively Indian society.&lt;ref name=Popplewell148&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including infiltration through a "Native" Indian intelligence officer by the name of Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to British intelligence, as well as the use of the famous American [[Pinkerton's]] detective agency.&lt;ref name=Popplewell148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Radhan259&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhan|2001|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; W. C. Hopkinson himself was assassinated in a court in Victoria by a Ghadarite named Mewa Singh in October 1914.&lt;ref name=Radhan261&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhan|2001|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on instructions from British secret service, Robert Nathan transferred his work to the Pacific coast North America where the Ghadar Party worked closely with the German consulate at San Francisco to obtain arms and men for what came to be known as the [[Ghadar Conspiracy]]. Working with [[Thomas J Tunney]], the head of New York Bomb Squad, Nathan's works successfully brought the Ghadarites and staff at the German consulate to trial following the [[Annie Larsen affair|''Annie Larsen'' arms plot]]. He organised the [[Hindu-German conspiracy trial]], which at the time was the longest in merican{{Clarify|date=May 2016}} legal history.&lt;ref name=Popplewell236&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for the arrest of [[Chandra Kanta Chakraverty]] and his subsequent interrogation, along with that Ernst Sekunna. Through March 1917, Nathan worked closely with [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], and negotiated with the [[US State Department]] the details of the case against the Indian conspirators. He strongly supported granting the guarantee to the United States of not being held responsible for violation  of neutrality.&lt;ref name=Popplewell250&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the ''Annie Larsen'' and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution. An Indian operative, codenamed "''C''" and described most likely to have been the adventurous Chandra Kanta Chakravarty (later the chief prosecution witness in the trial), also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence.&lt;ref name=Plowman93&gt;{{Harvnb|Plowman|2003|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of [[Bagha Jatin]]'s plans. The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Voska|Irwin|1940|p=98,108,120,122,123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masaryk50&gt;{{Harvnb|Masaryk|1970|p=50,221,242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|1971|p=233,233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American network, headed by [[E.V. Voska]], was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as [[Habsburg]] subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with [[Guy Gaunt]], who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to [[Tomáš Masaryk]] who further passed on the information the American authorities.&lt;ref name=Masaryk50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The British counter-intelligence operations effectively thwarted attempts within and from outside India, and ultimately was able to bring the [[Ghadar Party]] into the attention of American intelligence, while its counter-subversion within the Berlin committee and the Indian movement effectively broke the groups up and prevented a cohesive plan for being put into place.

'''Cape York Peninsula''' is a large remote [[peninsula]] located in [[Far North Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It is the largest unspoiled wilderness in northern Australia.&lt;ref name="Mittermeier"&gt;Mittermeier, R.E. et al. (2002). Wilderness: Earth’s last wild places. Mexico City: Agrupación Sierra Madre, S.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The land is mostly flat and about half of the area is used for grazing cattle. The relatively undisturbed eucalyptus wooded [[savannahs]], [[tropical rainforests]] and other types of habitat are now recognized and preserved for their global environmental significance, but native wildlife is threatened by [[introduced species]] and weeds.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;Mackey, B.

Kennedy, unveiled at [[Cardwell, Queensland|Cardwell]], 1948. In 1848, Kennedy, Assistant-Surveyor of New South Wales, led an expedition to explore Cape York Peninsula.]]

[[Edmund Kennedy]] was the first European explorer to attempt an overland expedition of Cape York Peninsula. He had been second-in-command to [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Livingstone Mitchell]] in 1846 when the [[Barcoo River]] was discovered. The aim was to blaze a trail to the tip of the peninsula where some Sydney businessmen thought of developing a port for trade with the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref name=wjoy1964&gt;{{cite book |title=The Explorers |last=Joy |first=William |year=1964 |publisher=Rigby Limited |location=Adelaide |isbn=0-85179-112-3 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition set out from [[Rockingham Bay]] near the present town of [[Cardwell, Queensland|Cardwell]] in May 1848, and it turned out to be one of the great disasters of Australian exploration. Of the thirteen men who set out, only three survived. The others died of fever or starvation, or were speared by hostile aborigines. Kennedy died of spear wounds almost within sight of his destination in December 1848. The only survivor to complete the journey was [[Jackey Jackey]], an aborigine from New South Wales. He led a rescue party to the other two who had been unable to continue.&lt;ref name=wjoy1964/&gt;

The peninsula was finally conquered in 1864 when the Jardine brothers with eight companions drove a mob of cattle from [[Rockhampton]] to the new settlement of Somerset (on Cape York) where the Jardines’ father was commander.

The west coast borders the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and the east coast borders the [[Coral Sea]]. The peninsula is bordered on three sides (north, east and west). There is no clear demarcation to the south, although the official boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland runs along at about 16°S latitude.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel. (2007). Cape York Peninsula Heritage X\au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CapeYorkPHA07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cape Flattery Cape York Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Sand dunes around Cape Flattery.]]

At the peninsula’s widest point, it is {{cvt|430|km}} from the [[Bloomfield River]] in the southeast, across to the west coast just south of the aboriginal community of [[Kowanyama, Queensland|Kowanyama]]. It is some {{cvt|660|km}} from the southern border of Cook Shire, to the tip of Cape York. The largest islands in the strait include [[Prince of Wales Island (Queensland)|Prince of Wales Island]], [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]], [[Moa Island (Queensland)|Moa]], and [[Badu Island]].

At the tip of the peninsula lies Cape York, the northernmost point on the Australian mainland. It was named by [[Lieutenant]] [[James Cook]] on 21 August 1770 in honour of [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], a brother of King [[George III of the United Kingdom]], who had died three years earlier:

{{quote|The point of the Main, which forms one side of the Passage before mentioned, and which is the Northern Promontory of this Country, I have named York Cape, in honour of his late Royal Highness, the Duke of York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8106/8106.txt From Cook's Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The tropical landscapes are among the most stable in the world.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt; Long undisturbed by tectonic activity, the peninsula is an extremely eroded, almost level low plain dominated by [[meander]]ing [[river]]s and vast [[floodplain]]s, with some very low hills rising to {{cvt|800|m}} elevation in the [[McIlwraith Range]] on the eastern side around [[Coen, Queensland|Coen]].

The backbone of Cape York Peninsula is the peninsula ridge, part of Australia’s [[Great Dividing Range]]. This mountain range is made up of ancient (1,500-million-year-old) [[Precambrian]] and [[Palaeozoic]] rocks.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;Frith, D.W., Frith, C.B. (1995). Cape York Peninsula: A Natural History. Chatswood: Reed Books Australia. Reprinted with amendments in 2006. {{ISBN|0-7301-0469-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To the east and west of the peninsula ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins, themselves made up of ancient [[Mesozoic]] sediments.&lt;ref name=Frith /&gt; There are several outstanding landforms on the peninsula: the large expanses of undisturbed [[dune]]fields at the eastern coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford-Cape Flattery; the huge piles of black [[granite]] boulders at [[Black Mountain (Kalkajaka) National Park|Black Mountain National Park]] and [[Cape Melville]]; and the limestone [[karst]]s around Palmerston in the peninsula’s far south.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt;

===Soil===
The soils are remarkably infertile even compared to other areas of Australia, being almost entirely [[laterite|laterised]] and in most cases so old and weathered that very little development is apparent today (classified in [[USDA soil taxonomy]] as [[Orthent]]s). It is because of this extraordinary soil poverty that the region is so thinly settled: the soils are so unworkable and unresponsive to [[fertiliser]]s that attempts to grow commercial crops have usually failed.

===Climate===
The climate on Cape York Peninsula is [[tropical]] and [[monsoon]]al, with a heavy monsoon season from November to April, during which time the forest becomes almost uninhabitable, and a dry season from May to October. The temperature is warm to hot, with a cooler climate in higher areas. The mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|18|°C}} at higher elevations to {{convert|27|°C}} on the lowlands in the drier southwest. Temperatures over {{convert|40|°C}} and below {{convert|5|°C}} are rare.

Annual rainfall is high, ranging from over {{convert|2000|mm}} in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about {{convert|700|mm}} at the southern border. Almost all this rain falls between November and April, and only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the [[median]] rainfall between June and September above {{convert|5|mm|1}}. Between January and March, however, the median monthly rainfall ranges from about {{convert|170|mm|0}} in the south to over {{convert|500|mm}} in the north and on the Iron Range.

===Rivers===
[[File:Jardine-river-cape-york-queensland-australia.jpg|thumb|[[Jardine River]], northern Cape York Peninsula, at the base of Cape York itself.]]

The Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea. To the west, a series of large, winding river systems including the [[Mitchell River (Queensland)|Mitchell]], [[Staaten River|Staaten]], Coleman, Holroyd, Archer, Watson, Wenlock, Ducie and [[Jardine River|Jardine]] [[drainage basin|catchments]] empty their waters into the Gulf of Carpentaria. During the [[dry season]], those rivers are reduced to a series of waterholes and sandy beds. Yet, with the arrival of torrential rains in the [[wet season]], they swell to mighty waterways, spreading across extensive floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to a vast array of freshwater and wetland species.&lt;ref name=Frith /&gt;

On the Eastern slopes, the shorter, faster-flowing Jacky Jacky Creek, Olive, Pascoe, Lockhart, Stewart, Jeannie and [[Endeavour River|Endeavour]] Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea, providing important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. On their way, those [[Wild river|wild, undisturbed rivers]] are lined with dense rainforests, sand dunes or mangroves.&lt;ref name=Frith/&gt;
[[File:Crossing the Wenlock River. Hope there are no crocodiles.jpg|thumb|left|Tourists crossing the [[Wenlock River]] in the Wet Season]]

The floodplains of the Laura Basin, which are protected in the [[Lakefield National Park|Lakefield]] and Jack River National Parks, are crossed by the Morehead, Hann, North Kennedy, Laura, Jack and [[Normanby River|Normanby]] Rivers.

The Peninsula’s river catchments are noted for their exceptional [[hydrology|hydrological]] integrity. With little disturbance on both water flows and vegetation cover throughout entire catchments, Cape York Peninsula has been identified as one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain essentially intact.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt; Cape York Peninsula contributes as much as a quarter of Australia's surface runoff. Indeed, with only about 2.7 percent of Australia's land area it produces more run-off than all of Australia south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Tapping those heavy tropical rainfalls, the peninsula’s rivers are also of particular importance for replenishing central Australia’s [[Great Artesian Basin]].&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt; The Queensland Government is currently poised to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsula’s wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005.&lt;ref name=WildRiversAct&gt;Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel. (2005). Wild Rivers Act 2005.  Retrieved 23 March 2008, from [http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2005/05AC042.pdf legislation.qld.gov.au].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geological history===
[[File:Mount-mulligan-cape-york.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Mulligan, Queensland|Mount Mulligan]], [[Hodgkinson Minerals Area|Hodgkinson Goldfields]]]]

The peninsula is formed from the northern part of the Great Dividing Range, folded during the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous period]] some 300 million years ago, when Australia collided with what is now parts of South America and New Zealand.{{fact|date=September 2018}} The range has experienced significant erosion since. 
Around 40 million years ago, the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian tectonic plate]] began to split apart from the ancient [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. As it collided with the [[Pacific Plate]] on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central [[New Guinea]] emerged around 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Frith /&gt; In the lee of this collision zone, the ancient rock formations of what is now Cape York Peninsula remained largely undisturbed.

Throughout the [[Pleistocene]] epoch Australia and New Guinea were alternately land-linked and separated by water. During periods of [[glacier|glaciation]] and resulting low sea levels, Cape York Peninsula provided a low-lying land link.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt; Another link existed between [[Arnhem Land]] and New Guinea, at times enclosing an enormous freshwater lake (Lake Carpentaria) in the centre of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref name=Woinarski /&gt; Australia and New Guinea remained connected in this way until the shallow [[Torres Strait]] was last flooded around 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Mittermeier /&gt;

== Ecology ==

===Flora===
Cape York Peninsula supports a complex mosaic of intact tropical rainforests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, [[Heath (habitat)|heath lands]], wetlands, wild rivers and [[mangrove]] swamps.&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt; The savannah woodlands consist typically of a tall dense grass layer and varying densities of trees, predominantly [[eucalypt]] of which the most common is Darwin stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus tetrodonta]]'').&lt;ref name=Woinarski /&gt; These various habitats are home to about 3300 species of [[flowering plants]]&lt;ref name=Neldner /&gt; and almost the entire area of Cape York Peninsula (99.6%) still retains its native vegetation and is little fragmented.&lt;ref name=Neldner&gt;Neldner, V.J., Clarkson, J.R. (1994). Vegetation Survey of Cape York Peninsula. Cape York Peninsula Land Use Study (CYPLUS). Office of the Co-ordinator General and Department of Environment and Heritage, Government of Queensland: Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; Although abundant and fully functioning on the peninsula, tropical savannahs are now rare and highly degraded in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Mackey/&gt; Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of [[endemism]] in Australia, with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far.&lt;ref name=Mackey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland''. (2000). Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-9349-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, parts of the peninsula have been noted for their exceptionally high wilderness quality.&lt;ref name=Abrahams&gt;Abrahams, H., Mulvaney, M., Glasco, D., Bugg, A.

[[File:Pitcher-plant-cape-york-australia.JPG|thumb|[[Carnivorous plants of Australia|Carnivorous]] [[pitcher plant]], Cape York Peninsula.]]

The flora of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species, plants that have emerged since the breakup of Gondwana and species from [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indo-Malaya]] and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea with the most variety being found in the rainforest areas. Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than nearby New Guinea which limits the rainforest plants of that island from migrating across to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0703|name=Cape York Peninsula tropical savanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being almost exclusively untouched, old-growth forests and supporting a disproportionately high biodiversity including flora of Gondwanan and New Guinean origin, the rainforests are of high conservation significance.&lt;ref name=Abrahams /&gt; The largest contiguous rainforest area on the peninsula occurs in the McIllwraith Range-[[Iron Range National Park|Iron Range]] area.&lt;ref name=Woinarski /&gt; The Gondwanan flora of this area includes [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]] conifers and ''[[Arthrochilus]]'', ''[[Corybas (plant)|Corybas]]'', and ''[[Calochilus]]'' orchids. In all, this rainforest contains at least 1000 different plants, including 100 rare or threatened species, and 16% of Australia's orchid species.

On poor, dry soils [[Heath (habitat)|tropical heathlands]] can be found. Northeast Cape York Peninsula supports Australia’s largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Woinarski /&gt;

The extensive wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are "among the largest, richest and most diverse in Australia".&lt;ref name=Abrahams /&gt; 19 wetlands of national significance have been identified, mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas. Important wetlands include the [[Jardine River National Park|Jardine Complex]], [[Lakefield National Park|Lakefield]] systems and the [[estuaries]] of the great rivers of the western plains.&lt;ref name=Abrahams /&gt; Many of these wetlands come into existence only during the wet season and support rare or uncommon plant communities.&lt;ref name=Cofinas /&gt;

The peninsula’s coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with [[mangrove]] forests of [[Intsia bijuga|kwila]] and other trees. Australia’s largest mangrove forest can be found at Newcastle Bay.

===Fauna===
The peninsula harbours an extraordinary [[biodiversity]], with more than 700 [[vertebrate]] land animal species of which 40 are endemic. As a result, from its geological history, "the flora and fauna of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics, Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders" (p.&amp;nbsp;41).&lt;ref name=Frith /&gt; Birds of the peninsula include [[buff-breasted buttonquail]] (''Turnix olivii''), [[golden-shouldered parrot]] (''Psephotus chrysopterygius''), [[lovely fairywren]] (''Malurus amabilis''), [[white-streaked honeyeater]] (''Trichodere cockerelli''), and [[yellow-spotted honeyeater]] (''Meliphaga notata'') while some such as [[pied oystercatcher]] are found in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula. The peninsula is also home to the [[eastern brown snake]], one of the world's most venomous snakes. Mammals include the rodent [[Cape York melomys]], related to the extinct [[Bramble Cay melomys]], which was found only on [[Bramble Cay]] in the Torres Strait and confirmed extinct in 2016.&lt;ref name="Extinction report June 2016"&gt;{{Citation |author-last1=Gynther |author-first1=Ian |author-last2=Waller |author-first2=Natalie |author-last3=Leung |author-first3=Luke K.-P. |date=June 2016 |title=Confirmation of the extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys Melomys rubicola on Bramble Cay, Torres Strait: results and conclusions from a comprehensive survey in August–September 2014 |publisher=Unpublished report to the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, Queensland Government, Brisbane. |url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/wildlife/threatened-species/documents/bramble-cay-melomys-survey-report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slezak&gt;{{cite news |last=Slezak |first=Michael |date=14 June 2016 |title=Revealed: first mammal species wiped out by human-induced climate change |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change |accessdate= 14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rainforests of the Iron Range National Park support species that are also found in New Guinea, including the [[eclectus parrot]] and [[southern common cuscus]]. Other rainforest fauna includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge [[Ornithoptera priamus|green birdwing]], the [[Morelia viridis|green tree python]] and the [[northern quoll]], a forest [[marsupial]] that is now severely depleted from eating the introduced poisonous [[cane toad]]s.

The riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own while the rivers including the Jardine, [[Jackson River (Queensland)|Jackson]], Olive, [[Holroyd River|Holroyd]] and the [[Wenlock River|Wenlock]] are rich in fish. The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and [[Saltwater crocodile|crocodile]] habitat, providing important [[drought refuge]] &lt;ref name=Woinarski /&gt;&lt;ref name=Abrahams /&gt; and finally the [[Great Barrier Reef]] lies off the east coast and is an important marine habitat.

===Threats and preservation===
[[File:BEWARE sign. 2008.JPG|thumb|BEWARE sign. Cape York Peninsula]]

Cattle station leases occupy about 57% of the total area, mostly located in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula. Indigenous land comprises about 20%, with the entire West coast being held under [[Native title]]. The remainder is mostly declared as [[National Park]] and managed by the [[Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service]]. Land uses include broad-acre pastoralism, [[bauxite]] and [[silica sand]] mining, nature reserves, tourism and fishing. 

There are extensive deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast.

The "Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy" study was commissioned by the Australian government in 1990 to create plans to protect the wilderness and a nomination for [[World Heritage site|World Natural Heritage]] is currently being considered by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments.&lt;ref name=Valentine&gt;Valentine, Peter S.

== People and culture ==

The first known contact between Europeans and Aborigines occurred on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606 but it was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities, then stations and later mining towns were established. European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland. Today the peninsula has a population of only about 18,000, of which a large percentage (~60%) are [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].&lt;ref name=Woinarski&gt;Woinarski, J., Mackey, B., Nix, H., Traill, B.

The administrative and commercial centre for much of Cape York Peninsula is [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]], located in its far southeastern corner while the peninsula’s largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The remainder is extremely sparsely populated, with about half the population living in very small settlements and cattle ranches. Along the peninsula developmental road, there are small service centres at [[Lakeland, Queensland|Lakeland]], [[Laura, Queensland|Laura]] and [[Coen, Queensland|Coen]]. About {{cvt|30|km}} offshore north of the tip of Cape York, there is a sizeable service centre on nearby [[Thursday Island]]. Aboriginal communities are at [[Hopevale, Queensland|Hopevale]], Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama, Aurukun, [[Lockhart River, Queensland|Lockhart River]], Napranum, Mapoon, [[Injinoo]], [[New Mapoon]] and [[Umagico]]. Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at [[Bamaga]] and [[Seisia]].&lt;ref name=Mackey /&gt;&lt;ref name=CYPDA /&gt; A completely sealed inland road links [[Cairns]] and the [[Atherton Tableland]] to Lakeland and Cooktown. The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season (roughly December to May).

The peninsula is a popular tourist destination in the dry season for camping, hiking, bird watching and fishing enthusiasts. Many people make the adventurous, but rewarding, drive to the tip of Cape York, the northernmost point of mainland Australia.

Some of the world's most extensive and ancient aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura, some of which are available for public viewing. There is also a new interpretive centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Old-telegraph-track-cape-york.JPG|thumb|Old Telegraph Track.]]

There are two roads passing north-south through Cape York Peninsula to Cape York: the [[Peninsula Developmental Road]] (PDR) and the [[Bamaga Road|Northern Peninsula Road]] (also called Bamaga Road and Telegraph Road).

Bamaga Road now bypasses the overland telegraph line (OTL) track, which is often referred to as the tele track. The tele track was used for construction and maintenance of the OTL until it was superseded by first microwave relay towers and then by fibre optic cables, and is now used by [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle enthusiasts in the dry season. Many crossings, such as the bridge over the Wenlock near Moreton station, have been upgraded; however, many [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] remain. The roads are unsealed and in places are difficult to traverse. They are considered suitable for four-wheel-drive vehicles only and also considered only suitable to be driven in the dry season.

In 1986 Cape York became the proposed site of a [[spaceport]], which a consortium of companies, the Cape York Space Agency, promoted with support from the federal government.  In 1992 investor support failed, and in 2017 legal ownership of {{convert|160000|ha}} of land required was returned to the [[Wudhadhi dialect|Wuthathi]], Kuku Yau and Northern [[Kaanju language|Kaanju]] people.&lt;ref name=nsci-19890624&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12216703-100-soviet-hardware-bolsters-plan-for-australian-launching-site/ |title=Soviet hardware bolsters plan for Australian launching site |last=Anderson |first=Ian |publisher=New Scientist |date=24 June 1989 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20170517&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/17/indigenous-owners-who-defeated-cape-york-spaceport-given-back-lands-after-150-years |title=Indigenous owners who defeated Cape York spaceport given back lands after 150 years |last=Robertson |first=Joshua |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 May 2017 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development, which was heavily supported by Queensland premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]]. would have included a new town, tourist resorts, an airport and a harbour.&lt;ref name=cairnspost-20170519&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/cairns/dark-and-fascinating-history-of-cape-york-spaceport-bid/news-story/6803ea7bf33f70277e25b16f0f8d3f97?nk=8a868c7b8b2294e2d5e69cb104d006a6-1495533319 |title=Dark and fascinating history of Cape York spaceport bid |last=Calcino |first=Chris |newspaper=The Cairns Post |date=19 May 2017 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryopediology''' is any study relating to the [[behavior]] of frozen [[snow]].  The shapes into which frozen snow is blown by the wind (e.g. on the [[tundra]]) are said to be 'cryopediological formations'.  The ways in which frozen snow behaves due to factors intrinsic to itself and relating to environments are 'cryopediological [[Process (science)|process]]es'.

'''Desert riparian''' is a North American [[desert]] vegetation type (or [[biome]]) occurring in the bottoms of [[canyon]]s and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.&lt;ref name=MDW&gt;Pam MacKay, Mojave Desert Wildflowers, 2nd Ed., p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with the [[desert dry wash]] vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring ([[oasis]]), or in a strand following the course of water flow.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (''[[Populus fremontii]]''), Arizona ash (''[[Fraxinus velutina]]''), arroyo willow (''[[Salix lasiolepis]]''), Goodding's willow (''[[Salix gooddingii]]''), red willow (''[[Salix laevigata]]''), California fan palm (''[[Washingtonia filifera]]''), and [[invasive species]] such as salt cedar (''[[Tamarix ramosissima]]''), giant reed (''[[Arundo donax]]''), and Russian olive (''[[Elaeagnus angustifolia]]'').&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt;

The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a highly [[sacred]] religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in particularly sacred ceremonies.

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at  [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015 | format = PDF}} As amended 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

Earth's internal heat budget is fundamental to the [[thermal history of the Earth]].  The '''flow of heat from Earth's interior to the surface''' is estimated at &lt;math&gt;47 \pm 2&lt;/math&gt; [[terawatt]]s (TW)&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010).

This renders solar radiation minimally relevant for internal processes.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, W. (2007). ''Fundamentals of geophysics''. Cambridge: CUP, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and early estimate of Earth's age ==

Based on calculations of Earth's cooling rate, which assumed constant conductivity in the Earth's interior, in 1862 [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later made Lord Kelvin) estimated the age of the Earth at 98 million years,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1864). [http://courses.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/EPS281r/Sources/Earth-age-and-thermal-history/more/Kelvin-1863-excerpts.pdf On the secular cooling of the earth], read 28 April 1862. ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 23, 157–170.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the age of 4.5 billion years obtained in the 20th century by [[radiometric dating]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. R. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Martin J. van Kranendonk|editor2=Vickie Bennett|editor3=Hugh R.H.

Contrary to the usual representation of Kelvin's argument, the observed thermal gradient of the Earth's crust would not be explained by the addition of radioactivity as a heat source. More significantly, [[mantle convection]] alters how heat is transported within the Earth, invalidating Kelvin's assumption of purely conductive cooling.

== Global internal heat flow ==
[[File:Heat flow of the inner earth.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross section of the Earth showing its main divisions and their approximate contributions to Earth's total internal heat flow to the surface, and the dominant heat transport mechanisms within the Earth.]]

Estimates of the total heat flow from Earth’s interior to surface span a range of 43 to 49 terawatts (TW) (a terawatt is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s).&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;Dye, S. T. (2012). Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth. Reviews of Geophysics, 50(3).&lt;/ref&gt; One recent estimate is 47&amp;nbsp;TW,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; equivalent to an average heat flux of 91.6&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is based on more than 38,000 measurements. The respective mean heat flows of continental and oceanic crust are 70.9 and 105.4&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

While the total internal Earth heat flow to the surface is well constrained, the relative contribution of the two main sources of Earth's heat, radiogenic and primordial heat, are highly uncertain because their direct measurement is difficult. Chemical and physical models give estimated ranges of 15–41&amp;nbsp;TW and 12–30&amp;nbsp;TW for [[radiogenic heat]] and [[primordial heat]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Dye /&gt; 

The [[structure of the Earth]] is a rigid outer [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that is composed of thicker [[continental crust]] and thinner [[oceanic crust]], solid but plastically flowing [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], a liquid [[outer core]], and a solid [[inner core]]. The [[viscosity|fluidity]] of a material is proportional to temperature; thus, the solid mantle can still flow on long time scales, as a function of its temperature&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; and therefore as a function of the flow of Earth's internal heat. The [[Mantle convection|mantle convects]] in response to heat escaping from Earth's interior, with hotter and more buoyant mantle rising and cooler, and therefore denser, mantle sinking. This convective flow of the mantle drives the movement of Earth's [[Lithosphere|lithospheric plates]]; thus, an additional reservoir of heat in the lower mantle is critical for the operation of plate tectonics and one possible source is an enrichment of radioactive elements in the lower mantle.&lt;ref name=Arevalo&gt;Arevalo Jr, R., McDonough, W. F., &amp; Luong, M. (2009). The K/U ratio of the silicate Earth: Insights into mantle composition, structure and thermal evolution. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 278(3), 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth heat transport occurs by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], [[mantle convection]], [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal convection]], and volcanic [[advection]].&lt;ref name=Jaupart&gt;Jaupart, C., &amp; Mareschal, J. C. (2007). Heat flow and thermal structure of the lithosphere. Treatise on Geophysics, 6, 217–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's internal heat flow to the surface is thought to be 80% due to mantle convection, with the remaining heat mostly originating in the Earth's crust,&lt;ref&gt;Korenaga, J. (2003). Energetics of mantle convection and the fate of fossil heat. Geophysical Research Letters, 30(8), 1437.&lt;/ref&gt; with about 1% due to volcanic activity, earthquakes, and mountain building.&lt;ref name=Turcotte&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald L. Turcotte|author2=Gerald Schubert|title=Geodynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nCHlVuJ4FoC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=primordial|date=25 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66624-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, about 99% of Earth's internal heat loss at the surface is by conduction through the crust, and mantle convection is the dominant control on heat transport from deep within the Earth. Most of the heat flow from the thicker continental crust is attributed to internal radiogenic sources, in contrast the thinner oceanic crust has only 2% internal radiogenic heat.&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; The remaining heat flow at the surface would be due to basal heating of the crust from mantle convection. Heat fluxes are negatively correlated with rock age,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; with the highest heat fluxes from the youngest rock at [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers (zones of mantle upwelling), as observed in the [[:File:Earth heat flow.jpg|global map of Earth heat flow]].&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

== Radiogenic heat ==
[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat-with total.svg|thumb|300px|The evolution of Earth's [[radiogenic heat]] flow over time.]]

The [[radioactive decay]] of elements in the Earth's mantle and crust results in production of daughter [[isotope]]s and release of [[Geoneutrino|geoneutrinos]] and heat energy, or [[radiogenic heat]]. Four radioactive isotopes are responsible for the majority of radiogenic heat because of their enrichment relative to other radioactive isotopes: [[uranium 238|uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[uranium 235|uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K).&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2011"&gt;Korenaga, J.

Geoneutrino detectors can detect the decay of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and thus allow estimation of their contribution to the present radiogenic heat budget, while &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is not detectable.  Regardless, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is estimated to contribute 4&amp;nbsp;TW of heating.&lt;ref name="Gando"&gt;Gando, A., Dwyer, D. A., McKeown, R. D., &amp; Zhang, C. (2011). Partial radiogenic heat model for Earth revealed by geoneutrino measurements. Nature Geoscience, 4(9), 647–651.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the short [[Half-life|half-lives]] the decay of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth, which was also much hotter than at present.&lt;ref name=Arevalo /&gt; Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of [[radioactive decay]] from within the Earth, a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for radiogenic heat, yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic,&lt;ref name=Gando /&gt; and this is consistent with previous estimates.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008"&gt;Korenaga, J. (2008). Urey ratio and the structure and evolution of Earth's mantle. Reviews of Geophysics, 46(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primordial heat ==

Primordial heat is the heat lost by the Earth as it continues to cool from its original formation, and this is in contrast to its still actively-produced radiogenic heat. The Earth core's heat flow—heat leaving the core and flowing into the overlying mantle—is thought to be due to primordial heat, and is estimated at 5–15&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name=Lay&gt;Lay, T., Hernlund, J., &amp; Buffett, B. A. (2008). Core–mantle boundary heat flow. Nature Geoscience, 1(1), 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of mantle primordial heat loss range between 7 and 15&amp;nbsp;TW, which is calculated as the remainder of heat after removal of core heat flow and bulk-Earth radiogenic heat production from the observed surface heat flow.&lt;ref name= Dye /&gt;

The early formation of the Earth's dense core could have caused superheating and rapid heat loss, and the heat loss rate would slow once the mantle solidified.&lt;ref name=Lay /&gt; Heat flow from the core is necessary for maintaining the convecting outer core and the geodynamo and [[Earth's magnetic field]], therefore primordial heat from the core enabled Earth's atmosphere and thus helped retain Earth's liquid water.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt;

== Heat flow and plate tectonics ==

R. 2007"/&gt; to a single-plate lithosphere,&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; to modern [[plate tectonics]] sometime between 3.2&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;ref&gt;Pease, V., Percival, J., Smithies, H., Stevens, G., &amp; Van Kranendonk, M.

Controversy over the exact nature of mantle convection makes the linked evolution of Earth's heat budget and the dynamics and structure of the mantle difficult to unravel.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt; There is evidence that the processes of [[plate tectonics]] were not active in the Earth before 3.2 billion years ago, and that early Earth's internal heat loss could have been dominated by [[advection]] via heat-pipe [[volcanism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, W. B., &amp; Webb, A. A. G. (2013). Heat-pipe Earth. Nature, 501(7468), 501–505.&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial bodies with lower heat flows, such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]], [[Thermal conduction|conduct]] their internal heat through a single lithospheric plate, and higher heat flows, such as on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], result in [[advection|advective]] heat transport via enhanced volcanism, while the active plate tectonics of Earth occur with an intermediate heat flow and a [[Mantle convection|convecting mantle]].&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

[[Image:Ekman spirale.svg|right|thumb|200px|Ekman spiral effect. 1. Wind 2.&amp;nbsp;force from above 3. Effective direction of the current 4. Coriolis effect]]

The '''Ekman spiral''' is a structure of currents or winds near a horizontal boundary in which the flow direction rotates as one moves away from the boundary. It derives its name from the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[oceanography|oceanographer]] [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]]. The deflection of surface currents was first noticed by the Norwegian oceanographer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] during the [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Fram expedition]] (1893–1896) and the effect was first physically explained by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, V. W. 1905. On the influence of the Earth's rotation on ocean currents. Arch. Math. Astron. Phys., 2, 1-52. [http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/classics.d/Ekman05.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The effect is a consequence of the [[Coriolis effect]] which subjects  moving objects to an apparent force to the right of their direction of motion in the northern hemisphere (and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Thus, when a persistent wind blows over an extended area of the ocean surface in the northern hemisphere, it causes a surface current which accelerates in that direction, which then experiences a Coriolis force and acceleration to the right of the wind:  the current will turn gradually to the right as it gains speed.  As the flow is now somewhat right of the wind, the Coriolis force perpendicular to the flow's motion is now partly directed ''against'' the wind.  Eventually, the current will reach a top speed when the force of the wind, of the Coriolis effect, and the resistant drag of the subsurface water balance, and the current will flow at a constant speed and direction as long as the wind persists.  This surface current drags on the water layer below it, applying a force in its own direction of motion to that layer, repeating the process whereby that layer eventually becomes a steady current even further to the right of the wind, and so on for deeper layers of water, resulting in a continuous rotation (or spiraling) of current direction with changing depth.  As depth increases, the force transmitted from the driving wind declines and thus the speed of the resultant steady current decreases, hence the tapered spiral representation in the accompanying diagram.  The depth to which the Ekman spiral penetrates is determined by how far turbulent mixing can penetrate over the course of a [[Foucault pendulum|pendulum day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The diagram above attempts to show the forces associated with the Ekman spiral as applied to the Northern hemisphere. The force from above is in red (beginning with the wind blowing over the water surface), the Coriolis force (which is shown at right angles to the force from above when it should in fact be at right angles to the actual water flow) is in dark yellow, and the net resultant water movement is in pink, which then becomes the force from above for the layer below it, accounting for the gradual clockwise spiral motion as you move down.

==Observation==
The first documented observations of an oceanic Ekman spiral were made in the Arctic Ocean from a drifting ice floe in 1958.&lt;ref name = "Hunkins"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunkins | first1 = K. | title = Ekman drift currents in the Arctic Ocean | journal = Deep-Sea Research | volume = 13 | pages = 607–620 | year = 1966 | doi=10.1016/0011-7471(66)90592-4|bibcode = 1966DSROA..13..607H }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent observations include:

Common to several of these observations spirals were found to be 'compressed', displaying larger estimates of eddy viscosity when considering the rate of rotation with depth than the eddy viscosity derived from considering the rate of decay of speed.&lt;ref name = "Price" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chereskin" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lenn" /&gt; Though in the Southern Ocean the 'compression', or spiral flattening effect disappeared when new data permitted a more careful treatment of the effect of geostrophic shear.&lt;ref name = "Polton" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roach"/&gt;

The classic Ekman spiral has been observed under sea ice,&lt;ref name = "Hunkins" /&gt; but observations remain rare in open-ocean conditions. This is due both to the fact that the turbulent mixing in the [[surface layer]] of the ocean has a strong [[diurnal cycle]] and to the fact that surface waves can destabilize the Ekman spiral. Ekman spirals are also found in the atmosphere. Surface winds in the Northern Hemisphere tend to blow to the left of winds aloft.

==Overview==
{{see also|Deforestation in Ethiopia|List of power stations in Ethiopia}}
The following table provides some of the most relevant energy sector numbers for Ethiopia, a [[developing country]]. The ''primary energy sector'' is by far the most important one in Ethiopia, with mainly wood used for cooking. That together with the [[population growth]] in Ethiopia results in issues like [[deforestation]].  Ethiopia aims at [[economic development]] and removal of [[poverty]] and to replace the use of wood by alternatives. This makes the ''secondary energy sector'' (with ''electricity'') most relevant for these efforts. Almost all recent developments are taking place in the secondary energy sector, with the construction of mainly [[hydropower plant]]s and [[power transmission line]]s being most visible.

All imported primary energy sources are ''natural asphalt''. That material is exclusively used for roads construction but is not used to produce primary energy ([[heat]]/[[enthalpy]]). 
[[File:Woman Carrying Bundle of Wood, Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|Wood collection for cooking]]
Therefore, Ethiopia produces its primary energy exclusively from inland resources. These inland resources are almost entirely traditional renewables from biomass and biofuels (like wood) and wastes.&lt;ref name=IEA_all /&gt; A common type of renewable biofuel is wood for heating or cooking in households, a type of resource, that is increasingly overused and overconsumed due to the Ethiopian population growth. Current natural reproduction of wood does not cover the annual use of 37 million tonnes of wood, 50% of the Ethiopian wood reserves of 1,120 million tonnes are exploited.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minister" /&gt; Consequently, deforestation is a common problem in Ethiopia with all of its negative implications. Due to the population growth, energy demand is increasing, which is increasingly (due to the stressed primary energy sources) covered by secondary energy imports, see the table.

Nevertheless, the use of primary energy is also increasing. In part this is due to a more efficient use of agricultural wastes. Ethiopia has agricultural wastes "reserves" of 38 million tonnes per annum, but in 2011 only 6 million tonnes of them were used.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minister" /&gt; This changes now. Such wastes can be used in households or in industrial processes, for example in thermal processing.

Beyond the renewables, Ethiopia also has resources of non-renewable primary energies (oil, natural gas, coal, ...), but it does not exploit them. It also does not export them.

=== Energy reserves ===
==== Solid and liquid fuels ====
Ethiopia currently relies much on its reserves of wood for energy generation, see the table. Ethiopia in 2013 had 1,120 million tonnes of exploitable wood reserves.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt;

Ethiopia also has liquid and solid [[hydrocarbon]] reserves ([[fossil fuel]]s): [[oil]] by 253 million tonnes of [[oil shale]]s and more than 300 million tonnes of [[coal]].&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; There are no plans in Ethiopia to exploit them and to use them for energy generation. The last time there were plans, in 2006, a 100&amp;nbsp;MW [[coal power plant]] (the Yayu coal power plant) with a nearby [[coal mine]] was under consideration. Due to severe environmental concerns all plans were stopped and cancelled in September 2006. The expected environmental destruction was considered to be way too severe.&lt;ref name="nazret" /&gt;

==== Natural gas ====
{{further|Ogaden Basin}}
[[Natural gas]] makes up the most exploitable form of hydrocarbon reserves: a total of {{convert|4.1|Tcuft|m3}} of natural gas reserves were found in two gas field in Ethiopia's [[Ogaden basin]], the [[Calub]] and [[Hilala, Ethiopia|Hilala]] gas fields. All the gas will be exported to [[China]], production wells are under construction in 2017. The two gas fields should be in production by 2019. Initial plans are to pump out 4 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ogaden" /&gt;

=== Transport of primary energy sources ===
==== Road transport ====
The currently used biomass / biofuels for primary energy production in most cases do not need to be transported over more than local distances. This can be done by simple roads. The reason is simple: Ethiopia was (and still is to some extent) a [[subsistence economy]], where the vast majority of goods is produced and consumed locally within a few kilometers around the home of people.

==== Pipelines ====
A pipeline will be built to transport natural gas from the Calub and Hilala gas fields to a [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG terminal]] in the [[Port of Djibouti]]. This pipeline will be around 800&amp;nbsp;km in length and should be in operation by 2020. It will be a pipeline for 4 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year.&lt;ref name="ogaden" /&gt; There are also low-priority plans to connect the triangle Kenya, [[South Sudan]] and Ethiopia through crude oil pipelines as part of the Kenyan [[LAPSSET]]-corridor.

== Secondary energy sector ==
=== Overview ===
Secondary energy is produced by the consumption of ''secondary energy sources'', more often called ''[[energy carrier]]s''. It is official policy worldwide and also in Ethiopia to replace primary energy through secondary energy and energy carriers are the vehicles to store this secondary energy. By doing so, the need to use primary energy for energy production in daily life will be replaced by the need to use energy carriers for energy production. This will relieve some pressure from the sources of primary energy in Ethiopia (wood, forests) and will also prevent the country from using its own domestic and non-renewable primary energy such as [[coal]] and [[oil shale]]s.

Energy carriers are obtained through a man-made conversion process from primary energy sources. Most suitable for the production of energy carriers are abundant and renewable primary energy sources (like sun, water, wind, etc.) while the use of precious and limited non-renewable sources like oil is usually avoided as much as possible. A direct use of such abundant renewable primary energy sources (sun, water, etc...) is often not possible in technical processes, so it is more feasible to produce energy carriers to store and to transport energy that can later be consumed as ''secondary energy''.

The three main energy carriers in Ethiopia are [[refined oil products]] (diesel, gasoline, kerosene), [[electricity]] (from solar radiation, water, wind, heat) and [[bioethanol]] (from [[sugarcane]]). Bioethanol wasn't produced in substantial quantities until very recently, it makes up 0.4&amp;nbsp;TWh annually (2017). Electricity is about to replace diesel as the main energy carrier in Ethiopia – but taken all refined oil products altogether (38.5&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2014), electricity (22.5&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2016) will still take a few years before it will surpass oil products as main energy carrier. Both the amount of imported refined oil products and the produced electricity are increasing – but the growth rate for electricity is much higher than that for refined oil products. See the table. For a developing country it is usually the other way round.

=== Refined oil products ===
[[Diesel fuel]] is the main refined oil product in Ethiopia. It has a share of 20.1&amp;nbsp;TWh on the total of 37.3&amp;nbsp;TWh for refeined oil products. Diesel is used for thermal powerplants (oil powerplant) and for private and public diesel generators in parts of the country, where electrical power from the national grid is an issue. Diesel fuel is the main fuel for trucking. As Ethiopia is leaving the state of a subsistence economy, the demand for the transportation of goods is quickly increasing. In 2017, there is no operational railway in Ethiopia, so the transportation of goods needs trucks and roads. Gasoline, to be used in cars, is only 13% (2.7&amp;nbsp;TWh) of the value for diesel.&lt;ref name=IEA_all /&gt;

More important than gasoline but not as important as diesel is kerosene with 8.8&amp;nbsp;TWh.&lt;ref name=IEA_all /&gt; 3.1&amp;nbsp;TWh of kerosene is used for lighting, as electricity is not everywhere in Ethiopia. The remaining 5.7&amp;nbsp;TWh of kerosene is used for jet flights by [[Ethiopian Airlines]], the state carrier of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=IEA_all /&gt; Ethiopian Airlines is maybe the most successful [[state owned enterprise]] in Ethiopia, the largest and most successful [[airline]] [[Africa]]s and also the airline with the largest [[cargo]] fleet in Africa in 2017. It is the cargo, that is of particular interest for Ethiopia. In recent years, [[floral industry|flowers]] and [[horticulture]] products – which require air transport – quickly became one of the main export products of Ethiopia, to Europe and to China in particular.&lt;ref name="flowers" /&gt;

=== Bioethanol ===
{{see also|Project Gaia}}
{{see also|Ethanol fuel energy balance}}
Bioethanol is produced in currently ~6 sugar factories in Ethiopia (planned are 12 with bioethanol production facilities in 2020), where [[sugarcane]] is converted into [[sugar]] and the remaining sugar [[molasses]] into [[bioethanol]]. The [[ethanol fuel energy balance]] from sugarcane molasses can be considered to be favorable.In addition, by using the output from existing [[co-generation]] modules as part of the sugar production processes in Ethiopia, the bioethanol production does not require extra energy, which makes the bioethanol production even more favorable.&lt;ref name="sugar" /&gt;

In 2017, the annual bioethanol production capacity was at 103,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Together with planned capacities, the total production capacity in 2020 would amount to almost 300,000m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per annum.&lt;ref name="sugar" /&gt; Compared to the [[Ethanol fuel by country|bioethanol world production]] in 2016, the existing bioethanol production makes up only 0.1% of the worldwide bioethanol production. For a poor and developing country like Ethiopia this is still a significant and valuable amount. Ethiopia itself uses its bioethanol to blend gasoline (ethanol is much cheaper than gasoline) and for cooking stoves. The produced amount of bioethanol is considered as energy carrier worth 400&amp;nbsp;GWh of secondary energy per annum. This is sufficient to blend all the imported motor gasoline to become [[gasohol|gasohol/E10]], which is mandatory in Ethiopia.

After blending the gasoline, around 60–70&amp;nbsp;% of the ethanol is left over, this fuel goes into modern [[cook stove]]s as is provided to Ethiopia through [[Project Gaia]]. These cook stoves are burning fuel more efficiently, do not require wood as fuel and are thought to help protecting the forests of Ethiopia and to prevent deforestation.

=== Electricity ===
{{see also|Renewable energy in Ethiopia}}

==== Electricity production potential ====
The country focuses on the production of electricity from a mix of cheap and clean renewable primary energy sources like [[hydropower]] or [[wind power]]. Ethiopia has a total identified economically feasible potential of 45&amp;nbsp;GW of hydropower and 1,350&amp;nbsp;GW of wind power.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; The identified economically feasible potential from [[photovoltaics]] amounts to 5.2&amp;nbsp;GW while that from geothermal energies amounts to ~7&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="pvm1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; Ethiopia plans to exploit these resources.

For a moderate average [[capacity factor]] of 0.4, that would mean a total electricity production potential of around 4,900&amp;nbsp;TWh, ~9 times the total primary energy the country did consume in 2014. As is obvious from such numbers, the country could replace most of its primary energy use through the use of electricity. More than that, the country could become a major exporter of electricity. It is an expressed wish of the Ethiopian government to become a world class exporter of large amounts of clean, cheap renewable energies in the future. However, going from 1% in 2010 to 4% in 2016 to 100% or even 900% in the (far) future is a long way to go.

In 2014, the country had an annual electricity production of 9,5&amp;nbsp;TWh. With this, Ethiopia was at position 101 and with an installed electricity generation capacity of 2.4&amp;nbsp;GW at the position 104 worldwide according to the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; In July 2017, the so-called ''nameplate''power capacity, the overall installed power capacity, was up to 4,267.5&amp;nbsp;MW. 97.4% of that were from renewable primary energies like water and wind, with electricity from hydropower plants dominating with 89.7% and wind power with 7.6%. The completion of Gilgel Gibe III in 2015/16 added another 1870&amp;nbsp;MW capacity to the country's power production, more than doubling the country's production capacity from the year before.

In 2010, electricity production made up only ~1&amp;nbsp;% of Ethiopia's primary energy. Between 2010 and 2016, the production of electricity went up from around ~5&amp;nbsp;TWh to around ~22&amp;nbsp;TWh (around  4% of the primary energy value). This was due to an ambitious program to build [[wind farm]]s and [[hydropower plant]]s to produce electricity.&lt;ref name="gtp2" /&gt; By looking at the table above, the annual production of energy carriers (electricity) within Ethiopia is growing faster than the growing need for primary energy. But the need for primary energy is still increasing in Ethiopia, even on a ''per person'' base. So, while energy carriers are increasingly produced, the general ''availability'' of them is not given to an extent that would allow the reduction of the use of primary energy. Also, imports of refined oil products are increasing, which cannot be avoided for a developing country (the transport of goods becomes much more important than for a subsistence economy).

Transport of electricity is done through electricity containers, such as [[power transmission line]]s and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Especially the availability of a network of power transmission lines, a [[power grid]], defines the amount of availability of electricity as the major source for secondary energy. Of course also in the case of Ethiopia. This is given through the degree of [[electrification]]. A higher electrification means an increasing demand for electricity.

In Ethiopia, the total demand for electrical power is increasing by ~30&amp;nbsp;% annually.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt; There is a race between available power generation capacities and the electrification and availability of electricity. In 2016 and 2017, while plenty of electricity was available through the addition of the new [[Gilgel Gibe III]] powerplant to the national power grid, [[electrical substation|substations]] and power transmission lines were running out of capacity, with frequent outages and shortages which resulted in a wave of additions of substations and power transmission lines.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="offthegrid" /&gt;

==== Electricity generation ====
{{main listing|List of power stations in Ethiopia}}
{{see also|Cost of electricity by source}}
In contrast to the primary energy sector, many sources of energy for the secondary energy sector are present both as renewable energies and in an abundant form. In total, Ethiopia has very good conditions for generating electricity through [[hydropower]], [[wind power]] and [[geothermal power]], all of them characterized by a very low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emission. The [[levelized cost]] of electricity generation in recent years became somewhat favorable for these clean ways to generate electricity.

Constructing power stations is of high priority in Ethiopian politics. The country is permanently increasing its number of power stations with an increasing amount of power stations in operation and under construction. The amount of power stations in planning stage is even larger. Ethiopia fully focuses on renewable energies, mainly from hydropower and wind power, to increase its installed electricity production capacity.

===== Hydropower =====
{{see also|Dams and reservoirs in Ethiopia}}
{{see also|Water politics in the Nile Basin}}
[[File:ET Bahir Dar asv2018-02 img14 Tis Issat.jpg|thumb|Hydroelectric power plant near the [[Blue Nile Falls]]]]
The levelized cost of electricity is often considered to be lowest for hydropower if compared to other possible types of electricity generation. In addition, hydropower is by far the most favorable way of producing electricity when looking at the [[energy returned on energy invested]]. This makes hydropower a favorable source of energy.

On the other hand, side, the country is often affected by droughts. Hydropower projects (dams) help setting up irrigation projects in certain parts of Ethiopia while buffering the impact of droughts. It is official policy to fully utilize hydropower in Ethiopia in combination with irrigation, so the double-positive effect of getting both cheap energy and sufficient water explains the focus on hydropower projects.

Ethiopia in 2013 assumed a total economically feasible potential of 45&amp;nbsp;GW of hydropower.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; For a decent capacity factor of 0.4, one could expect an electrical energy generation of 158&amp;nbsp;TWh per annum in case of full exploitation of the feasible potential, which fits the expected numbers put forward by the Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy.&lt;ref name="minister" /&gt; 8.5% of the 45&amp;nbsp;GW of assumed hydrowoper potential of Ethiopia was exploited in 2017, the additional irrigation area gained through these hydropower installations is unknown outside Ethiopia.

Only 28% of the installed power is located in river basins ([[Atbara]], [[Blue Nile]], [[Sobat River]]) discharging into the [[River Nile]], while the same basins contribute 64% to the economically feasible hydropower potential of 45&amp;nbsp;GB. One of the reasons for this imbalance is [[water politics in the Nile Basin]]. Ethiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[Water politics in the Nile Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt under international law vetoed almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. External financing for hydropower projects in other Ethiopian river basins was easier to get.

One example for this discouraging effect is the ''Chemoga Yeda''-project, that, according to Ethiopian voices, was considered to affect less than 1% of the water system of the Blue Nile. This project in 2011 had secured external financing and was considered ''under construction'' already, when it received an Egyptian veto under international law. The project lost its financing.&lt;ref name="yeda" /&gt; In 2015, another attempt was started to finance the project, the outcome hasn't been reported to the media. In 2011, another project was started in the Blue Nile basin, the [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] (GERD). This project was also vetoed by Egypt, but Ethiopia this time made it a ''National Project'' and started the project without external financing (except from the Ethiopian [[Diaspora]]). GERD will add 6.45&amp;nbsp;GW of installed power but comes without irrigation. Nonetheless, in 2013 Egypt issued harsh statements just short of war threatening, seeing the River Nile as its sole lifeline in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian warning over Ethiopia Nile dam|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22850124|accessdate=16 August 2017|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dam under construction, outside the River Nile basin and not facing vetoes by Egypt, nevertheless saw a lot of criticism, this time from environmentalists. The construction of the large [[Gilgel Gibe III]] hydroelectric project, which after commissioning in 2016 more than doubled Ethiopias installed electricity generation capabilities and is one of the largest hydropower projects in Africa, was feared to reduce the flow of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]]. And so much, that the people along the banks of the Omo River would be heavily affected and [[Lake Turkana]], the terminus of the Omo River and its [[endorheic basin]] would become a saline lake and finally dry up. The risk of earthquakes at the dam site (magnitudes of up to 8) was also highlighted. The dam is fully in operation as of 2017 and it needs to be seen, whether or not the predictions become reality.

===== Wind power =====
The Ethiopian government increasingly focuses on [[wind power]]. In contrast to hydropower projects, which re-allocate water resources to some extent, only locals feel negatively impacted by [[wind farm]]s to some extent. The [[levelized cost]] of electricity from wind power worldwide is falling and is now (2017) roughly that of hydropower. It is expected to fall further due to maturing technologies, increasing wind power popularity and more suitable sites where wind power plants can be installed when compared to hydropower. By taking these developments into account, the Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy revised its numbers on an economically feasible wind power potential within only a few years from 10&amp;nbsp;GW to 1,350&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minister" /&gt;

Wind power is ideally suited to complement hydro power. Oversimplified is wind power available in Ethiopia in times of water shortages, while abundant water is present when no wind is blowing. During the Ethiopian dry seasons, steady [[trade winds]] are blowing all over the country while it is dry. During the summer wet season, the wet [[monsoon]] dominates in Western Ethiopia with plenty of water available, while winds are rather weak over most of Ethiopia.

Almost 80% of the identified favorable sites for wind power development are within the [[Somali Region]] of Ethiopia, most of it which would require long transmission lines to the Ethiopian cities. The remaining ~300&amp;nbsp;GW  are more evenly distributed across Ethiopia (1,000&amp;nbsp;TWh per annum for a capacity factor of 0.4). This potential is still much bigger than that from hydropower.

===== Solar Energy =====
Predicted by [[Swanson's law]], the levelized costs for photovoltaics have plunged to levels just above that of hydropower and wind power. For a country aiming at a most efficient economic development like Ethiopia, photovoltaics might become a ''big thing'' in the next few years. Ethiopia reportedly aims to diversify its electricity generation capabilities by investing into an ''energy mix'', of which photovoltaics will be a part.&lt;ref name="pvm1" /&gt;

Some decent conditions to use solar energy ([[photovoltaics]]) can also be expected in Ethiopia, in particular in [[Tigray Region]] and on the eastern and western rims of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] (roughly 2% of Ethiopia's area) have an annual solar irradiation of 2,200 kWh/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;•a) or more, with around 20% cell efficiency this results in a solar energy generation potential of ~0.45 TWh/(km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;•a).&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; A solar-cell-covered area of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (around 0,1&amp;nbsp;% of Ethiopia's area) could generate 450&amp;nbsp;TWh annually. In 2017, it was reported, that Ethiopia now seeks the installation of 5.2&amp;nbsp;GW from photovoltaic power stations.&lt;ref name="pvm1" /&gt; With a solar cell efficiency of 20%, an annual power generation of 9.1&amp;nbsp;TWh might be expected from the sum of all proposed photovoltaics power stations. Until 2020, 300&amp;nbsp;MW of photovoltaic installations should be developed. Explicitly mentioned was the 100&amp;nbsp;MW ''Metehara PV power station'', which was tendered in 2017.&lt;ref name="pvm2" /&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] doesn't play any role in Ethiopias energy mix considerations. The expected levelized costs of solar thermal installations is quite high. A possible exception is to make use of [[co-generation]], like for example, the use of [[solar pond]] technologies for salt ponds at sites like [[Dallol (woreda)|Dallol]], where in 2017 a [[potash]] project is under development.

===== Geothermal energy =====
Possibly exploitable are around 1,000–7,000&amp;nbsp;GW from [[geothermal energy]], as the [[East African Rift]] runs through Ethiopia with a number of hot spots for energy generation from geothermal energy.&lt;ref name="eep3adama2gd3" /&gt; It is planned to develop 570&amp;nbsp;MW of geothermal energy at two different sites within the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="pvm2" /&gt; Given a capacity factor of 0.8 that would make 4&amp;nbsp;TWh annually.

In exploiting geothermal energies, Ethiopia is piloting a way, that was previously unknown to this country in the energy sector (which is otherwise entirely owned by the state): [[foreign direct investments]] with a full private ownership of powerplants for 25 years with a [[power purchase agreement]] in place with a guaranteed price of US ¢7.53/kWh for the enterprise developing the [[Corbetti]] thermal site. This site alone is expected to generate 500&amp;nbsp;MW of the planned 570&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="royaltys" /&gt;

===== Co-generation =====
By using [[co-generation]], up to ten sugar plants with attached thermal power plants are planned or under construction in 2017, using [[bagasse]] as fuel. Expected is an installed capacity of between 200–300&amp;nbsp;MW. Two thirds would be used for [[sugar]] production while the remaining third could be delivered to the national grid. If one assumes a decent capacity factor of 0.8 (typical value for thermal power plants), there might be indeed some excess electricity added to the national grid. The generated energy will not add much to the national grid but it will prevent the sugar factories from becoming net consumers of electricity.

===== Other thermal power stations =====
Besides the co-generation facilities, a single [[waste-to-energy]] project (renewable energy) is running in Ethiopia. Also a number of diesel power plants exist (non-renewable fuel) to make electric power available, when no generation capacities from renewable and abundant energy sources are available for some reason.

=== Transport of energy carriers ===
Electricity, refined oil products and bioethanol transport and distribution.

==== Power transmission lines and electrification ====
In communities without power and without power transmission lines there is no electrification? In Ethiopia that is not entirely true. The Ethiopian government bought around 40,000 [[Home Solar Systems]] (SHS) and some larger ''Institutional Solar Systems'' in China starting around 2014 with a battery storage and a maximum output power of about 50&amp;nbsp;W per panel under optimum solar irradiation conditions. These systems were distributed to remote rural communities to power school rooms, offices of authorities and households. The SHS operate at a rated voltage of 12&amp;nbsp;V [[direct current|DC]], with a rated current of up to 5&amp;nbsp;A. [[LED lamp]]s for lighting come with the SHS. The SHS can provide power for low power DC appliances such as lights, radios for about three to five hours a day. Until 2020, around 150.000 SHS should be bought.&lt;ref name="shs"/&gt;

This distribution of SHS was deemed necessary, as only 56% of Ethiopias population had access to the electric grid in 2017. Most of the 35% rural population of Ethiopia is not connected to the grid. Also affected by off-grid conditions in 2017 is a substantial part of the urban population.&lt;ref name="pvm2"/&gt;

That does not necessarily mean, that the urban population with nominal access to the electric grid was better off. Due to a quickly increasing demand of electric power of ~30&amp;nbsp;% per annum it came to a lot of power outages in 2016 and 2017, there was a lack of grid stability.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt; In particular most the existing [[electrical substation|substations]] were running above their nominal capacity, while the capacity of standard voltage transmission lines (the last mile) was exceeded, too. Urban households were experiencing frequent outages lasting over days.&lt;ref name="offthegrid" /&gt; Companies on the other hand were affected by energy rationing. To work around these outages, shortages and the rationing, some companies started to build their own substations to become independent from the public ones after which they enjoyed a more stable access to the grid with a higher allowed energy consumption.&lt;ref name="steelbrothers" /&gt; As a consequence of the shortages, Ethiopia in 2017 and 2018 invested a lot in new substations and standard voltage transmission lines with the promise, that at least the main urban centers and industrial parks would see a more stable electricity supply in 2018.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt;

The least concern is given for the backbone of the electric grid. Ethiopia steadily invests in high voltage transmission lines (130&amp;nbsp;kV ac, 230&amp;nbsp;kV ac; 400&amp;nbsp;kV ac). For large energy exports to the wider [[East Africa]]n area, Ethiopia and Kenya are now building a 500&amp;nbsp;kV [[high-voltage direct current|HVDC]] line over 1045&amp;nbsp;km length, that is expected to carry 2&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="500kV" /&gt; In the long term, Ethiopia eyes HVDC lines to Egypt and to Europe.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt;

==== Roads and rail ====
There is a strongly growing need for refined oil imports (diesel, gasoline and kerosene) to the Ethiopian metropolitan areas (''SE imports'', see the table above). This demand was covered in 2016 and 2017 by ~500 tank trucks daily leaving the Port of Djibouti towards Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="hoap" /&gt; Plans to substitute the truck transport by 110 tank waggons on the newly built [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]] didn't arrive in reality in 2017. Also transported by road is bioethanol. The bioethanol production plants have road access but are usually located in remote areas so that tank trucks need to be used.

==== Pipelines ====
A multi-fuel pipeline is ccurrently (2017) being built until 2019 over 500–600&amp;nbsp;km from Djibouti to Central Ethiopia ([[Awash, Ethiopia|Awash]]), where a storage facility exists. This multi-fuel ''Horn of Africa Pipeline'' (HOAP) will transport all sorts of refined oil products.&lt;ref name="hoap" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10706">South Korea is a major energy importer, importing nearly all of its oil needs and the second-largest importer of [[liquefied natural gas]] in the world.
Electricity generation in the country mainly comes from conventional thermal power, which accounts for more than two thirds of production, and from [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea, South|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=KS|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy producers were dominated by government enterprises, although privately operated coal mines and oil refineries also existed. The [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] enacted a broad electricity sector restructuring program in 2000, but the restructuring process was halted amid political controversy in 2004 and remains a topic of intense political debate.&lt;ref name=Pittman&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Direction for South Korean Electricity Policy?|url=http://www.keei.re.kr/keei/download/keer/KEER14_1301_60.pdf|publisher=Korean Energy Economic Review 13 (2014) 145-178|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea has no proven oil reserves.&lt;ref name=eia /&gt; Exploration until the 1980s in the Yellow Sea and on the continental shelf between Korea and Japan did not find any offshore oil. Coal supply in the country is insufficient and of low quality. The potential for hydroelectric power is limited because of high seasonal variations in the weather and the concentration of most of the rainfall in the summer. As of 2017, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has vowed to end the country’s reliance on coal and also said the nation would move away from nuclear energy. He has taken a major step in that direction in June, saying his country would not try to extend the life of its nuclear plants, would close existing coal-fired plants, and would not build any new coal plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/south-korean-president-details-phase-out-of-coal-nuclear-power/|title=South Korean President Details Phase-out of Coal, Nuclear Power|date=1 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric power ==
===History===
The [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (KEPCO) provided electricity in the country. When KEPCO's predecessor, KECO, was founded in 1961, annual power production was 1,770 GWh. Production reached 73,992 GWh in 1987. In that year, residential customers used 17.9% of total production, public and service businesses used 16.2%, and the industrial sector used 65.9%. Sources of power generation were primarily nuclear power, coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas. Of the 54,885 GWh of electricity generated in 1985, 22% came from nuclear plants then in operation, 74% from non-nuclear thermal plants (oil and coal), and 4% from hydroelectric sites. It was predicted in 1988 that the generation structure by the year 2000 would be 10.2% hydroelectric, 12.2% oil, 22.9% coal, 10.2% LNG, and 44.5% nuclear.

'''Energy security '''is the association between [[national security]] and the availability of [[natural resource]]s for [[energy consumption]]. Access to (relatively) cheap [[energy]] has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of [[energy supplies]] among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. International energy relations have contributed to the globalization of the world leading to energy security and energy vulnerability at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2016) ‘Energy: The Missing Link in Globalization’, Energy Research and Social Science, 14, pp. 122–130. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296486356&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of energy security, security of energy supply is an issue of utmost importance. Moreover, it is time to define "a global energy policy model, which not only aims at ensuring an efficient environmental protection but also at ensuring security of energy supply".&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol. 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renewable energy|Renewable]] resources and significant opportunities for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ETP2012SUM.pdf |title=Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 |author= International Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
The modern world relies on a vast energy supply to fuel everything from transportation to communication, to security and health delivery systems. Perhaps most alarmingly, [[peak oil]] expert [[Michael Ruppert]] has claimed that for every [[calorie]] of food produced in the industrial world, ten calories of oil and gas energy are invested in the forms of fertilizer, pesticide, packaging, transportation, and running farm equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvd7WHQZ78|title=Collapse|people=[[Michael Ruppert]]|year=2009|quote=There are ten calories of hydrocarbon energy in every calorie of food consumed in the industrialized world.|time=27:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy plays an important role in the national security of any given country as a fuel to power the economic engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=/published/emeraldfulltextarticle/pdf/3280010106.pdf |title=Emerald: Article Request - Sino-Indian cooperation in the search for overseas petroleum resources: Prospects and implications for India |publisher=Emeraldinsight.com |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sectors rely on energy more heavily than others; for example, the Department of Defense relies on petroleum for approximately 77% of its energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parthemore|first=C.|title=Fueling the Force: Preparing the Department of Defense for a Post-Petroleum Era|publisher=Center for  New American Security|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to '''energy security''' include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, terrorism, and reliance on foreign countries for oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.aspi.org.au/publications/power-plays-energy-and-australias-security|title = Power plays: Energy and Australia's security|publisher = Aspi.org.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign oil supplies are vulnerable to unnatural disruptions from in-state conflict, exporters' interests, and non-state actors targeting the supply and transportation of oil resources. The political and economic instability caused by war or other factors such as [[strike action]] can also prevent the proper functioning of the energy industry in a supplier country. For example, the nationalization of oil in Venezuela has triggered strikes and protests in which Venezuela's oil production rates have yet to recover.&lt;ref name="Global Issues"&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Issues|year=2009|publisher=CQ Researchers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exporters may have political or economic incentive to limit their foreign sales or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Since Venezuela's nationalization of oil, anti-American [[Hugo Chávez]] threatened to cut off supplies to the United States more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Issues|year=2009|publisher=CQ Researcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1973 oil embargo against the United States is a historical example in which oil supplies were cut off to the United States due to U.S. support of Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. This has been done to apply pressure during economic negotiations—such as during the [[2007 Russia–Belarus energy dispute]]. Terrorist attacks targeting oil facilities, pipelines, tankers, refineries, and oil fields are so common they are referred to as "industry risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luft|first=G|author2=Korin, A.|title=Terrors Next Target|journal=Journal of International Security Affairs|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure for producing the resource is extremely vulnerable to sabotage.&lt;ref name="Global Issues"/&gt;  One of the worst risks to oil transportation is the exposure of the five ocean chokepoints, like the Iranian-controlled [[Strait of Hormuz]]. [[Anthony Cordesman]], a scholar at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], warns, "It may take only one asymmetric or conventional attack on a [[Ghawar]] Saudi oil field or tankers in the Strait of Hormuz to throw the market into a spiral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cordesman|first=A.|title=Global Oil Security|journal=Center for Strategic and International Studies|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New threats to energy security have emerged in the form of the increased world competition for energy resources due to the increased pace of [[industrialization]] in  countries such as [[India]] and [[China]], as well as due to the increasing consequences of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still a minority concern, the possibility of price rises resulting from the [[Hubbert peak theory|peaking of world oil production]] is also starting to attract the attention of at least the [[France|French]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter |first=Adam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077802.stm |title='Peak oil' enters mainstream debate |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased competition over energy resources may also lead to the formation of security compacts to enable an equitable distribution of oil and gas between major powers. However, this may happen at the expense of less developed economies. The [[Group of Five]], precursors to the [[G8]], first met in 1975 to coordinate economic and energy policies in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab oil embargo]], a rise in [[inflation]] and a global economic slowdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maavak.net/maavak/maavak070.html Panoptic World: "Globocops of Energy Security"] Mathew Maavak, originally published in The Korea Herald on July 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[2008 Bucharest summit|NATO leaders meeting in Bucharest Romania, in April 2008]], may discuss the possibility of using the military alliance "as an instrument of energy security". One of the possibilities include placing troops in the [[Caucasus]] region to police oil and gas pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/10/eu.climatechange "Climate change may spark conflict with Russia, EU told"] Guardian, March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|12|13}}

==Long-term security==
Long-term measures to increase energy security center on reducing [[energy dependence|dependence]] on any one source of imported energy, increasing the number of suppliers, exploiting native [[fossil fuel]] or [[renewable energy]] resources, and reducing overall demand through [[energy conservation]] measures. It can also involve entering into international agreements to underpin international energy trading relationships, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] in Europe.  All the concern coming from security threats on oil sources long term security measures will help reduce the future cost of importing and exporting fuel into and out of countries without having to worry about harm coming to the goods being transported.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The impact of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the emergence of the [[OPEC]] [[cartel]] was a particular milestone that prompted some countries to increase their energy security. Japan, almost totally dependent on imported oil, steadily introduced  the use of [[natural gas]], [[nuclear power]], high-speed [[mass transit]] systems, and implemented [[energy conservation]] measures.&lt;ref name="bennett2000"&gt;[http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=226465 Oil Crisis, US Senator Bob Bennett, September 27, 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131235718/http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=226465 |date=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] began exploiting [[North Sea oil]] and gas reserves, and became a net exporter of energy into the 2000s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In other countries energy security has historically been a lower priority. The [[United States]], for example, has continued to increase its dependency on imported oil&lt;ref name="bennett2000" /&gt; although, following the [[oil price increases since 2003]], the development of [[biofuels]] has been suggested as a means of addressing this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/15/news/companies/bush_biofuel.reut/index.htm CNN: Oil majors question Bush biofuel plan, February 15, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222090947/http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/15/news/companies/bush_biofuel.reut/index.htm |date=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing energy security is also one of the reasons behind a block on the development of natural gas imports in Sweden. Greater investment in native renewable energy technologies and energy conservation is envisaged instead. [[Energy policy of India|India]] is carrying out a major hunt for domestic oil to decrease its dependency on [[OPEC]], while [[renewable energy in Iceland|Iceland]] is well advanced in its plans to become [[energy independence|energy independent]] by 2050 through deploying 100% renewable energy.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Short-term security==

===Petroleum===
Petroleum, otherwise known as "crude oil", has become the resource most used by countries all around the world including Russia, China (actually, China is mostly [[energy dependence|dependent]] on [[coal]] (70.5% in 2010)) and the United States of America.  With all the oil wells located around the world energy security has become a main issue to ensure the safety of the petroleum that is being harvested.  In the middle east oil fields become main targets for sabotage because of how heavily countries rely on oil. Many countries hold [[global strategic petroleum reserves|strategic petroleum reserves]] as a buffer against the [[economy|economic]] and political impacts of an [[energy crisis]]. All 28 members of the [[International Energy Agency]] hold a minimum of 90 days of their oil imports, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2002/beijing/KUOLT2.PDF|title=IEA - 404 Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Margaret Baker |url=http://www.agiweb.org/gap/legis106/reauthspr.html |title=Reauthorization of the Energy Policy &amp; Conservation Act |publisher=Agiweb.org |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of such reserves was demonstrated by the relative lack of disruption caused by the 2007 [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]], when [[Russia]] indirectly cut exports to several countries in the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Due to the theories in [[peak oil]] and need to curb demand, the [[United States Military Academy|United States military]] and [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] had made significant cuts, and have been making a number of attempts to come up with more efficient ways to use oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=183:energy-security-as-national-security-defining-problems-ahead-of-solutions1&amp;catid=92:issuecontent&amp;Itemid=341|title= Energy Security as National Security: Defining Problems Ahead of Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
Compared to [[petroleum]], reliance on imported [[natural gas]] creates significant short-term vulnerabilities. The gas conflicts between Ukraine and Russia of 2006 and 2009 serve as vivid examples of this.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orttung and Indra Overland (2011) ‘A limited toolbox: Explaining the constraints on Russia’s foreign energy policy’, ''Journal of Eurasian Studies'', Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 74-85.[https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F251718767&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C964ee38a95a940ba9ce908d563e4aacd%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636524756123561129&amp;sdata=v7td7TNaWIPBMyQYrcJiQExfW6Gm%2BpdxkDzm8uIephM%3D&amp;reserved=0 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251718767]&lt;/ref&gt; Many European countries saw an immediate drop in supply when Russian gas supplies were halted during the [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Natural gas has been a viable source of energy in the world.  Consisting of mostly [[methane]], natural gas is produced using two methods: biogenic and thermogenic.  Biogenic gas comes from [[methanogen]]ic organisms located in marshes and landfills, whereas thermogenic gas comes from the [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] [[decomposition|decay]] of [[organic matter]] deep under the Earth's surface. Russia is the current leading country in production of natural gas.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

One of the biggest problems currently facing natural gas providers is the ability to store and transport it. With its low density, it is difficult to build enough pipelines in North America{{clarify|date=January 2013}} to transport sufficient natural gas to match demand. These pipelines are reaching near capacity and even at full capacity do not produce the amount of gas needed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Nuclear power===
[[Image:2007 EU Uranium sources.png|thumb|300px|Sources of uranium delivered to EU utilities in 2007, from the [http://ec.europa.eu/euratom/ar/last.pdf 2007 Annual report] of the [[Euratom]] Supply Agency]] Uranium for [[nuclear power]] is [[Uranium mining|mined]] and [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] in diverse and "stable" countries. These include Canada (23% of the world's total in 2007), Australia (21%), Kazakhstan (16%) and more than 10 other countries. Uranium is mined and fuel is manufactured significantly in advance of need.  Nuclear fuel is considered by some to be a relatively reliable power source, being more common in the Earth's crust than tin, mercury or silver, though a debate over the timing of [[peak uranium]] does exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cameco.com/uranium_101/|title= Cameco Uranium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power reduces [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aXb5iuqdZoD4&amp;refer=us U.S. Energy Legislation May Be 'Renaissance' for Nuclear Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182130/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103 |date=2009-06-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a very viable resource, nuclear power can be a controversial solution because of the risks associated with it.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7388/full/483123a.html Lessons of a Triple Disaster; Nature 483, 123 (08 March 2012) doi:10.1038/483123a].&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the debate with nuclear power is that many people or companies simply do not want any nuclear energy plant or radioactive waste near them.

Currently, nuclear power provides 13% of the world's total electricity.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable use of nuclear power within the United States is in U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and submarines, which have been exclusively nuclear-powered for several decades. These classes of ship provide the core of the Navy's power, and as such are the single most noteworthy application of nuclear power in that country.

===Renewable energy===
{{Main|Energy security and renewable technology}}
The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. For those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a significant energy security issue, renewable technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power as well as displacing electricity demand through direct heat production. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]].&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf |title=Contribution of renewables to Energy Security |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the resources that have been so crucial to survival in the world to this day start declining in numbers, countries will begin to realize that the need for renewable fuel sources will be as vital as ever. With the production of new types of energy, including solar, geothermal, hydro-electric, biofuel, and wind power. With the amount of solar energy that hits the world in one hour there is enough energy to power the world for one year.  With the addition of solar panels all around the world a little less pressure is taken off the need to produce more oil.

Geothermal can potentially lead to other sources of fuel, if companies would take the heat from the inner core of the earth to heat up water sources we could essentially use the steam creating from the heated water to power machines, this option is one of the cleanest and efficient options.  Hydro-electric which has been incorporated into many of the dams around the world, produces a lot of energy, and is very easy to produce the energy as the dams control the water that is allowed through seams which power turbines located inside of the dam.  [[Biofuels]] have been researched using many different sources including ethanol and algae, these options are substantially cleaner than the consumption of petroleum. "Most life cycle analysis results for perennial and ligno-cellulosic crops conclude that biofuels can supplement anthropogenic energy demands and mitigate [[GHG emissions|green house gas emissions]] to the atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Sarah|title=Life-cycle analysis and the ecology of biofuels|url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/delucia/Publications/Davis%20LCA%20TiPS.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Cell Press|date=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625170748/http://www.life.illinois.edu/delucia/Publications/Davis%20LCA%20TiPS.pdf|archivedate=25 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Using oil to fuel transportation is a major source of green house gases, any one of [[Cubic mile of oil#Replacement of oil by alternative sources|these developments]] could replace the energy we derive from oil. Traditional fossil fuel exporters (e.g. Russia) struggle to diversify away from oil and develop renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, ''International Journal of Environmental Studies'', Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.

==Biography==
Erma Johnson graduated from [[Vassar College]], where she participated in [[track and field]] as a [[long jump]]er. She married the wealthy financier Bradley Fisk, lived in [[Buffalo, New York]], and became the mother of three children. When Bradley Fisk was United States Assistant Secretary of Commerce from 1957 to 1961 in the Eisenhower administration, Erma J. Fisk was a hostess in Washington D.C. She was widowed at age 55. She then became a full-time field naturalist and assisted ornithologists in various parts of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

{{blockquote|... Mrs. Fisk, at 73, lived alone for five months in a tiny cabin in the foothills of Arizona's [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness|Baboquivari Peak]], recording and banding birds for [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name=LuckiestWidow&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Cantwell, Mary|authorlink=Mary Cantwell|title=Luckiest Widow in the West|date=18 September 1983|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/books/luckiest-widow-in-the-west.html}} (book review of ''The Peacocks of Baboquivari''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the age of 75, she began writing books and soon became a literary celebrity.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; She traveled the lecture circuit in her [[Volkswagen Golf|VW Rabbit]] to visit colleges and signings at bookstores and women's clubs.&lt;ref name=CapeCodJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of ''Cape Cod Journal'' by Erma J. Fisk|date=27 August 1990|website=Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/erma-j-fisk-2/a-cape-cod-journal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Fisks first visited [[Guana Island]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] and had a cottage built there. In 1952, Jonnie Fisk started sending ornithological reports from Guana Island to the ornithologist [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lazell, James|title=Island: Fact and Theory in Nature|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aaOGjO63UgC&amp;pg=PA208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
The three children of Bradley and Erma Fisk were Bradley Jr. (1927–1997), Irving Lester (1928–1984), and Amanda (born 1936). The poet and radio personality [[Molly Fisk]] is a granddaughter of Erma J. Fisk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">'''''European Union and its Member States — Certain Measures Relating to the Energy Sector''''', '''DS476''', is the formal name of a case brought by the [[Russian Federation]] against the [[European Union]] and its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]] in the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Dispute Settlement Body]].&lt;ref name="DS476"&gt;[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds476_e.htm Dispute settlement: Dispute DS 476], World Trade Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was formally initiated with the filing of a complaint by Russia (in WTO terms, a "request for consultations") on April 30, 2014.  The dispute concerns the EU's [[Third Energy Package]], which consists of various two [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]].&lt;ref name="DS476"/&gt;

Russia claims that the measures within the package violate Articles II, VI, XVI and XVII of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS); Articles I, III, X and XI of the 1994 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT); Article 3 of the [[Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures]] (SCM); and Article 2 of the [[Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures]] (TRIM).&lt;ref name="DS476"/&gt;
     
== History of the dispute and background==
The [[European Commission]] adopted the Third Energy Package, which came into effect in 2009.&lt;ref name="ICTSD"&gt;[http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/biores/news/russia-turns-to-wto-over-eu-energy-package-0 Russia turns to WTO over EU energy package], [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]] (May 13, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The measures aimed to promoted a more competitive European Union-wide market in the energy sector.&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt; One provision in the package prohibits energy suppliers from also owning [[Energy distribution|distribution networks]], including [[pipeline transport|pipelines]].&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt;

The new rules were opposed by Russia and its [[state-owned enterprise]] [[Gazprom]], which supplies more than 25% of Europe's gas by transnational pipelines, and is the sole supplier of case for several EU member states, mostly [[Eastern Europe]]an nations that were formerly part of the [[Soviet bloc]].&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt; Russia considered filing a challenge to the Third Energy Package as early as November 2011.&lt;ref name="Bryanski"&gt;Gleb Bryanski, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/16/russia-wto-energy-idUSL5E7MF3ZE20111116 Russia may contest EU energy rules in WTO - source], Reuters, November 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The filing of the complaint in 2014 is viewed as part of a wider decline in [[Russia–European Union relations|relations between Russia and the EU]], occurring simultaneously with tensions over the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian occupation of Crimea]] and other [[Ukrainian crisis|Russian involvement in Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt;  Russia previously filed an [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] complaint against the EU in the WTO, while the EU filed a complaint against Russia in the WTO over its ban on imported [[pork]] products and a separate complaint over Russia's "recycling fee" for vehicles, which the EU argues is a [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policy that favors Russia, [[Belarus]], and [[Kazakhstan]], the three members of the Russian-led [[Eurasian Customs Union]],.&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt;

At an April 2014 meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, for example, Angelos Pangratis, the EU ambassador to the WTO, stated: "The overall experience with Russia as WTO member is, to our regrets, rather disappointing. Russia has not shown willingness to put its trade measures in line with basic WTO obligations and has continued raising a number of trade obstacles inconsistent with its WTO obligations."&lt;ref name="ICTSD"/&gt;

Other closely related processes shown are [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[groundwater recharge]].]]

'''Evapotranspiration''' ('''ET''') is the [[Summation|sum]] of [[evaporation]] and [[plant]] [[transpiration]] from the Earth's land and ocean surface to the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. Evaporation accounts for the movement of water to the air from sources such as the [[soil]], [[canopy interception]], and [[waterbody|waterbodies]]. Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a [[plant]] and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through [[stomata]] in its [[leaf|leaves]]. Evapotranspiration is an important part of the [[water cycle]].  An element (such as a tree) that contributes to evapotranspiration can be called an '''evapotranspirator'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2000/0031.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625034354/http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2000/0031.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Potential evaporation|'''Potential evapotranspiration''' ('''PET''')]] is a representation of the environmental demand for evapotranspiration and represents the evapotranspiration rate of a short green crop (grass), completely shading the ground, of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile. It is a reflection of the [[energy]] available to evaporate water, and of the [[wind]] available to transport the [[water vapour]] from the ground up into the lower atmosphere. Often a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated at a nearby climatic station on a reference surface, conventionally short grass. This value is called the reference evapotranspiration (ET&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Actual evapotranspiration is said to equal potential evapotranspiration when there is ample water.  Some US states utilize a full cover alfalfa reference crop that is 0.5 m in height, rather than the short green grass reference, due to the higher value of ET from the alfalfa reference.&lt;ref name="extension.uidaho.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.uidaho.edu/kimberly/files/2013/02/ascestzdetmain2005.pdf|title=Kimberly Research and Extension Center|author=|date=|website=extension.uidaho.edu|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080954/http://extension.uidaho.edu/kimberly/files/2013/02/ascestzdetmain2005.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water cycle ==
[[File:Stormwater Management with trees.webm|thumb|437x437px]]
Evapotranspiration is a significant water loss from [[drainage basin]]s. Types of vegetation and land use significantly affect evapotranspiration, and therefore the amount of water leaving a drainage basin. Because water transpired through leaves comes from the roots, plants with deep reaching roots can more constantly transpire water. [[Herbaceous plant]]s generally transpire less than [[woody plant]]s because they usually have less extensive foliage. [[Conifer]] forests tend to have higher rates of evapotranspiration than [[deciduous]] forests, particularly in the dormant and early spring seasons. This is primarily due to the enhanced amount of precipitation intercepted and evaporated by conifer foliage during these periods.&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W., and Douglass, J. 1974, ''Science.'' 185(4154) 857-859&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that affect evapotranspiration include the plant's growth stage or level of maturity, percentage of soil cover, [[solar radiation]], [[humidity]], [[temperature]], and [[wind]].  Isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of evapotranspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasechko |first1=Scott |last2=Sharp |first2=Zachary D. |last3=Gibson |first3=John J. |last4=Birks |first4=S. Jean |last5=Yi |first5=Yi |last6=Fawcett |first6=Peter J. |title=Terrestrial water fluxes dominated by transpiration |journal=Nature |date=3 April 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature11983 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11983.html |accessdate=4 April 2013 |pmid=23552893 |volume=496 |issue=7445 |pages=347–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through evapotranspiration, forests reduce water yield, except in unique ecosystems called [[cloud forest]]s. Trees in cloud forests collect the liquid water in fog or low clouds onto their surface, which drips down to the ground. These trees still contribute to evapotranspiration, but often collect more water than they evaporate or transpire.

In areas that are not irrigated, actual evapotranspiration is usually no greater than [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], with some buffer in time depending on the soil's ability to hold water. It will usually be less because some water will be lost due to [[percolation]] or surface runoff. An exception is areas with high [[water table]]s, where [[capillary action]] can cause water from the groundwater to rise through the soil matrix to the surface. If potential evapotranspiration is greater than the actual precipitation, then soil will dry out, unless [[irrigation]] is used.

Evapotranspiration can never be greater than [[#Potential evapotranspiration|PET]], but can be lower if there is not enough water to be evaporated or plants are unable to transpire readily.

==Estimating evapotranspiration==
Evapotranspiration can be measured or estimated using several methods.

===Indirect methods===
[[Pan evaporation]] data can be used to estimate lake evaporation, but transpiration and evaporation of intercepted rain on vegetation are unknown. There are three general approaches to estimate evapotranspiration indirectly.

====Catchment water balance====
Evapotranspiration may be estimated by creating an equation of the water balance of a drainage basin. The equation balances the change in water stored within the basin (''S'') with inputs and outgoes:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = P - ET - Q - D \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The input is precipitation (''P'') and the outgoes are evapotranspiration (which is to be estimated), streamflow (''Q''), and [[groundwater recharge]] (''D''). If the change in storage, precipitation, streamflow, and groundwater recharge are all estimated, the missing flux, ET, can be estimated by rearranging the above equation as follows:

&lt;math&gt;ET = P -\Delta S - Q - D \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Energy balance====
A third methodology to estimate the actual evapotranspiration is the use of the energy balance.

&lt;math&gt; \lambda E = R_n - G - H \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where λE is the energy needed to change the phase of water from liquid to gas, R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the net radiation, G is the soil heat flux and H is the [[sensible heat flux]]. Using instruments like a [[scintillometer]], soil heat flux plates or radiation meters, the components of the energy balance can be calculated and the energy available for actual evapotranspiration can be solved.

The [[SEBAL]] and [[METRIC]] algorithms solve the energy balance at the earth's surface using satellite imagery. This allows for both actual and potential evapotranspiration to be calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Evapotranspiration is a key indicator for water management and irrigation performance. SEBAL and METRIC can map these key indicators in time and space, for days, weeks or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.waterwatch.nl/tools0/sebal.html|title=   SEBAL_ WaterWatch|deadurl=   no|archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20110713133722/http://www.waterwatch.nl/tools0/sebal.html|archivedate=   2011-07-13|df=   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental methods for measuring evapotranspiration===
One method for measuring evapotranspiration is with a weighing [[lysimeter]].  The weight of a soil column is measured continuously and the change in storage of water in the soil is modeled by the change in weight.  The change in weight is converted to units of length using the surface area of the weighing lysimeter and the unit weight of water.  evapotranspiration is computed as the change in weight plus rainfall minus percolation.

====Remote sensing====
In recent decades, estimating evapotranspiration has been improved by advances in remote sensing, particularly in agricultural studies. However, quantifying evapotranspiration from mixed vegetation environs, particularly urban parklands, is still challenging because of the heterogeneity of plant species, canopy covers and microclimates and because the methodology is costly.  Different remote sensing-based approaches for estimating evapotranspiration have various advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Nouri2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nouri|first1=Hamideh|last2=Beecham|first2=Simon|last3=Anderson|first3=Sharoyn|last4=Hassanli|first4=Morad|last5=Kazemi|first5=Fatemeh|title=Remote sensing techniques for predicting evapotranspiration from mixed vegetated surfaces|journal=Urban Water J.|date=13 May 2014|doi=10.1080/1573062X.2014.900092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eddy covariance====
{{main|Eddy covariance}}
The most direct method of measuring evapotranspiration is with the [[eddy covariance]] technique in which fast fluctuations of vertical wind speed are correlated with fast fluctuations in atmospheric water [[vapor density]]. This directly estimates the transfer of water vapor (evapotranspiration) from the land (or canopy) surface to the atmosphere.

===Hydrometeorological equations===
The most general and widely used equation for calculating reference ET is the [[Penman equation]]. The [[Penman-Monteith]] variation is recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.htm|title=Crop Evapotranspiration: Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements|last=Allen|first=R.G.|author2=Pereira, L.S.|author3=Raes, D.|author4=Smith, M.|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=1998|isbn=92-5-104219-5|series=FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56|location=Rome, Italy|accessdate=2011-06-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515113038/http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.HTM|archivedate=2011-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name="RojasSheffield2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rojas |first1=Jose P. |last2=Sheffield |first2=Ronald E. |title=Evaluation of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration Methods as Compared with the ASCE-EWRI Penman-Monteith Equation Using Limited Weather Data in Northeast Louisiana |journal=Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering |volume=139 |issue=4 |year=2013 |pages=285–292 |issn=0733-9437 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simpler [[Blaney-Criddle equation]] was popular in the Western [[United States]] for many years but it is not as accurate in regions with higher humidities.  Other solutions  used includes Makkink, which is simple but must be calibrated to a specific location, and [http://bioma.jrc.ec.europa.eu/components/componentstools/evapotranspiration/help/Hargreaves.html Hargreaves]. To convert the reference evapotranspiration to actual crop evapotranspiration, a [[crop coefficient]] and a [[stress coefficient]] must be used.  Crop [[coefficient]]s as used in many hydrological models usually change along the year to accommodate to the fact that crops are seasonal and, in general, plants behave differently along the seasons: perennial plants mature over multiple seasons, and stress responses can significantly depend upon many aspects of plant condition.

===Urban landscape plants===

Methods for measuring evapotranspiration can be adapted to an urban setting to estimate the water requirements of urban landscape vegetation.&lt;ref name=Nouri&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nouri|first1=Hamideh|last2=Beecham|first2=Simon|last3=Kazemi|first3=Fatemeh|last4=Hassanli|first4=Ali Morad|title=A review of ET measurement techniques for estimating the water requirements of urban landscape vegetation|journal=Urban Water J.|date=2013|volume=10|issue=4|pages=247–259|doi=10.1080/1573062X.2012.726360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evapotranspiration of Urban Vegetation====
The water &lt;big&gt;requirement&lt;/big&gt; of urban landscapes, particularly urban parklands, is of growing concern. The estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and subsequently plant water requirements in urban vegetation needs to consider the heterogeneity of plants, soils, water, and climate characteristics. In a research in South Australia, two practical ET estimation approaches are compared to a detailed Soil Water Balance (SWB) analysis over a one-year period. One approach is the Water Use Classification of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS) method, which is based on expert opinion on the water needs of different classes of landscape plants. The other is a remote sensing approach based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. Both methods require knowledge of reference ET calculated from meteorological data. More information is available in:

==Potential evapotranspiration==
[[File:Potential evapotranspiration Hawaii.gif|thumb|350px|Monthly estimated potential evapotranspiration and measured pan evaporation for two locations in [[Hawaii]], Hilo and Pahala.]]
{{main|Potential evaporation}}
Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired by a specific crop or ecosystem if there were sufficient [[water]] available. This demand incorporates the energy available for evaporation and the ability of the lower atmosphere to transport evaporated moisture away from the land surface. Potential evapotranspiration is higher in the summer, on less cloudy days, and closer to the equator, because of the higher levels of solar radiation that provides the energy for evaporation. Potential evapotranspiration is also higher on windy days because the evaporated moisture can be quickly moved from the ground or plant surface, allowing more evaporation to fill its place.

Potential evapotranspiration is expressed in terms of a depth of water, and can be graphed during the year (see figure).

Potential evapotranspiration is usually measured indirectly, from other climatic factors, but also depends on the surface type, such as free water (for [[lake]]s and [[ocean]]s), the [[soil]] type for bare soil, and the [[vegetation]].  Often a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated at a nearby climate station on a reference surface, conventionally short grass.  This value is called the reference evapotranspiration, and can be converted to a potential evapotranspiration by multiplying with a surface coefficient.  In agriculture, this is called a crop coefficient.  The difference between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is used in [[irrigation scheduling]].

Average annual potential evapotranspiration is often compared to average annual precipitation, P. The ratio of the two, P/PET, is the [[aridity index]].

A '''fog bow''', sometimes called a '''white rainbow''',&lt;ref name="BBC 22 November 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38063662?SThisFB|title= Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor| author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 22 November 2016|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC| accessdate= 22 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a similar phenomenon to a [[rainbow]]; however, as its name suggests, it appears as a bow in [[fog]] rather than [[rain]].&lt;ref name="Met Office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/rainbows/fogbow|title= What is a fogbow?|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= metoffice.gov.uk/ |publisher= [[Met Office]]| accessdate= 22 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the very small size of water droplets that cause fog—smaller than {{convert|0.05|mm|in|sp=us}}—the fog bow has only very weak colors, with a red outer edge and bluish inner edge.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, when the droplets are very small, fog bows appear white, and are therefore sometimes called ''white rainbows''. This lack of color is the feature of a fog bow that distinguishes it from a [[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], which has multiple pale-colored rings caused by diffraction. When droplets forming it are almost all of the same size, the fog bow can have multiple inner rings, or supernumeraries, which are more strongly colored than the main bow.  According to [[NASA]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fogbow's lack of colors is caused by the smaller water drops&amp;nbsp;... so small that the [[wavelength]] of light becomes important. Diffraction smears out colors that would be created by larger rainbow water drops&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061115.html APOD: 2006 November 15 - A Fog Bow Over California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A fog bow seen in clouds, typically from an aircraft looking downwards, is called a ''cloud bow''. Mariners sometimes call fog bows ''sea-dogs''.

==Direction==
A fog bow is seen in the same direction as a rainbow, thus the sun would be behind the head of the observer and the direction of view would be into a bank of fog (which may not be noticeable in directions away from the bow itself). Its outer radius is slightly less than that of a rainbow.

When a fog bow appears at night it is called a ''lunar fog bow''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogmoon.htm Lunar Fogbow]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foliar feeding''' is a technique of feeding plants by applying liquid [[fertilizer]] directly to their [[leaf|leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/foliar.html#intro Foliar Fertilization] By George Kuepper, NCAT Agriculture Specialist, Published 2003, [http://attra.ncat.org/who.html ATTRA] Publication #CT135&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are able to absorb essential elements through their leaves.&lt;ref&gt; N. K. Fageria, M.P. Barbosa Filho, A. Moreira &amp; C. M. Guimarães  Foliar Fertilization of Crop Plants. In ''Journal of Plant Nutrition'' Volume 32, Issue 6, May 2009, pages 1044-1064  Published online: 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption takes place through their [[stomata]] and also through their [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]].  Transport is usually faster through the stomata, but total absorption may be as great through the epidermis.  Plants are also able to absorb nutrients through their bark.

Foliar feeding was earlier thought to damage [[tomato]]es, but has become standard practice.

== Ocean-based sources ==

{{Ref improve section|date=December 2015|talk=y}}
A popular version of the feeding is to use sea-based plant mixes, especially [[kelp]], which contains many of the fifty "trace [[nutrient]]s"; the more such nutrients are needed, the harder it is to balance them within the soil. Kelp also contains some [[hormone]]s considered good for the development of the plants' leaves, flowers and fruit, of interest to [[organic gardener]]s who reject artificial hormone applications.

== Effectiveness ==

H.B. Tukey was head of [[Michigan State University]] (MSU) Department of [[Horticulture]] in the 1950s. Working with S. H. Wittwer, they proved conclusively that foliar feeding is effective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.13essentials.com/what-is-foliar-feeding/|title=What is Foliar Feeding and Why You Should be Doing It?|date=July 2018|publisher=13 Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Radioactive [[phosphorus]] and [[potassium]] were applied to foliage.&lt;ref&gt;Tukey, H.B., Ticknor, R.L., Hinsvark, O.N and Wittwer, S.H. (1952). ''Science'', 116: 167–167.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Geiger counter]] was used to observe absorption, movement and nutrient utilization. The nutrients were transported at the rate of about one foot per hour to all parts of the plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dramm.com/media/fish/Foliar%20Feeding%20Reprint.pdf|title=Foliar Feeding Of Nutrients|author=Charlie O'Dell|date=March 2004|journal=American Vegetable Grower|publisher=Dramm Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229101927/http://www.dramm.com/media/fish/Foliar%20Feeding%20Reprint.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spray enhancer can help nutrients stick to the leaf and then penetrate the leaves' [[cuticle]]. 

Foliar application has been shown to avoid the problem of leaching-out in soils and prompts a quick reaction in the plant. Foliar application of phosphorus, zinc and iron brings the greatest benefit in comparison with addition to soil where phosphorus becomes fixed in a form inaccessible to the plant&lt;ref&gt;Ejaz Ahmad Waraich, Zahoor Ahmad, Rashid Ahmad, Saifullah &amp; M. Y. Ashraf (2015) 'Foliar Applied Phosphorus Enhanced Growth, Chlorophyll Contents, Gas Exchange Attributes and PUE in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)'. In ''Journal of Plant Nutrition'' Volume 38, Issue 12, October 2015, pages 1929-1943  Published online: 29 Jun 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and where zinc and iron are less available.

== Usage ==

Foliar feeding is generally done in the early morning or late evening, preferably at temperatures below 24°C (75°F), since heat causes the pores on some species' leaves to close.

The '''Garden of Eden''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] גַּן עֵדֶן, ''Gan ʿEḏen''), also called '''Paradise''', is the biblical "garden of God" described in the [[Book of Genesis]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]..&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Metzger|first1= Bruce Manning|last2= Coogan|first2= Michael D|title= The Oxford Guide To People And Places Of The Bible|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=amlXOOaSuLMC|accessdate= 22 December 2012|year= 2004|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-517610-0|page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2011|pp= 228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 13:10 refers to the "garden of God",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Genesis+13|title=oremus Bible Browser : Genesis 13|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "trees of the garden" are mentioned in Ezekiel 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Zechariah]] and the [[Book of Psalms]] also refer to trees and water without explicitly mentioning Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tigchelaar|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''edinnu'', from a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word ''[[Edin (Sumerian term)|edin]]'' meaning "plain" or "steppe", closely related to an [[Aramaic]] root word meaning "fruitful, well-watered".&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"/&gt; Another interpretation associates the name with a Hebrew word for "pleasure"; thus the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] in Genesis 2:8 has the wording
"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure" rather than "a garden in Eden". The Hebrew term is translated "pleasure" in Sarah's secret saying in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|18:9-15|HE|Genesis 18:12|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/strongs/H5731 H5731 Eden]  – The same as H5730 (masculine); Eden= "pleasure" ... the first habitat of man after the creation; site unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Genesis flood narrative]], the [[Genesis creation narrative]] and the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], the story of Eden echoes the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian myth]] of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the [[Tree of Life]].{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p= 33}} The [[Hebrew Bible]] depicts [[Adam and Eve]] as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Miller (2007) ''Miller 3-in-1: Blue Like Jazz, Through Painted Deserts, Searching for God'', Thomas Nelson Inc, {{ISBN|978-1418551179}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tfHksenSLIEC&amp;pg=PT207#v=onepage&amp;q=naked%20%22garden%20of%20eden%22%20nudity&amp;f=false PT207]&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis as the source of four tributaries. The Garden of Eden is considered to be [[Mythology|mythological]] by most scholars.&lt;ref name=loc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc2/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc5/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc4/&gt; Among those that consider it to have been real, there have been various suggestions for its location:&lt;ref name="wilensky2012"/&gt; at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]], in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers run into the sea;&lt;ref name=loc7/&gt; and in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name=loc8/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc10/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc11/&gt;

===Genesis===
{{main article|Genesis creation narrative|Adam and Eve}}

The second part of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]&lt;!--do not remove the word narrative, click the link and read why it is called this--&gt;, {{bibleverse|Genesis|2:4-3:24|HE}}, opens with [[YHWH]]-[[Elohim]] (translated here "the {{LORD}} God", see [[Names of God in Judaism]]) creating the first man ([[Adam]]), whom he placed in a garden that he planted "eastward in Eden".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levenson|2004|p=13}} "The root of Eden denotes fertility. Where the wondrously fertile gard was thought to have been located (if a realistic location was ever conceived) is unclear. The Tigris and Euphrates are the two great rivers of the Mesopotamia (now found in modern Iraq). But the Piston is unidentified, and the only Gihon in the Bible is a spring in Jerusalem (1 Kings 1.33, 38)."&lt;/ref&gt; "And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Last of all, the God made a woman ([[Eve]]) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In chapter three, the man and the woman were seduced by the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] into eating the [[forbidden fruit]], and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], and thus living forever. [[Cherub]]im were placed east of the garden, "and a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life" ({{bibleverse|Genesis|3:24}}).

{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:10–14|HE}} lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: [[Pishon]], [[Gihon]], Chidekel (the [[Tigris]]), and Phirat (the [[Euphrates]]). It also refers to the land of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]]—translated/interpreted as [[Ethiopia]], but thought by some to equate to ''Cossaea'', a Greek name for the land of the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=me8sAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Cossaea  |title=The Jewish Quarterly Review|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |publication-date=1973 |volume=64-65 |page=132 |issn=1553-0604 |accessdate=2014-02-19 |quote=...as Cossaea, the country of the Kassites in Mesopotamia [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lands lie north of [[Elam]], immediately to the east of ancient Babylon, which, unlike Ethiopia, does lie within the region being described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Speiser|1994|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', the first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identifies the Pishon as what "the Greeks called [[Ganges]]" and the Geon (Gehon) as the [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews''. Book I, Chapter 1, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lars-Ivar Ringbom the ''paradisus terrestris'' is located in [[Shiz]] in northeastern [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Ivar Ringbom, ''Paradisus Terrestris. Myt, Bild Och Verklighet'', Helsingfors, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezekiel===
{{main article|Ezekiel's cherub in Eden}}

In {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|28:12–19|HE}} the prophet [[Ezekiel]] the "son of man"&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; sets down God's word against the king of Tyre: the king was the "seal of perfection",&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation,&lt;!-- v.13 --&gt; placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub.&lt;!-- v.14 --&gt; But the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: "All those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more." (v.19).

According to Terje Stordalen, the Eden in Ezekiel appears to be located in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stordalen|2000|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are connections between paradise, the garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swarup|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] and [[Peter Kyle McCarter]] have suggested that the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)]], the oldest [[Sumer]]ian version of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon ranges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis, chapter 2, verses 10–14:

{{quote|And a river departed from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four tributaries.
The name of the first is Pishon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Havilah where there is gold.
And the gold of this land is good; there are [[bdellium]] and cornelian stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Cush.
And the name of the third is Chidekel, which is that which goes to the east of Ashur; and the fourth river is Phirat.|sign=|source=}}

==Parallel concepts==
* [[Dilmun]] in the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] story of ''Enki and Ninhursag'' is a paradisaical abode{{sfn|Mathews|1996|pp=96}} of the immortals, where sickness and death were unknown.{{sfn|Cohen|2011|pp=229}}
* The [[Hesperides|garden of the Hesperides]] in [[Greek mythology]] was somewhat similar to the Christian concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association was made in the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting (''see illustration at top''). In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.
* The Persian term "[[paradise]]" (borrowed as {{lang-he|פרדס}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The word "''pardes''" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: "Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: "I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: "And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city." In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means "orchard" or "park", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] "paradise" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] "paradise" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.

==Other views==
===Jewish eschatology===
In the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&amp;letter=E Gan Eden] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called "Garden in Eden". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the "lower Gan Eden". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the "higher Gan Eden". The [[Rabbi|Rabbanim]] differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"/&gt;

According to [[Jewish eschatology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba – The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eshatology"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&amp;letter=E#1239 Eshatology] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the higher Gan Eden is called the "Garden of Righteousness". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are "clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones.&lt;ref name="Eshatology"/&gt; This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms ''[[gehinnom]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish." [http://www.jewfaq.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?Keywords=Gehinnom Gehinnom – Judaism 101] websourced 02-10-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[sheol]]'', figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from [[heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm#Gan |title=Gan Eden and Gehinnom |publisher=Jewfaq.org |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic view===
[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]
The term ''jannāt ʿadni'' ("Gardens of Eden" or "Gardens of Perpetual Residence") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of "the Garden" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''ʿadn'',&lt;ref&gt;See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71–88), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (also known as [[Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]]. It is recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the [[Last Judgement|final judgement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53?lang=eng#53|title=Doctrine and Covenants 107:53|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.1?lang=eng#1|title=Doctrine and Covenants 116:1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/7.13.13-14,22?lang=eng#12|title=Daniel 7:13-14,22|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous early leaders of the Church, including [[Brigham Young]], [[Heber C. Kimball]], and [[George Q. Cannon]], taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby [[Jackson County, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Garden_of_Eden_in_Missouri "Joseph Smith/Garden of Eden in Missouri"], FairMormon Answers&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Van Orden, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/01/i-have-a-question "I Have a Question: What do we know about the location of the Garden of Eden?"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1994, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-101#C18|title=What is Mormonism?

==Art==
The Garden of Eden motifs most frequently portrayed in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings are the "Sleep of Adam" ("Creation of Eve"), the "Temptation of Eve" by the Serpent, the "[[Fall of Man]]" where Adam takes the fruit, and the "Expulsion". The idyll of "Naming Day in Eden" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. In ''[[Divine Comedy|the Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the Garden at the top of [[Purgatory|Mt. Purgatory]]. For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human [[love]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], often associated with the classic and medieval [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[locus amoenus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtius|1953|p=200, n.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in [[Byzantine style]] in [[Ravenna]], while the city was still under Byzantine control. A preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of Eden.

In France, a '''gourmette''' is a [[jewellery chain]] in the form of a [[Braid|plait]], of which the plaits have rough and smooth sides. On the smooth side, at the front, the wearer tends to have a small [[badge]] with their [[Christian name]] etched thereon. Usually, it is designed so that the wearer can read the inscription  on the badge.

A gourmette is most often worn so that, if lost or in trouble, others can find the wearer's name and give or summon help. It is usually given on [[baptism]].

It can be made of any material, but traditionally is of [[silver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9968">{{Star formation}}

In [[astronomy]], the '''initial mass function''' ('''IMF''') is an [[empirical]] function that describes the initial [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of masses for a population of stars.  The IMF is an output of the process of [[star formation]].  The IMF is often given as a [[Probability distribution|probability distribution function]] (PDF) for the mass at which a star enters the [[main sequence]] (begins [[nuclear fusion|hydrogen fusion]]).  The distribution function can then be used to construct the [[mass distribution]] (the [[histogram]] of stellar masses) of a population of stars.  It differs from the '''present day mass function''' (PDMF), the current distribution of masses of stars, due to the evolution and death of stars which occurs at different rates for different masses as well as dynamical mixing in some populations.

The properties and evolution of a star are closely related to its mass, so the IMF is an important diagnostic tool for astronomers studying large quantities of stars.  For example, the initial mass of a star is the primary factor determining its [[Stellar classification|colour]], [[luminosity]], and lifetime.  At low masses, the IMF sets the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] mass budget and the number of substellar objects that form.  At intermediate masses, the IMF controls chemical enrichment of the [[interstellar medium]].  At high masses, the IMF sets the number of core collapse [[supernovae]] that occur and therefore the kinetic energy feedback.

The IMF is relatively invariant from one group of stars to another, though some observations suggest that the IMF is different in different environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2012ApJ...760...71C | title=The Stellar Initial Mass Function in Early-type Galaxies From Absorption Line Spectroscopy.

==Form of the IMF==
[[File:Plot of various initial mass functions.svg|thumbnail|Initial mass function]]

The IMF is often stated in terms of a series of [[power law]]s, where &lt;math&gt;N(m) \mathrm{d}m&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes also represented as &lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m&lt;/math&gt;), the number of stars with masses in the range &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m + \mathrm{d}m
&lt;/math&gt; within a specified volume of space, is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless exponent. The IMF can be inferred from the present day stellar [[luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] by using the stellar  [[mass-luminosity relation]] together with a model of  how the star formation rate varies with time. Commonly used forms of the IMF are the Kroupa (2001) [[broken power law]]&lt;ref name="Kroupa01"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Pavel | last = Kroupa | title = On the variation of the initial mass function | journal = MNRAS | volume = 322 | issue = 2 | pages =  231–246 | date = 2001 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04022.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0009005 |bibcode = 2001MNRAS.322..231K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chabrier (2003) log-normal.&lt;ref name="Chabrier03"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gilles | last = Chabrier | title = Galactic stellar and substellar initial mass function | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume = 115 | issue = 809 | pages = 763–795 | date = 2003 | doi=10.1086/376392|arxiv = astro-ph/0304382 |bibcode = 2003PASP..115..763C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salpeter (1955) ===
The IMF of stars more massive than our sun was first quantified by [[Edwin Salpeter]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  first = Edwin | last = Salpeter | title = The luminosity function and stellar evolution | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 121 | pages = 161 | date = 1955 | doi=10.1086/145971|bibcode = 1955ApJ...121..161S }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work favoured an exponent of &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2.35&lt;/math&gt;. This form of the IMF is called the '''Salpeter function''' or a Salpeter IMF. It shows that the number of stars in each mass range decreases rapidly with increasing mass.  The Salpeter Initial Mass Function is 
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= \xi_{0}\left(\frac{m}{M_\odot}\right)^{-2.35}\left(\frac{\Delta m}{M_\odot}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar mass]], and &lt;math&gt;\xi_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant relating to the local stellar density.

=== Miller-Scalo (1979) ===
Later authors extended the work below one [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}). Glenn E. Miller and [[John M. Scalo]] suggested that the IMF "flattened" (approached &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;) below one solar mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Glenn | last2 = Scalo | first2 = John | title = The initial mass function and stellar birthrate in the solar neighborhood | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume = 41 | pages = 513 | date = 1979 | doi=10.1086/190629|bibcode = 1979ApJS...41..513M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kroupa (2001) ===
[[Pavel Kroupa]] kept &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2.3&lt;/math&gt; above half a solar mass, but introduced &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1.3&lt;/math&gt; between {{Solar mass|0.08-0.5|link=y}} and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.3&lt;/math&gt; below {{Solar mass|0.08}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = m^{-\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 0.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m&lt;0.08,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 1.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 0.08&lt;m&lt;0.5,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 2.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m&gt;0.5 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Chabrier (2003) ===
Chabrier 2003 for individual stars:
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= 0.158 (1/(\ln(10) m)) \exp[- (\log(m)-\log(0.08))^2/(2 \times 0.69^2)]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = k m^{-\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &gt; 1, \alpha = 2.3 \pm 0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

Chabrier 2003 for stellar systems (e.g. binaries):
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= 0.086 (1/(\ln(10) m)) \exp[- (\log(m)-\log(0.22))^2/(2 \times 0.57^2)]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = k m^{-\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &gt; 1, \alpha = 2.3 \pm 0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

==Slope==
The initial mass function is typically graphed on a logarithm scale of log(N) vs log(m).  Such plots give approximately straight lines with a slope Γ equal to 1-α.  Hence Γ is often called the slope of the initial mass function.  The present day mass function, for coeval formation, has the same slope except that it rolls off at higher masses which have evolved away from the main sequence.&lt;ref name=massey&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998ASPC..142...17M|title=The Initial Mass Function of Massive Stars in the Local Group|journal=The Stellar Initial Mass Function (38Th Herstmonceux Conference)|volume=142|pages=17|last1=Massey|first1=Philip|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainties ===
There are large uncertainties concerning the [[Brown dwarf|substellar region]]. In particular, the classical assumption of a single IMF covering the whole substellar and stellar mass range is being questioned in favour of a two-component IMF to account for possible different formation modes of substellar objects. I.e. one IMF covering brown dwarfs and very-low-mass stars on the one hand, and another ranging from the higher-mass brown dwarfs to the most massive stars on the other. Note that this leads to an overlap region between about 0.05 and {{Solar mass|0.2}} where both formation modes may account for bodies in this mass range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |arxiv= 1112.3340| last1 = Kroupa | first1 = Pavel | display-authors = etal | booktitle = Stellar Systems and Galactic Structure, Vol. V | title = The stellar and sub-stellar IMF of simple and composite populations | date = 2012|bibcode = 2013pss5.book..115K |doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-5612-0_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4862">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Wyoming''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were two Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No other sites are currently proposed for entry on the list, and one site has been cleaned up and removed from the NPL.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

== Geology and history ==
The [[Iranian plateau]] is subject to most types of [[tectonic]] activity, including active [[Fold (geology)|folding]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. It is well known for its long history of disastrous earthquake activity. Not only have these earthquakes killed thousands, but they have also led to waste of valuable natural resources.&lt;ref name=Iranian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Iranica/June97/Earthquake/Text2.html|title=100 years; 126,000 deaths|author=Manuel Berberian|publisher=The Iranian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1900, at least 126,000 fatalities have resulted from earthquakes in Iran.&lt;ref name=Iranian/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4178">This is an incomplete list of [[forest]]s in [[Ireland]].

Upon the first arrival of humans in Ireland around 12,500 years ago, the entire island was predominantly covered in a blanket of thick woodland. These woodlands consisted largely of [[Oak]] and [[Pine]] forests. However, centuries of heavy [[deforestation]] meant that by the end of the 19th century the area of woodland and forest cover in Ireland was estimated to be approximately 69,000 hectares, or 1% of the national land area. During the first 75 years of the 20th century forestry in Ireland was almost exclusively carried out by the State and by 1985 forest and woodland cover had increased to approximately 420,000 hectares. The mid 1980s saw a significant increase in private forest development, with the introduction of [[European Union|EU]] funded grant schemes aimed at encouraging private land owners, mainly farmers, to become involved in forestry. As a result, the area of national forest estate in Ireland has now increased to approximately 700,000 hectares. Of this, approximately 45% is in private ownership and 55% is in the ownership of [[Coillte]].
It must be remembered that the vast majority of forestry plantings in Ireland are non-native species, chiefly Sitka Spruce with the consequent damage to biodiversity  and the environment.

'''María Lionza''' is the central figure in one of the most widespread indigenous religions in [[Venezuela]]. Her religion is a blend of [[African culture|African]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] beliefs. She is revered as a [[goddess]] of nature, love, peace, and harmony. She has followers in many layers of Venezuelan society from small rural villages to the modern capital of [[Caracas]], where a statue stands in her honor. Both the [[Salsa music|salsa]] singer [[Rubén Blades]] and the [[New Weird America]] musician [[Devendra Banhart]] have composed songs in her honor.

==Biography==
According to the legends, María Lionza was born in 1802 to an Indian chief from the region of [[Yaracuy]]. A statue on the [[Francisco Fajardo Highway]] in Caracas by the Venezuelan sculptor, [[Alejandro Colina]], portrays her as a well-endowed and strong woman, riding a large [[tapir]], and holding a female [[pelvis]], to represent fertility. It is said that she reigned over the savage beasts, and in her throne were indigenous animals like turtles and snakes. She is said to still live on the mountain of [[Sorte]], where her followers come to pay homage to her, calling her their "Queen."  Because of the tradition, the mountain of Sorte was declared a National Park in the 1980s.

The name María Lionza comes from ''Santa María de la Onza'' ("[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] of the Jaguar"), from the full name "Santa María de la Onza Talavera del Prato de Nívar" given by the Catholic Church to Christianize the religion. Eventually the name was contracted to "María Lionza".

==Religion==
[[Image:Lionza.JPG|thumb|190px|Statue in the Francisco Fajardo highway]]
The indigenous religion of María Lionza, similar in most aspects to [[Santería]], lies in the mountain of [[Sorte]], in [[Yaracuy]] state, Venezuela, which is central to the religion. Therein is located the "Altar Mayor" or principal altar. As such, it is the main destination of pilgrimage from elsewhere in Venezuela and a place for people from the Caribbean to come to pay homage to the goddess. Though pilgrims come here all year round, the most important day is October 12. On this day, all the principal [[shaman]]s and priests of María Lionza come together to pay homage to their Queen. Many of them do a tribal show called "Baile de las Brasas", where they do traditional dances, including [[fire walking|dances over coals]].

The myth of Maria Lionza has also influenced popular arts such as Victor Millan ( "La Reina María Lionza", 1965);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vereda.ula.ve/wiki_artevenezolano/index.php/Mill%C3%A1n,_V%C3%ADctor|title=Millán, Víctor - WIKIHISTORIA DEL ARTE VENEZOLANO|website=vereda.ula.ve|language=es|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lately Honys Torres ("Caracas Ciudad Mística", 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/una-muestra-plastica-honys-torres-denuncia-consumismo/|title=El neo pop se instaló en el Museo Alejandro Otero{{!}}Con una muestra plástica Honys Torres denuncia el consumismo|date=2014-10-18|work=Correo del Orinoco|access-date=2017-09-25|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Francisco Rada ("La Corte Bolivariana", 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avn.info.ve/contenido/exposici%C3%B3n-%E2%80%9Cirreverencia-lo-cotidiano%E2%80%9D-abre-sus-puertas-museo-arturo-michelena-caracas|title=http://www.avn.info.ve/sites/default/files/fotografia/201611/museoarturo_michelena1339513321.jpg|website=www.avn.info.ve|language=es|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; among several others.

===The Pantheon===

María Lionza is the highest and most important deity in the pantheon. She is part of a [[trinity]] of saints known as the ''tres potencias'' or "three powers". The other two figures in this trinity are [[Guaicaipuro]], an Indian chief murdered by the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonists, and ''Negro Felipe'', a black slave who was also murdered by the [[colonists]]. 
These three saints are the leading figures of the pantheon and lead several "courts" of lesser deities. These courts are:

* The Indian Court, led by María Lionza and composed of many Venezuelan Indian chiefs.
* The Medical Court, led by [[José Gregorio Hernández]] and composed of many other famous doctors.
* The Court of the Juans made up by a number of figures belonging to [[Venezuelan folklore]].
* The Teachers' Court, led by [[Andrés Bello]] and some other authors.
* The Black and African Court, led by popular black figures of [[History of Venezuela|Venezuelan history]] such as La Negra Matea (who was a slave to the Bolivars and nanny of Simón Bolívar), and El Negro Primero ([[Pedro Camejo]]) who was known as Negro Primero because he was black and also among the first to go into combat.
* The Celestial Court, composed of a number of [[Catholic]] saints.
* The Political Court, which includes [[Simón Bolívar]].
* The Court of Malandros, made up of deceased criminals.
* The Viking Court, with various of the important Viking chiefs.

{{Classical mechanics|expanded=fundamentals}}

'''Mass''' is both a [[physical property|property]] of a [[physical body]] and a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of its [[Inertia|resistance]] to [[acceleration]] (a change in its state of [[motion (physics)|motion]]) when a [[net force]] is applied.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mass&lt;/ref&gt; The object's mass also determines the [[Force|strength]] of its [[gravitation]]al attraction to other bodies. 

The basic [[SI unit]] of mass is the [[kilogram]] (kg). In [[physics]], mass is not the same as [[weight]], even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a [[spring scale]], rather than [[Weighing scale#Balance scales|balance scale]] comparing it directly with known masses. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass. This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.

==Phenomena==
There are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass. Although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be independent of each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/419367/new-quantum-theory-separates-gravitational-and-inertial-mass/ |title=New Quantum Theory Separates Gravitational and Inertial Mass |publisher=MIT Technology Review |date=14 Jun 2010 |accessdate=3 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; current experiments have found no difference in results regardless of how it is measured:
* ''Inertial mass'' measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a force (represented by the relationship {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}}).
* ''Active gravitational mass'' measures the gravitational force exerted by an object.
* ''Passive gravitational mass'' measures the gravitational force exerted on an object in a known gravitational field.

The mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force. The inertia and the inertial mass describe the same properties of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively, by other words, the mass quantitatively describes the inertia.  According to [[Newton's second law of motion]], if a body of fixed mass ''m'' is subjected to a single force ''F'', its acceleration ''a'' is given by ''F''/''m''. A body's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a [[gravitational field]]. If a first body of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is placed at a distance ''r'' (center of mass to center of mass) from a second body of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, each body is subject to an attractive force {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Gm''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {{val|6.67|e=-11|u=N kg&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the "universal [[gravitational constant]]". This is sometimes referred to as gravitational mass.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;When a distinction is necessary, ''M'' is used to denote the active gravitational mass and ''m'' the passive gravitational mass.&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical; since 1915, this observation has been entailed ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' in the [[equivalence principle]] of [[general relativity]].

== Units of mass ==

[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|The kilogram is one of the seven [[SI base units]] and one of three which is defined ''ad hoc'' (i.e. without reference to another base unit).]]

The standard [[International System of Units]] (SI) unit of mass is the [[kilogram]] (kg). The kilogram is 1000&amp;nbsp;grams (g), first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the [[melting point]] of ice. However, because precise measurement of a decimeter of water at the proper temperature and pressure was difficult, in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the [[international prototype kilogram]] of cast iron, and thus became independent of the meter and the properties of water. 

However, the mass of the international prototype and its supposedly identical national copies have been found to be drifting over time. It is expected that the [[Proposed redefinition of SI base units | re-definition of the kilogram and several other units]] will occur on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the [[CGPM]] in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other units are accepted for use in SI:
* the [[tonne]] (t) (or "metric ton") is equal to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.
* the [[Electronvolt (mass)|electronvolt]] (eV) is a unit of [[energy]], but because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]] it can easily be converted to a unit of mass, and is often used like one. In this context, the mass has units of eV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''c'' is the speed of light). The electronvolt and its multiples, such as the MeV (megaelectronvolt), are commonly used in [[particle physics]].
* the [[atomic mass unit]] (u) is 1/12 of the mass of a [[carbon-12]] atom, approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Since the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the number of atoms in 12&amp;nbsp;g of carbon-12, it follows that 1&amp;nbsp;u is exactly 1/(10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/ref&gt; The atomic mass unit is convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules.

Outside the SI system, other units of mass include:
* the [[slug (unit)|slug]] (sl) is an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] of mass (about 14.6&amp;nbsp;kg).
* the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] (lb) is a unit of both mass and force, used mainly in the United States (about 0.45&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.5&amp;nbsp;N). In scientific contexts where [[pound (force)]] and [[pound (mass)]] need to be distinguished, SI units are usually used instead.
* the [[Planck mass]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) is the maximum mass of point particles (about {{val|2.18|e=-8|u=kg}}). It is used in [[particle physics]].
* the [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass}}) is defined as the mass of the [[Sun]]. It is primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or galaxies (≈{{val|1.99|e=30|u=kg}}).
* the mass of a very small particle may be identified by its inverse [[Compton wavelength]] ({{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ {{val|3.52|e=-41|u=kg}}}}).
* the mass of a very large star or [[black hole]] may be identified with its [[Schwarzschild radius]] ({{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;cm ≈ {{val|6.73|e=24|u=kg}}}}).

== Definitions of mass ==
{{Properties of mass}}

In [[physical science]], one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of ''mass'', or seven physical notions that involve the concept of ''mass''.&lt;ref name="Rindler2"&gt;{{cite book |author=W. Rindler |date=2006 |title=Relativity: Special, General, And Cosmological |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MuuaG5HXOGEC&amp;pg=PA16 |pages=16–18 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-856731-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], and in some cases equal, and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass.  There are a number of ways mass can be measured or [[operationalization|operationally defined]]:
* Inertial mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a [[force]] is applied. It is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force. An object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force. One says the body of greater mass has greater [[inertia]].
* Active gravitational mass&lt;ref group=note &gt;The distinction between "active" and "passive" gravitational mass does not exist in the Newtonian view of gravity as found in [[classical mechanics]], and can safely be ignored for many purposes. In most practical applications, Newtonian gravity is assumed because it is usually sufficiently accurate, and is simpler than General Relativity; for example, NASA uses primarily Newtonian gravity to design space missions, although "accuracies are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny relativistic effects".{{URL|http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf3-2.php}} The distinction between "active" and "passive" is very abstract, and applies to post-graduate level applications of General Relativity to certain problems in cosmology, and is otherwise not used. There is, nevertheless, an important conceptual distinction in Newtonian physics between "inertial mass" and "gravitational mass", although these quantities are identical; the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two distinct methods of measurement. It was long considered anomalous that the two distinct measurements of mass (inertial and gravitational) gave an identical result. The property, observed by Galileo, that objects of different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration (ignoring air resistance), shows that inertial and gravitational mass are the same.&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of the strength of an object's [[Gauss' law for gravity|gravitational flux]] (gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface). Gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small "test object" to fall freely and measuring its [[free-fall]] acceleration. For example, an object in free fall near the [[Moon]] is subject to a smaller gravitational field, and hence accelerates more slowly, than the same object would if it were in free fall near the Earth. The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less active gravitational mass.
* Passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's interaction with a [[gravitational field]]. Passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object's weight by its free-fall acceleration. Two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration; however, the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force (less weight) than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass.
* Energy also has mass according to the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including [[pair production]], [[nuclear fusion]], and the gravitational [[gravitational lens|bending of light]]. Pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy, or vice versa. In the gravitational bending of light, photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass.
* Curvature of [[spacetime]] is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass. Such [[curvature]] is extremely weak and difficult to measure.  For this reason, curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Extremely precise [[atomic clocks]] on the surface of the Earth, for example, are found to measure less time (run slower) when compared to similar clocks in space. This difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called [[gravitational time dilation]]. Other forms of curvature have been measured using the [[Gravity Probe B]] satellite.
* Quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object's quantum [[frequency]] and its [[wave number]]. The quantum mass of an electron, the [[Compton wavelength]], can be determined through various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and is closely related to the [[Rydberg constant]], the [[Bohr radius]], and the [[classical electron radius]]. The quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a [[Kibble balance]]. In relativistic quantum mechanics, mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the Poincaré group.

===Weight vs. mass===
{{main article|Mass versus weight}}
In everyday usage, mass and "[[weight]]" are often used interchangeably. For instance, a person's weight may be stated as 75&amp;nbsp;kg. In a constant gravitational field, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts. But because of slight differences in the strength of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]] at different places, the [[Mass versus weight|distinction]] becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent, and for places far from the surface of the Earth, such as in space or on other planets. Conceptually, "mass" (measured in [[kilograms]]) refers to an intrinsic property of an object, whereas "weight" (measured in [[newtons]]) measures an object's resistance to deviating from its natural course of [[free fall]], which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in free fall are [[Weightlessness|weightless]], though they still have mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kane |first=Gordon |title=The Mysteries of Mass |newspaper=Scientific American |location= |pages=32–39 |language= |publisher=Nature America, Inc. |date=September 4, 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysteries-of-mass |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force known as "weight" is proportional to mass and [[acceleration]] in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the [[Earth]] or the [[Moon]]. This force keeps the object from going into free fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall. By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kilograms but weighs only 81.5&amp;nbsp;newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight ''W'' of an object is related to its mass ''m'' by {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}, where {{nowrap|1=''g'' = {{val|fmt=commas|9.80665|u=m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the acceleration due to [[Earth's gravity|Earth's gravitational field]], (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).

For other situations, such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall, which is called the [[proper acceleration]]. Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the like, may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such cases, the generalized equation for weight ''W'' of an object is related to its mass ''m'' by the equation {{nowrap|1=''W'' = –''ma''}}, where ''a'' is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be zero).

===Inertial vs. gravitational mass===
Although inertial mass, passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct, no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them. In [[classical mechanics]], Newton's third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical (or at least proportional), but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass. That it does is merely an empirical fact.

[[Albert Einstein]] developed his [[general theory of relativity]] starting with the assumption of the intentionality of correspondence between inertial and passive gravitational mass, and that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them, in essence the [[equivalence principle]]. 

This particular equivalence often referred to as the "Galilean equivalence principle" or the "[[weak equivalence principle]]" has the most important consequence for freely falling objects. Suppose an object has inertial and gravitational masses ''m'' and ''M'', respectively. If the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field ''g'', the force on the object is:

: &lt;math&gt;F = M g.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this force, the acceleration of the object can be determined by Newton's second law:

: &lt;math&gt;F = m a.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting these together, the gravitational acceleration is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{M}{m}g.&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant ''K'' [[if and only if]] all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field. This phenomenon is referred to as the "universality of free-fall". In addition, the constant ''K'' can be taken as 1 by defining our units appropriately.

The first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were—according to scientific ‘folklore’—conducted by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] obtained by dropping objects from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]. This is most likely apocryphal: he is more likely to have performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless [[inclined plane]]s to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy. Increasingly precise experiments have been performed, such as those performed by [[Loránd Eötvös]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Eötvös |first1=R. V. |last2=Pekár |first2=D. |last3=Fekete |first3=E. |date=1922 |title=''Beiträge zum Gesetz der Proportionalität von Trägheit und Gravität'' |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=68 |pages=11–66 |bibcode=  1922AnP...373...11E|doi=10.1002/andp.19223730903}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[torsion balance]] pendulum, in 1889. {{As of|2008}}, no deviation from universality, and thus from Galilean equivalence, has ever been found, at least to the precision 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. More precise experimental efforts are still being carried out.

The universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force. All other forces, especially [[friction]] and [[air resistance]], must be absent or at least negligible. For example, if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on Earth, the feather will take much longer to reach the ground; the feather is not really in ''free''-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity. On the other hand, if the experiment is performed in a [[vacuum]], in which there is no air resistance, the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other, and of the ground towards both objects, for its own part, is negligible). This can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump. It is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum, as [[David Scott]] did on the surface of the [[Moon]] during [[Apollo 15]].

A stronger version of the equivalence principle, known as the ''Einstein equivalence principle'' or the ''strong equivalence principle'', lies at the heart of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. Einstein's equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time, it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field. Thus, the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object's tendency to move in a straight line (in other words its inertia) and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field.

=== Origin of mass ===
{{main article|Mass generation mechanism}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a [[mass generation mechanism]] is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of [[physics]]. To date, a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views of the origin of mass. The problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the [[gravitational interaction]] but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of [[particle physics]], known as the [[Standard Model]].

== Pre-Newtonian concepts ==
===Weight as an amount===
{{main article|weight}}
[[File:Weighing of the heart3.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of early [[balance scales]] in the [[Papyrus of Hunefer]] (dated to the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], ca. 1285 BC). The scene shows [[Anubis]] weighing the heart of Hunefer.]]
The concept of [[wikt:amount|amount]] is very old and [[Prehistoric numerals|predates recorded history]].  Humans, at some early era, realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was [[Proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to the number of objects in the collection:

: &lt;math&gt;W_n \propto n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the weight of the collection of similar objects and ''n'' is the number of objects in the collection. Proportionality, by definition, implies that two values have a constant [[ratio]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_n}{n} = \frac{W_m}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_n}{W_m} = \frac{n}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;

An early use of this relationship is a [[balance scale]], which balances the force of one object's weight against the force of another object's weight. The two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields.  Hence, if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar.  This allows the scale, by comparing weights, to also compare masses.

Consequently, historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts.  The Romans, for example, used the [[carob]] seed ([[Carat (unit)|carat]] or [[siliqua]]) as a measurement standard.  If an object's weight was equivalent to [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3138.pdf 1728 carob seeds], then the object was said to weigh one Roman pound.  If, on the other hand, the object's weight was equivalent to [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|144 carob seeds]] then the object was said to weigh one Roman ounce (uncia).  The Roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard, the carob seed.  The ratio of a Roman ounce (144 carob seeds) to a Roman pound (1728 carob seeds) was:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{ounce}}{\mathrm{pound}} = \frac{W_{144}}{W_{1728}} = \frac{144}{1728} = \frac{1}{12}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Planetary motion===
{{see also|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
In 1600 AD, [[Johannes Kepler]] sought employment with [[Tycho Brahe]], who had some of the most precise astronomical data available.  Using Brahe's precise observations of the planet Mars, Kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion. In 1609, Johannes Kepler published his three laws of planetary motion, explaining how the planets orbit the Sun. In Kepler's final planetary model, he described planetary orbits as following [[elliptical]] paths with the Sun at a focal point of the ellipse. Kepler discovered that the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[orbital period]] of each planet is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit, or equivalently, that the [[ratio]] of these two values is constant for all planets in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;This constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the Sun's active gravitational mass; it has units of distance cubed per time squared, and is known as the [[standard gravitational parameter]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mu=4\pi^2\frac{\text{distance}^3}{\text{time}^2}\propto\text{gravitational mass}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 1609, [[Galileo Galilei]] demonstrated his first telescope to a group of Venetian merchants, and in early January 1610, Galileo observed four dim objects near Jupiter, which he mistook for stars.  However, after a few days of observation, Galileo realized that these "stars" were in fact orbiting Jupiter.  These four objects (later named the [[Galilean moons]] in honor of their discoverer) were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the Earth or Sun.  Galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months, and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods.

===Galilean free fall===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Galileo Galilei (1636)]]
[[File:Falling ball.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Distance traveled by a freely falling ball is proportional to the square of the elapsed time]]
Sometime prior to 1638, Galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall, attempting to characterize these motions. Galileo was not the first to investigate Earth's gravitational field, nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics.  However, Galileo's reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists. It is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept, or if they were real experiments performed by Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=S. |date=1979 |title=Galileo's Discovery of the Law of Free Fall |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=228 |issue=5 |pages=84–92 |bibcode=1973SciAm.228e..84D |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0573-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling.  A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had dropped [[ball]]s of the same material, but different masses, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed. See {{cite book |last=Drake |first=S. |date=1978 |title=Galileo at Work |pages=19–20 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-16226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this conclusion, Galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument: He asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string, does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive, or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body?  The only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galileo |first=G. |date=1632 |title=[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later experiment was described in Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' published in 1638.  One of Galileo's fictional characters, Salviati, describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp.  The wooden ramp was "12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick" with a straight, smooth, polished [[Groove (engineering)|groove]].  The groove was lined with "[[parchment]], also smooth and polished as possible".  And into this groove was placed "a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball".  The ramp was inclined at various [[angle]]s to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured.  The ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp, and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured.  The time was measured using a water clock described as follows:
:"a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galileo |first1=G. |date=1638 |title=Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, Intorno à Due Nuove Scienze |volume=213 |publisher=[[House of Elzevir|Louis Elsevier]]}}, translated in {{cite book |date=1954 |editor1-last=Crew |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=de Salvio |editor2-first=A. |title=Mathematical Discourses and Demonstrations, Relating to Two New Sciences |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;Itemid=99999999 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=1-275-10057-0}} and also available in {{cite book |editor1-last=Hawking |editor1-first=S. |date=2002 |title=On the Shoulders of Giants |pages=534–535 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |isbn=0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo found that for an object in free fall, the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time:

: &lt;math&gt;{\text{Distance}} \propto {\text{Time}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the Earth’s gravitational field have a constant acceleration, and Galileo’s contemporary, Johannes Kepler, had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the Sun’s gravitational mass.  However, Galileo’s free fall motions and Kepler’s planetary motions remained distinct during Galileo’s lifetime.

[[Robert Hooke]] had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating that all [[celestial bodies]] have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers, and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity. He further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hooke |first=R. |date=1674 |title=An attempt to prove the motion of the earth from observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgtPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In correspondence with [[Isaac Newton]] from 1679 and 1680, Hooke conjectured that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Turnbull |editor-first=H. W. |date=1960 |title=Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Volume 2 (1676–1687) |page=297 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke urged Newton, who was a pioneer in the development of [[calculus]], to work through the mathematical details of Keplerian orbits to determine if Hooke's hypothesis was correct.  Newton's own investigations verified that Hooke was correct, but due to personal differences between the two men, Newton chose not to reveal this to Hooke.  Isaac Newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend, [[Edmond Halley]], that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits, but had misplaced the solution in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hawking |editor-first=S. |date=2005 |title=Principia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlLAG5EUZqQC&amp;pg=PR15 |pages=15''ff'' |publisher=[[Running Press]] |isbn=978-0-7624-2022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being encouraged by Halley, Newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings.  In November 1684, Isaac Newton sent a document to Edmund Halley, now lost but presumed to have been titled ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (Latin for "On the motion of bodies in an orbit").&lt;ref&gt;

Isaac Newton had bridged the gap between Kepler’s gravitational mass and Galileo’s gravitational acceleration, resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=-\mu\frac{\hat{\mathbf{R}}}{|\mathbf{R}|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''g''' is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist, ''μ'' is the gravitational mass ([[standard gravitational parameter]]) of the body causing gravitational fields, and '''R''' is the radial coordinate (the distance between the centers of the two bodies).

By finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field, Newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass.  The mass of the Earth can be determined using Kepler's method (from the orbit of Earth's Moon), or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the Earth's surface, and multiplying that by the square of the Earth's radius.  The mass of the Earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the Sun.  To date, no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cuk |first=M. |date=January 2003 |title=Curious About Astronomy: How do you measure a planet's mass? |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=452 |work=Ask an Astronomer |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030320113723/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=452 |archivedate=20 March 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's cannonball===
[[File:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|A cannon on top of a very high mountain shoots a cannonball horizontally.  If the speed is low, the cannonball quickly falls back to Earth (A,B). At [[orbital speed|intermediate speeds]], it will revolve around Earth along an elliptical orbit (C,D). At [[Escape velocity|a sufficiently high speed]], it will leave the Earth altogether (E).]]
{{main article|Newton's cannonball}}

Newton's cannonball was a [[thought experiment]] used to bridge the gap between Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits.  It appeared in Newton's 1728 book ''A Treatise of the System of the World''.  According to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the Earth.  However, Newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity) it follows a curved path.  "For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground.  And the greater the velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth."&lt;ref name=principia /&gt;{{rp|513}} Newton further reasons that if an object were "projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain" with sufficient velocity, "it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth, and return to the mountain from which it was projected."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Universal gravitational mass===
[[File:Universal gravitational mass.PNG|An apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the Earth; however, the sum total of these many fields produces a single gravitational field directed towards the Earth's center|left|thumb]]
In contrast to earlier theories (e.g. [[celestial spheres]]) which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material, Newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitational mass]]: every object has gravitational mass, and therefore, every object generates a gravitational field.  Newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object. If a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the Earth or Sun, Newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body,&lt;ref name="principia"/&gt;{{rp|397}} and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center.&lt;ref name="principia"/&gt;{{rp|221}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These two properties are very useful, as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, according to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, each carob seed produces a gravitational field.  Therefore, if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere, then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere.  Hence, it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the Earth or Sun.  In fact, by [[unit conversion]] it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass.

[[File:Cavendish Experiment.png|thumb|right|Vertical section drawing of Cavendish's torsion balance instrument including the building in which it was housed. The large balls were hung from a frame so they could be rotated into position next to the small balls by a pulley from outside. Figure 1 of Cavendish's paper.]]

Measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle, but extremely difficult in practice.  According to Newton's theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere.  However, from a practical standpoint, the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure. Newton's books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s, but the first successful measurement of the Earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units, the [[Cavendish experiment]], did not occur until 1797, over a hundred years later. Cavendish found that the Earth's density was 5.448 ± 0.033 times that of water.  As of 2009, the Earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy, whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures.{{clarify|reason="mass in kilograms" does not specify an experimental method. What's the distinction between the methods?|date=January 2014}}

Given two objects A and B, of masses ''M''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, separated by a [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, Newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other, of magnitude
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\text{AB}}=-GM_{\text{A}}M_{\text{B}}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{AB}}}{|\mathbf{R}_{\text{AB}}|^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''G'' is the universal [[gravitational constant]]. The above statement may be reformulated in the following way: if ''g'' is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field, then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass ''M'' is
: &lt;math&gt;F=Mg&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the basis by which masses are determined by [[weighing]]. In simple [[spring scales]], for example, the force ''F'' is proportional to the displacement of the [[spring (device)|spring]] beneath the weighing pan, as per [[Hooke's law]], and the scales are [[calibration|calibrated]] to take ''g'' into account, allowing the mass ''M'' to be read off. Assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance, a [[Beam balance|balance]] measures relative weight, giving the relative gravitation mass of each object.

===Inertial mass===
[[File:Massmeter.jpg|thumb|Massmeter, a device for measuring the inertial mass of an astronaut in weightlessness. The mass is calculated via the oscillation period for a spring with the astronaut attached ([[Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics]])]]
''Inertial mass'' is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration. This definition has been championed by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mach, "Science of Mechanics" (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=belkind&gt;Ori Belkind, "Physical Systems: Conceptual Pathways between Flat Space-time and Matter" (2012) Springer (''Chapter 5.3'')&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been developed into the notion of [[Operationalization|operationalism]] by [[Percy W. Bridgman]].&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Bridgman, ''Einstein's Theories and the Operational Point of View'', in: P.A. Schilpp, ed., ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', Open Court, La Salle, Ill., Cambridge University Press, 1982, Vol. 2, p. 335–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. A Gillies, "[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/gillies/documents/1972a_Operationalism.pdf Operationalism]" ''Synthese'' (1972) pp 1-24 D. Reidel Publishing DOI 10.1007/BF00484997&lt;/ref&gt; The simple [[classical mechanics]] definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of [[special relativity]], but the essential meaning is the same.

In classical mechanics, according to [[Newton's second law]], we say that a body has a mass ''m'' if, at any instant of time, it obeys the equation of motion

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m \mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is the resultant [[force]] acting on the body and '''a''' is the [[acceleration]] of the body's centre of mass.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In its original form, Newton's second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass.&lt;/ref&gt; For the moment, we will put aside the question of what "force acting on the body" actually means.

This equation illustrates how mass relates to the [[inertia]] of a body. Consider two objects with different masses. If we apply an identical force to each, the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration, and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration. We might say that the larger mass exerts a greater "resistance" to changing its state of motion in response to the force.

However, this notion of applying "identical" forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is. We can sidestep this difficulty with the help of [[Newton's third law]], which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object, it will experience an equal and opposite force. To be precise, suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We isolate the two objects from all other physical influences, so that the only forces present are the force exerted on ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which we denote '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and the force exerted on ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which we denote '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. Newton's second law states that
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F_{12}} &amp; =m_1\mathbf{a}_1,\\
\mathbf{F_{21}} &amp; =m_2\mathbf{a}_2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the accelerations of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Suppose that these accelerations are non-zero, so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero. This occurs, for example, if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another. Newton's third law then states that
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12}=-\mathbf{F}_{21};&lt;/math&gt;
and thus
: &lt;math&gt;m_1=m_2\frac{|\mathbf{a}_2|}{|\mathbf{a}_1|}\!.&lt;/math&gt;

If |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| is non-zero, the fraction is well-defined, which allows us to measure the inertial mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is our "reference" object, and we can define its mass ''m'' as (say) 1&amp;nbsp;kilogram. Then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations.

Additionally, mass relates a body's [[momentum]] '''p''' to its linear [[velocity]] '''v''':
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;,
and the body's [[kinetic energy]] ''K'' to its velocity:
: &lt;math&gt;K=\dfrac{1}{2}m|\mathbf{v}|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The primary difficulty with Mach's definition of mass is that it fails to take into account the [[potential energy]] (or [[binding energy]]) needed to bring two masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass.&lt;ref name=belkind/&gt; This is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the [[proton]] in the nucleus of [[deuterium]], to the mass of the proton in free space (which is greater by about 0.239% - this is due to the binding energy of deuterium.). Thus, for example, if the reference weight ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken to be the mass of the neutron in free space, and the relative accelerations for the proton and neutron in deuterium are computed, then the above formula over-estimates the mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (by 0.239%) for the proton in deuterium.  At best, Mach's formula can only be used to obtain ratios of masses, that is, as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; /''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| / |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|.  An additional difficulty was pointed out by [[Henri Poincaré]], which is that the measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible: unlike the measurement of time or distance, there is no way to measure acceleration with a single measurement; one must make multiple measurements (of position, time, etc.) and perform a computation to obtain the acceleration.  Poincaré termed this to be an "insurmountable flaw" in the Mach definition of mass.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Poincaré. "[https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Poincare/Poincare_1905_07.html Classical Mechanics]". Chapter 6 in Science and Hypothesis . London: Walter Scott Publishing (1905): 89-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atomic mass ==
{{main article|Atomic mass unit}}

Typically, the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram, which is defined as the mass of the [[International prototype kilogram|''international prototype kilogram'']] (IPK), a platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in a vault at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in France. However, the IPK is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of similar scale, as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms, and has most certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to prevent this. It is much easier to precisely compare an atom's mass to that of another atom, thus scientists developed the [[atomic mass unit]] (or Dalton). By definition, 1&amp;nbsp;u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a [[carbon-12]] atom, and by extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12&amp;nbsp;u.  This definition, however, might be changed by the [[proposed redefinition of SI base units]], which will leave the Dalton very close to one, but no longer exactly equal to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Mass in relativity ==

===Special relativity===
{{main article|Mass in special relativity}}
In some frameworks of [[special relativity]], physicists have used differing definitions of the term "mass". However, such usage is controversial and has fallen out of favor.

In these frameworks, two kinds of mass are defined: [[rest mass]] (invariant mass),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It is possible to make a slight distinction between "rest mass" and "invariant mass". For a system of two or more particles, none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer. To avoid this confusion, some sources will use "rest mass" only for individual particles, and "invariant mass" for systems.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[relativistic mass]] (which increases with velocity). Rest mass is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object.  ''Relativistic mass'' is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The two are related by the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{relative}=\gamma (m_\mathrm{rest})\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames, while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's [[frame of reference]]. In order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers, it is convenient to use rest mass. The rest mass of a body is also related to its energy ''E'' and the magnitude of its momentum '''p''' by the [[relativistic energy-momentum equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;(m_\mathrm{rest})c^2=\sqrt{E_\mathrm{total}^2-(|\mathbf{p}|c)^2}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

So long as the system is [[Closed system|closed]] with respect to mass and energy, both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference. The conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others. Matter particles (such as atoms) may be converted to non-matter particles (such as photons of light), but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy. Although things like heat may not be matter, all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box, sitting on a scale, would in theory show no change in mass when detonated (although the inside of the box would become much hotter). In such a system, the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat. However, in that case, the removed energy would take its associated mass with it. Letting heat or radiation out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass. Thus, mass, like energy, cannot be destroyed, but only moved from one place to another.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=E. F. |last2=Wheeler |first2=J. A. |date=1992 |title=Spacetime Physics |pages=248–149 |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |isbn=0-7167-2327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity; rather, both are names for the same thing, and neither mass nor energy ''appear'' without the other.

Both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E''&amp;nbsp;= ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], yielding [[rest energy]] and "relativistic energy" (total system energy) respectively:

: &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{rest}=(m_\mathrm{rest})c^2\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{total}=(m_\mathrm{relative})c^2\!&lt;/math&gt;

The "relativistic" mass and energy concepts are related to their "rest" counterparts, but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum. Because the relativistic mass is [[Mass–energy equivalence|proportional to the energy]], it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=G.

In bound systems, the [[binding energy]] must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound. The mass of the system changes in this process merely because the system was not closed during the binding process, so the energy escaped. For example, the binding energy of [[atomic nuclei]] is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed, leaving [[nuclide]]s which have less mass than the free particles ([[nucleon]]s) of which they are composed.

[[Mass–energy equivalence]] also holds in macroscopic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Planck, Max|date=1907|title=Zur Dynamik bewegter Systeme|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich-Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin|volume=Erster Halbband|issue=29|pages=542–570|url=https://archive.org/details/sitzungsberichte1907deutsch}}

=== General relativity ===
{{main article|Mass in general relativity}}

In [[general relativity]], the [[equivalence principle]] is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Inertial Mass|inertial mass]]. At the core of this assertion is [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[Fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (i.e. accelerated) frame of reference.

However, it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of [[invariant mass]] in general relativity. At the core of the problem is the [[Nonlinear system|non-linearity]] of the [[Einstein field equations]], making it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the [[stress–energy tensor]] in a way that is invariant for all observers. For a given observer, this can be achieved by the [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Misner |first1=C. W. |last2=Thorne |first2=K. S. |last3=Wheeler |first3=J.

== Mass in quantum physics ==

In [[classical mechanics]], the inert mass of a particle appears in the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] as a parameter ''m'':
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \left( \, \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \right) \ = \ m \, \ddot{x}_i &lt;/math&gt;.

After quantization, replacing the position vector ''x'' with a [[wave function]], the parameter ''m'' appears in the [[kinetic energy]] operator:
: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) =  \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right)\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the ostensibly [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] (relativistically invariant) [[Dirac equation]], and in [[natural units]], this becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;(-i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu + m) \psi = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where the "[[Invariant mass|mass]]" parameter ''m'' is now simply a constant associated with the [[quantum]] described by the wave function ψ.

In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] as developed in the 1960s, this term arises from the coupling of the field  ψ to an additional field Φ, the [[Higgs field]]. In the case of fermions, the [[Higgs mechanism]] results in the replacement of the term ''m''ψ in the Lagrangian with &lt;math&gt;G_{\psi} \overline{\psi} \phi \psi&lt;/math&gt;. This shifts the [[explanandum]] of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown couplings ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The term "[[tachyon]]" was coined by [[Gerald Feinberg]] in a 1967 paper,&lt;ref name="feinberg67"/&gt; but it was soon realized that Feinberg's model in fact did not allow for [[superluminal]] speeds.&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt; Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons.  This process is known as tachyon condensation.  Well known examples include the [[Higgs mechanism|condensation]] of the [[Higgs boson]] in [[particle physics]], and [[ferromagnetism]] in [[condensed matter physics]].

Although the notion of a tachyonic [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized.  Rather, the [[scalar field]] is; even for tachyonic [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], the [[field operator]]s at [[Minkowski space|spacelike]] separated points still [[Canonical commutation relation|commute (or anticommute)]], thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light,&lt;ref name="feinberg67"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gerald | last = Feinberg | authorlink = Gerald Feinberg | title = Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles | journal = Physical Review | volume = 159 | year = 1967 | pages = 1089–1105 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of [[causality]]). [[Tachyon condensation]] drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared.&lt;ref name = "Peskin" /&gt;

This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a [[complex number|complex]] mass, with the real part being their mass in the usual sense, and the imaginary part being the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] in [[natural units]].&lt;ref name="Peskin"&gt;
{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[quantum field theory]], a particle (a "one-particle state") is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. An [[Particle decay|unstable particle]] is a state which is only approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude, this is interpreted as a [[resonance]] appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it.

In a [[Lorentz invariant]] theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called "[[bradyon]]s" in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular the [[energy–momentum relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4 \;&lt;/math&gt;
(where '''p''' is the relativistic [[momentum]] of the bradyon and '''m''' is its [[rest mass]]) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the "rest mass–energy") and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy.
When ''v'' is larger than ''c'', the denominator in the equation for the energy is [[imaginary number|"imaginary"]], as the value under the [[square root|radical]] is negative. Because the total [[energy]] must be [[real number|real]], the numerator must ''also'' be imaginary:  i.e. the [[rest mass]] '''m''' must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number.

=== Exotic matter and negative mass ===
{{main article|negative mass}}
The [[negative mass]] exists in the model to describe [[dark energy]] ([[phantom energy]]) and [[radiation]] in [[negative-index metamaterial]] in a unified way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang,Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the negative mass is associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], [[negative kinetic energy]] and FTL ([[faster-than-light]]).

'''Mike Plant''' (November 21, 1950 – 1992) was an American [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] [[yachtsman]]. He competed in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|BOC Challenge]] and the [[Vendée Globe]], a single-handed non-stop race around the world. After five years of single-handed sailing, he logged over 100,000 miles at sea and set the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation by an American, with a time of 135 days.&lt;ref name="The Museum of Yachting"&gt;[http://www.windlasscreative.com/shshof_web/mike_plant.htm ''The Museum of Yachting''] Retrieved March 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakeshore Weekly News"&gt;[http://www.weeklynews.com/main.asp?SectionID=10&amp;SubSectionID=10&amp;ArticleID=2558 "Celebrating a Sailor's Adventurous Spirit"], ''Lakeshore Weekly News'', September 9, 2006. Retrieved March 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Plant was preparing to compete in his second Vendée Globe and fourth single-handed circumnavigation aboard ''Coyote'', a powerful [[IMOCA 60|Open 60]] [[sloop]], and was lost at sea while delivering ''Coyote'' from [[New York Harbor]] to [[Les Sables-d'Olonne|Les Sables-d'Olonne, France]] for the starting line.  ''Coyote'' was found 32 days later, [[Turtling (sailing)|turtled]], without the 8,400lbs lead bulb that should have been attached to the keel.&lt;ref name="Mystery at Sea"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004596/ ''Mystery at Sea''] ''Sports Illustrated'', November 30, 1992.

Mike Plant was born in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], on November 21, 1950, the third of Frank Plant Jr. and Mary Kennedy's five children. He spent his childhood in the Minneapolis suburb of [[Deephaven, Minnesota|Deephaven]] on the shores of [[Lake Minnetonka]].&lt;ref name="Coyote Lost at Sea"&gt;Plant, Julia. ''Coyote Lost at Sea: The Story of Mike Plant, America’s Daring Solo Circumnavigator''. (March 5, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 9, Plant began sailing [[X boat (dinghy)|X boats]] at Minnetonka Yacht Club, and by the age of 14, aboard ''Lucky Strike'', had twice won the Interlake Regatta, the biggest regatta in the area, in which the top five boats from each of the large lakes in Minnesota, [[Iowa]] and [[Wisconsin]] competed at the end of the summer.&lt;ref name="Coyote Lost at Sea" /&gt; After many adventures in his 20s, including trekking the length of [[South America]] (12,000 miles), Plant moved to [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]], where he would later find his passion for single-handed sailing.&lt;ref name="Coyote Lost at Sea" /&gt;

* 1986/1987: Won the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|BOC Challenge]] (Class II - [[IMOCA 50|Open 50]]) aboard ''Airco Distributor'', his first solo ocean race, with a time of 157 days &lt;ref name="Velux5Oceans" /&gt;
* 1989: Competed in the first [[Vendée Globe]] aboard ''Duracell'', an [[IMOCA 60|Open 60]] [[sloop]] built by Plant and designed by Roger Martin. Although eliminated from the race after receiving help to rescue his boat after it ran aground in [[Perseverance Harbour]] at [[Campbell Island, New Zealand]], Plant still set a record for the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world with a time of 135 days, bettering [[Dodge Morgan|Dodge Morgan's]] time of 150 days set in 1985 aboard his 60-foot [[cutter (boat)|cutter]], ''American Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/sports/18morgan.html?mcubz=0 ''Dodge Morgan, Who Sailed Around World, Dies at 78''] The New York Times, September 17, 2010. Retrieved September 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
**Plant's disqualification from the 1989 [[Vendée Globe]] transpired when a $5 part on ''Duracell's'' rigging was damaged in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Plant sailed 36 hours straight until he was able to anchor off [[Campbell Island, New Zealand]]. Once anchored, a storm caught him and began pushing ''Duracell'' toward a rocky shore’s certain destruction. On the island, four meteorologists saw the racer’s plight and motored out in their Zodiac. To save his boat with its dragging anchor, Plant had to accept the tow, but he knew that the outside assistance would disqualify him. The meteorologists suggested to Mike that he simply continue the race. They vowed eternal silence. No one would know. "Except I would," Mike answered. Plant radioed the race committee that he had accepted outside help and that he would continue the race, though disqualified. He unofficially crossed the finish line in seventh place. Mike lost the race, but to the admiring French, he emerged a real hero. His determination and honesty did not go unnoticed: 25,000 people lined the breakwater in Les Sables d’Olonne to give him a rousing hero’s welcome. Mike was the only American in the race. Herb McCormick, editor of Cruising World, and the Boating Editor of the New York Times wrote: "The tens of thousands of French men and women who greeted him at the finish understood something that largely was missed in this country. By forging on, by completing what he’d set out to do, by showing the highest respect for his competitors in a wonderful act of sportsmanship, Mike was as much a winner as the sailors who’d officially crossed the finish line." &lt;ref name="Broken Seas"&gt;[http://www.sailingbreezes.com/sailing_breezes_current/articles/April05/BrokenSeas.htm Excerpt from ''Broken Seas'' by Marlin Bree] Retrieved October 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
** Plant's record as the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world stood until the 1994/95 [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|BOC Challenge]] when Steve Pettengill, sailing ''Hunter's Child'', bested the time with a circumnavigation in 128 days. [[Bruce Schwab]] later broke this record, finishing the 2005 [[Vendée Globe]] with a time of 109 days nonstop.&lt;ref name="The Museum of Yachting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coyote Lost at Sea" /&gt;
* 1990/1991: Finished 4th overall in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|BOC Challenge]], setting the highest mark in a solo-sailing event for an American. Plant became one of only five people to complete three solo-circumnavigations&lt;ref name="Velux5Oceans" /&gt;

==Mike Plant Memorial Fund==
After his death, the Mike Plant Memorial Fund was created at the [https://wayzatasailing.org/ Wayzata Community Sailing Center], located on [[Lake Minnetonka]] in [[Wayzata, Minnesota]], to provide sailing experiences for children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to sail.

'''Mount Kinabalu''' ({{lang-ms|Gunung Kinabalu}}) is a mountain in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. It is protected as [[Kinabalu Park]], a [[World Heritage Site]]. Kinabalu is the highest peak in Borneo's [[Crocker Range]] and is the highest mountain in the [[Malay Archipelago]] as well as the highest mountain in Malaysia.{{#tag:ref|Given the definition of the Malay Archipelago excluding [[New Guinea]], where about [[List of highest mountains of New Guinea|22 mountains]] exceed 4100 m.|group="note"}} Mount Kinabalu is also the [[List of peaks by prominence|20th most prominent]] mountain in the world by [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peaklist.org/WWlists/WorldTop50.html|title=World Top 50 Most Prominent Peaks|publisher=Peaklist.org|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology established its summit (known as Low's Peak) height at {{convert|4095|m|ft|0}} above sea level, which is some {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} less than the previously thought and hitherto published figure of {{convert|4101|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=P&amp;L&gt;[[Anthea Phillipps|Phillipps, A.]] &amp; [[Francis Liew|F. Liew]] 2000. ''Globetrotter Visitor's Guide – Kinabalu Park''. New Holland Publishers (UK) Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Kinabalu includes the '''Kinabalu montane alpine meadows''' [[ecoregion]] in the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[biome]]. The mountain and its surroundings are among the most important biological sites in the world, with between 5,000 and 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and more than 100 mammalian species identified. Among this rich collection of wildlife are famous species such as the gigantic ''[[Rafflesia]]'' plants and [[orangutans]]. Mount Kinabalu has been accorded [[UNESCO]] World Heritage status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1012/|title=Kinabalu Park|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/ss/8seasiasights_4.htm|title=Mount Kinabalu, Malaysia|author=Michael Aquino|work=About.com Travel|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecologyasia.com/html-loc/mount-kinabalu.htm|title=Mount Kinabalu – revered abode of the dead|publisher=Ecology Asia|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology ==
Mount Kinabalu along with other upland areas of the Crocker Range is known worldwide for its [[botanical]] and [[biology|biological]] [[species]] [[biodiversity]] with plants of [[Himalaya]]n, [[Australasia]]n, and [[Indomalaya]]n origin. A recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns),&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parris, By.

It is therefore one of the world's most important biological sites.

In 2015, a major Malaysian-Dutch study showed that the unique flora, fauna, and fungi on the mountain summit are younger than the mountain itself, and have evolved from both local and distant montane ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merckx | first1 = V.

=== Flora ===
The flora covers the mountain in zones of different types of habitat as one climbs up, beginning with a lowland belt of [[Common fig|fig]] trees and [[insectivorous]] [[pitcher plants]]. Then between {{convert|2600|to|3200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is a layer of short trees such the conifer ''[[Dacrydium gibbsiae]]'' and dwarf shrubs, mosses, lichens, liverworts, and ferns. Finally many of the world's richest variety of [[orchid]]s are found on the high rockier slopes.

[[File:Nepenthes rajah.png|thumb|left|upright|Large lower pitcher of ''[[Nepenthes rajah]]''.]]
These plants have high levels of [[endemism]] (i.e. species which are found only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). The orchids are the best-known example with over 800 species including some of the highly valued ''[[Paphiopedilum]]'' [[Cypripedioideae|slipper orchids]], but there are also over 600 species of [[fern]]s (more than the whole of Africa's 500 species) of which 50 are found nowhere else, and the richest collection in the world for the ''Nepenthes'' pitcher plants (five of the thirteen are found nowhere else on earth) which reach spectacular proportions (the largest-pitchered in the world being the endemic ''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'').&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurata&gt;Kurata, S. 1976. ''[[Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu]]''. Sabah National Parks Publications No. 2, Sabah National Parks Trustees, Kota Kinabalu.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adam | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Wilcock | first2 = C.C. | year = 1998 | title = Pitcher plants of Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah | url = | journal = The Sarawak Museum Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 71| pages = 145–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[parasitic]] ''[[Rafflesia]]'' plant, which has the largest single flower in the world, is also found in Kinabalu (particularly ''[[Rafflesia keithii]]'' whose flower grows to  {{convert|94|cm|in}} in diameter),&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt; though it should be noted that blooms of the flower are rare and difficult to find. Meanwhile, another ''Rafflesia'' species, ''[[Rafflesia tengku-adlinii]]'', can be found on the neighbouring [[Mount Trus Madi]] and the nearby [[Maliau Basin]].

Its incredible [[biodiversity]] in plant life is due to a combination of several unique factors: its setting in one of the richest plant regions of the world (the tropical biogeographical region known as western [[Malesia]] which comprises the island of [[Sumatra]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], and the island of [[Borneo]]), the fact that the mountain covers a wide climatic range from near sea level to freezing ground conditions near the summit, the jagged terrain and diversity of rocks and soils, the high levels of rainfall (averaging about {{convert|2700|mm|in}} a year at park HQ), and the climatic instability caused by periods of [[glaciation]] and catastrophic droughts which result in [[evolution]] and [[speciation]]. This diversity is greatest in the lowland regions (consisting of lowland dipterocarp forests, so called because the tree [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dipterocarpaceae]] are dominant). However, most of Kinabalu's [[endemism|endemic]] species are found in the mountain forests, particularly on [[ultramafic]] soils (i.e. soils which are low in phosphates and high in iron and metals poisonous to many plants; this high toxic content gave rise to the development of distinctive plant species found nowhere else).&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt;

=== Fauna ===
[[File:Borneo Mount Kinabalu Moutain Squirrel Rat.jpg|thumb|right|A mountain squirrel, ''[[Sundasciurus tenuis]]'', from Mount Kinabalu.]]
The variety of plant life is also habitat for a great variety of birds and mammals. There are some 326 species of birds in Kinabalu Park, including the spectacular [[rhinoceros hornbill]], [[mountain serpent-eagle]], [[Dulit frogmouth]], [[eyebrowed jungle flycatcher]], and [[bare-headed laughingthrush]]. Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain. The mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the four great apes, the [[orangutan]] (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120).&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt; Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the [[Malayan weasel]] ''(Mustela nudipes)'', [[oriental small-clawed otter]] ''(Aonyx cinerea)'', and [[leopard cat]] ''(Felis bengalensis)''. Endemic mammals include the [[black shrew]] ''(Suncus ater)'' and [[Bornean ferret-badger]] ''(Melogale everetti)''.

Endemic annelids number less than a dozen known species but include the [[Kinabalu giant red leech]] that preys on various earthworms, including the [[Kinabalu giant earthworm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blakemore, R.J. |author2=C.

=== Threats and preservation ===
{{see also|Deforestation in Borneo}}
The steep mountainsides with poor soil are not suitable for farming or for the timber industry so the habitats and animal life of Kinabalu remain largely intact, with about a third of the original habitat now degraded. Kinabalu Park was established in 1964 and the nearby mountains were protected as the [[Crocker Range National Park]] in 1984. However even national park status does not guarantee full protection, as logging permits were granted on Trus Madi in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im1001|name=Kinabalu montane alpine meadows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:Summit of Mount Kinabalu.jpg|thumb|left|Summit of Mount Kinabalu.]]
Mount Kinabalu is essentially a massive [[pluton]] formed from [[granodiorite]] which is intrusive into [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[ultrabasic rock]]s, and forms the central part, or core, of the Kinabalu massif. The granodiorite is intrusive into strongly folded strata, probably of [[Eocene]] to [[Miocene]] age, and associated ultrabasic and basic [[igneous rock]]s. It was pushed up from the earth's crust as molten rock millions of years ago. In geological terms, it is a very young mountain as the granodiorite cooled and hardened only about 10 million years ago. The present landform is considered to be a mid-[[Pliocene]] peneplain, arched and deeply dissected, through which the Kinabalu granodiorite body has risen in isostatic adjustment. It is still pushing up at the rate of 5&amp;nbsp;mm per annum. During the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch of about 100,000 years ago, the massive mountain was covered by huge sheets of ice and [[glacier]]s which flowed down its slopes, scouring its surface in the process and creating the {{convert|1800|m|ft|adj=on}} deep Low's Gully (named after [[Hugh Low]]) on its north side. Its granite composition and the glacial formative processes are readily apparent when viewing its craggy rocky peaks.&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt;

== History ==
British colonial administrator [[Hugh Low]] made the first recorded ascent of Mount Kinabalu's summit plateau in March 1851. Low did not scale the mountain's highest peak, however, considering it "inaccessible to any but winged animals".&lt;ref&gt;Hiung, C. S., R. Mandalam, and C. Chin. 2004. ''The Hugh Low Trail: The Quest for the Historical Trail to the Summit of Kinabalu''. The Sabah Society, Kota Kinabalu.&lt;/ref&gt; In April and July 1858, Low was accompanied on two further ascents by [[Spenser St. John]], the British Consul in Brunei.&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt; The highest point of Mount Kinabalu was finally reached in 1888 by zoologist [[John Whitehead (explorer)|John Whitehead]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt; British botanist [[Lilian Gibbs]] became the first woman and the first botanist to summit Mount Kinabalu in February 1910.&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt;

Botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] led two important expeditions of the [[Royal Society of Great Britain]] to the mountain in 1961 and 1964.&lt;ref name=P&amp;L /&gt; [[Kinabalu National Park]] was established in 1964. The park was designated a natural [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1012 Kinabalu Park]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 earthquake ===
{{main article|2015 Sabah earthquake}}
On 5 June 2015 at 07:15 [[Malaysian Standard Time|MST]], the area around Mount Kinabalu was damaged by an earthquake. Eighteen people, including hikers and mountain guides, were killed by the earthquake and a massive landslide that followed it. Ranau and many parts of Sabah [[West Coast Division|West Coast]] were affected and Donkey Ear's Peak was heavily damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/06/05/Sabah-tremors-Donkey-Ear-peak/|title=Sabah quake: Donkey’s Ear Peak on Mount Kinabalu destroyed|author=Victoria Brown|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climbing permit ==
[[Sabah Parks]] grants a summit-climbing permit only to climbers who stay at mountain huts. Due to the limited number of beds at the mountain huts, only 130 persons are allowed to climb Mount Kinabalu per day. There are only 3 types of mountain hut owned by either Sutera Sanctuary Lodges, Mountain Torq or [[Sabah Parks]]. Accommodation package can be purchased directly from them.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} (The hut owned by [[Sabah Parks]] is restricted only to Malaysians.)

Climbers must be accompanied by accredited guides at all times due to national park regulations. There are two main starting points for the climb: the Timpohon Gate (located 5.5&amp;nbsp;km from Kinabalu Park Headquarters, at an altitude of {{convert|1866|m|ft}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Quentin Phillipps|author2=Karen Phillipps|title=Phillipps' Field Guide to the Mammals of Borneo and Their Ecology: Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei, and Kalimantan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SxzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236|date=10 May 2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16941-5|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mesilau Nature Resort]]. The latter starting point is slightly higher in elevation, but crosses a ridge, adding about two kilometres to the ascent and making the total elevation gain slightly higher. The Mesilau Trail is no longer accessible due to earthquake in 2015. The two trails meet about two kilometres before Laban Rata.

Accommodation is available inside the park or outside near the headquarters. Sabah Parks has privatised Mount Kinabalu activities to an organisation called Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. The mountain may be climbed on a single day trip, or hikers may (usually) stay one night at Laban Rata Resthouse at {{convert|3270|m|ft}} to complete the climb in 2 days, finishing the ascent and descending on the second day. The majority of climbers begin the ascent on day one of a two-day hike from Timpohon gate at {{convert|1866|m|ft}}, reaching this location either by minibus or by walking, and then walk to Laban Rata. Most people accomplish this part of the climb in 3 to 6 hours. Since there are no roads, the supplies for the Laban Rata Resthouse are carried by porters, who sometimes bring more than 35 kilograms of supplies on their backs. Hot food and beverages are available at Laban Rata. Most rooms have no hot water in the bathrooms and whilst the dining area is heated, most rooms are not. The last {{convert|2|km|ft}}, from the Laban Rata Resthouse at {{convert|3270|m|ft}} to Low's Peak (summit) at {{convert|4095.2|m|ft}}, takes between 2 and 4 hours. The last part of the climb is on bare granite rock.

Given the high altitude, some people may suffer from [[altitude sickness]]&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although staying overnight at the lodges before the climb and climbing at a lower rate of ascent may reduce the likelihood of this happening.

=== Low's gully ===
Low's Gully (named after [[Hugh Low]] who first looked down into it in 1851) is a {{convert|1800|m|ft|adj=on}} deep gorge carved out by [[Glacial period|glaciation]] on the north side of Mount Kinabalu, that is one of the least explored and most inhospitable places on earth. In March 1994 two British Army officers were severely criticised after leading a party of 7 British and 3 [[Hong Kong]] soldiers in an attempt to [[Abseiling|abseil]] and climb down into the gully that required extensive rescue efforts from both the RAF and the Malaysian army. The party were not equipped with radios and the 2 officers and 3 Hong Kong soldiers were trapped for 16 days and did not eat for five days before being rescued when stretchers were lowered by helicopter. The breakaway party of five completed the first descent of the gully in three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/leaders-of-lost-expedition-criticised-1450078.html|title=Leaders of lost expedition criticised|author=Mary Braid|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 September 1994|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book about the 31-day fight for survival entitled ''Descent Into Chaos'' was published in 1996 and a film drama ''[[The Place of the Dead]]'' was released in 1997.

== Naming myths ==
[[File:Kina Balu from Pinokok Valley.png|thumb|left|"Kina Balu from Pinokok Valley" – lithograph published in 1862.]]

[[File:G.kinabalu.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Kinabalu viewed from the summit of nearby [[Mount Tambuyukon]].]]
There are few stories that led to the main beliefs in the origin of the mountain's name. The first derivation of the word Kinabalu is extracted from the short form for the [[Kadazan Dusun language|Kadazan-Dusun]] word 'Aki Nabalu', meaning "the revered place of the dead". Meanwhile, it can also be believed that the name "Kinabalu" comes from the Dusun phrase "tina balu" which means "a widow mother". So, assumably, ''tina balu'' is the spirit of the mount itself. Another consideration is Kinabalu is formed by two words of [[Dusun people|Dusun]] "ki" (have/has) and "nabalu" (mountain), so "ki-nabalu" means "have mountain". It is common by Dusun people named place based on what the place have. For example, there is a place named "kiwaig" that literally mean "have water". Considering the fact that the word "Kinabalu" in many [[Dusun]] dialects literally means 'mountain', means that this explanation is the most likely.

A popular story told to Western and Chinese tourists states that the name "Kinabalu" actually means "Cina Balu" (which would fully mean "A Chinese Widow").&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33020356|title=The call of Malaysia's 'conquerable' Mount Kinabalu|publisher=BBC News|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[linguistics|lingual influence]] among the Kadazan Dusun of [[Sabah]], the [[pronunciation]] for the word "cina" (chee-na) was changed to "Kina" (kee-na).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/01/18/majesty-mystery-and-magic-of-mountains/|title=Majesty, mystery and magic of mountains|author=Alan Rogers|publisher=[[The Borneo Post]]|date=18 January 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody actually knows when or where this story came from but it seems to have originated within the last 30 years.

It was told that a Chinese prince, was cast away to [[Borneo]] when his ship sank in the middle of the [[South China Sea]]. He was subsequently rescued by the natives from a nearby village. As he recovered, he was slowly accepted as one of the people of the village. Eventually, he fell in love with a local woman, and married her. Years went by, and he started to feel homesick. So he asked permission from his newly found family to go back to China to visit his parents (the [[Chinese emperor|Emperor]] and Empress of China). To his wife, he promised that as soon as he was done with his family duties in China, he would come back to Borneo to take her and their children back to China. When he made his return to China, he was given a grand welcome by his family. However, to his dismay, his parents disagreed with him about taking his Bornean wife back to China. Worse, they told him that he was already betrothed to a princess of a neighbouring kingdom. Having no choice (due to [[filial piety|high respect towards his parents]]), he obeyed with a heavy heart.

Meanwhile, back in Borneo, his wife grew more and more anxious. Eventually, she decided that she would wait for her husband's ship. However, since the village was situated far away from the coast, she couldn't afford to come to the shore and wait for him daily. Instead she decided to climb to the top of the highest mountain near her village, so that she could have a better view of the ships sailing in the South China Sea. Thus, she was then seen climbing up the mountain at every sunrise, returning only at night to attend to her growing children. Eventually her efforts took their toll. She fell ill, and died at the top of the cold mountain while waiting for her husband. The [[nature spirit|spirit of the mountain]], having observed her for years, was extremely touched by her loyalty towards her husband. Out of admiration for this woman, the spirit of the mountain turned her into a stone.&lt;ref name="legend"/&gt; Her face was made to face the South China Sea, so that she could wait forever for her dear husband's return. The people in her hometown who heard about this were also gravely touched by this. Thus, they decided to name the mountain "Kinabalu" in remembrance of her. To them, the mountain is a symbol of the everlasting love and loyalty that should be taken as a good example by women.

Local legend among the people of [[Ranau, Malaysia|Ranau]], a district in Sabah, has it that [[St. John's Peak]] was the stone which her body was turned into.

== Temperature ==
The temperature of Mount Kinabalu usually stands from −4&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C in December to January, and 3&amp;nbsp;°C to 12&amp;nbsp;°C in June to September. Due to the coldness of the mountain in December to January, sometimes [[frost]], [[ice]] or even [[snow]] appears at the summit of Mount Kinabalu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/01/25/did-it-snow-on-the-summit-of-mount-kinabalu/|title=Did it snow on the summit of Mount Kinabalu?|publisher=The Star|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://says.com/my/news/ice-sheets-found-on-mount-kinabalu-sabah|title=Ice Sheets And 'Snow' Have Formed On Mount Kinabalu!|author=Tang Ruxyn|publisher=Says.com|date=10 February 2017|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MSH80 mailboxes along cowlitz river 1980.jpg|thumb|Mailboxes caught in a mudflow following the May 1980 Saint Helens volcanic eruption.]]

A '''mudflow''' or '''mud flow''' is a form of [[mass wasting]] involving "very rapid to extremely rapid surging flow"&lt;ref&gt;3 meters/minute to 5 meters/second; {{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2014 |loc=Table 2}}, citing Cruden and Varnes, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; of debris that has become partially or fully liquified by the addition of significant amounts of water to the source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2014|p=185}}; {{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2013|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudflows contain a significant proportion of clay, which makes them more fluid than [[debris flow]]s; thus, they are able to travel farther and across lower slope angles. Both types are generally mixtures of various kinds of materials of different sizes, which are typically sorted by size upon deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2014|pp=170, 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudflows are often called ''mudslides'', a term applied indiscriminately by the mass media to a variety of mass wasting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2013|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudflows often start as slides, becoming flows as water is entrained along the flow path; such events are often called ''flow slides''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunger|Leroueil|Picarelli|2013|loc=§6.1 Flow slides}}; {{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2014|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of mudflows include [[lahar]]s (involving fine-grained [[pyroclastic]] deposits on the flanks of volcanoes) and [[jökulhlaup]]s (outbursts from under glaciers or icecaps).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hungr|Leroueil|Picarelli|2014|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statutory definition of "flood-related mudslide" appears in the United States' National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, codified at 42 USC Sections 4001 and following.

== Triggering of mudflows ==
[[Image:Mameyes.jpg|thumb|right|The Mameyes mudflow disaster, in barrio [[Tibes]], Ponce, [[Puerto Rico]], was caused by heavy rainfall from [[Mameyes#Puerto Rico|Tropical Storm Isabel]] in 1985. The mudflow destroyed more than 100 homes and claimed an estimated 300 lives.]] Heavy rainfall, [[snow]]melt, or high levels of [[ground water]] flowing through cracked bedrock may trigger a movement of soil or sediments. [[Flood]]s and [[debris flow]]s  may also occur when strong rains on hill or mountain slopes cause extensive [[erosion]] and/or what is known as "channel scour". The 2006 [[Sidoarjo mud flow]] may have been caused by rogue drilling. 

Some broad mudflows are rather [[viscous]] and therefore slow; others begin very quickly and continue like an [[avalanche]]. If large enough, they can devastate villages and countrysides. They are composed of at least 50% silt and clay-sized materials and up to 30% water. Mudflows are common even in the [[hill]]s around [[Los Angeles]], California, where they have destroyed many homes built on hillsides without sufficient support after fires destroy vegetation holding the land.

The point where a muddy material begins to flow depends on its [[grain]] size and the water content. Fine grainy material or soil has a smaller [[friction angle]] than a coarse [[sediment]] or a [[debris]] flow, but falling rock pieces can trigger a material flow, too.

On December 14, 1999 in [[Vargas, Venezuela|Vargas]], [[Venezuela]], a mudflow known as [[Vargas tragedy|The Vargas tragedy]] significantly altered more than 60 kilometers (37&amp;nbsp;mi) of the coastline. It was triggered by heavy rainfall and caused estimated damages of US$1.79 to US$3.5 billion, killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people, forced 85,000 people to [[Emergency evacuation|evacuate]], and led to the complete collapse of the state's infrastructure.

== Mudflows and landslides ==

''[[Landslide]]'' is a more general term than mudflow. It refers to the gravity-driven failure and subsequent movement downslope of any types of surface movement of soil, rock, or other debris. The term incorporates earth slides, rock falls, [[debris flow]]s, and mudslides, amongst [[Landslide classification|other categories]] of hillslope [[mass wasting|mass movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/landslide/basics/what |title=What is a Landslide? - Geoscience Australia |publisher=Ga.gov.au |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not have to be as fluid as a mudflow.

Mudflows can be caused by unusually heavy rains or a sudden thaw. They consist mainly of mud and water plus fragments of rock and other debris, so they often behave like floods. They can move houses off their foundations or bury a place within minutes because of incredibly strong currents.

== Mudflow geography ==

When a mudflow occurs it is given four named areas, the 'main scarp', in bigger mudflows the 'upper and lower shelves' and the 'toe'. The main scarp will be the original area of incidence, the toe is the last affected area(s). The upper and lower shelves are located wherever there is a large dip (due to mountain or natural drop) in the mudflow's path. A mudflow can have many shelves.

==Largest recorded mudflow==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
The world's largest historic landslide (in terms of volume) occurred during the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|1980 eruption]] of [[Mount St. Helens]], a volcano in the Cascade Mountain Range in the State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], USA. The volume of material displaced was {{convert|2.8|km³|cumi|abbr=on}}. Directly in the path of the huge mudflow was [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]]. Normally a chilly {{convert|5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, the lahar instantly raised the temperature to near {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Today the bottom of Spirit Lake is {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the original surface, and it has two and a half times more surface area than it did before the eruption.

The world's largest known prehistoric terrestrial landslide took place in southwestern [[Iran]], and is named the [[Saidmarreh landslide]]. The landslide was located on the [[Kabir Kuh]] [[anticline]] at 33.0°N, 47.65°E. The landslide had a volume of about {{convert|20|km³|cumi|abbr=on}}, a depth of {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a travel distance of {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and a width of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}. This means that about 50 billion tons of rock moved in this single event.

The largest known of all prehistoric landslides was an enormous [[submarine landslide]] that disintegrated 60,000 years ago and produced the longest flow of sand and mud yet documented on Earth. The massive submarine flow travelled {{convert|1,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} – the distance from London to Rome.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

By volume, the [[List of landslides|largest submarine landslide]] (the [[Agulhas slide]] off South Africa) occurred approximately 2.6 million years ago. The volume of the slide was {{convert|20,000|km³|cumi|abbr=on}}.

==Areas at risk==

The area most generally recognized as being at risk of a dangerous mudflow are:
* Areas where wildfires or human modification of the land have destroyed vegetation
* Areas where landslides have occurred before
* Steep slopes and areas at the bottom of slopes or canyons
* Slopes that have been altered for construction of buildings and roads
* Channels along streams and rivers
* Areas where surface runoff is directed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''Oblivantsy''' (from {{lang-ru|обливанцы}}) is a word still used by [[Old Believers]] for those who practise the [[baptism]] by sprinkling water, as in [[Catholic Church]], rather than by submerging the whole body three times, as the Old Believers insist on. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] practises both ways of baptizing and, subsequently, recognizes baptism both by sprinkling and submerging.

In [[Machine#Mechanical_systems|mechanical systems]], '''resonance''' is a phenomenon that occurs when the [[frequency]] at which a [[force]] is [[Periodic function|periodically]] applied is equal or nearly equal to one of the [[natural frequency|natural frequencies]] of the system on which it acts. This causes the system to [[Oscillation|oscillate]] with larger [[amplitude]] than when the force is applied at other frequencies.&lt;ref name = "Resnick and Halliday"&gt;{{cite book

| authors = Resnick and Halliday
| edition = 3rd
| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
| date = 1977
| ISBN13 = 9780471717164
| quote = There is a characteristic value of the driving frequency ''ω"'' at which the amplitude of oscillation is a maximum. This condition is called ''resonance'' and the value of ''ω"'' at which resonance occurs is called the ''resonant frequency''. 
| page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a [[relative maximum]] are known as '''resonant frequencies''' or '''resonance frequencies''' of the system.&lt;ref name = "Resnick and Halliday"/&gt; Near resonant frequencies, small periodic forces have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations, due to the storage of [[vibrational energy]].

In other systems, such as electrical or optical, phenomena occur which are described as resonance but depend on interaction between different aspects of the system, not on an external driver.

For example, [[electrical resonance]] occurs in a [[Electrical network|circuit]] with [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. Once the circuit is charged, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action. This is analogous to a mechanical [[pendulum]], where [[mechanical energy]] is converted back and forth between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]], and both systems are forms of [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s.

In [[optical cavities]], light confined in the cavity reflects back and forth multiple times. This produces [[standing wave]]s, and only certain patterns and [[frequency|frequencies]] of radiation are sustained, due to the effects of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], while the others are suppressed by destructive interference. Once the light enters the cavity, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action.

Some behavior is mistaken for resonance but instead is a form of [[self-oscillation]], such as [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]], [[speed wobble]], or [[Hunting oscillation]]. In these cases, the external energy source does not oscillate, but the components of the system interact with each other in a periodic fashion.&lt;ref name = "Billah and Scanlan"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf |title=Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks |author=K.&amp;nbsp;Yusuf Billah and Robert H.

==Overview==

Resonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different [[storage mode]]s (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called [[damping]]. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the [[natural frequency]] of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant frequencies.

Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or [[wave]]s: there is [[mechanical resonance]], [[acoustic resonance]], [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] resonance, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), [[electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance]] (ESR) and resonance of quantum [[wave function]]s. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., [[musical instrument]]s), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).

The term ''resonance'' (from [[Latin]] ''resonantia'', 'echo', from ''resonare'', 'resound') originates from the field of acoustics, particularly observed in musical instruments, e.g., when strings started to vibrate and to produce sound without direct excitation by the player.

==Examples==
[[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|Pushing a person in a [[swing (seat)|swing]] is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing, a [[pendulum]], has a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.]]

A familiar example is a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]], which acts as a [[pendulum]]. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.

Resonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all [[sinusoidal]] waves and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]] are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength [[electromagnetic radiation]] is produced by resonance on an [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], such as [[electron]]s in atoms.  Other examples of resonance:

* Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the [[balance wheel]] in a mechanical [[watch]] and the [[quartz crystal]] in a [[quartz watch]]
* [[Tidal resonance]] of the [[Bay of Fundy]]
* [[Acoustic resonance]]s of [[musical instruments]] and the human [[vocal tract]]
* Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)
* [[Friction idiophone]]s, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) [[vibration|vibrate]] by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip
* [[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in [[radio]]s and [[TV]]s that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received
* Creation of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light by [[optical resonance]] in a [[laser]] [[Optical cavity|cavity]]
* [[Orbital resonance]] as exemplified by some [[natural satellite|moons]] of the [[solar system]]'s [[gas giants]]
* Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that are used in [[condensed matter physics]]

===Tacoma Narrows Bridge===
{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}

The dramatically visible, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse of "Galloping Gertie", the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], is mistakenly characterized as an example of resonance phenomenon in certain textbooks.&lt;ref name = "Resnick and Halliday"/&gt; The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it—a phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]], which is a kind of "self-sustaining vibration" as referred to in the nonlinear theory of vibrations. [[Robert H. Scanlan]], father of [[bridge engineering|bridge]] [[aerodynamics]], has written an article about this misunderstanding.&lt;ref name = "Billah and Scanlan"/&gt;

===International Space Station===

The [[rocket engine]]s for the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) are controlled by an [[autopilot]]. Ordinarily, uploaded parameters for controlling the engine control system for the Zvezda module make the rocket engines boost the International Space Station to a higher orbit. The rocket engines are [[hinge]]-mounted, and ordinarily the crew doesn't notice the operation. On January 14, 2009, however, the uploaded parameters made the autopilot swing the rocket engines in larger and larger oscillations, at a frequency of 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. These oscillations were captured on video, and lasted for 142 seconds.&lt;ref name=oberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Oberg|first=James|title=Shaking on Space Station Rattles NASA|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28998876/#story|newspaper=NBC News|date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of resonance==

===Mechanical and acoustic resonance===
{{Main|Mechanical resonance|Acoustic resonance|String resonance}}
[[File:Resonating mass experiment.jpg|thumb|upright|School resonating mass experiment]]

[[Mechanical resonance]] is the tendency of a [[mechanics|mechanical system]] to absorb more energy when the [[frequency]] of its oscillations matches the system's [[natural frequency]] of [[vibration]] than it does at other frequencies. It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including bridges, buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing objects, [[engineers]]  must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as [[mechanical resonance#Resonance disaster|resonance disaster]].

Avoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and [[bridge]] [[construction]] project. As a countermeasure, [[shock mount]]s can be installed to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The [[Taipei 101]] building relies on a {{convert|660|t|ST|adj=mid|[[pendulum]]}}—a [[tuned mass damper]]—to cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur. Buildings in [[seismic]] zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition, [[engineer]]s designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts.

[[Clock]]s keep time by mechanical resonance in a [[balance wheel]], [[pendulum]], or [[Quartz clock|quartz crystal]].

The cadence of runners has been hypothesized to be energetically favorable due to resonance between the elastic energy stored in the lower limb and the mass of the runner.&lt;ref name="Snyder and Farley. Energetically optimal stride frequency in running: the effects of incline and decline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|last2=Farley|title=Energetically optimal stride frequency in running: the effects of incline and decline|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2011|volume=214|pages=2089–95|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2089.long|accessdate=1 Sep 2014|ref=Snyder and Farley. Energetically optimal stride frequency in running: the effects of incline and decline|doi=10.1242/jeb.053157|pmid=21613526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acoustic resonance]] is a branch of [[mechanical resonance]] that is concerned with the mechanical vibrations across the frequency range of human hearing, in other words [[sound]]. For humans, hearing is normally limited to frequencies between about 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (20&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry F. Olson]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC&amp;pg=PA248 ''Music, Physics and Engineering.''] Dover Publications, 1967, pp. 248–249. "Under very favorable conditions most individuals can obtain tonal characteristics as low as 12 Hz."&lt;/ref&gt;  Many objects and materials act as resonators  with resonant frequencies within this range, and when struck vibrate mechanically, pushing on the surrounding air to create sound waves.  This is the source of many percussive sounds we hear.   

Acoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as most acoustic [[Musical instrument|instruments]] use [[resonator]]s, such as the [[string resonance|strings]] and body of a [[violin]], the length of tube in a [[flute]], and the shape of, and tension on, a drum membrane.

Like mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic failure of the object at resonance. The classic example of this is breaking a wine glass with sound at the precise resonant frequency of the glass, although this is difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demoweb/demomanual/acoustics/effects_of_sound/breaking_glass_with_sound.html Breaking Glass with Sound&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical resonance===
{{Main|Electrical resonance}}
[[Image:Tuned circuit animation 3.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|Animation illustrating electrical resonance in a [[tuned circuit]], consisting of a [[capacitor]] (C) and an [[inductor]] (L) connected together. Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor plates through the inductor.  Energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor's [[electric field]] ({{mvar|E}}) and the inductor's [[magnetic field]] ({{mvar|B}}). ]]

[[Electrical resonance]] occurs in an [[electrical network|electric circuit]] at a particular ''resonant frequency'' when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the circuit is at a minimum in a series circuit or at maximum in a parallel circuit (or when the [[transfer function]] is at a maximum). Resonance in circuits are used for both transmitting and receiving wireless communications such as television, cell phones and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Physics Of Resonance|url=http://www.intuitor.com/resonance/circuits.html|website=Intuitor|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical resonance===
{{Main|Optical cavity}}

An [[optical cavity]], also called an ''optical resonator'', is an arrangement of [[mirror]]s that forms a [[standing wave]] [[cavity resonator]] for [[light wave]]s. Optical cavities are a major component of [[laser]]s, surrounding the [[gain medium]] and providing [[feedback]] of the laser light. They are also used in [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and some [[interferometer]]s. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called "modes". [[Longitudinal mode]]s differ only in frequency while [[transverse mode]]s differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. [[Optical ring resonators|Ring resonators]] and [[Whispering gallery|whispering galleries]] are examples of optical resonators that do not form standing waves.

Different resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.

Optical cavities are designed to have a very large [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - ''Q'' factor, quality factor, cavity, resonator, oscillator, frequency standards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A beam reflects a large number of times with little [[attenuation]]—therefore the frequency [[line width]] of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the laser.

Additional optical resonances are [[guided-mode resonance]]s and [[surface plasmon resonance]], which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.

===Orbital resonance===
{{Main|Orbital resonance}}

In [[celestial mechanics]], an [[orbital resonance]] occurs when two [[orbit]]ing bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to their [[orbital period]]s being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear the neighborhood]] around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around them; this effect is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].

=== Atomic, particle, and molecular resonance ===
{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance|Resonance (particle physics)}}

[[File:HWB-NMR - 900MHz - 21.2 Tesla.jpg|thumb|upright|NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK. In its strong 21.2-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] field, the proton resonance is at 900&amp;nbsp;MHz.]]
[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is the name given to a physical resonance phenomenon involving the observation of specific [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties of an [[atom]]ic [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] in the presence of an applied, external magnetic field. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study [[molecular physics]], [[crystallography|crystal]]s, and non-crystalline materials through [[NMR spectroscopy]]. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).

All nuclei containing odd numbers of [[nucleon]]s have an intrinsic [[magnetic moment]] and [[angular momentum]]. A key feature of NMR is that the resonant frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant frequency.

[[Electron paramagnetic resonance]], otherwise known as ''Electron Spin Resonance'' (ESR) is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be [[paramagnetic]].

The [[Mössbauer effect]] is the resonant and [[recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray]] photons by atoms bound in a solid form.

[[Resonance (particle physics)|Resonance in particle physics]] appears in similar circumstances to [[classical physics]] at the level of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. However, they can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula above valid if ''Γ'' is the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] and ''Ω'' replaced by the particle's mass ''M''. In that case, the formula comes from the particle's [[Propagator (Quantum Theory)|propagator]], with its mass replaced by the [[complex number]] ''M''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iΓ''. The formula is further related to the particle's [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] by the [[optical theorem]].

==Theory==
[[File:Universal Resonance Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|"Universal Resonance Curve", a symmetric approximation to the normalized response of a resonant circuit; [[abscissa]] values are deviation from center frequency, in units of center frequency divided by 2Q; [[ordinate]] is relative amplitude, and phase in cycles; dashed curves compare the range of responses of real two-pole circuits for a ''Q'' value of 5; for higher ''Q'' values, there is less deviation from the universal curve. Crosses mark the edges of the 3&amp;nbsp;dB bandwidth (gain 0.707, phase shift 45° or 0.125 cycle).]]

The exact response of a resonance, especially for frequencies far from the resonant frequency, depends on the details of the physical system, and is usually not exactly symmetric about the resonant frequency, as illustrated for the [[simple harmonic oscillator]] above.
For a lightly [[damping|damped]] linear oscillator with a resonance frequency ''Ω'', the ''intensity'' of oscillations ''I'' when the system is driven with a driving frequency ''ω'' is typically approximated by a formula that is symmetric about the resonance frequency:&lt;ref&gt;

:
The intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations. This is a [[Lorentzian function]], or [[Cauchy distribution]], and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. ''Γ'' is a parameter dependent on the [[harmonic oscillator|damping]] of the oscillator, and is known as the ''linewidth'' of the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency. The linewidth is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|inversely proportional]] to the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]], which is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance.

In [[radio engineering]] and [[electronics engineering]], this approximate symmetric response is known as the ''universal resonance curve'', a concept introduced by [[Frederick E. Terman]] in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio circuits with a range of center frequencies and ''Q'' values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Radio Engineering | author = Frederick Emmons Terman | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | year = 1932 | url = https://books.google.com/books?d=8rE8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:terman+inauthor:frederick+universal&amp;dq=inauthor:terman+inauthor:frederick+universal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resonators==
A physical system can have as many resonant frequencies as it has [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]; each degree of freedom can vibrate as a [[harmonic oscillator]]. Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, [[pendulum]]s, [[balance wheel]]s, and [[RLC circuit|LC tuned circuits]] have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as [[Double pendulum|coupled pendulums]] and [[resonant transformer]]s can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.

Extended objects that can experience resonance due to vibrations inside them are called [[resonator]]s, such as [[organ pipe]]s, [[vibrating string]]s, [[quartz crystal]]s, [[microwave]] and [[laser]] [[Resonators#Cavity resonators|cavities]]. Since these can be viewed as being made of millions of coupled moving parts (such as [[atom]]s), they can have millions of resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator. If the distance between the sides is ''d'', the length of a roundtrip is 2''d''. To cause resonance, the phase of a [[sinusoidal]] wave after a roundtrip must be equal to the initial phase, so the waves reinforce the oscillation. So the condition for resonance in a resonator is that the roundtrip distance, 2''d'', be equal to an [[integer]] number of wavelengths ''λ'' of the wave:

:&lt;math&gt;2d = N\lambda,\qquad\qquad N \in \{1,2,3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

If the velocity of a wave is ''v'', the frequency is ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''v''|''λ''}} so the resonant frequencies are:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{Nv}{2d}\qquad\qquad N \in \{1,2,3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

So the resonant frequencies of resonators, called [[normal modes]], are equally spaced multiples of a lowest frequency called the [[fundamental frequency]]. The multiples are often called [[overtone]]s. There may be several such series of resonant frequencies, corresponding to different modes of oscillation.

==''Q'' factor==
{{Main|Q factor}}
The [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] or ''quality factor'' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] parameter that describes how [[damping|under-damped]] an [[oscillation|oscillator]] or [[resonator]] is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electric Power Transformer Engineering | author = James H. Harlow | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8493-1704-0 | pages = 2–216

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or equivalently, characterizes a resonator's [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] relative to its center frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Electronic Circuits: Fundamentals and Applications | author = Michael H. Tooley | publisher = Newnes | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7506-6923-8

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher ''Q'' indicates a lower rate of energy loss relative to the stored energy of the oscillator, i.e., the oscillations die out more slowly. A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high ''Q'', while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low ''Q''. To sustain a system in resonance in constant amplitude by providing power externally, the energy provided in each cycle must be less than the energy stored in the system (i.e., the sum of the potential and kinetic) by a factor of {{sfrac|''Q''|2{{pi}}}}. Oscillators with high-quality factors have low [[damping]], which tends to make them ring longer.

[[sine wave|Sinusoidally]] driven [[resonator]]s having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around the frequency at which they resonate. The range of frequencies at which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-''Q'' [[RLC circuit|tuned circuit]] in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have greater [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See [[oscillator phase noise]].)

The quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system. Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from slamming shut) have ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Clocks, lasers, and other systems that need either strong resonance or high frequency stability need high-quality factors. [[Tuning fork]]s have quality factors around ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1000. The quality factor of [[atomic clock]]s and some high-''Q'' [[optical cavity|lasers]] can reach as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology: ''Q'' factor]&lt;/ref&gt; and higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm Time and Frequency from A to Z: Q to Ra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm |date=2008-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many alternate quantities used by physicists and engineers to describe how damped an oscillator is that are closely related to its quality factor. Important examples include: the [[damping ratio]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|relative bandwidth]], [[oscillator linewidth|linewidth]], and bandwidth measured in [[Octave (electronics)|octave]]s.

'''Sinharaja Forest Reserve''' is a [[national park]] and a [[biodiversity hotspot]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is of international significance and has been designated a [[Biosphere Reserve]] and [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare.

The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the [[Sri Lanka lowland rain forests]] [[ecoregion]], was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988. The reserve's name translates as ''Lion Kingdom''.

The reserve is only {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, and a maximum of {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south, but it is a treasure trove of [[endemic species]], including trees, insects, [[amphibia]]ns, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as [[Yala National Park|Yala]]. There are about 3 [[elephant]]s, and 15 or so{{vague|date=July 2017}} [[leopard]]s. The most common larger mammal is the endemic [[purple-faced langur]].

Birds tend to move in [[Mixed-species feeding flock|mixed feeding flocks]], invariably led by the fearless [[Sri Lanka Crested Drongo]] and the noisy [[orange-billed babbler]]. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive [[red-faced malkoha]], [[green-billed coucal]] and [[Sri Lanka blue magpie]].

Reptiles include the endemic [[Trimeresurus trigonocephalus|green pit viper]] and [[hump-nosed viper]]s, and there are a large variety of amphibians, especially [[tree frog]]s. Invertebrates include the endemic [[common birdwing]], [[butterfly]] and leeches.

== Social Integration ==
The reserve is well-integrated with the local population that are living in some dozens of villages dotted along the border. The villages are more in number along the southern border whilst the presence of some large estates along the northern border has resulted in only a few villages there. The locals collect herbal medicine, edible fruits, nuts, mushrooms, other non-timber forest products including bees honey and a sugary sap collected from a local palm species of the genus Caryota. The sap is converted into jaggery, a local brew and vinegar. Local people walk in the forest to collect above items when they are not busy with their other agricultural pursuits. In addition, the crystal-clear water coming from dozens of streams is the main water source for all people living around the reserve. For generations, local people trekked through the forest from south to north to make their annual pilgrimage to the Adams Peak.

The '''Tamaulipan matorral''' is an [[ecoregion]] in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]] on the eastern slopes of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range in northeastern [[Mexico]]. It is a transitional ecoregion between the [[Tamaulipan mezquital]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] to the west and the [[Veracruz moist forests]] to the south. It is a desert shrubland where the flora mainly consists of woody shrubs, small trees, cacti, and succulents. Piedmont scrub occurs in shallow hollows and montane [[chaparral]] occurs above about {{convert|1700|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. There are a number of resident bird species and the mammals include [[Mexican prairie dog]], [[Saussure's shrew]], [[yellow-faced pocket gopher]], [[Allen's squirrel]], [[collared peccary]] and [[coyote]]. 

==Setting==
The Tamaulipan [[matorral]] extends along the eastern slopes of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range in northeastern Mexico, extending from central [[Tamaulipas]] state across central [[Nuevo León]]. The [[ecoregion]] covers an area of {{convert|16300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The humid [[Veracruz moist forests]] lie to the southeast, on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coastal]] Plain of southern Tamaulipas and Veracruz states; the [[Tamaulipan mezquital]] lies in the [[Rio Grande]] lowlands to the east and northeast. The [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] occupy higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Oriental range to the west.

==Flora==
The ecoregion is predominantly a desert shrubland made up of woody shrubs, small trees, [[Cactus|cacti]], and [[Succulent plant|succulents]]. Dominant plant species include ''[[Cylindropuntia leptocaulis]]'', [[Opuntia engelmannii|''Opuntia engelmannii'' var. ''lindheimeri'']], ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', ''[[Prosopis laevigata|P. laevigata]]'', ''[[Yucca treculeana]]'', ''[[Salvia ballotiflora]]'', ''[[Jatropha dioica]]'', cenizo (''[[Leucophyllum frutescens]]''), ''[[Mammillaria heyderi|Mammillaria heyderi hemisphaerica]]'', tepeguaje (''[[Leucaena pulverulenta]]'') and [[Mimosa aculeaticarpa|''Mimosa aculeaticarpa'' var. ''biuncifera'']]. Piedmont scrub is found in shallow soils derived from sedimentary rocks at the base of the Sierra Madre (below {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and receives {{convert|450|-|900|mm|in|abbr=on}} of annual rainfall. It is composed of relatively short plants ({{convert|3|to|5|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} in height) such as ''[[Helietta parvifolia]]'', ''[[Neopringlea integrifolia]]'' and ''[[Acacia]]'' spp. Montane [[chaparral]] is a distinct plant community found above {{convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Sierra Madre Oriental, composed of [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.), ''[[Arbutus]]'', [[Yucca]], ''[[Cercocarpus]]'', and ''[[Bauhinia]]''.&lt;ref name=Full&gt;{{cite web  |title=WWF Full Reports |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Mammals present in this ecoregion include the [[Mexican prairie dog]] (''Cynomys mexicanus''), [[Saussure's shrew]] (''Sorex saussurei''), [[yellow-faced pocket gopher]] (''Pappogeomys castanops''), [[Allen's squirrel]] (''Sciurus alleni''), [[collared peccary]] (''Pecari tajacu'') and [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''). Birds such as the [[burrowing owl]] (''Athene cunicularia''), [[hooded oriole]] (''Icterus cucullates''), [[eastern meadowlark]] (''Sturnella magna''), [[long-billed thrasher]] (''Toxostoma longirostre''), [[hooded yellowthroat]] (''Geothlypis nelsoni''), [[blue bunting]] (''Cyanocompsa parellina'') and [[olive sparrow]] (''Arremonops rufivirgatus'') are resident.&lt;ref name=Full/&gt;

'''Titian Ramsay Peale''' (November 17, 1799 – March 13, 1885)&lt;ref&gt;Sterling (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was an American artist, naturalist, and explorer. He was a noted scientific illustrator whose paintings and drawings of wildlife were known for their beauty and accuracy. He participated as a naturalist in several scientific surveys, in particular he accompanied [[Stephen Harriman Long]] in 1819 to explore the Rocky Mountains and later served on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] (1838-1842).

==Biography==
[[File:Titian Ramsay Peale.jpg|thumb|left|Titian Ramsay Peale]]
[[File:Titian Ramsey Peale's painting 'Kilauea', 1842.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Titian Ramsay Peale's painting ''Kilauea'', 1842]]
Peale was born on November 17, 1799 in Philadelphia, the youngest son of noted artist and naturalist, [[Charles Willson Peale]]. He was first exposed to the study of [[natural history]] while assisting his father on his many excursions in search of specimens for the [[Peale Museum]]. The family moved to [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]], outside of Philadelphia, where he began collecting and drawing [[butterflies]] and other insects. Although some of his butterfly and moth illustrations were ultimately published, the majority remained unpublished until recently.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Like his older brothers [[Raphaelle Peale|Raphaelle]], [[Rembrandt Peale|Rembrandt]], and [[Rubens Peale|Rubens]] Peale, Titian helped his father in the preservation of the museum's specimens for display, which included contributions from [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].

His drawings were published in [[Thomas Say]]'s ''American Entomology'' as early as 1816, and he was soon after elected to the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]]. 

Peale took part in the 1817 expedition of the Academy of Natural Sciences to Florida and Georgia, together with Thomas Say, [[George Ord]] and [[William Maclure]]. He was assistant to Say on the expedition to the [[Rocky Mountains]] led by [[Stephen Harriman Long]] in 1819. The collection submitted to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia from this expedition included 122 drawings by Peale.  He acquired a wild turkey for the museum's collections.

[[File:Automeris io Titian Peale 1833.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Automeris io]]'' 1833]]
Peale provided illustrations for Say's ''American Entomology'' (1824–28) and [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]]'s ''American Ornithology'' (1825–33). He also undertook a collecting expedition to Florida on behalf of Bonaparte.

In 1831, Peale published a pamphlet known as ''Circular of the Philadelphia Museum: Containing Direction for the Preservation and Preparation of Objects of Natural History''.  The Peale museum continued to gain a worldwide reputation.  He developed an effective method for storing butterflies in sealed cases with glass fronts and backs. As a result, parts of his collection have been preserved until the present day. His meticulous collection of over 100 separate butterfly species was often praised for the brilliance and vibrancy of the insects' colors.

In 1838, two years after [[Charles Darwin]] had returned from his voyage on the ''Beagle'', Peale took leave from his work at the museum to sail aboard the ''Peacock'' as chief naturalist for the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842]] led by Lt. [[Charles Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=A.|date=May 1, 2011|title=From the Pacific to the Patent Office: The US Exploring Expedition and the origins of America's first national museum|url=https://academic.oup.com/jhc/article-abstract/23/1/49/628187/From-the-Pacific-to-the-Patent-Office-The-US|journal=Journal of the History of Collections|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=49–74|doi=10.1093/jhc/fhq002|issn=0954-6650}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chief naturalist, he collected and preserved various specimens of natural history, many of which he packed and shipped back to the museum. Peale's post-expedition report, ''Mammalia and Ornithology'' (1848), was suppressed due to objections by Wilkes and [[John Cassin]]. Cassin was hired to produce a corrected volume, which was published in 1858. During the expedition, Wilkes named [[Peale Passage]] after Titian Peale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 1843, financial pressures forced Peale to sell the bankrupt museum at a sheriff's sale to Isaac Brown Parker. Peale went on to work for the [[U.S. Patent Office]] and to become a pioneer American [[photographer]].

'''Ultra low velocity zones''' (ULVZs) are patches on the [[core-mantle boundary]] that have extremely low [[Seismic velocity|seismic velocities]]. The zones are mapped to be hundreds of kilometers in diameter and tens of kilometers thick. Their [[shear wave]] velocities can be up to 30% lower than surrounding material. The composition and origin of the zones remain uncertain. The zones appear to correlate with edges of the African and Pacific [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces]] (LLSVPs)&lt;ref name="McNamara2010"&gt;

==Discovery and constraints==
ULVZs are discovered by the delay and scattering of [[body wave (seismology)|body waves]] that reflect and diffract on or are refracted by the [[core-mantle boundary]]. Different body waves types give different constraints on the dimensions or velocity contrasts of the ULVZ. Even though ULVZs are discovered in places, it remains difficult to map out their extent and constrain their density and velocity. Usually trade-offs between various parameters exist. In general though, ULVZs appear to be a hundred to a thousand kilometers across and tens of kilometers thick (although existing thinner or smaller ULVZs might fall below the resolution of seismology). Their shear wave velocity reduction is on the order of -10 to -30% and the compressional wave velocity reduction tends to be weaker.&lt;ref name=Williams1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cottaar2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorne2013 /&gt;

==Distribution and dynamics==
ULVZs have higher density than their surroundings to remain stable on the core-mantle boundary. In a general mantle convection setting, the density contrast as well as the amount of material available would control the morphology/shape of the ULVZ.&lt;ref name="Bower2011"&gt;

It is mapped out to be roughly 1000&amp;nbsp;km across and 20&amp;nbsp;km high. Its large aspect ratio dynamically suggests it is very dense.&lt;ref name="Bower2011" /&gt; Its shear wave velocity reduction is roughly 20% compared to surrounding material. It remains speculative if there is a correlation between this large ULVZ and the presence of the strongest hotspot flux at the surface; potentially the ULVZ could be an anchor to a whole-mantle plume.

The '''von Kármán wind turbulence model''', also known as '''von Kármán gusts''', is a mathematical model of [[continuous gusts]]. It matches observed continuous gusts better than that [[Dryden Wind Turbulence Model]]{{sfn|Hoblit|1988|loc=Chap. 4}} and is the preferred model of the [[United States Department of Defense]] in most aircraft design and simulation applications.{{sfn|MIL-STD-1797A|1990|p=678}} The von Kármán model treats the linear and angular velocity components of continuous gusts as spatially varying [[stochastic process]]es and specifies each component's [[power spectral density]]. The von Kármán wind turbulence model is characterized by [[Rational function|irrational]] power spectral densities, so filters can be designed that take [[white noise]] inputs and output stochastic processes with the approximated von Kármán gusts' power spectral densities.

== History ==

The von Kármán wind turbulence model first appeared in a 1957 [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Diedrich| first=Franklin W.|author2=Joseph A. Drischler | title=Effect of Spanwise Variations in Gust Intensity on the Lift Due to Atmospheric Turbulence|year=1957|pages=NACA TN 3920}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on earlier work by [[Theodore von Kármán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Kármán|first=Theodore|author2=Leslie Howarth |title=On the Statistical Theory of Isotropic Turbulence|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

== Power spectral densities ==

The von Kármán model is characterized by power spectral densities for gusts' three linear velocity components (''u&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'',''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'',''w&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''),

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \Phi_{u_g}(\Omega)&amp;=\sigma_u^2\frac{2 L_u}{\pi} \frac{1}{ \left(1+ (1.339 L_u \Omega)^2 \right)^\frac{5}{6}} \\
 \Phi_{v_g}(\Omega)&amp;=\sigma_v^2\frac{2L_v}{\pi} \frac{1+\frac{8}{3}(2.678 L_v \Omega)^2}{\left(1+ (2.678 L_v \Omega)^2 \right)^{\frac{11}{6}}} \\
 \Phi_{w_g}(\Omega)&amp;=\sigma_w^2\frac{2 L_w}{\pi} \frac{1+\frac{8}{3}(2.678 L_w \Omega)^2}{\left(1+ (2.678 L_w \Omega)^2 \right)^{\frac{11}{6}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the turbulence intensity and scale length, respectively, for the ''i''th velocity component, and ''Ω'' is a spatial frequency.{{sfn|MIL-STD-1797A|1990|p=678}} These power spectral densities give the stochastic process spatial variations, but any temporal variations rely on vehicle motion through the gust velocity field. The speed with which the vehicle is moving through the gust field ''V'' allows conversion of these power spectral densities to different types of frequencies,{{sfn|Hoblit|1988|p=***}}

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \Omega &amp;= \frac{\omega}{V} \\
 \Phi_i(\Omega) &amp;= V\Phi_i\left(\frac{\omega}{V} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ω has units of radians per unit time.

The gust angular velocity components (''p&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'',''q&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'',''r&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') are defined as the variations of the linear velocity components along the different vehicle axes,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 p_g &amp;= \frac{\partial w_g}{\partial y} \\
 q_g &amp;= \frac{\partial w_g}{\partial x} \\
 r_g &amp;= -\frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

though different sign conventions may be used in some sources. The power spectral densities for the angular velocity components are&lt;ref name="MATLAB von Karman"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \Phi_{p_g}(\omega) &amp;= \frac{\sigma_w^2}{2VL_w}\frac{0.8\left(\frac{2\pi L_w}{4b}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}{1+ \left(\frac{4b\omega}{\pi V}\right)^2} \\
 \Phi_{q_g}(\omega) &amp;= \frac{\pm \left( \frac{\omega}{V} \right)^2}{1+ \left( \frac{4b\omega}{\pi V} \right)^2} \Phi_{w_g}(\omega) \\
 \Phi_{r_g}(\omega) &amp;= \frac{\mp \left( \frac{\omega}{V} \right)^2}{1+ \left( \frac{3b\omega}{\pi V} \right)^2} \Phi_{v_g}(\omega)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The military specifications give criteria based on vehicle [[stability derivatives]] to determine whether the gust angular velocity components are significant.{{sfn|MIL-STD-1797A|1990|p=680}}

== Spectral factorization ==

The gusts generated by the von Kármán model are not a [[white noise]] process and therefore may be referred to as [[Colors of noise|colored noise]]. Colored noise may, in some circumstances, be generated as the output of a [[minimum phase]] [[linear filter]] through a process known as spectral factorization. Consider a [[LTI system theory|linear time invariant system]] with a white noise input that has unit [[variance]], [[transfer function]] ''G''(''s''), and output ''y''(''t''). The power spectral density of ''y''(''t'') is

&lt;math&gt; \Phi_y(\omega) = |G(i\omega)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1. For irrational power spectral densities, such as that of the von Kármán model, a suitable transfer function can be found whose magnitude squared evaluated along the imaginary axis approximates the power spectral density. The [[MATLAB]] documentation provides a realization of such a transfer function for von Kármán gusts that is consistent with the military specifications,&lt;ref name="MATLAB von Karman"&gt;{{cite web| title = Von Karman Wind Turbulence Model (Continuous)| work = MATLAB Reference Pages| publisher = The MathWorks, Inc.| year = 2010| accessdate = May 24, 2013| url = http://www.mathworks.com/help/aeroblks/drydenwindturbulencemodelcontinuous.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 G_{u_g}(s) &amp;= \frac{ \sigma_u \sqrt{\frac{2L_u}{\pi V}} \left(1+0.25\frac{L_u}{V}s \right)}{1+1.357\frac{L_u}{V}s+0.1987\left(\frac{L_u}{V}s\right)^2} \\
 G_{v_g}(s) &amp;= \frac{ \sigma_v \sqrt{\frac{2L_v}{\pi V}} \left( 1+2.7478\frac{2L_v}{V}s + 0.3398\left(\frac{2L_v}{V}s\right)^2 \right)}{1+ 2.9958\frac{2L_v}{V}s + 1.9754 \left(\frac{2L_v}{V}s\right)^2 + 0.1539 \left(\frac{2L_v}{V}s\right)^3} \\
 G_{w_g}(s) &amp;= \frac{ \sigma_w \sqrt{\frac{2L_w}{\pi V}} \left( 1+2.7478\frac{2L_w}{V}s + 0.3398\left(\frac{2L_w}{V}s\right)^2 \right)}{1+ 2.9958\frac{2L_w}{V}s + 1.9754 \left(\frac{2L_w}{V}s\right)^2 + 0.1539 \left(\frac{2L_w}{V}s\right)^3} \\
 G_{p_g}(s) &amp;= \sigma_w \sqrt{\frac{0.8}{V}} \frac{ \left( \frac{\pi}{4b} \right)^{\frac{1}{6}} }{(2L_w)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left(1 + \frac{4b}{\pi V}s \right)} \\
 G_{q_g}(s) &amp;= \frac{ \pm \frac{s}{V}}{1+\frac{4b}{\pi V}s} G_{w_g}(s) \\
 G_{r_g}(s) &amp;= \frac{ \mp \frac{s}{V}}{1+\frac{3b}{\pi V}s} G_{v_g}(s)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Driving these filters with independent, unit variance, band-limited white noise yields outputs with power spectral densities that approximate the power spectral densities of the velocity components of the von Kármán model. The outputs can, in turn, be used as wind disturbance inputs for aircraft or other dynamic systems.{{sfn|Richardson|2013|p=33}}

== Altitude dependence ==

{{See|Continuous Gusts#Altitude Dependence}}

The von Kármán model is parameterized by a length scale and turbulence intensity. The combination of these two parameters determine the shape of the power spectral densities and therefore the quality of the model's fit to spectra of observed turbulence. Many combinations of length scale and turbulence intensity give realistic power spectral densities in the desired frequency ranges.{{sfn|Hoblit|1988|loc=Chap. 4}} The Department of Defense specifications include choices for both parameters, including their dependence on altitude.{{sfn|MIL-STD-1797A|1990|pp=673, 678-685, 702}}
