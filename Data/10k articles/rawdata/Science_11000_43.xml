'''The American Association for the Advancement of Science''' ('''AAAS''') is an American international [[non-profit organization]] with the stated goals of promoting cooperation among [[scientist]]s, defending [[scientific freedom]], encouraging scientific responsibility, and supporting [[science education|scientific education]] and [[science outreach]] for the betterment of all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaas.org/about/mission-and-history|title=About AAAS|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's largest general scientific society, with over 120,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://membercentral.aaas.org/about|title=About – AAAS MemberCentral|website=membercentral.aaas.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the publisher of the well-known scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' which had a weekly circulation of 138,549 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpaww.com/library/index.cgi BPA Worldwide], June 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723183536/http://www.bpaww.com/library/index.cgi |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Creation===
The American Association for the Advancement of Science was created on September 20, 1848 at the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was a reformation of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS Origins: 1848–1899|url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/origins2.php|publisher=AAAS|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society chose [[William Charles Redfield]] as their first president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reingold|first=Nathan|title=Science in Nineteenth-Century America: A Documentary History|year=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-70947-7|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  because he had proposed the most comprehensive plans for the organization. According to the first constitution which was agreed to at the September 20 meeting, the goal of the society was to promote scientific dialogue in order to allow for greater scientific collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.aaas.org/docs/documents.php?doc_id=413|title=1856 AAAS Constitution|website=AAAS Archives &amp; Records Center |publisher=AAAS|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so the association aimed to use resources to conduct science with increased efficiency and allow for scientific progress at a greater rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visionlearning.com/en/library/Process-of-Science/49/The-How-and-Why-of-Scientific-Meetings/186|title=The How and Why of Scientific Meetings|publisher=Visionlearning|date=2011|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association also sought to increase the resources available to the scientific community through active advocacy of science.  There were only 78 members when the AAAS was formed.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2013/09/20|title=Sep. 20, 2013|publisher=The Writer's Almanac|date=20 September 2013|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the new scientific body, [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], [[USN]] was one of those who attended the first 1848 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/library/historical/images-of-historical-objects-artwork-in-library/portraits/maury1.jpg/view|title=Lt. Matthew Fontaine Maury|publisher=Naval Oceanographic Portal|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting held on Friday afternoon, September 22, 1848, Redfield presided, and [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] gave a full scientific report on his ''Wind and Current Charts''. Maury stated that hundreds of ship navigators were now sending abstract logs of their voyages to the [[United States Naval Observatory]].  He added, "Never before was such a corps of observers known."&lt;ref name="Almanac" /&gt; But, he pointed out to his fellow scientists, his critical need was for more "simultaneous observations."  "The work," Maury stated, "is not exclusively for the benefit of any nation or age." The minutes of the AAAS meeting reveal that because of the universality of this "view on the subject, it was suggested whether the states of Christendom might not be induced to cooperate with their Navies in the undertaking; at least so far as to cause abstracts of their log-books and sea journals to be furnished to [[Matthew Fontaine Maury|Matthew F. Maury]], [[USN]], at the Naval Observatory at Washington."

[[William Barton Rogers]], professor at the [[University of Virginia]] and later founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a resolution: "Resolved that a Committee of five be appointed to address a memorial to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting his further aid in procuring for Matthew Maury the use of the observations of European and other foreign navigators, for the extension and perfecting of his charts of winds and currents." The resolution was adopted and, in addition to Rogers, the following members of the association were appointed to the committee: Professor Joseph Henry of Washington; Professor Benjamin Peirce of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Professor James H. Coffin of Easton, Pennsylvania, and Professor Stephen Alexander of Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaas.org/page/articles-incorporation-american-association-advancement-science|title=Articles of Incorporation of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|publisher=AAAS|date=1993|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was scientific cooperation, and Maury went back to Washington with great hopes for the future.

===Growth and Civil War dormancy===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
By 1860, membership increased to over 2,000. The AAAS became dormant during the [[American Civil War]]; their August 1861 meeting in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] was postponed indefinitely after the outbreak of the first major engagement of the war at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]]. The AAAS did not become a permanent casualty of the war.

In 1866, [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|Frederick Barnard]] presided over the first meeting of the resurrected AAAS at a meeting in [[New York City]].  Following the revival of the AAAS, the group had considerable growth. The AAAS permitted all people, regardless of scientific credentials, to join. The AAAS did, however, institute a policy of granting the title of "[[Fellow of the AAAS]]" to well-respected scientists within the organization.  The years of peace brought the development and expansion of other scientific-oriented groups. The AAAS's focus on the unification of many fields of science under a single organization was in contrast to the many new science organizations founded to promote a single discipline. For example, the [[American Chemical Society]], founded in 1876, promotes [[chemistry]].

In 1863, the US Congress established the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], another multidisciplinary sciences organization. It elects members based on recommendations from colleagues and the value of published works.

===Advocacy===
[[Alan I. Leshner]], AAAS CEO from 2001 until 2015, published many op-ed articles discussing how many people integrate science and religion in their lives. He has opposed the insertion of non-scientific content, such as [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]], into the scientific curriculum of schools.&lt;ref name="shreveport times"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2008/media/0529shreveport_leshner.pdf "'Academic Freedom' Bill Dangerous Distraction,"] Alan I. Leshner, ''The Shreveport Times'' 28 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times picayune"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/media/20080506_times_picayune.pdf "Anti-science law threatens tech jobs of future,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200500/http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/media/20080506_times_picayune.pdf |date=2009-04-29 }} Alan I.

Leshner, ''The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Chronicle Review'' 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the AAAS adopted an official statement on [[climate change]], in which they stated, "The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society....The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control [[greenhouse gas emissions]] is now."&lt;ref name="aaas board"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/climate_change/mtg_200702/aaas_climate_statement.pdf AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change] ''www.aaas.org'' December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the AAAS used satellite images to document human rights abuses in [[Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencemode.com/2007/09/28/satellite-images-verify-myanmar-forced-relocations-mounting-military-presence/ |title=Satellite Images Verify Myanmar Forced Relocations, Mounting Military Presence |accessdate=2007-10-01 |publisher=ScienceMode |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226124205/http://sciencemode.com/2007/09/28/satellite-images-verify-myanmar-forced-relocations-mounting-military-presence/ |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, AAAS launched the Center for Science Diplomacy to advance both science and the broader relationships among partner countries, by promoting [[science diplomacy]] and international scientific cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;

====Sections of the AAAS====
The AAAS has 24 "sections" with each section being responsible for a particular concern of the AAAS. There are sections for [[agriculture]], [[anthropology]], [[astronomy]], [[atmospheric science]], [[biological science]], [[chemistry]], [[dentistry]], [[education]], [[engineering]], general interest in science and engineering, [[geology]] and [[geography]], the [[History of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]], [[technology]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[medical science]], [[neuroscience]], [[pharmaceutical science]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], science and human rights, [[social science|social]] and [[political science]], the social impact of science and engineering, and [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/organization/sections/index.shtml AAAS Sections], ''AAAS.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Affiliates====
AAAS affiliates include 262 societies and [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]], serving more than 10 million members, from the [[Acoustical Society of America]] to the [[Wildlife Society]], as well as non-mainstream groups like the [[Parapsychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/affiliates/#P list of affiliates starting with the letter '''P'''].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Council===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] --&gt;
The Council is composed of the members of the Board of Directors, the retiring section chairmen, elected delegates and affiliated foreign council members. Among the elected delegates there are always at least two members from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and one from each region of the country. The President of the AAAS serves as the Chairperson of the Council. Members serve the Council for a term of three years.

The council meets annually to discuss matters of importance to the AAAS. They have the power to review all activities of the Association, elect new fellows, adopt resolutions, propose amendments to the Association's constitution and bylaws, create new scientific sections, and organize and aid local chapters of the AAAS. The Council recently has new additions to it from different sections which include many youngsters as well. John Kerry of Chicago is the youngest American in the council and Akhil Ennamsetty of India is the youngest foreign council member.

===Board of directors===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] --&gt;
The board of directors is composed of a chairperson, the president, and the president-elect along with eight elected directors, the executive officer of the association and up to two additional directors appointed by elected officers. Members serve a four-year term except for directors appointed by elected officers, who serve three-year terms.

The current chairman is [[Gerald Fink]], Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor at Whitehead Institute, MIT. Fink will serve in the post until the end of the 2016 AAAS Annual Meeting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/about-aaas Board of Directors], ''AAAS.org''&lt;/ref&gt; 15 February 2016.&lt;ref name="Annual Meeting Date"&gt;[http://meetings.aaas.org// 2016 AAAS Annual Meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928081654/http://meetings.aaas.org/ |date=2015-09-28 }}, ''AAAS.org''&lt;/ref&gt; (The chairperson is always the immediate past-president of AAAS.)

The board of directors has a variety of powers and responsibilities. It is charged with the administration of all association funds, publication of a budget, appointment of administrators, proposition of amendments, and determining the time and place of meetings of the national association. The board may also speak publicly on behalf of the association. The board must also regularly correspond with the council to discuss their actions.

==AAAS Fellows==
The AAAS council elects every year, its members who are distinguished scientifically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/general-process|title=General Process|website=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to the grade of fellow ('''FAAAS'''). Election to AAAS is an honor bestowed by their peers and elected fellows are presented with a certificate and rosette pin.

==Meetings==
Formal meetings of the AAAS are numbered consecutively, starting with the first meeting in 1848. Meetings were not held 1861–1865 during the [[American Civil War]], and also 1942–1943 during [[World War II]]. Since 1946, one meeting has occurred annually, now customarily in February.

== Awards ==
Each year, the AAAS gives out a number of honorary awards, most of which focus on [[science communication]], journalism, and outreach — sometimes in partnership with other organizations. The awards recognize "scientists, journalists, and public servants for significant contributions to science and to the public’s understanding of science.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/page/aaas-awards|title=AAAS Awards|date=2013-06-19|website=AAAS.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are presented each year at the association’s annual meeting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14357">The '''basic needs''' approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of [[absolute poverty]] in developing countries.  It attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term [[physical well-being]], usually in terms of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption goods]].  The [[poverty line]] is then defined as the amount of [[income]] required to satisfy those needs. The 'basic needs' approach was introduced by the International Labour Organization's World Employment Conference in 1976.&lt;ref name="ILO_WEC1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/genericdocument/wcms_193047.pdf|format=PDF|title=The World Employment Programme at ILO|access-date=2013-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319063854/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/genericdocument/wcms_193047.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO1976"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Employment Conference: The Enthronement of Basic Needs|author=Richard Jolly|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.1976.tb00338.x|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=A9|number=2|pages=31–44|date=October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps the high point of the WEP was the World Employment Conference of 1976, which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy. The basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers’ and employers’ organizations from all over the world. It influenced the programmes and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and was the precursor to the human development approach."&lt;ref name="ILO_WEC1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO1976" /&gt;

A traditional list of immediate "basic needs" is [[food]] (including [[water]]), [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] and [[clothing]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-930390-94-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Denton, John A. |title=Society and the official world: a reintroduction to sociology |publisher=General Hall |location=Dix Hills, N.Y |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-930390-94-5 |oclc= |doi= |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs' of not just food, water, clothing and shelter, but also [[sanitation]], [[education]], [[healthcare]], and [[internet]].  Different agencies use different lists.

The basic needs approach has been described as consumption-oriented, giving the impression "that poverty elimination is all too easy."&lt;ref name=basicneeds1978&gt;{{cite journal|title=Basic Needs and its Critics|author=Dharam Ghai|journal=Institute of Development Studies|volume=9|number=4|pages=16–18|date=June 1978|doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.1978.mp9004004.x|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/10859}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] focused on 'capabilities' rather than consumption.

In the [[Economic development|development]] discourse, the basic needs model focuses on the measurement of what is believed to be an eradicable level of [[poverty]].  [[Social development|Development programs]] following the basic needs approach do not invest in [[productivity|economically productive]] activities that will help a [[society]] carry its own weight in the future, rather it focuses on allowing the society to consume just enough to rise above the poverty line and meet its basic needs. These programs focus more on subsistence than fairness.  Nevertheless, in terms of "measurement", the basic needs or absolute approach is important.  The 1995 world summit on social development in Copenhagen had, as one of its principal declarations that all nations of the world should develop measures of both absolute and [[relative poverty]] and should gear national policies to "eradicate absolute poverty by a target date specified by each country in its national context."&lt;ref name="urlUnited Nations Division for Sustainable Development- Sustainable Development Issues - Poverty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/poverty/poverty_decisions|title=United Nations Division for Sustainable Development-Sustainable Development Issues - Poverty|accessdate=2008-06-20|publisher=United Nations| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726160118/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/poverty/poverty_decisions| archivedate= 26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

Professor Chris Sarlo, an [[economist]] at [[Nipissing University]] in [[North Bay, Ontario]], [[Canada]] and a senior fellow of the [[Fraser Institute]], uses [[Statistics Canada]]'s socio-economic databases, particularly the ''Survey of Household Spending'' to determine the cost of a list of household necessities.  The list includes [[food]], shelter, [[clothing]], [[health care]], [[Hygiene|personal care]], [[furniture|essential furnishings]], [[transportation]] and [[communication]], [[laundry]], [[home insurance]], and miscellaneous; it assumes that education is provided freely to all residents of Canada.  This is calculated for various communities across Canada and adjusted for family size.  With this information, he determines the proportion of Canadian households that have insufficient income to afford those necessities. Based on his basic needs [[poverty threshold]], the poverty rate in Canada, the poverty rate has declined from about 12% of Canadian households to about 5% since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fraserinstitute.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=3443 Poverty in Canada: 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521081014/https://www.fraserinstitute.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=3443 |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in sharp contrast to the results of Statistic Canada, Conference Board of Canada, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and UNESCO reports using the relative poverty measure considered to the most useful for advanced industrial nations like Canada, which Sarlo rejects.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In 1992 Sarlo argued that the difference between absolute and relative poverty thresholds is artificial since "what is considered to be a necessity depends to some extent on the conditions in the larger society in which one is a member (Sarlo 1992: 19)." In 1992 and again in 2001 Sarlo clarified that the basic needs poverty line is not absolute but relative, since the poverty threshold must be "connected to the society in which people live" but that an "aspect of poverty remains timeless" (Sarlo 2001:11). This is the "irreducible core of necessities invariant through time:"..."water, food, shelter and clothing (Sarlo 1992: 19)" which remains the same through time but the "quantity and quality" are relative to one's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

OECD and UNICEF rate Canada's poverty rate much higher using a relative poverty threshold. Statistics Canada's LICO, which Sarlo also rejects, also result in higher poverty rates. According to a 2008 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the rate of poverty in Canada, is among the highest of the OECD member nations, the world's wealthiest industrialized nations.&lt;ref name=OECD2008&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|year=2008|title=Growing unequal? Income distribution and poverty in OECD countries|location=Paris, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no official government definition and therefore, measure, for [[poverty]] in Canada. However, Dennis Raphael, author of ''Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life''&lt;ref name=povincanada&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cspi.org/books/poverty_canada|author=DennisRaphael Foreword by Rob Rainer and Jack Layton|title=Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|date=13 April 2007|isbn=978-1551303239|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=povincanada2011&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cspi.org/books/poverty_canada|author=DennisRaphael Foreword by Rob Rainer and [[Jack Layton]]|title=Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|year=2011|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP), the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Conference Board of Canada "uses the OECD’s relative measure of child poverty, which calculates the proportion of children living in households where disposable income is less than 50 per cent of the median in each country." The Conference Board 2013 cautioned that Canada’s high poverty rate, ranks among the worst of the 17 countries they compared. "Canada’s child poverty rate was 15.1 per cent, up from 12.8 per cent in the mid-1990s.

==The Philippines==

The Municipality of [[Rosario, Batangas]], [[Philippines]] implemented its Aksyon ng Bayan Rosario 2001 And Beyond Human and Ecological Security Plan using this concept as a core strategy through the ''Minimum Basic Needs Approach to Improved Quality of Life - Community-Based Information System (MBN-CBIS)'' prescribed by the Philippine Government.  This approach helped the municipal government identify priority families and communities for intervention, as well as rationalize the allocation of its social development funds.

==United States==

In the United States, the equivalent measures are called ''self-sufficiency standards'' or ''living income standards''.  Unlike the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL), which is calculated from a single, national variable (cost of food), these models assume that different households have different needs, based on factors such as the number and age of children in the household, and the cost of housing in the particular area (usually a county) that they live in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/pdf/SSS-FAQ.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers]&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the principles of basic needs, these measurements do not include any extra money for entertainment, savings, debt payment, or unusual or avoidable expenses, such as vehicle repairs.  It assumes that adults will be working and pay taxes; it also includes costs of all government, charitable, and family subsidies, such as free medical care through [[Medicaid]], free food from the USDA [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] program or a [[food bank]], or free [[childcare]] from a grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820005813/http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }} Family Economic Self-Sufficiency by Diana Pearce at Wider Opportunities for Women&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these costs are ignored by the official FPL measurement, but included in a self-sufficiency standard.

Minimum expenses vary by region.  For housing, child care, food, transportation, health care, and other necessary expenses, plus net taxes, a family in middle-class [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]] in northwestern [[Pennsylvania]] of one adult and two children (one preschooler, one school-aged) needed a minimum income of $30,269 to pay its own way in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/state-resources/SSS/The%20Self-Sufficiency%20Standard%20for%20Pennsylvania%202006.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Pennsylvania 2006] by Diana Pearce, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Child care]] is the largest expense in this budget, followed by housing, taxes, and food.  The same family, living in the wealthy [[King County, Washington|Seattle region]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] would need to earn $48,269 to be self-sufficient while remaining in that location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowonline.org/ourprograms/fess/state-resources/documents/WASSSfullreport6-29-07.pdf The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Washington 2006] by Diana Pearce, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt; These figures contrast sharply with the FPL for that year, which was just $16,600 for any three-person household.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">The '''caloric theory''' is an [[obsolete scientific theory]] that [[heat]] consists of a self-repellent fluid called '''caloric''' that flows from hotter bodies to colder bodies.  Caloric was also thought of as a weightless gas that could pass in and out of pores in solids and liquids. The "caloric theory" was superseded by the mid-19th century in favor of the [[mechanical theory of heat]], but nevertheless persisted in some scientific literature—particularly in more popular treatments—until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The 1880 edition of [[A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar#Caloric theory|A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar]], a 19th century educational science book, explained heat transfer in terms of the flow of caloric&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The world’s first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782-83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the [[heat]] involved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]’s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].]]
In the [[history of thermodynamics]], the initial explanations of heat were thoroughly confused with explanations of [[combustion]]. After [[J. J. Becher]] and [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] introduced the [[phlogiston]] theory of combustion in the 17th century, phlogiston was thought to be the ''substance of heat.''

There is one version of the caloric theory that was introduced by [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Lavoisier developed the explanation of combustion in terms of [[oxygen]] in the 1770s. In his paper "Réflexions sur le phlogistique" (1783), Lavoisier argued that [[phlogiston theory]] was inconsistent with his experimental results, and proposed a 'subtle fluid' called '''caloric''' as the ''substance of heat''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas W. Best, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10698-015-9236-x Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' II: On the Nature of Heat], ''[[Foundations of Chemistry]]'', 2016, '''18''', 3-13. In this early work, Lavoisier calls it “igneous fluid”. The term “caloric” was not coined until 1787, when [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], used ''calorique'' in a work he co-edited with Lavoisier ([https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0MMPAAAAQAAJ_2 "Mémoire sur le développement des principes de la nomenclature méthodique"] in Guyton de Morveau, L.-B., Lavoisier, A.-L., Bertholet, C.-L., Fourcroy, A.-F. (eds.) ''Méthode de nomenclature chimique'', pp. 26–74. Cuchet, Paris). The word “caloric” was first used in English in a translation of Guyton's essay by James St John ("A memoir to explain the principles of the methodical nomenclature" in ''Method of Chymical Nomenclature'', Kearsley, London (1788), pp. 19–50, at p. 22).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the quantity of this substance is constant throughout the universe,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it flows from warmer to colder bodies. Indeed, Lavoisier was one of the first to use a [[calorimeter]] to measure the heat changes during chemical reaction.

In the 1780s, some believed that cold was a fluid, "frigoric". [[Pierre Prévost]] argued that cold was simply a lack of caloric.

Since heat was a material substance in caloric theory, and therefore could neither be created nor destroyed, [[Conservation law|conservation]] of heat was a central assumption.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot, Sadi]] (1824). ''Réflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the caloric theory was also influenced by the experiments of [[Joseph Black]] related to the thermal properties of materials. Besides the caloric theory, another theory existed in the late eighteenth century that could explain the phenomenon of heat: the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]. The two theories were considered to be equivalent at the time, but kinetic theory was the more modern one, as it used a few ideas from [[atomic theory]] and could explain both combustion and calorimetry.

==Successes==
Quite a number of successful explanations can be, and were, made from these hypotheses alone. We can explain the cooling of a cup of tea in room temperature: caloric is self-repelling, and thus slowly&lt;!--why thus slowly?--&gt; flows from regions dense in caloric (the hot water) to regions less dense in caloric (the cooler air in the room).

We can explain the expansion of air under heat: caloric is absorbed into the air, which increases its [[volume]]. If we say a little more about what happens to caloric during this absorption phenomenon, we can explain the [[thermal radiation|radiation]] of heat, the [[phase transition|state changes]] of matter under various temperatures, and deduce nearly all of the [[gas law]]s.

[[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] developed his principle of the [[Carnot cycle]], which still forms the basis of [[heat engine]] theory, solely from the caloric viewpoint.

However, one of the greatest apparent confirmations of the caloric theory was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s theoretical correction of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]’s calculation of the [[speed of sound]]. Newton had assumed an [[Isothermal_process|isothermal]] process, while Laplace, a calorist, treated it as [[Adiabatic_Process|adiabatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cTPI90LwlkC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115|page=115|title=Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth|first=Stathis|last=Psillos|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-203-97964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This addition not only substantially corrected the theoretical prediction of the speed of sound, but also continued to make even more accurate predictions for almost a century afterward, even as measurements became more precise.

==Later developments==
In 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]] published ''[[An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction]]'', a report on his investigation of the heat produced while [[manufacturing]] [[cannon]]s. He had found that [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] a cannon repeatedly does not result in a loss of its ability to produce heat, and therefore no loss of '''caloric'''. This suggested that '''caloric''' could not be a conserved "substance" though the experimental uncertainties in his experiment were widely debated.

His results were not seen as a "threat" to caloric theory at the time, as this theory was considered to be equivalent to the alternative [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier, A.-L. de]] (1783). ''Mémoire sur la chaleur, lu à l'Académie royale des sciences, le 28 juin 1783, par MM. Lavoisier et de La Place''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, to some of his contemporaries, the results added to the understanding of caloric theory.
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|Joule's apparatus for measuring the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]].]]
Rumford's experiment inspired the work of [[James Prescott Joule]] and others towards the middle of the 19th century. In 1850, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published a paper showing that the two theories were indeed compatible, as long as the calorists' principle of the conservation of heat was replaced by a principle of [[conservation of energy]]. In this way, the caloric theory was absorbed into the annals of physics, and evolved into modern [[thermodynamics]], in which heat is the [[kinetic energy]] of some particles (atoms, molecules) of the substance. 

In later combination with the law of energy conservation, the caloric theory still shows a very valuable physical insight into some aspects of heat, for example, the emergence of [[Laplace's equation]] and [[Poisson's equation]] in the problems of spatial distribution of heat and temperature. The caloric theory is now also remembered for the naming of the [[calorie]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He is known as the "father of modern taxonomy".&lt;ref name=calisher&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calisher|first1=CH|title=Taxonomy: what's in a name? Doesn't a rose by any other name smell as sweet? |journal=Croatian Medical Journal |date=2007 |volume=48|issue=2|pages=268–270|pmid=17436393|pmc=2080517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as '''{{lang|la|Carolus Linnæus}}''' (after 1761 '''Carolus a Linné''').

Linnaeus was born in the countryside of [[Småland]] in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at [[Uppsala University]] and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death.

Philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] sent him the message: "Tell him I know no greater man on earth."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |work=Linné on line |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608101238/http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |archivedate=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote: "With the exception of Shakespeare and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; Swedish author [[August Strindberg]] wrote: "Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist".&lt;ref name="deceased"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/9_0.html |title=Linnaeus deceased |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |work=Linné on line |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus has been called ''{{lang|la|Princeps botanicorum}}'' (Prince of Botanists) and "The [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] of the North".&lt;ref name="Broberg7"&gt;[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egerton|first1=Frank N. |title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 23: Linnaeus and the Economy of Nature |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=88|issue=1|pages=72–88|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2007)88[72:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, the abbreviation '''L.''' is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Plant Names Index]] |work=Author Details |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idAuthorSearch.do?id=12653-1 |title=Linnaeus, Carl (1707–1778) |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older publications, the abbreviation "Linn." is found. Linnaeus' remains comprise the [[type (biology)#Lectotype|type specimen]] for the species ''Homo sapiens'' following the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself.&lt;ref group=note name=holotype&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ ICZN Chapter 16, Article 72.4.1.1] – "For a nominal species or subspecies established before 2000, any evidence, published or unpublished, may be taken into account to determine what specimens constitute the type series." and Article 73.1.2 – "If the nominal species-group taxon is based on a single specimen, either so stated or implied in the original publication, that specimen is the holotype fixed by monotypy (see Recommendation 73F). If the taxon was established before 2000 evidence derived from outside the work itself may be taken into account [Art. 72.4.1.1] to help identify the specimen."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Childhood===
[[File:LA2-Rashult-2.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace at [[Råshult]]]]

Linnæus was born in the village of [[Råshult]] in [[Småland]], Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted the family name Linnæus) and Christina Brodersonia. His siblings were Anna Maria Linnæa, Sofia Juliana Linnæa, Samuel Linnæus (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on [[beekeeping]]),&lt;ref name="Blunt12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver8"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broberg10"&gt;[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and Emerentia Linnæa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolaus Linnæus|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Nicolaus-Linn%C3%A6us/6000000006836790143|website=Geni|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family spoke so much Latin at home, that Linnæus learned Latin before he learned Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/19795749/A_Brief_Detail_Of_The_Life_Of_Carl_Linnaeus&lt;/ref&gt;

One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur [[botanist]], a [[Lutheran]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], and the [[curate]] of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius.&lt;ref name="Fries2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fries|first1=Theodor Magnus|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Benjamin Daydon|title=Linnaeus|date=2011|orig-year=1923|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-108-03723-5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|376}}

A year after Linnæus' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the [[rectory]] from the curate's house.&lt;ref name="Blunt13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic2007"&gt;[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in his early years, Linnæus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.&lt;ref name="Blunt15"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl's father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the [[patronymic]] naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the [[University of Lund]], he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant [[linden tree]] (or lime tree), ''{{lang|sv|lind}}'' in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead.&lt;ref name="Blunt12"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This name was spelled with the [[æ]] [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications.&lt;ref name="Blunt13"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}

===Early education===
Linnaeus' father began teaching him basic Latin, religion, and geography at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Thomas|title=History of the Royal Society From Its Institution to the End of the Eighteenth Century|year=2011|origyear=1812|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge (UK)|isbn=978-1-108-02815-8|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUlt0htkZZgC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local [[yeoman]]. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander "was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them."&lt;ref name="Blunt15-16"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower [[Grammar School]] at [[Växjö]] in 1717.&lt;ref name="Stöver5"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden.

He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at [[Katedralskolan, Växjö|Katedralskolan]] (a [[Gymnasieskola|gymnasium]]) in Växjö. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine.&lt;ref name="Blunt16"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver5-6"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he "read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora Åboensis, [[Johannes Palmberg|Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana]],  Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis...."&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Linnés betydelse såsom naturforskare och läkare : skildringar utgifna af Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien i anledning af tvåhundraårsdagen af Linnés födelse ([http://runeberg.org/linne200ar/linnebotan/0007.html source])&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus entered the Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, where he studied mainly [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[theology]] and [[mathematics]], a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Stöver6"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt16-17"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him [[physiology]] and botany. Nils accepted this offer.&lt;ref name="Blunt17-18"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver8-11"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University studies==
=== Lund ===
[[File:Carl von Linné i Lund.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue as a university student in [[Lund]]]]

Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort's]] system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to [[Sébastien Vaillant]].&lt;ref name="Blunt17-18"/&gt; In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in [[Lund University]] in [[Skåne]].&lt;ref name="Blunt18"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver13"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He was registered as ''{{lang|la|Carolus Linnæus}}'', the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.&lt;ref name="Blunt171"/&gt;

Professor [[Kilian Stobæus]], natural scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures.&lt;ref name="Blunt21-22"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver15"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students sharing the same interests.&lt;ref name="Stöver14-15"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uppsala===
[[File:Linné-Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum.jpg|thumb|[[Pollination]] depicted in ''{{lang|la|Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum}}'' (1729)]]
In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend [[Uppsala University]] on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]] and [[Lars Roberg]]. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state.&lt;ref name="Blunt23-25"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, [[Olof Celsius]], who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist.&lt;ref name="Blunt31-32"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Stöver19-20"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, ''{{lang|la|Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum}}'' on [[Plant reproductive morphology|plant sexual reproduction]]. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people.&lt;ref name="Blunt32-34"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions.&lt;ref name="Blunt34-37"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of [[stamen]]s and [[pistil]]s. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Critica Botanica]]}}''. He also produced a book on the plants grown in the [[Linnaean Garden|Uppsala Botanical Garden]], ''{{lang|la|Adonis Uplandicus}}''.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-36-37"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudbeck's former assistant, [[Nils Rosén von Rosenstein|Nils Rosén]], returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus' botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a "disagreement" with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-36-37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson40"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expedition to Lapland==
{{main|Expedition to Lapland|Flora Lapponica}}
[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - Martin Hoffman - Carl von Linné (Linnaeus) in his Lapland costume - painting.jpg|thumb|upright|Wearing the traditional dress of the [[Sami people]] of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]], holding the [[twinflower]], later known as ''Linnaea borealis'', that became his personal emblem. [[Martin Hoffman (painter)|Martin Hoffman]], 1737.]]

During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]]; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native [[Sami people]], reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]] for his journey.&lt;ref name="Anderson42-43"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-38"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25.&lt;ref name="David Black"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Carl Linnaeus Travels|editor-last = Black|editor-first = David|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|year = 1979|isbn = 978-0684159768|location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and [[ornithological]] manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near [[Gävle]] he found great quantities of ''Campanula serpyllifolia'', later known as ''[[Linnaea borealis]]'', the twinflower that would become his favourite.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-42-43"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock&lt;ref name="Anderson43-44"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and was particularly interested in [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, the latter a main part of the diet of the [[reindeer]], a common and economically important animal in Lapland.&lt;ref name="Anderson46"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], making major inland incursions from [[Umeå]], [[Luleå]] and [[Tornio]]. He returned from his six-month-long, over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-63-65"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt39-42"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 39–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broberg29"&gt;[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lapland was a region with limited [[biodiversity]], Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book ''{{lang|la|[[Flora Lapponica]]}}''.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver38-39"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.&lt;ref name="David Black" /&gt;

In ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' Linnaeus' ideas about [[nomenclature]] and [[Biological classification|classification]] were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern [[Flora (publication)|Flora]].&lt;ref name="Frodin_p27"/&gt; The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] who attributed Linnaeus with ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' as the first example in the botanical genre of [[Flora]] writing. Botanical historian [[Edward Lee Greene|E. L. Greene]] described ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' as "the most classic and delightful" of Linnaeus's works.&lt;ref name="Frodin_p27"&gt;[[#Frodin|Frodin (2001)]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a [[Eureka effect|flash of insight]] regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: "If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds."&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-54"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to [[Dalarna]]. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at [[Røros]].&lt;ref name="Broberg29"/&gt;

==Doctorate==
[[File:Karte Linne.png|thumb|right|Cities where he worked; those outside Sweden were only visited during 1735–1738.]]
His relations with Nils Rosén having worsened, Linnaeus accepted an invitation from Claes Sohlberg, son of a mining inspector, to spend the Christmas holiday in [[Falun]], where Linnaeus was permitted to visit the mines.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-74"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1735, at the suggestion of Sohlberg's father, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the [[Dutch Republic]], where Linnaeus intended to study medicine at the [[University of Harderwijk]]&lt;ref name="Stöver71"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; while tutoring Sohlberg in exchange for an annual salary. At the time, it was common for Swedes to pursue doctoral degrees in the [[Netherlands]], then a highly revered place to study natural history.&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-78-79"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way, the pair stopped in [[Hamburg]], where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a supposed [[wonder of nature]] in his possession: the [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] remains of a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]. Linnaeus quickly discovered the specimen was a [[hoax|fake]] cobbled together from the jaws and paws of weasels and the skins of snakes. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus that it had been manufactured by monks to represent the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast of Revelation]]. Even at the risk of incurring the mayor's wrath, Linnaeus made his observations public, dashing the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum. Linnaeus and Sohlberg were forced to flee from Hamburg.&lt;ref name="Anderson60-61"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt90"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albertus Seba - Hydra.jpg|thumb|left|The Hamburg Hydra, from the ''{{lang|la|Thesaurus}}'' (1734) of [[Albertus Seba]]]]

Linnaeus began working towards his degree as soon as he reached [[Harderwijk]], a university known for awarding degrees in as little as a week.&lt;ref name="Blunt94"/&gt; He submitted a dissertation, written back in Sweden, entitled ''Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa'',&lt;ref group=note name=dissertatio&gt;That is, ''Inaugural thesis in medicine, in which a new hypothesis on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he laid out his hypothesis that [[malaria]] arose only in areas with clay-rich soils.&lt;ref name=hempelmann&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hempelmann|first1=Ernst|last2=Krafts|first2=Kristine|title=Bad air, amulets and mosquitoes: 2,000 years of changing perspectives on malaria|journal=Malaria Journal|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=232|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-12-232|pmid=23835014|pmc=3723432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he failed to identify the true source of disease transmission, (''i.e.'', the ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/animal/4_1.html Linnaeus’ thesis on the ague (malaria)], ©-2008, Uppsala University.&lt;/ref&gt; he did correctly predict that ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' ([[artemisinins|wormwood]]) would become a source of [[antimalarial]] medications.&lt;ref name=hempelmann/&gt;

Within two weeks he had completed his oral and practical examinations and was awarded a doctoral degree.&lt;ref name="Anderson60-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt94"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=N54GuRxlgrMC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer Linnaeus reunited with [[Peter Artedi]], a friend from Uppsala with whom he had once made a pact that should either of the two predecease the other, the survivor would finish the decedent's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in the [[canals of Amsterdam]], leaving behind an unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish.&lt;ref name="Anderson66"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt98-100"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''==
One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Johan Frederik Gronovius]] to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' (1735).&lt;ref name="Blunt98"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson62-63"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, [[Herman Boerhaave]], who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist [[Johannes Burman]]. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his ''{{lang|la|Thesaurus Zeylanicus}}''. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: ''{{lang|la|Fundamenta Botanica}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Bibliotheca Botanica}}''.&lt;ref name="Blunt100-102"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==George Clifford, Philip Miller, and Johann Jacob Dillenius==
{{multiple image|footer = Leaf forms from ''{{lang|la|[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]}}'' (1738)|image1 = Hortus Cliffortianus folia simpl.png|alt1=Folia Simplicia|width1=107|image2=Hortus Cliffortianus folia compos.png|alt2=Folia Composita et Folia Determinata|width2=106}}

In August 1735, during Linnaeus' stay with Burman, he met [[George Clifford III]], a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of [[Hartekamp]] in [[Heemstede]]. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane's]] ''Natural History of Jamaica'', a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.&lt;ref name="Anderson64"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver81-82"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford, and curator of Clifford's herbarium. He was paid 1,000 [[florin]]s a year, with free board and lodging. Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year, Linnaeus practically stayed there until 1738.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shurtleff|first1=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|title=History of Soybeans and Soyfoods in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland (1735-2015): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook|year=2015|publisher=Soyinfo Center|location=California (US)|isbn=978-1-928914-80-8|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gtpCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he wrote a book ''Hortus Cliffortianus'', in the preface of which he described his experience as "the happiest time of my life."

In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense.&lt;ref name="Blunt106-107"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinet]],&lt;ref name="Stöver89"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to visit the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and its keeper, [[Philip Miller]]. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''. Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new [[binomial nomenclature]], preferring the classifications of [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] and [[John Ray]] at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's ''Gardeners Dictionary'',&lt;ref&gt;''Non erit Lexicon Hortulanorum, sed etiam Botanicorum'', that the book will be, not just a lexicon of gardeners, but of botanists."; noted in Paterson 1986:40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of ''[[The Gardeners Dictionary]]'' of 1768.  Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus' system.&lt;ref name="Stöver89-90"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus also travelled to Oxford University to visit the botanist [[Johann Jacob Dillenius]]. He failed to make Dillenius publicly fully accept his new classification system, though the two men remained in correspondence for many years afterwards. Linnaeus dedicated his ''Critica botanica'' to him, as "''opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit''". Linnaeus would later name a genus of tropical tree Dillenia in his honour. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants.&lt;ref name="Stöver90-93"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he published ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'', in which he described 935 [[Genus|genera]] of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with ''{{lang|la|Corollarium Generum Plantarum}}'', with another sixty (''sexaginta'') genera.&lt;ref name="Stöver95"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work at Hartekamp led to another book, ''{{lang|la|[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]}}'', a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.&lt;ref name="Blunt100-102"/&gt; It contains the first use of the name ''[[Nepenthes]]'', which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of [[pitcher plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Veitch|Veitch (1897)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note name=nepenthes&gt;"If this is not Helen's ''[[Nepenthe]]s'', it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator!" (translated from Latin by [[Harry Veitch]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as [[Antoine de Jussieu]]. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.&lt;ref name="Blunt123"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koerner56"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Sweden==
[[File:LinnaeusWeddingPortrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Wedding portrait]]

When Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to [[Falun]], where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.&lt;ref name=nrm.se&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrm.se/researchandcollections/botany/phanerogamicbotany/botanicalhistory/carlvonlinne.4.5fdc727f10d795b1c6e80007524.html |title=Carl Linnaeus |accessdate=3 April 2010 |author=Louise Petrusson |publisher=[[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver141"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with [[Carl Gustav Tessin|Count Carl Gustav Tessin]], who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty.&lt;ref name="Stöver146-147"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koerner16"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]]; he became the first [[Praeses]] in the academy by drawing of lots.&lt;ref name="Koerner103-105"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, [[Carl Linnaeus the Younger|Carl]]. Two years later, a daughter, [[Elisabeth Christina von Linné|Elisabeth Christina]], was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver382"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CarlvonLinne house.jpg|thumb|House in [[Uppsala]]]]
In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and [[natural history]], instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.&lt;ref name="Gribbin"/&gt;{{rp|49–50}}

=== Öland and Gotland ===
Ten days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of [[Öland]] and [[Gotland]] with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to [[Visby]] in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in ''{{lang|sv|Öländska och Gothländska Resa}}'', written in Swedish. Like ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'', it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland.&lt;ref name="Koerner115"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt137-142"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: ''{{lang|la|Flora Suecica}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Fauna Suecica}}''. ''{{lang|la|Flora Suecica}}'' was a strictly botanical book, while ''{{lang|la|Fauna Suecica}}'' was [[zoology|zoological]].&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stöver117-118"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Celsius]] had created the temperature scale [[Celsius|named after him]] in 1742. Celsius' scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and freezing point at 100&amp;nbsp;°C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard.&lt;ref name="Koerner204"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Västergötland===
In the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of [[Västergötland]]. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book ''{{lang|sv|Wästgöta-Resa}}'', published the next year.&lt;ref name="Koerner115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt159"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province [[Scania]]. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;

In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title [[archiater]], or chief physician, by the Swedish king [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]]—a mark of great respect.&lt;ref name="Blunt165"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences in Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Stöver167"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scania===
In the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to [[Scania]], again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow [[walnut]] and [[Sorbus intermedia|Swedish whitebeam]] trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus' observations were published the next year in ''{{lang|sv|Skånska Resa}}''.&lt;ref name="Blunt198-205"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 198–205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koerner116"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rector of Uppsala University===
[[File:CarlvonLinne Hammarby.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Summer home at his Hammarby estate]]
[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Linnaean Garden]] in Uppsala]]

In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt; Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his "apostles".&lt;ref name="Gribbin"&gt;[[#Gribbin|Gribbin &amp; Gribbin (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56–57}} His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.&lt;ref name="Blunt206"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Philosophia Botanica'' ===
Linnaeus published ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'' in 1751.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1751}} The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden.&lt;ref name="Blunt221"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Nutrix Noverca'' ===
[[File:Nutrix noverca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of ''Nutrix Noverca'' (1752)]]
During Linnaeus' time it was normal for upper class women to have [[wet nurse]]s for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing campaign to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Tönz, Otmar| chapter=Breastfeeding in modern and ancient times: Facts, ideas and beliefs| page=12| title= Short and Long Term Effects of Breast Feeding on Child Health| editor1=Koletzko, Berthold|editor2=Michaelsen, K.F.|editor3=Hernell, Olle| publisher=Springer| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/NutrixNoverca|title=Nutrix Noverca|year=1752|author=Linnaeus, Carl|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of the period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (''prases'') expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by [[Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert|J.E. Gilibert]] in 1770 as ''La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire''. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps&lt;ref name="Koerner, Lisbet 2009 69–70"&gt;{{cite book|author=Koerner, Lisbet| title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation| year=2009| pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk.&lt;ref name="Koerner, Lisbet 2009 69–70"/&gt; It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term ''Mammalia'' for the class of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Why Mammals are Called Mammals: Gender Politics in Eighteenth-Century Natural History| first=Londa| last=Schiebinger| journal=The American Historical Review| volume=98| issue=2| year=1993|pages= 382–411 |jstor=2166840| doi=10.2307/2166840| pmid=11623150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Species Plantarum'' ===
{{main|Species Plantarum}}
Linnaeus published ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern [[botanical nomenclature]], in 1753.&lt;ref name="Stace_p24"&gt;[[#Stace|Stace (1991)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year.{{refn|1=The date of issue of both volumes was later, for practical purposes, arbitrarily set on 1 May, see Stearn, W.T.

He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.&lt;ref name="Blunt166"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ennoblement===
[[File:Linne CoA.jpg|thumb|right|His [[coat of arms]]]]
Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.&lt;ref name="Koerner116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt219"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.&lt;ref name="Blunt220-224"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 220–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the initial release of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for [[zoological nomenclature]], the equivalent of ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}''.&lt;ref name="Gribbin"/&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref name="Blunt6"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish King Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus [[nobility]] in 1757, but he was not [[ennobled]] until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinised as ''{{lang|la|Carolus a Linné}}''), 'Linné' being a shortened and [[French language|gallicised]] version of 'Linnæus', and the German [[nobiliary particle]] '[[von]]' signifying his ennoblement.&lt;ref name="Blunt171"/&gt; The noble family's [[coat of arms]] prominently features a [[Linnaea borealis|twinflower]], one of Linnaeus' favourite plants; it was given the scientific name ''Linnaea borealis'' in his honour by [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]]. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the centre is an egg "to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated ''in ovo''." At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the [[Aeneid]], which reads "Famam extendere factis": we extend our fame by our deeds.&lt;ref name="Gribbin"/&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="Blunt199"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt229-230"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 229–230.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus inscribed this personal motto in books that were gifted to him by friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Anecdotes of Linnaeus|page=v |url=https://archive.org/stream/ornithologyhummi06jardrich#page/n21/mode/2up|title=The Naturalist's Library. Volume VI. Ornithology. Humming birds, Part I.|editor=Jardine, William|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|place=London|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, [[Catherine II of Russia]] sent him seeds from her country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_0.html Uppsala University, Linné Online], English language version&lt;/ref&gt; He also corresponded with [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], "the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire", who was a doctor and a botanist in [[Idrija]], [[Duchy of Carniola]] (nowadays [[Slovenia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/soban.htm |title=A Living Bond between Idrija and Uppsala |first=Branko |last=Soban |newspaper=The Slovenian |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the [[olm]] and the [[dormouse]], two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected Scopoli and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, ''[[Scopolia]]'', the source of [[scopolamine]], after him, but because of the great distance between them, they never met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/soban.htm |title=A Living Bond between Idrija and Uppsala |accessdate=1 December 2007 |last=Soban |first=Branko |date=January 2005 |work=Slovenija.svet  |publisher=Slovene Emigrant Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scopoli, Giovanni Antonio|title=Joannes A.

==Final years==
[[File:Carl von Linné grave 2007 Upsala.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Headstone]] of him and his son [[Carl Linnaeus the Younger]]]]

Linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt; He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.&lt;ref name="Koerner56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt245"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Rosén. He developed [[sciatica]] in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him.&lt;ref name="Blunt232"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.&lt;ref name="Stöver243-245"&gt;[[#Stöver|Stöver (1794)]], pp. 243–245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broberg42"&gt;[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.&lt;ref name="Gribbin"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref name="Blunt245"/&gt; Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was buried in [[Uppsala Cathedral]] on 22 January.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic4"&gt;[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson104-106"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. [[Joseph Banks]], an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, [[James Edward Smith]], who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the [[Linnean Society of London]] five years later.&lt;ref name="Anderson104-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-238-240"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 238–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The von Linné name ended with his son Carl, who never married.&lt;ref name="deceased"/&gt; His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linnaeus.c18.net/Letters/display_bio_note.php?id_letter=L1753&amp;code_person=LinnaeusJ |title=Linnaeus, Johannes (1754–1757).

==Apostles==
{{Main|Apostles of Linnaeus}}
[[File:Pehr Forsskål portrait (cropped and color balanced).png|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Forsskål]] was among the apostles who met a tragic fate abroad.]]

During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught [[List of students of Linnaeus|many devoted students]], 17 of whom he called "apostles". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition.&lt;ref name="Blunt189-190"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished.&lt;ref name="Broberg37-39"&gt;[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland.&lt;ref name="Anderson92-93"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The British botanist [[William T. Stearn]] notes without Linnaeus' new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens.&lt;ref name="Blunt184-185"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.

===Early expeditions===
Christopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a [[Swedish East India Company]] ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on [[Côn Sơn Island]] the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström.&lt;ref name="Blunt185-186"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including [[Pehr Forsskål]] and [[Pehr Löfling]].&lt;ref name="Blunt184-185"/&gt;

Two years after Tärnström's expedition, Finnish-born [[Pehr Kalm]] set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in ''Species Plantarum'' had been brought back by Kalm.&lt;ref name="Anderson93-94"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cook expeditions and Japan===

[[Daniel Solander]] was living in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist [[Joseph Banks]]. With Banks, Solander joined [[James Cook]] on his expedition to Oceania on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' in 1768–71.&lt;ref name="Anderson96"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt191-192"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; [[Anders Sparrman]] followed on the ''[[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]]'' in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.&lt;ref name="Blunt192-193"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to [[Japan]]. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of [[Dejima]] outside [[Nagasaki]], so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.&lt;ref name="Blunt193-194"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Systema Naturae''===
[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturæ'']] (1758)]]

{{Main|Systema Naturae}}

The first edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work.&lt;ref name="SystNat1"&gt;[[#L1735|Linnaeus (1735)]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it reached its [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. People from all over the world sent their specimens to Linnaeus to be included. By the time he started work on the 12th edition, Linnaeus needed a new invention - the [[index card]] - to track classifications.&lt;ref name="Everts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everts|first1=Sarah|title=Information Overload|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=26–33|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/information-overload|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Systema Naturae'', the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as "''{{lang|la|Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis}}''", were supplemented with concise and now familiar "binomials", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, ''[[Physalis angulata]]''. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as [[binomial nomenclature]], was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see [[Gaspard Bauhin]] and [[Johann Bauhin]]) almost 200 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Windelspecht|Windelspecht (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.

After the decline in Linnaeus' health in the early 1770s, publication of editions of ''Systema Naturae'' went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, [[Johan Andreas Murray]] issued the ''Regnum Vegetabile'' section separately in 1774 as the ''Systema Vegetabilium'', rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition.{{sfn|Linné|1774}} Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire ''Systema'' appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was through the ''Systema Vegetabilium'' that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the [[Lichfield Botanical Society]] as ''A System of Vegetables'' (1783–1785).{{sfn|Linné|1785}}

===''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}''===
{{Main|Species Plantarum}}

''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' (or, more fully, ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas}}'') was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of [[botanical nomenclature|plant nomenclature]] as it exists today.&lt;ref name="Stace_p24"/&gt;

====''{{lang|la|Genera Plantarum}}''====
{{Main|Genera Plantarum}}

''{{lang|la|Genera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium}}'' was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition.&lt;ref name="Stace_p22"&gt;[[#Stace|Stace (1991)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22].&lt;/ref&gt; In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes. One, [[Cryptogamia]], included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).&lt;ref name="Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95"&gt;[[#Hoek|Van den Hoek ''et al.'' (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====''{{lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}''====
{{Main|Philosophia Botanica}}

''{{lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}'' (1751){{sfn|Linnaeus|1751}} was a summary of Linnaeus' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in ''{{lang|la|[[Fundamenta Botanica]]}}'' (1736) and ''{{lang|la|[[Critica Botanica]]}}'' (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his ''{{lang|la|[[Classes Plantarum]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]}}'': all were printed in Holland (as were ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'' (1737) and ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' (1735)), the ''Philosophia'' being simultaneously released in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stafleu|Stafleu (1971)]], p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:External Statues, Palm House, Sefton Park (4).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Linnaeus'' marble by [[Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud]] (1899), outside the Palm House at [[Sefton Park]], [[Liverpool]]]]
At the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in [[Uppsala]] was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by [[Carl Gyllenborg]] (in 1744–1745), crown-prince [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|Adolf Fredrik]] (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and [[Jonas Alströmer]] (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum.&lt;ref name="Wallin, L. 2001"&gt;[http://www.evolutionsmuseet.uu.se/samling/UUZM04_Linnaeus.pdf Wallin, L. 2001.] Catalogue of type specimens. 4. Linnaean specimens. – pp. [1], 1–128. Uppsala. (Uppsala University, Museum of Evolution, Zoology Section).&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.&lt;ref&gt;Lisbet Koerner, "Carl Linnaeus in his Time and Place," in Cultures of Natural History, ed. Nicholas Jardine, James A. Secord, and Emma C. Spary (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 145–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his [[Linnaeus' Hammarby|country house at Hammarby]] near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.

In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linné's son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linné's death his son confirmed that mice had caused "horrible damage" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage.&lt;ref name="Dance, S.P. 1967"&gt;Dance, S.P. 1967. Report on the Linnaean shell collection. – Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London 178 (1): 1–24, Pl. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material.

In 1784 the young medical student [[James Edward Smith]] purchased the entire specimen collection, library, manuscripts, and correspondence of Carl Linnaeus from his widow and daughter and transferred the collections to London.&lt;ref name="White1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Paul|title=The purchase of knowledge: James Edward Smith and the Linnean collections|journal=Endeavour|date=1999|volume=23|issue=3|page=126|doi=10.1016/S0160-9327(99)01212-0|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi916/week5/white_the_purchase_of_knowledge.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fries2011" /&gt;{{rp|342–357}} Not all material in Linné's private collection was transported to England. Thirty-three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost.{{Citation needed|reason=Fact is not mentioned in White1999 nor Fries2011|date=January 2018}}

In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection, he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are evident in the [http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN603451020 Portland catalogue p. 76 Lot 1715 and p. 188 Lot 3997.] "A catalogue of the Portland Museum, lately the property of the Duchess Dowager of Portland, deceased: Which will be sold by auction by Mr. Skinner and Co. On Monday the 24th of April, 1786, and the thirty-seven following days (...) at her late dwelling-house, in Privy-Garden, Whitehall, by order of the Acting Executrix." – pp. i–viii [= 1–8], 3-194, pl. [1]. [London]. (Skinner).&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.&lt;ref name="Dance, S.P. 1967" /&gt;

Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Queen Lovisa Ulrika]] (1720–1782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as "Museum Ludovicae Ulricae" or "M. L. U."). This collection was donated by his grandson [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|King Gustav IV Adolf]] (1778–1837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Fredrik]] (1710–1771) (in the Linnean sources known as "Museum Adolphi Friderici" or "Mus. Ad. Fr."), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and is today housed in the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] at [[Stockholm]]. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.&lt;ref name="Wallin, L. 2001" /&gt;

==System of taxonomy==
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|right|Table of the Animal Kingdom (''{{lang|la|Regnum Animale}}'') from the 1st edition of ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae|Systema Naturæ]]}}'' (1735)]]

{{Main|Linnaean taxonomy}}

The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature.&lt;ref name="Reveal 1993 p. 160-161"&gt;[[#Reveal|Reveal &amp; Pringle (1993)]], p.&amp;nbsp;160–161.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the ''Linnaean taxonomy''; the system of [[scientific classification]] now widely used in the [[biology|biological sciences]]. A previous zoologist [[Rumphius]] (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=4|location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-593-076-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Linnaean system classified nature within a [[nested hierarchy]], starting with three [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (''singular:'' genus), which were divided into species (''singular:'' species).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simpson|Simpson (1961)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Below the rank of species he sometimes recognised taxa of a lower (unnamed) [[taxonomic rank|rank]]; these have since acquired standardised names such as ''variety'' in botany and ''subspecies'' in zoology.  Modern taxonomy includes a rank of [[Family (biology)|family]] between order and genus and a rank of [[phylum]] between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus' original system.&lt;ref name="Davis 1973 p. 17"&gt;[[#Davis|Davis &amp; Heywood (1973)]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not simply upon differences.&lt;ref name="Davis 1973 p. 17"/&gt; Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.&lt;ref name="Reveal 1993 p. 160-161"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simpson|Simpson (1961)]], p.&amp;nbsp;56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid "observable characteristics" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, [[DNA sequencing]], unavailable in Linnaeus' time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their [[Phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]]), the fundamental principle remains sound.

=== Human taxonomy ===
{{main|Human taxonomy#History}}
{{undue weight|date=May 2018}}
{{split section|Anthropomorpha|Simia|Human taxonomy#History|date=May 2018}}
Linnaeus' system of taxonomy was especially noted as the first to include humans (''[[Homo]]'') taxonomically grouped with apes (''[[Simia]]''), under the header of ''[[Anthropomorpha]]''.
German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] speaking in 1907 noted this as the "most important sign of Linnaeus' genius".&lt;ref&gt;Sven Horstadius, [https://watermark.silverchair.com/j.1095-8312.1974.tb00725.x.pdf  Linnaeus, animals and man]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 6 (December 1974), 269&amp;ndash;275 (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Biological Family}} 
Linnaeus classified humans among the [[primate]]s (as they were later{{clarify|date=May 2018}} called) beginning with the first edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''. 
During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man.&lt;ref name="Gribbin"/&gt;{{rp|173–174}} He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences.&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr170"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 167, quotes Linnaeus explaining the real difference would necessarily be absent from his classification system, as it was not a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristic: ''"I well know what a splendidly great difference there is [between] a man and a ''bestia'' [literally, "beast"; that is, a non-human animal] when I look at them from a point of view of [[morality]]. Man is the animal which the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]] has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent [[mind]] and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life"''. See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=wIkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.com] in which Linnaeus cites the significant capacity to reason as the distinguishing characteristic of humans.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, ''Anthropomorpha'', meaning "manlike."&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr167"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; This classification received criticism from other biologists such as [[Johan Gottschalk Wallerius]], [[Jacob Theodor Klein]] and [[Johann Georg Gmelin]] on the ground that it is illogical to describe a human as 'like a man'.{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linnaeus.c18.net/Letters/display_txt.php?id_letter=L0759 |author=[[Johann Georg Gmelin]] |title=Letter to Carl Linnaeus |date=30 December 1746 |location=St. Petersburg, Russia |work=The Linnean Correspondence |accessdate=4 October 2011 |id=L0759}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linnaeus.c18.net/Letters/display_txt.php?id_letter=L0783 |author=Carl Linnaeus |title=Letter to Johann Georg Gmelin |date=25 February 1747 |location=Uppsala, Sweden |work=The Linnean Correspondence |accessdate=4 October 2011 |id=L0783}} Also available as [http://linnaeus.c18.net/mss_combine/UUB/L-GmelinJG/L0783-a-150-02.jpg JPG].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1=Discussion of translation was originally made in [https://groups.google.com/group/talk.origins/browse_thread/thread/39a07ac72ab23aed/ this thread] on [[talk.origins]] in 2005.

&lt;!--Please don't edit the translation without leaving a comment on the talk page. --&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It does not please [you] that I've placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term 'with human form',&lt;ref group=note&gt;"antropomorphon" {{sic}}&lt;/ref&gt; but man learns to know himself. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] in the first edition of his ''Manual of Natural History'' (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the [[Quadrumana]] (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and [[Bimana]] (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably [[Georges Cuvier]]. Some elevated the distinction to the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates – and especially the great apes – made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Antropomorpha12c.png|thumb|left|Detail from the sixth edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' (1748) describing ''[[Anthropomorpha|Ant[h]ropomorpha]]'' with a division between ''Homo'' and ''Simia'']]

The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the [[great chain of being]], and second, because the Bible says man was created in the [[image of God]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:26–1:27|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[theomorphism]]), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept.&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr171-172"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between [[world view]]s that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, [[creation–evolution controversy]] began in earnest with the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859.

After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' introduced new terms, including ''Mammalia'' and ''Primates'', the latter of which would replace ''Anthropomorpha''&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr175"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as giving humans the full binomial ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref name="Blunt8"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not being a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it.&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr191-192"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''{{lang|la|Dieta Naturalis}}'', he said, "One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a [[soul]] and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility."&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr166"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.''

Linnaeus added a second species to the genus ''Homo'' in ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' based on a figure and description by [[Jacobus Bontius]] from a 1658 publication: ''Homo troglodytes'' ("caveman")&lt;ref&gt;[[#L1758|Linnaeus (1758)]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bontius, I. 1658"&gt;[[#Bontius|Bontius (1658)]], [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/39776#page/106/mode/1up p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt; and published a third in 1771: ''Homo lar''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#L1771|Linnaeus (1771)]], p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish historian [[Gunnar Broberg]] states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus.&lt;ref name="Frängsmyr187"&gt;[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early editions of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'', many well-known [[legendary creature]]s were included such as the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[dragon]], [[manticore]], and [[satyrus (ape)|satyrus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Engel|Linnaeus (1964) (1735)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1=Linnaeus is translated, writing that the satyrus is "hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen."|group=note}} which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category ''[[Animalia Paradoxa|Paradoxa]]''.

{{anchor|Varieties of Homo sapiens}}
{{See also|Race (human categorisation)}}
In the first edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'', Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four [[Race (biology)|varieties]] based on [[continent]] and{{dubious|date=May 2018}} [[human skin color|skin colour]]: "Europæus albus" (white European), "Americanus rubescens" (red American), "Asiaticus fuscus" (brown Asian) and "Africanus niger" (black African).{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} 
In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed phenotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the [[four temperaments]] from [[classical antiquity]],{{dubious|date=May 2018}} and changed the description of Asians' skin tone to "luridus" (yellow).&lt;ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--WP:BOMBARD of five(!) references, what exactly is being referenced here, and in whose opinion are the "four temperaments" involved?--&gt;

Additionally, Linnaeus created a [[wastebasket taxon]] "monstrosus" for "wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Willoughby|Willoughby (2007)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=dOC38AS_VfkC&amp;pg=PA33 pp. 33–34], citing [[#Broberg1975|Broberg (1975)]], p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[W. T. Stearn]] designated Linnaeus to be the [[lectotype]] of ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stearn |first1=W.

==Influences and economic beliefs==
[[File:LinneStatueMidway.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Statue on University of Chicago campus]]

Linnaeus' applied science was inspired not only by the instrumental utilitarianism general to the early Enlightenment, but also by his adherence to the older economic doctrine of [[Cameralism]].&lt;ref name="Koerner95-96"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Linnaeus was a state interventionist.  He supported tariffs, levies, export bounties, quotas, embargoes, navigation acts, subsidised investment capital, ceilings on wages, cash grants, state-licensed producer monopolies, and cartels.&lt;ref name="Koerner97"&gt;[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
[[File:Råshult 1907.jpg|thumb|left|1907 celebration in [[Råshult]]]]
{{Main|Commemoration of Carl Linnaeus}}

Anniversaries of Linnaeus' birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations.&lt;ref name="Östholm"&gt;[[#Östholm|Östholm (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and [[banknote]]s.&lt;ref name="Östholm" /&gt; There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The [[Linnean Society of London]] has awarded the [[Linnean Medal]] for excellence in [[botany]] or [[zoology]] since 1888. Following approval by the [[Riksdag of Sweden]], [[Växjö University]] and [[Kalmar College]] merged on 1 January 2010 to become [[Linnaeus University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lnu.se/about-lnu/about-linnaeus-university?l=en |title=A modern, international university in the Småland region of Sweden |publisher=[[Linnaeus University]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus ''[[Linnaea]]'', the crater [[Linné (crater)|Linné]] on the Earth's moon, a street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the cobalt sulfide mineral [[Linnaeite]].

==Commentary==
[[Andrew Dickson White]] wrote in ''[[q:A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom|A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Linnaeus&amp;nbsp;... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.&amp;nbsp;... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his ''Systema Naturæ'' he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.&amp;nbsp;... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Dickson White]], ''History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'' (1922) [https://archive.org/details/ahistorywarfare00whitgoog Vol.1] pp.&amp;nbsp;59–61&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mathematical [[PageRank]] algorithm, applied to 24 multilingual Wikipedia editions in 2014, published in ''[[PLOS ONE]]'' in 2015, placed Carl Linnaeus at the top historical figure, above [[Jesus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Adolf Hitler]] (in that order).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eom|first1=Young-Ho|last2=Aragón|first2=Pablo|last3=Laniado|first3=David|last4=Kaltenbrunner|first4=Andreas|last5=Vigna|first5=Sebastiano|last6=Shepelyansky|first6=Dima L.|last7=Gao|first7=Zhong-Ke|title=Interactions of Cultures and Top People of Wikipedia from Ranking of 24 Language Editions|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0114825|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0114825|pmid=25738291|pmc=4349893|arxiv=1405.7183|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1014825E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tamblyn|first1=Thomas|title=Wikipedia Reveals Most Influential Person In History, No It's Not Jesus|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/06/12/wikipedia-most-influential-person-jesus_n_5487516.html|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ChIP-on-chip''' (also known as '''ChIP-chip''') is a technology that combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] ('ChIP') with [[DNA microarray]] (''"chip"''). Like regular [[Ch-IP|ChIP]], ChIP-on-chip is used to investigate interactions between [[protein]]s and [[DNA]] ''[[in vivo]]''. Specifically, it allows the identification of the [[cistrome]], the sum of [[binding site]]s, for DNA-binding proteins on a genome-wide basis.&lt;ref name="Alpha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aparicio |first1=O |last2=Geisberg |first2=JV |last3=Struhl |first3=K |year=2004 |title=Chromatin immunoprecipitation for determining the association of proteins with specific genomic sequences ''in vivo'' |journal=Current Protocols in Cell Biology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |location=University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA |volume=Chapter 17 |issue=2004 |pages=Unit 17.7 |issn=1934-2616 |doi=10.1002/0471143030.cb1707s23  |pmid=18228445 |isbn=978-0-471-14303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole-genome analysis can be performed to determine the locations of binding sites for almost any protein of interest.&lt;ref name="Alpha" /&gt; As the name of the technique suggests, such proteins are generally those operating in the context of [[chromatin]]. The most prominent representatives of this class are [[transcription factor]]s, [[DNA replication|replication]]-related proteins, like Origin Recognition Complex Protein ([[Origin Recognition Complex Protein|ORC]]), [[histone]]s, their variants, and histone modifications.

The goal of ChIP-on-chip is to locate protein binding sites that may help identify functional elements in the [[genome]]. For example, in the case of a transcription factor as a protein of interest, one can determine its transcription factor binding sites throughout the genome. Other proteins allow the identification of [[Promoter (biology)|promoter regions]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], [[repressors]] and [[Silencer (DNA)|silencing elements]], [[Chromatin insulation|insulators]], boundary elements&lt;!-- Insert Link --&gt;, and sequences that control DNA replication.&lt;ref name="M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb 2004"&gt;M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb, ChIP-chip: considerations for the design, analysis, and application of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, Genomics 83 (2004) 349-360.&lt;/ref&gt; If histones are subject of interest, it is believed that the distribution of modifications and their localizations may offer new insights into the mechanisms of [[Gene regulation|regulation]].

One of the long-term goals ChIP-on-chip was designed for is to establish a catalogue of (selected) organisms that lists all [[protein-DNA interaction]]s under various physiological conditions. This knowledge would ultimately help in the understanding of the machinery behind gene regulation, [[cell proliferation]], and disease progression. Hence, ChIP-on-chip offers both potential to complement our knowledge about the orchestration of the genome on the nucleotide level and information on higher levels of information and regulation as it is propagated by research on [[epigenetics]].

== Technological platforms ==
{{See also|DNA microarray|Immunoprecipitation}}

The technical platforms to conduct ChIP-on-chip experiments are [[DNA microarray]]s, or ''"chips"''. They can be classified and distinguished according to various characteristics:

''Probe type'': DNA arrays can comprise either mechanically spotted [[cDNA]]s or [[PCR|PCR-products]], mechanically spotted [[oligonucleotide]]s, or oligonucleotides that are synthesized ''[[in situ]]''. The early versions of microarrays were designed to detect [[RNA]]s from expressed genomic regions ([[open reading frame]]s aka ORFs). Although such arrays are perfectly suited to study [[Expression profiling|gene expression profiles]], they have limited importance in ChIP experiments since most "interesting" proteins with respect to this technique bind in [[intergenic region]]s. Nowadays, even custom-made arrays can be designed and fine-tuned to match the requirements of an experiment. Also, any sequence of nucleotides can be synthesized to cover genic as well as intergenic regions.

''Probe size'': Early version of cDNA arrays had a probe length of about 200bp. Latest array versions use oligos as short as 70- (Microarrays, Inc.) to 25-mers ([[Affymetrix]]). (Feb 2007)

''Probe composition'': There are tiled and non-tiled DNA arrays. Non-tiled arrays use probes selected according to non-spatial criteria, i.e., the DNA sequences used as probes have no fixed distances in the genome. Tiled arrays, however, select a genomic region (or even a whole genome) and divide it into equal chunks. Such a region is called tiled path. The average distance between each pair of neighboring chunks (measured from the center of each chunk) gives the resolution of the tiled path. A path can be overlapping, end-to-end or spaced.&lt;ref&gt;Royce TE, Rozowsky JS, Bertone P, Samanta M, Stolc V, Weissman S, Snyder M, Gerstein M. Related Articles. Issues in the analysis of oligonucleotide tiling microarrays for transcript mapping. Trends Genet. 2005 Aug;21(8):466-75. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Array size'': The first microarrays used for ChIP-on-Chip contained about 13,000 spotted DNA segments representing all ORFs and intergenic regions from the yeast genome.&lt;ref name="M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb 2004" /&gt; Nowadays, Affymetrix offers whole-genome tiled yeast arrays with a resolution of 5bp (all in all 3.2 million probes). Tiled arrays for the human genome become more and more powerful, too. Just to name example, Affymetrix offers a set of seven arrays with about 90 million probes, spanning the complete non-repetitive part of the human genome with about 35bp spacing. (Feb 2007)
Besides the actual microarray, other hard- and software equipment is necessary to run ChIP-on-chip experiments. It is generally the case that one company’s microarrays can not be analyzed by another company’s processing hardware. Hence, buying an array requires also buying the associated workflow equipment. The most important elements are, among others, hybridization ovens, chip scanners, and software packages for subsequent numerical analysis of the raw data.

== Workflow of a ChIP-on-chip experiment ==
Starting with a biological question, a ChIP-on-chip experiment can be divided into three major steps: The first is to set up and design the experiment by selecting the appropriate array and probe type. Second, the actual experiment is performed in the wet-lab. Last, during the dry-lab portion of the cycle, gathered data are analyzed to either answer the initial question or lead to new questions so that the cycle can start again.

=== Wet-lab portion of the workflow ===
[[File:ChIP-on-chip wet-lab.png|thumb|400px|Workflow overview of the wet-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment.]]
In the first step, the protein of interest (POI) is [[cross-link]]ed with the DNA site it binds to in an ''[[in vitro]]'' environment. Usually this is done by a gentle [[formaldehyde]] fixation that is reversible with heat.

Then, the cells are [[Lysis|lysed]] and the DNA is sheared by [[sonication]] or using [[micrococcal nuclease]]. This results in double-stranded chunks of DNA fragments, normally 1 kb or less in length. Those that were [[cross-link]]ed to the POI form a POI-DNA complex.

In the next step, only these complexes are filtered out of the set of DNA fragments, using an [[antibody]] specific to the POI. The antibodies may be attached to a solid surface, may have a magnetic bead, or some other physical property that allows separation of cross-linked complexes and unbound fragments. This procedure is essentially an [[immunoprecipitation]] (IP) of the protein.  This can be done either by using a tagged protein with an antibody against the tag (ex. [[FLAG-tag|FLAG]], [[Hemagglutinin|HA]], c-myc) or with an antibody to the native protein.

The cross-linking of POI-DNA complexes is reversed (usually by heating) and the DNA strands are purified. For the rest of the workflow, the POI is no longer necessary.

After an amplification and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] step, the single-stranded DNA fragments are labeled with a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] tag such as Cy5 or Alexa 647.

Finally, the fragments are poured over the surface of the DNA microarray, which is spotted with short, single-stranded sequences that cover the genomic portion of interest. Whenever a labeled fragment "finds" a complementary fragment on the array, they will [[DNA hybridization|hybridize]] and form again a double-stranded DNA fragment.

=== Dry-lab portion of the workflow ===
{{See also|DNA microarray}}
[[File:ChIP-on-chip dry-lab.png|thumb|400px|Workflow overview of the dry-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment.]]
After a sufficiently large time frame to allow hybridization, the array is illuminated with fluorescent light. Those probes on the array that are hybridized to one of the labeled fragments emit a light signal that is captured by a camera. This image contains all raw data for the remaining part of the workflow.

This raw data, encoded as [[False-color|false-color image]], needs to be converted to numerical values before the actual analysis can be done. The analysis and information extraction of the raw data often remains the most challenging part for ChIP-on-chip experiments. Problems arise throughout this portion of the workflow, ranging from the initial chip read-out, to suitable methods to subtract background noise, and finally to appropriate [[algorithm]]s that [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]] the data and make it available for subsequent [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], which then hopefully lead to a better understanding of the biological question that the experiment seeks to address. Furthermore, due to the different array platforms and lack of standardization between them, data storage and exchange is a huge problem. Generally speaking, the data analysis can be divided into three major steps:

During the first step, the captured fluorescence signals from the array are normalized, using control signals derived from the same or a second chip. Such control signals tell which probes on the array were hybridized correctly and which bound nonspecifically.

In the second step, numerical and statistical tests are applied to control data and IP fraction data to identify POI-enriched regions along the genome. The following three methods are used widely: [[Median percentile rank]], [[Single-array error]], and [[Sliding-window]]. These methods generally differ in how low-intensity signals are handled, how much background noise is accepted, and which trait for the data is emphasized during the computation. In the recent past, the sliding-window approach seems to be favored and is often described as most powerful.

In the third step, these regions are analyzed further. If, for example, the POI was a transcription factor, such regions would represent its binding sites. Subsequent analysis then may want to infer nucleotide motifs and other patterns to allow functional annotation of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomics.nchresearch.org/gene_regulation_analysis.html Biomedical Genomics Core - The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Using [[Tiling array|tiled arrays]], [[ChIP]]-on-chip allows for high resolution of genome-wide maps. These maps can determine the binding sites of many DNA-binding proteins like transcription factors and also chromatin modifications.

Although ChIP-on-chip can be a powerful technique in the area of genomics, it is very expensive. Most published studies using ChIP-on-chip repeat their experiments at least three times to ensure biologically meaningful maps. The cost of the DNA microarrays is often a limiting factor to whether a laboratory should proceed with a ChIP-on-chip experiment. Another limitation is the size of DNA fragments that can be achieved. Most ChIP-on-chip protocols utilize sonication as a method of breaking up DNA into small pieces. However, sonication is limited to a minimal fragment size of 200 bp. For higher resolution maps, this limitation should be overcome to achieve smaller fragments, preferably to single [[nucleosome]] resolution. As mentioned previously, the statistical analysis of the huge amount of data generated from arrays is a challenge and normalization procedures should aim to minimize artifacts and determine what is really biologically significant. So far, application to mammalian genomes has been a major limitation, for example, due to the significant percentage of the genome that is occupied by repeats. However, as ChIP-on-chip technology advances, high resolution whole mammalian genome maps should become achievable.

[[Antibody|Antibodies]] used for [[ChIP]]-on-chip can be an important limiting factor. [[ChIP]]-on-chip requires highly specific antibodies that must recognize its [[epitope]] in free solution and also under fixed conditions. If it is demonstrated to successfully [[immunoprecipitate]] cross-linked [[chromatin]], it is termed "[[ChIP-grade]]". Companies that provide ChIP-grade antibodies include [[Abcam plc|Abcam]], [[Cell Signaling Technology]], Santa Cruz, and Upstate. To overcome the problem of specificity, the protein of interest can be fused to a tag like [[FLAG-tag|FLAG]] or [[Hemagglutinin|HA]] that are recognized by antibodies. An alternative to ChIP-on-chip that does not require antibodies is [[DamID]].

Also available are antibodies against a specific histone modification like [[Histone H3|H3]] tri methyl K4. As mentioned before, the combination of these antibodies and ChIP-on-chip has become extremely powerful in determining whole genome analysis of histone modification patterns and will contribute tremendously to our understanding of the [[histone code]] and epigenetics.

A study demonstrating the non-specific nature of DNA binding proteins has been published in PLoS Biology. This indicates that alternate confirmation of functional relevancy is a necessary step in any ChIP-chip experiment.&lt;ref name="X-Y Li et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transcription Factors Bind Thousands of Active and Inactive Regions in the Drosophila Blastoderm |journal= PLOS Biology|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages= e27|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060027 |pmid= 18271625|pmc= 2235902|year = 2008|last1 = Li|first1 = Xiao-Yong|last2= MacArthur|first2= Stewart|last3= Bourgon|first3= Richard|last4= Nix|first4= David|last5= Pollard|first5= Daniel A.|last6= Iyer|first6= Venky N.|last7= Hechmer|first7= Aaron|last8= Simirenko|first8= Lisa|last9= Stapleton|first9= Mark|last10= Hendriks|first10= Cris L.

== History ==
A first ChIP-on-chip experiment was performed in 1999 to analyze the  distribution of cohesin along [[budding]] [[yeast]] chromosome III.&lt;ref&gt;Blat Y, Kleckner N., Cohesins bind to preferential sites along yeast chromosome III, with differential regulation along arms versus the centric region, Cell (1999) Jul 23;98(2):249-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the genome was not completely represented, the protocol in this study remains equivalent as those used in later studies. The ChIP-on-chip technique using all of the ORFs of the genome (that nevertheless remains incomplete, missing intergenic regions) was then applied successfully in three papers published in 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Lieb, X. Liu, D. Botstein, P.O. Brown, Promoter-specific binding of Rap1 revealed by genome-wide maps of protein-DNA association, Nat. Genet. 28 (2001) 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Ren, F. Robert, J.J. Wyrick, O. Aparicio, E.G. Jennings, I. Simon, J. Zeitlinger, J. Schreiber, N. Nannett, E. Kanin, T.L. Volkert, C.J. Wilson, S.R. Bell, R.A. Young, Genome-wide location and function of DNA binding proteins, Science 290 (2000) 2306-2309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.R. Iyer, C.E. Horak, C.S. Scafe, D. Botstein, M. Snyder, P.O. Brown, Genomic binding sites of the yeast cell-cycle transcription factors SBF and MBF, Nature 409 (2001) 533-538.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors identified binding sites for individual transcription factors in the [[budding]] [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. In 2002, Richard Young’s group &lt;ref&gt;T.I. Lee, N.J. Rinaldi, F. Robert, D.T. Odom, Z. Bar-Joseph, G.K. Gerber, N.M. Hannett, C.T. Harbison, C.M. Thompson, I. Simon, J. Zeitlinger, E.G. Jennings, H.L. Murray, D.B. Gordon, B. Ren, J.J. Wyrick, J.B Tagne, T.L. Volkert, E. Fraenkel, D.K. Gifford, R.A Young, Transcriptional regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Science 298 (2002) 799-804.&lt;/ref&gt; determined the genome-wide positions of 106 transcription factors using a c-Myc tagging system in yeast. The first demonstration of  the mammalian ChIp-on-chip technique reported the isolation of nine chromatin fragments containing weak and strong E2F binding site was done by Peggy Farnham's lab in collaboration with Michael Zhang's lab and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Weinmann AS, Bartley SM, Zhang T, Zhang MQ, Farnham PJ. Use of chromatin immunoprecipation to clone novel E2F target promoters., Molecular and Cell Biology 20 (2001)6820-32.&lt;/ref&gt;   This study was followed several months later in a collaboration between the Young lab with the laboratory of Brian Dynlacht which used the ChIP-on-chip technique to show for the first time that E2F targets encode components of the DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways, as well as factors involved in chromatin assembly/condensation, chromosome segregation, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint&lt;ref&gt;Ren B, Cam H, Takahashi Y, Volkert T, Terragni J, Young RA, Dynlacht BD. E2F integrates cell cycle progression with DNA repair, and G2(M) checkpoints., Genes and Development 16 (2002) 245-56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other applications for ChIP-on-chip include [[DNA replication]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and chromatin structure. Since then, ChIP-on-chip has become a powerful tool in determining genome-wide maps of histone modifications and many more transcription factors. ChIP-on-chip in mammalian systems has been difficult due to the large and repetitive genomes. Thus, many studies in mammalian cells have focused on select promoter regions that are predicted to bind transcription factors and have not analyzed the entire genome. However, whole mammalian genome arrays have recently become commercially available from companies like Nimblegen. In the future, as ChIP-on-chip arrays become more and more advanced, high resolution whole genome maps of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin components for mammals will be analyzed in more detail.

==Alternatives==
[[Chip-Sequencing]] is a recently developed technology that still uses chromatin immunoprecipitation to crosslink the proteins of interest to the DNA but then instead of using a micro-array, it uses the more accurate, higher throughput method of sequencing to localize interaction points.

[[DamID]] is an alternative method that does not require antibodies.

[[ChIP-exo]] uses exonuclease treatment to achieve up to single base pair resolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2660">'''Charles George Johnson''' (1886{{endash}}14 October 1950) was a chemist, businessman and political figure in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].

==Biography==
Johnson was born in [[Essex]], England in 1886 and led an adventurous life, including a spell of [[boxing]] professionally, before arriving in Adelaide in 1925.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45658933 Death of City Councillor], ''The Advertiser'', Monday 16 October 1950, p.4. Accessed 30 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He first came to public notice as an [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] (ALP) candidate for a North Adelaide seat in South Australia's House of Assembly in 1933.

In August 1934, Johnson founded the cleaning products company [[Jasol Chemical Products]]. "Jasol" was an [[acronym]] for "Johnson's Antiseptic Soluble Oils Limited." Early deliveries were done by Johnson on a [[pushbike]].

In 1945, when he was well known for his association with the Jasol firm, Johnson was elected as Councillor on the [[Adelaide City Council]]. He resigned from the ALP in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43747401 Councillor resigns from A.L.P.], ''The Advertiser'', 11 December 1947, p.3. Accessed 30 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He consistently voted against generosity towards retiring councillors, mayors and employees, even when he acknowledged that the person had served the council exceptionally well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30508961 Points from Letters], ''The Advertiser'', Friday 24 January 1947, p.12.

Accessed 30 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1949 to stand as an alderman but was defeated.

He was vice-president of the Adelaide sub-branch of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Sailors Soldiers and Airmens Imperial League of Australia]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Johnson lived on [[South Terrace, Adelaide]]. He died in the [[Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park]] in 1950. He was survived by his wife Millie Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45658804 Births Deaths and Marriages], ''The Advertiser'', 16 October 1950, p.16.

'''Compressed hydrogen''' (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CGH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CGH2) is the [[gaseous state]] of the element [[hydrogen]] kept under [[pressure]]. Compressed hydrogen in [[hydrogen tank]]s at 350 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for mobile [[hydrogen storage]] in [[hydrogen vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/hydrogen/basics/documents/task2_gaseous_h2.pdf Compressed Hydrogen Storage]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a [[fuel gas]].

==Infrastructure==
Compressed hydrogen is used in [[hydrogen pipeline transport]] and in [[compressed hydrogen tube trailer]] transport.

[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.
|salign = right
|source = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cosmic Chemistry: Cosmogony  : Teacher Text : Background Information|publisher=Genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|width  = 30em
|align  = right
}}

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

''is irreducible over the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;''.

== The second cuboid conjecture ==

'''Cuboid conjecture 2.''' ''For any two positive coprime integer numbers

The conjectures 1, 2, and 3 are related to the [[Euler brick#Perfect cuboid|perfect cuboid]] problem.&lt;ref name=shr_01&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharipov R.A. |title=Perfect cuboids and irreducible polynomials|journal=Ufa Math Journal|year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=153&amp;ndash;160|arxiv=1108.5348|bibcode=2011arXiv1108.5348S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shr_02&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharipov R.A. |title=Asymptotic approach to the perfect cuboid problem|journal=Ufa Math Journal|year=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=100&amp;ndash;113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they are not equivalent to the perfect cuboid problem, if all of these three conjectures  are valid, then no perfect cuboids exist.

'''TIDES''' is an ambitious technology development effort, funded by [[DARPA]]. It stands for '''Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization'''. It is focused on the automated processing and understanding of a variety of human language data.  The primary goal is to make it possible for English speakers to find and interpret needed information quickly and effectively regardless of language or medium.

==Overview==

To provide that overall capability, TIDES is intended to develop a suite of robust, powerful, broadly useful component capabilities; integrate those components effectively in technology demonstration systems; and experiment with the systems on real-world problems.  These are all high-risk research activities.

The four component capabilities are
* Detection &amp;ndash; Find or discover needed information.
* Extraction &amp;ndash; Pull out key facts.
* [[Automatic summarization|Summarization]] &amp;ndash; Reduce number of words that someone must read.
* Translation &amp;ndash; Convert text from another language into English.

Detection, extraction, and summarization must work within a language (monolingually) and across languages (translingually) to aid people who speak only English.

In addition to creating effective technology, TIDES aims to develop methods for porting these capabilities rapidly and inexpensively to other languages, including languages having severely limited linguistic resources.

TIDES will integrate its component capabilities with one another and with other technologies to produce synergistic, effective, end-to-end, technology demonstration systems able to address multiple real-world applications.

==Investigative Data Warehouse==
The [[FBI]]'s [[Investigative Data Warehouse]] contains an "Open Source News Library". This library contains news gathered by the TIDES program. The information is collected from dozens of public websites all over the world, such as Ha'aretz, Pravda, the Jordan Times, The People's Daily, ''The Washington Post'', and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/foia_idw/20090609_idw04.pdf FBI, ''IDW-S System Security Plan'', 2003 Dec 3], pages 58-69 of linked pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the [[MiTAP]] (Mitre Text and Audio Processing) system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/foia_idw/20090609_idw04.pdf FBI, Security Concept of Operations IDW, 2004 11 29], pages 50, 51 of linked pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1001">The '''Disneyland model''' is a proposed system in which users of a service would bear no risk for damage or injuries they sustain that are caused by others, as full liability would be imposed upon the responsible party (and/or their insurers). It is in contrast to the [[ballpark model]], under which people use a service at their own risk. The Disneyland model is frequently advocated as a method by which licensure of motorists and their vehicles could be privatized. Before a person would be granted a [[license plate]], they would need to obtain liability insurance without any caps on coverage amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=2020 On the Road: Newsroom: The Independent Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the fact that at [[Disneyland]], the company is liable for any accidents that befall a customer if they, for instance, ride a ride they were too short for.

'''Distributed Free Rainbow Tables''' (or '''DistrRTgen''') was a distributed computing project for making [[rainbow tables]] for [[password cracking]]. By using distributed computing, DistrRTgen can generate rainbow tables that are able to crack long passwords. DistrRtgen was used to generate LM, NTLM, MD5 and MYSQLSHA1 rainbow tables. All of the rainbow tables are downloadable at [https://www.freerainbowtables.com/ Free Rainbow Tables].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1439">The '''Donchian channel''' is an indicator used in market trading developed by [[Richard Donchian]]. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last ''n'' periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.

It is commonly available on most trading platforms. On a charting program, a line is marked for the high and low values visually demonstrating the channel on the markets price (or other) values.

The Donchian channel is a useful indicator for seeing the [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of a market price. If a price is stable the Donchian channel will be relatively narrow. If the price fluctuates a lot the Donchian channel will be wider. Its primary use, however, is for providing signals for [[Long (finance)|long]] and [[Short selling|short]] positions. If a security trades above its highest ''n'' periods high, then a long is established. If it trades below its lowest ''n'' periods low, then a short is established.

Originally the ''n'' periods were based upon daily values. With today's trading platforms, the period may be of the value desired by the investor. i.e.: day, hour, minute, ticks, etc.

The [[European Social Charter|Social Charter]] initially defined what many UK campaigning groups termed the '''Council of Europe [[decency]] threshold''' in the 1960s as 68% of average earnings within a [[national economy]]. The definition was modified to that of 60% of [[Net pay|net]] earnings ({{As of|2004|alt=as of July 2004}}) in order to take account of the difficulties experienced in taking into account initiatives such as redistributive tax systems when calculating adequate incomes.  

There are a number of anomalies between the previous use of this threshold by UK campaigning groups and the way in which it is understood by the Secretariat of the European Social Charter. The exact origins of the term 'Council of Europe Decency Threshold' are vague, but it is said to be an incorrect term as the Council of Europe did not create it. It is therefore now more commonly referred to as the 'European Social Charter Adequate Remuneration Threshold' or ESCART.

Many [[pressure group]]s in the UK used the original method of calculation to call for a higher [[minimum wage]]. Before its closure, the [[Low Pay Unit]] used this threshold in campaigning in addition to calling for a minimum wage of half male [[median]] earnings, rising to 2/3 over the next few years. However, it (like many other organisations) had expressed reservations about the usefulness of the Threshold following the move to a definition of 60% of net average earnings, primarily because this was a far lower monetary amount than the Threshold as previously defined.

The [[Scottish Low Pay Unit]], an independent organisation with similar aims to the now-defunct London based Low Pay Unit, continue to campaign for a higher National Minimum Wage in this way although they do not use the ESCART due to difficulties in obtaining accurate net earnings figures for the UK. They have also produced a briefing outlining the advantages and disadvantages of the calculation.

The '''galactic anticenter''' is a direction in space directly opposite to the [[Galactic Center]], as viewed from [[Earth]]. This direction corresponds to a point on the [[celestial sphere]]. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the galactic anticenter is located in the constellation [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Alnath|Beta Tauri]] is the bright star that appears nearest this point.

}}

== Education ==
Harriman received a B.S. degree in chemistry from [[American International College]]. She studied Biomedical and [[Pharmaceutical Sciences]] with Prof. Elie Abushanab at the [[University of Rhode Island]], receiving her doctorate in 1991. Harriman completed postdoctoral studies with Prof. [[Gunda Georg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/georggroup/alumni|title=Alumni - Georg Research Group|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Kansas]], focusing on the medicinal chemistry of [[paclitaxel]] analogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Georg|first=Gunda I.|title=Medicinal Chemistry of Paclitaxel|date=1994-12-07|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1995-0583.ch016|work=ACS Symposium Series|pages=217–232|publisher=American Chemical Society|language=EN|doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0583.ch016|isbn=0841230730|access-date=2018-10-24|last2=Harriman|first2=Geraldine C.

== Career ==
Harriman's first industrial position was at the immunology start-up LeukoSite,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotspotthera.com/team/|title=Team - HotSpot Therapeutics|work=HotSpot Therapeutics|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was acquired by Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/business/millennium-set-to-buy-leukosite.html|title=Millennium Set To Buy Leukosite|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next seven years, Harriman rose to become the Head of Chemistry at Millennium, when she was recruited by [[Galenea]] in 2007. She served as VP and Head of Chemistry there until 2010, when she was appointed VP at [[Nimbus Therapeutics]], formed by [[Atlas Venture|Atlas Ventures]] in 2009. Nimbus specialized in computational and outsourced drug discovery. The program Harriman oversaw - "Nimbus Apollo" - focused on targeting the [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|acetyl-coA carboxylase]] pathway to treat fatty liver diseases such as [[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis]] (NASH). Gilead acquired Nimbus Apollo for $1.2 billion USD in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2016/04/04/atlas-backed-nimbus-delivers-its-apollo-mission-a-1-2b-gilead-partnership/#28f2368b5c22|title=Atlas-Backed Nimbus Delivers Its Apollo Mission: A $1.2B Gilead Partnership|last=Booth|first=Bruce|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Harriman co-founded Atlas-backed HotSpot Therapeutics, which will seek for [[Allosteric modulator|allosteric]] inhibitors to potentially treat [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and metabolic disorders. Harriman is a co-inventor on over twenty small-molecule use patents and 30 scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/geraldine-harriman#section-overview|title=Crunchbase Profile: Geraldine Harriman|last=|first=|date=October 2018|website=CrunchBase|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul F. "Ginger" Fraser''' was an American football player, coach, and military officer. He was considered to be one of Maine's all-time greatest college football players.&lt;ref name=Retire /&gt;

==Early life==
Fraser was born in [[Boston]]'s [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; He attended [[Boston Latin School]] in 1907 and 1908, where he played end, center, and halfback on the football team and outfield on the baseball team. He then attended [[Dorchester High School (Massachusetts)|Dorchester High School]] in 1909 and 1910, where he played in the backfield on the football team and second base on the baseball team.&lt;ref name=Everett /&gt; He was a named to the greater Boston all-scholastic football team two years.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|title='Ginger' Fraser Dies, Colby Gridiron Star|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=April 12, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College==
Fraser attended [[Colby College]], where he played four years for the [[Colby Mules]] football team. He was the team captain in 1914.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; [[1914 Colby Mules football team |That year]], Colby outscored its three in-state rivals [[Bowdoin College]], the [[University of Maine]], and [[Bates College]] 123 to 0 to win the series title. Colby also gained national recognition for its game against the star–studded [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipmen]]. Colby led Navy 21–10 at the half, but due to Navy's superior manpower, it was able to use a great number of substitutes in the second half, which helped the team score 21 unanswered points and win the game 31–21. After the game, a ''[[New York Times]]'' sportswriter wrote "It was one of the finest exhibitions of football ever seen at Annapolis. In the first half the brilliant running of [Edward] Cawley, [John] Lowney, and Fraser swept the Midshipmen off their feet."&lt;ref name=Lewiston&gt;{{cite news|title=Honor Memory of Ginger Fraser at Colby Night|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19391102&amp;id=LNNKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=evMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4427,2461794&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 18, 2015|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=November 2, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching==
After graduating in 1915, Fraser served as sub-master and athletic director at Waterville High School in [[Waterville, Maine]].&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; On April 27, 1916, the [[Everett, Massachusetts]] School Committee unanimously voted to hire Fraser to coach football and baseball and teach science. He succeeded [[Cleo O'Donnell]], who became head coach of the [[Purdue Boilermakers football]] team.&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Fraser Chosen|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=April 28, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Fraser tried to enter government service, but was initially rejected due to poor eyesight. He instead joined the [[YMCA]], which maintained camps at the rear of the fighting lines. On April 30, 1917 he was ordered to report to his YMCA in [[Portland, Maine]]. Everett High granted him an indefinite leave of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coach Fraser Ordered to Join Unit at Portland, ME|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=May 1, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; That December, Fraser was selected for the Officers' Training Corps and assigned to [[Fort Oglethorpe (Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia)|Fort Oglethorpe]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sportsman|title=Live Tips and Topics|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=December 20, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later transferred to [[Camp Wadsworth]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where he excelled in wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sportsman|title=Live Tips and Topics|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=April 22, 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually assigned to the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment as a First Lieutenant.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

After the War, Fraser became athletic director at the [[Coburn Classical Institute]]. In 1922 he became community athletic director for [[Westbrook, Maine]] and head football coach of the [[Westbrook High School (Maine)|town's high school]].&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; He also served as a teacher and secretary of the Westbrook Community Association.&lt;ref name=Retire /&gt; In 1926 his team won the Maine state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr Boardman Talks to Maine Alumni|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=February 13, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he was the referee for a football game between Bowdoin and [[Boston University]]. The game was the first in Maine and one of the first in the United States to be played with a limited number of plays (each team had thirty plays per quarter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraser to be Referee in Brunswick Game|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=September 25, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowdoin won the game 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1926|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=4030&amp;year=1926|website=College Football Data Warehouse|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 and 1929, Fraser was granted a leave of absence to serve as an assistant football coach at Bowdoin.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; He retired as Westbrook football coach and athletic director in June 1932, but stayed on as a teacher and community association secretary.&lt;ref name=Retire&gt;{{cite news|title=Ginger Fraser to Retire After Completing Year|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=November 11, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On April 11, 1938, Fraser died of a heart attack following a game of badminton. He was survived by his wife, four daughters, and two sons. In 1939, Colby College's annual "Colby Night" was renamed "Ginger Fraser Night" to honor Fraser. All of the living members of the 1914 team returned to Colby for the school's homecoming celebration.&lt;ref name=Lewiston /&gt;

[[Image:Small Weight.png|thumb|Closeup of collet (weight).]]
The '''Gyromax''' is the trade name for an adjustable mass (or adjustable [[inertia]]) [[balance wheel]] used in [[Patek Philippe]] [[wristwatches]]. Instead of weight adjustment screws on the outside of the rim, as in traditional balances, the Gyromax has turnable weights recessed into the top of the rim.  The advantages claimed for this design are that, without projecting weight screws, the diameter of the balance can be increased, giving it a larger [[moment of inertia]], and that it has less air resistance.

The Gyromax balance has six to eight small turnable weights that fit on pins located in recesses around the top of the balance wheel rim. Each of the weights, called ''collets'', has a cutout making it heavier on one side.   When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the balance wheel, the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed.  When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the balance wheel turns more slowly.  A [[watchmaker]] can turn an individual collet to adjust the wheel's balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust the wheel's rotation speed.  The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the wheel's [[balance spring]] for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.

Swiss patents were granted to Patek Phillipe for the Gyromax balance on May 15, 1949 and December 31, 1951, and the balance was first used in watches in 1952.  Another balance wheel with a similar design is the [[Rolex]] Microstella.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">'''Information history''' may refer to the history of each of the categories listed below (or to combinations of them). It should be recognized that the understanding of, for example, libraries as information systems only goes back to about 1950. The application of the term ''information'' for earlier systems or societies is a [[retronym]].

==The word and concept "information"==
The Latin roots and Greek origins of the word "information" is presented by Capurro &amp; Hjørland (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Capurro, Rafael &amp; Hjørland, Birger (2003). The concept of information. Annual review of information science and technology (s. 343-411). Medford, N.J.: Information Today. A version retrieved November 6, 2011 from: http://www.capurro.de/infoconcept.html&lt;/ref&gt; References on "formation or molding of the mind or character, training, instruction, teaching" date from the 14th century in both English (according to [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) and other European languages. 
In the transition from Middle Ages to Modernity the use of the concept of information reflected a fundamental turn in epistemological basis – from "giving a (substantial) form to matter" to "communicating something to someone". Peters (1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13) concludes:

:Information was readily deployed in empiricist psychology (though it played a less important role than other words such as impression or idea) because it seemed to describe the mechanics of sensation: objects in the world inform the senses. But sensation is entirely different from "form" – the one is sensual, the other intellectual; the one is subjective, the other objective. My sensation of things is fleeting, elusive, and idiosynchratic [sic]. For Hume, especially, sensory experience is a swirl of impressions cut off from any sure link to the real world...  In any case, the empiricist problematic was how the mind is informed by sensations of the world. At first informed meant shaped by; later it came to mean received reports from. As its site of action drifted from cosmos to consciousness, the term's sense shifted from unities (Aristotle's forms) to units (of sensation). Information came less and less to refer to internal ordering or formation, since empiricism allowed for no preexisting intellectual forms outside of sensation itself. Instead, information came to refer to the fragmentary, fluctuating, haphazard stuff of sense. Information, like the early modern worldview in general, shifted from a divinely ordered cosmos to a system governed by the motion of corpuscles. Under the tutelage of empiricism, information gradually moved from structure to stuff, from form to substance, from intellectual order to sensory impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, J. D. (1988). Information: Notes Toward a Critical History. Journal of Communication Inquiry, 12, 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the most important influence on the concept of information is derived from the [[Information theory]] developed by Shannon and others. This theory, however, reflects a fundamental contradiction. Qvortrup (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Qvortrup, L. (1993). The controversy over the concept of information. An overview and a selected and annotated bibliography. Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing 1(4), 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

:Thus, actually two conflicting metaphors are being used: The well-known metaphor of information as a quantity, like water in the waterpipe, is at work, but so is a second metaphor, that of information as a choice, a choice made by :an information provider, and a forced choice made by an :information receiver. Actually, the second metaphor implies that the information sent isn’t necessarily equal to the information received, because any choice implies a comparison with a list of possibilities, i.e., a list of possible meanings. Here, meaning is involved, thus spoiling the idea of information as a pure "Ding an sich." Thus, much of the confusion regarding the concept of information seems to be related to the basic confusion of metaphors in Shannon’s theory: is information an autonomous quantity, or is information always per se information to an observer? Actually, I don’t think that Shannon himself chose one of the two definitions. Logically speaking, his theory implied information as a subjective phenomenon. But this had so wide-ranging epistemological impacts that Shannon didn’t seem to fully realize this logical fact. Consequently, he continued to use metaphors about information as if it were an objective substance. This is the basic, inherent contradiction in Shannon’s information theory." (Qvortrup, 1993, p. 5)

In their seminal book ''The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages'',&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, Fritz &amp; Una Mansfield (eds.). 1983. The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Machlup and Mansfield (1983) collected key views on the interdisciplinary controversy in computer science, artificial intelligence, library and information science, linguistics, psychology, and physics, as well as in the social sciences. Machlup (1983,&lt;ref&gt;Machlup,Fritz. 1983. "Semantic Quirks in Studies of Information," pp. 641-71 in Fritz Machlup &amp; Una Mansfield, The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.
&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;660) himself disagrees with the use of the concept of information in the context of signal transmission, the basic senses of information in his view al referring "to telling something or to the something that is being told. Information is addressed to human minds and is received by human minds." All other senses, including its use with regard to nonhuman organisms as well to society as a whole, are, according to Machlup, metaphoric and, as in the case of cybernetics, anthropomorphic.

''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 58(10), 1448-1456.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fundamental difference between objective and subjective views of information and argues that the subjective view has been supported by, among others, Bateson,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G.

An activity-theoretical approach to information science. Westport: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hjørland provided the following example: 
:A stone on a field could contain different information for different people (or from one situation to another). It is not possible for information systems to map all the stone’s possible information for every individual. Nor is any one mapping the one "true" mapping. But people have different educational backgrounds and play different roles in the division of labor in society. A stone in a field represents typical one kind of information for the geologist, another for the archaeologist. The information from the stone can be mapped into different collective knowledge structures produced by e.g. geology and archaeology. Information can be identified, described, represented in information systems for different domains of knowledge. Of course, there are much uncertainty and many and difficult problems in determining whether a thing is informative or not for a domain. Some domains have high degree of consensus and rather explicit criteria of relevance. Other domains have different, conflicting paradigms, each containing its own more or less implicate view of the informativeness of different kinds of information sources. (Hjørland, 1997, p. 111, emphasis in original).

==Academic discipline==
'''Information history''' is an emerging discipline related to, but broader than, [[library history]]. An important introduction and review was made by Alistair Black (2006).&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, A. (2006). Information history. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 40 , 441-473.&lt;/ref&gt;
A prolific scholar in this field is also Toni Weller, for example, Weller (2007, 2008, 2010a and 2010b).&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2007). Information history: its importance, relevance and future.  ASLIB Proceedings, 59(4-5), 437-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2008). Information History—An Introduction: Exploring an Emergent Field. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2010a), An Information History Decade: A Review of the Literature and Concepts, 2000–2009, Library &amp; Information History, 26 (1), 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (Ed) (2010b), Information History in the Modern World: Histories of the Information Age, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her work Toni Weller has argued that there are important links between the modern information age and its historical precedents.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (June 2010), 'The Victorian Information Age: Nineteenth Century Answers to Today's Information Policy Questions?', History &amp; Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris (November 2010), 'The Victorians were every bit as inquisitive as us', BBC History Magazine. http://www.historyextra.com/feature/victorians-were-every-bit-inquisitive-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2012), 'The Information State: A Historical Perspective on Surveillance' in Lyon, Haggerty &amp; Ball (Eds), Routledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies&lt;/ref&gt; A description from Russia is Volodin (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Volodin, B.F. (2000).  History of librarianship, library history, or information history: A view from Russia. Library Quarterly, 70(4), 446-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair Black (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;445) wrote: "This chapter explores issues of discipline definition and legitimacy by segmenting information history into its various components: 
* The history of print and written culture, including relatively long-established areas such as the histories of libraries and librarianship, book history, publishing history, and the history of reading.
* The history of more recent information disciplines and practice, that is to say, the history of information management, information systems, and information science.
* The history of contiguous areas, such as the history of the information society and information infrastructure, necessarily enveloping communication history (including telecommunications history) and the history of information policy.
* The history of information as social history, with emphasis on the importance of informal information networks."

"Bodies influential in the field include the American Library Association’s Round Table on Library History, the Library History Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), and, in the U.K., the Library and Information History Group of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP). Each of these bodies has been busy in recent years, running conferences and seminars, and initiating scholarly projects. Active library history groups function in many other countries, including Germany (The Wolfenbuttel Round Table on Library History, the History of the Book and the History of Media, located at the Herzog August Bibliothek), Denmark (The Danish Society for Library History, located at the Royal School of Library and Information Science), Finland (The Library History Research Group, University of Tamepere), and Norway (The Norwegian Society for Book and Library History). Sweden has no official group dedicated to the subject, but interest is generated by the existence of a museum of librarianship in Bods, established by the Library Museum Society and directed by Magnus Torstensson. Activity in Argentina, where, as in Europe and the U.S., a "new library history" has developed, is described by Parada (2004)." (Black (2006, p. 447).&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

==Information technology (IT)==
The term IT is ambiguous although mostly synonym with computer technology. Haigh (2011, pp. 432-433) wrote 
:"In fact, the great majority of references to information technology have always been concerned with computers, although the exact meaning has shifted over time (Kline, 2006). The phrase received its first prominent usage in a Harvard Business Review article (Haigh, 2001b;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2001b). Inventing information systems; The systems men and the computer, 1950-1968. Business History Review, 75(1), 15-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt &amp; Whisler, 1958&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt, H. J. &amp; Whisler, T. L. (1958). Management in the 1980s. Harward Business Review, 36(6), 41-48.&lt;/ref&gt;) intended to promote a technocratic vision for the future of business management. Its initial definition was at the conjunction of computers, operations research methods, and simulation techniques. Having failed initially to gain much traction (unlike related terms of a similar vintage such as information systems, information processing, and information science) it was revived in policy and economic circles in the 1970s with a new meaning. Information technology now described the expected convergence of the computing, media, and telecommunications industries (and their technologies), understood within the broader context of a wave of enthusiasm for the computer revolution, [[post-industrial society]], information society (Webster, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (1995). Theories of the information society. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;), and other fashionable expressions of the belief that new electronic technologies were bringing a profound rupture with the past. As it spread broadly during the 1980s, IT increasingly lost its association with communications (and, alas, any vestigial connection to the idea of anybody actually being informed of anything) to become a new and more pretentious way of saying "computer". The final step in this process is the recent surge in references to "information and communication technologies" or ICTs, a coinage that makes sense only if one assumes that a technology can inform without communicating".&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2011). The history of information technology. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45, 431-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people use the term ''information technology'' about technologies used before the development of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jeremy G. (1997). A History of Information Technology and Systems. http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is however to use the term as a [[retronym]].

==Information society==
{{See also|Information Age|Information revolution}}
"It is said that we live in an "Age of Information," but it is an open scandal that there is no theory, nor even definition, of information that is both broad and precise enough to make such an assertion meaningful." (Goguen, 1997).&lt;ref name="Goguen"/&gt;

The Danish Internet researcher Niels Ole Finnemann (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Finnemann, Niels Ole (2001). The Internet-A New Communicational Infrastructure. Manuscript for the 15th Nordic Conference on Media and Communication Research, "New Media, New opportunities, New Societies", University of Iceland in Reykjavik, Iceland, August 11th-13th, 2001. Tilgængelig: https://web.archive.org/web/20040328165322/http://cfi.imv.au.dk/pub/skriftserie/002_finnemann.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; developed a general history of media. He wrote: "A society cannot exist in which the production and exchange of information are of only minor significance. For this reason one cannot compare industrial societies to information societies in any consistent way. Industrial societies are necessarily also information societies, and information societies may also be industrial societies." He suggested the following media matrix:&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, James (2011).''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood.''New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Oral cultures based mainly on speech.
# Literate cultures: speech + writing (primary alphabets and number systems).
# Print cultures: speech + written texts + print.
# Mass-media cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media.
# Second-order alphabetic cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media + digital media.

==Information science==
{{See also|Information science#History|Cranfield experiments|Documentation science|Information scientist}}
Many information science historians cite [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] as the fathers of information science with the founding of the [[International Institute of Bibliography]] (IIB) in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (1994). International federation for information and documentation. In W. A. Wiegand, &amp; D. G. David Jr. (Eds.), The encyclopedia of library history (pp. 290–294). New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Trudi Bellardo &amp; Buckland, Michael (eds.). (1998). ''Historical studies in information science.'' Medford, NJ: Information Today, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, information science emerged in the last part of the 19th century as [[documentation science]] which in general shifted name to [[information science]] in the 1960s.

Heting Chu (2010) classified the history and development of information representation and retrieval (IRR) in four phases. "The history of IRR is not long. A retrospective look at the field identifies increased demand, rapid growth, the demystification phase, and the networked era as the four major stages IRR has experienced in its development:" &lt;ref&gt;Chu, Heting (2010).’’  Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age’’, Second Edition. Medford, NJ: Information Today&lt;/ref&gt;

# Increased Demand (1940s–early 1950s) ([[Information explosion]])
# Rapid Growth (1950s–1980s) (the emergence of computers and systems such as [[Dialog (online database)]])
# Demystification Phase (1980s–1990s) (systems developed for end-user searching)
# The Networked Era (1990s–Present) (search enginees such as [[AltaVista]] and [[Google]])

The '''Korean decimal classification''' ('''KDC''') is a system of [[library classification]] used in [[South Korea]]. The main classes are the same as in the Dewey Decimal Classification but these are in a different order: Natural sciences 400; Technology and engineering 500; Arts 600; Language 700.

==Main classes==
* 000 General
* 100 Philosophy
* 200 Religion
* 300 Social sciences
* 400 Natural sciences
* 500 Technology and engineering
* 600 Arts
* 700 Language

'''Ángel Leopoldo López-Escobar''' (1940 – June 29, 2013) was a Chilean [[geochemistry]] academic. His scientific career begun by studying Biology and Chemistry at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]. Later he worked at the [[Austral University of Chile]] and the [[University of Chile]]. In 1996 he started a [[metallogeny]] research group at the [[University of Concepción]].

It prioritizes scientific research as the basis of innovation, and plays down the role of later players in the innovation process.

Current models of [[innovation]] derive from approaches such as [[Actor-Network Theory]], [[Social shaping of technology]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/53871734|title=Networks of innovation : change and meaning in the age of the Internet|last=Ilkka.|first=Tuomi,|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199256985|oclc=53871734}}&lt;/ref&gt;,provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works. Current ideas in [[Open Innovation]] and [[User innovation]] derive from these later ideas. 

In the 'Phase Gate Model' , the product or services concept is frozen at an early stage to minimize risk. Through enterprise, the innovation process involves a series of sequential phases arranged in a manner that the preceding phase muse be cleared before movie to the next phase. Therefore a project must pass through a gate with the permission of the gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase.

Criteria for passing through each gate is defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for the preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place during the preceding phase or not.

Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented:

# "technology push" model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "market pull" model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The stages of the "Technology Push" model are: 

:Basic science→Design and engineering→Manufacturing→Marketing→Sales

From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the "market pull" model of innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the "market pull " model are:

:Market need—Development—Manufacturing—Sales.

The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different "stages" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation. A history of the linear model of innovation may be found in Godin ''The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godin|first1=Benoit|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2006|volume=31|pages=639–667|url=http://www.csiic.ca/PDF/Godin_30.pdf|doi=10.1177/0162243906291865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 'Hunter Theory', the virus was transmitted from a chimpanzee to a human when a bushmeat hunter was bitten or cut while hunting or butchering an animal. The resulting exposure of the hunter to blood or other bodily fluids of the chimpanzee could have resulted in infection. A contrasting hypothesis [[scientific consensus|regarded]] as disproven is the [[OPV AIDS hypothesis|oral polio vaccine (OPV) AIDS hypothesis]].

'''''Newton's Apple''''' is an American [[education]]al [[television program]] produced and developed by [[Twin Cities PBS|KTCA]] of [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]], and distributed to [[PBS]] stations in the [[United States]] that ran from October 15, 1983, to January 3, 1998, with reruns continued until October 31, 1999.&lt;ref name= "fun"&gt;{{cite news |last=Unger |first=Arthur |url= https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1013/101306.html |title=Science program 'Newton's Apple' is fun, informative |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=October 13, 1983 |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's title is based on the legend of [[Isaac Newton]] sitting under a [[tree]] and an [[apple]] falling near him — or, more popularly, on his head — prompting him to ponder what makes things fall, leading to the development of his theory of [[gravitation]] (an event often loosely described as him "discovering" gravity). The show was produced by [[Twin Cities PBS|Twin Cities Public Television]] (tpt).&lt;ref name= "scigirls"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zahed |first=Ramin |url= http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/pbs-scigirls-announces-multi-platform-plans/ |title=PBS ‘SciGirls’ Announces Multi-platform Plans |work=[[Animation Magazine]] |date=August 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For most of the run, the show's theme song was ''Ruckzuck'' by [[Kraftwerk]], later remixed by Absolute Music. Earlier- and later- episodes of the show featured an original song.

[[Ira Flatow]] was the show's first host, later succeeded by David Heil, then assistant director of the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI).&lt;ref name= "science"&gt;{{cite news |last=Heffley |first=Lynne |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-06/entertainment/ca-587_1_science-education |title='Newton's Apple': Science That Hits You in the Head |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 6, 1990 |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peggy Knapp was a longtime field reporter and served as co-host in the 14th season.&lt;ref name= "project"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mendoza |first=N.

An occasional short feature called "Science of the Rich and Famous" featured celebrities explaining a scientific principle or natural or physical phenomenon; for example, rock star [[Ted Nugent]] explained guitar feedback, Olympic Gold Medalist skater [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]] demonstrated angular momentum in the context of a skater's spin, [[Monty Hall]] explained principles of [[probability]], and [[Betty White]] showed how cats purr.

"Newton's Apple" won numerous national awards including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Science Journalism Award, the Parent's Choice Award, and the 1989 [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Children's Series.  

A segment in the early years, titled "Newton's Lemons," used 1950s-era newsreels of a device that was considered "futuristic" at the time of its introduction but had long since been forgotten.

'''Orbit-Vis''' is an [[orbit]] simulation program which is designed to allow users to simulate a [[satellite]] in any orbit around the [[Earth]], and to give the user data on the position and motion of the satellite in both visual and numerical form. It is based on information from the book 'Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications',&lt;ref&gt;Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications by Oliver Montenbruck and Eberhard Gill&lt;/ref&gt; and is an example of an orbit propagation program utilising the Kepler [[Two-body problem]] for solving elliptical orbits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm Orbital mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the [[Graphics Device Interface]] to display the calculated orbit as it progresses.

==Features==

The program features two major parts - the input and numerical display window, in which the user can enter a desired [[Apogee]] and [[Perigee]] and press the 'Launch!' button to begin the simulation, and which displays the numerical properties of the orbit in real time, and also the visual display, which consists of a sizeable window displaying the Earth and the orbiting object to scale. Also featured is a control panel which allows the user to manipulate the display window in real time.

The graphical display features [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]] and the ability to update the inputs while the simulation is running, along with a moveable viewpoint and the ability to pause the simulation.

Version 2.0 also fixed various bugs and cleared up the interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">'''Pattern-oriented modeling''' ('''POM''') is an approach to bottom-up [[complex systems]] [[Systems analysis|analysis]] that was developed to [[Systems modeling|model]] complex ecological and [[agent-based model|agent-based]] systems. A goal of POM is to make ecological modeling more rigorous and comprehensive.&lt;ref name="IndividualBasedModelingAndEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Railsback  S.F. (2005), ''Individual-based Modeling and Ecology'', [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional ecosystem model attempts to approximate the real system as closely as possible. POM proponents posit that an ecosystem is so information-rich that an ecosystem model will inevitably either leave out relevant information or become over-parameterized and lose predictive power.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems"&gt;Grimm, V.; Revilla, E.; Berger, U.; Jeltsch, F.; Mooij, W.M.; Railsback, S.F.; Thulke, H.H.; Weiner, J. Wiegand, T.; DeAngelis D.L. (2005), "Pattern-oriented modeling of agent-based complex systems: lessons from ecology", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 310: 987-991&lt;/ref&gt; Through a focus on only the relevant patterns in the real system, POM offers a meaningful alternative to the traditional approach. 

An attempt to mimic the [[scientific method]], POM requires the researcher to begin with a pattern found in the real system, posit hypotheses to explain the pattern, and then develop predictions that can be tested. A model used to determine the original pattern may not be used to test the researcher’s predictions.  Through this focus on the pattern, the model can be constructed to include only information relevant to the question at hand.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingInpopulationEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Frank, K.; Jeltsch, F.; Brandl, R.; Uchmariski, J.; Wissel C. (1996), "Pattern-oriented modeling in population ecology", ''The Science of the Total Environment'', 183: 151-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

POM is also characterized by an effort to identify the appropriate [[Temporal scales|temporal]] and [[Spatial scales|spatial scale]] at which to study a pattern, and to avoid the assumption that a single process might explain a pattern at multiple temporal or spatial scales. It does, however, offer the opportunity to look explicitly at how processes at multiple scales might be driving a particular pattern.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

A look at the trade-offs between model complexity and payoff can be considered in the framework of the [[Medawar zone]]. The model is considered too simple if it addresses a single problem (e.g., the explanation behind a single pattern), whereas it will be considered too complex if it incorporates all the available biological data. The Medawar zone, where the payoff in what is learned is greatest, is at an intermediate level of model complexity.

==Usage==
Pattern-oriented modeling has been used to test [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] hypotheses on how herdsman decide which farmers to contract with when grazing their cattle. Herdsman behavior followed the pattern predicted by a 'friend' rather than 'cost' priority hypothesis.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

{{Infobox organization|name=Plymouth Coastal Observatory|image=Plymouth Coastal Observatory logo.jpg|website={{url|www.coastalmonitoring.org/southwest}}}}

The '''Plymouth Coastal Observatory''' ('''PCO''') is the data management centre for the South West Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme. It is managed and led by [[Teignbridge]] District Council in partnership with other south west of England local authorities and the [[Environment Agency]].

The South West Regional Coastal Programme is part of a nationwide network of regional coastal monitoring programmes. The focus of the ongoing programme is collecting data on [[Water waves|waves]], [[tides]], [[LiDAR]], [[Aerial Photography]], topographic beach surveys, storm response and ecological mapping Data is published through its website, and is freely available for public use.&lt;ref name="n-somerset.gov.uk"&gt;http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/Leisure/parks_and_open_spaces/Beaches-and-the-coast/Documents/sea%20defence%20deployment%20information%20%28pdf%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The PCO office is situated on the Campus of [[Plymouth University]], located in the city centre of [[Plymouth]], England.

==Creation==
The first phase of the programme was set up in 2006, with an initial grant of £7.2 million from the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA). The funding was split into two with £4.1 million used by [[Teignbridge]] to deliver, [[Bathymetric]] and [[Topographic]], [[Hydrographic surveys]] and £3.1 million managed by the [[Environment Agency]] to deliver [[Aerial photography]], [[LiDAR]] and Ecological mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/mobile/article/13041/Coastal-Monitoring-and-Defences|title=Coastal Monitoring and Defences|work=teignbridge.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ndascag.org/SW%20monitoring%20programme%20-%20Jan07.pdf|title=Strategic Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme for the South West|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 2 of the programme commenced in 2011 with 100% DEFRA funding, and will run until 2016. Phase 2 of the Programme is solely managed by Teignbridge District Council.&lt;ref name="channelcoast.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelcoast.org/southwest/programme_aims/|title=Channel Coastal Observatory - Programme Aims|date=5 February 2015|work=channelcoast.org|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assets==
The PCO has a network of wave buoys around the south west coastline collecting data on [[wave height]], direction and sea temperature.&lt;ref name="n-somerset.gov.uk"/&gt; In July 2014 the PCO wave [[buoys]] recorded the highest sea temperatures seen for 7 years around the south west coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28462717|title=Cornwall and Devon sea temperatures hit seven-year high|author=Morris, Jonathan|publisher=BBC News|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the PCO buoy network also detected a 0.5 - 0.8m [[tsunami]] along south west coast of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hydro-international.com/content/news/minor-uk-tsunami-after-massive-sub-atlantic-slide|title=Minor UK Tsunami After Massive sub-Atlantic Slide|work=hydro-international.com|date=4 July 2011|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCO has four [[tide gauges]] situated around the south west coast, collecting real time tidal and surge data. A notable addition to the tidal gauge network was the [[Port Isaac]] Step gauge, which was installed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-10870336|title=New north Cornwall tidal gauge to help sea predictions|publisher=BBC News|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation at Port Isaac filled a 'notable gap in measured tide data along the north Cornwall coastline' &lt;ref&gt;http://rid.eurocean.org/detail_pdf.jsp?load=315&amp;ran=0.9405646486455989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and Collaboration==
After the 2013/2014 winter storms [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) awarded a £50,000 emergency project grant to coastal researchers at the Plymouth University in conjunction with PCO and the [[Met Office]]. The project will run from the 1st March 2014 for 1 year and assess the coastal response to the extreme winter storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr|url=https://nerc.ukri.org/press/releases/2014/08-storms/|title=Study of the effects of recent winter storms' impact on southwest UK could aid preparedness|publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]]|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myscience.org.uk/wire/plymouth_university_coastal_scientists_receive_funding_to_study_full_impact_of_winter_storms-2014-Plymouth|title=Plymouth University coastal scientists receive funding to study full impact of winter storms|website=[[myScience]]|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration between the PCO and the Plymouth University Coastal Process Research Group (CPRG) is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coastalprocesses.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13863">{{short description|A proposed driving force for tectonic plate motion as the result of the lithosphere sliding down the raised asthenosphere below mid-ocean ridges}}
'''Ridge push''' or sliding plate force is a proposed [[Plate tectonics#Driving forces of plate motion|driving force]] for plate motion in [[plate tectonics]] that occurs at [[mid-ocean ridges]] as the result of the rigid [[lithosphere]] sliding down the hot, raised [[asthenosphere]] below mid-ocean ridges. Although it is called ridge push, the term is somewhat misleading; it is actually a [[body force]] that acts throughout an ocean plate, not just at the ridge, as a result of [[Gravity|gravitational pull]]. The name comes from earlier models of plate tectonics in which ridge push was primarily ascribed to upwelling magma at mid-ocean ridges pushing or wedging the plates apart.

== Mechanics ==
[[File:Ridge Push (Mid-ocean Ridge).png|alt=This image shows a mid-ocean ridge in cross-section. The material nearest the ridge (less than 90 million years old) experiences gravity and an angled normal force, resulting in a net force down and away from the ridge. Material older than 90 million years experiences gravity and an equal but directly opposite normal force, producing no ridge push.|thumb|400x400px|Diagram of a mid-ocean ridge showing ridge push near the mid-ocean ridge and the lack of ridge push after 90 Ma]]
Ridge push is the result of [[gravity|gravitational]] forces acting on the young, raised oceanic [[lithosphere]] around [[mid-ocean ridges]], causing it to slide down the similarly raised but weaker [[asthenosphere]] and push on lithospheric material farther from the ridges.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geodynamics|last=Turcotte|first=D.L.|last2=Schubert|first2=G.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|isbn=0-521-66186-2|edition=2|pages=1–21|chapter=Plate Tectonics|ref=CITEREFTurcotteSchubert2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mid-ocean ridges]] are long underwater mountain chains that occur at [[divergent boundary|divergent plate boundaries]] in the ocean, where new oceanic crust is formed by upwelling [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material as a result of tectonic plate spreading and relatively shallow (above ~60&amp;nbsp;km) [[Igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The upwelling mantle and fresh crust are [[Thermal expansion|hotter and less dense]] than the surrounding crust and mantle, but cool and contract with age until reaching equilibrium with older crust at around 90 Ma.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijer|first=P.T.|last2=Wortel|first2=M.J.R.|last3=Zoback|first3=Mary Lou|title=The dynamics of motion of the South American Plate|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=97|issue=B8|pages=11915–11931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/driving_forces_basic.htm|title=Driving Forces of Plate Motions|last=DiVenere|first=Vic|date=May 21, 2017|website=Columbia University, Earth and Space Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces an [[isostasy|isostatic]] response that causes the young regions nearest the plate boundary to rise above older regions and gradually sink with age, producing the mid-ocean ridge morphology.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The greater heat at the ridge also weakens rock closer to the surface, raising the [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary|boundary]] between the [[Brittleness|brittle]] lithosphere and the weaker, [[ductility|ductile]] asthenosphere to create a similar elevated and sloped feature underneath the ridge.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

These raised features produce ridge push; gravity pulling down on the lithosphere at the mid-ocean ridge is mostly opposed by the [[normal force]] from the underlying rock, but the remainder acts to push the lithosphere down the sloping asthenosphere and away from the ridge.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Because the asthenosphere is weak, ridge push and [[Plate tectonics#Driving forces of plate motion|other driving forces]] are enough to deform it and allow the lithosphere to slide over it, opposed by [[Drag (physics)|drag]] at the [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary]] and resistance to [[subduction]] at [[convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Ridge push is mostly active in lithosphere younger than 90 Ma, after which it has cooled enough to reach [[thermal equilibrium]] with older material and the slope of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary becomes effectively zero.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== History ==
===Early Ideas (1912-1962)===
Despite its current status as one of the driving forces of [[plate tectonics]], ridge push was not included in any of [[Alfred Wegener|Alfred Wegener's]] 1912-1930 proposals of [[continental drift]], which were produced before the discovery of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and lacked any concrete mechanisms by which the process might have occurred.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyjosie/chapter/chapter-10-plate-tectonics/#section10.3|title=Physical Geology|last=Earle|first=Steven|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=1916|isbn=978-1537068824|location=|pages=|chapter=Plate Tectonics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Patrick|date=2007-08-15|title=Wegener, Alfred Lothar (1880-1930)|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/0471743984.vse9783|journal=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia|language=en|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|doi=10.1002/0471743984.vse9783|isbn=0471743984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/dynamic.html|title=This Dynamic Earth: The Story of Plate Tectonics|last=Kious|first=W.

===Gravitational Models (1964-Current)===
In 1964 and 1965, [[Egon Orowan]] proposed the first [[Gravity|gravitational]] mechanism for spreading at mid-ocean ridges, postulating that spreading can be derived from the principles of [[isostasy]]. In Orowan's proposal, pressure within and immediately under the elevated ridge is greater than the pressure in the oceanic crust to either side due to the greater weight of overlying rock, forcing material away from the ridge, while the lower density of the ridge material relative to the surrounding crust would gradually compensate for the greater volume of rock down to the [[Erosion and tectonics|depth of isostatic compensation]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orowan|first=E.|date=1964-11-20|title=Continental Drift and the Origin of Mountains: Hot creep and creep fracture are crucial factors in the formation of continents and mountains|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3647|pages=1003–1010|doi=10.1126/science.146.3647.1003|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17832393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bott|first=M.H.P.|title=Ridge push and associated plate interior stress in normal and hot spot regions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/004019519190003B|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=200|issue=1-3|pages=17–32|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(91)90003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar models were proposed by Lliboutry in 1969, Parsons and Richer in 1980, and others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1969, Hales proposed a model in which the raised lithosphere of the mid-ocean ridges slid down the elevated ridge, and in 1970 Jacoby proposed that the less dense material and isostasy of Orowan and others' proposals produced uplift which resulted in sliding similar to Hales' proposal.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The term "ridge push force" was coined by Forsyth and Uyeda in 1975.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forsyth|first=Donald|last2=Uyeda|first2=Seiya|date=1975-10-01|title=On the Relative Importance of the Driving Forces of Plate Motion|url=https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/43/1/163/586101|journal=Geophysical Journal International|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=163–200|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246x.1975.tb00631.x|issn=0956-540X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Early models of [[plate tectonics]], such as [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess's]] [[seafloor spreading]] model, assumed that the motions of plates and the activity of mid-ocean ridges and [[Subduction|subduction zones]] were primarily the result of [[convection|convection currents]] in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] dragging on the crust and supplying fresh, hot [[magma]] at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further developments of the theory suggested that some form of ridge push helped supplement convection in order to keep the plates moving, but in the 1990s, calculations indicated that [[slab pull]], the force that a [[Subduction|subducted]] section of plate exerts on the attached crust on the surface, was an order of magnitude stronger than ridge push.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 1996, slab pull was generally considered the dominant mechanism driving plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Modern research, however, indicates that the effects of slab pull are mostly negated by resisting forces in the mantle, limiting it to only 2-3 times the effective strength of ridge push forces in most plates, and that mantle convection is probably much too slow for drag between the [[lithosphere]] and the [[asthenosphere]] to account for the observed motion of the plates.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=R.M.|last2=Cox|first2=B.L.|title=Evolution of oceanic lithosphere: A driving force study of the Nazca Plate|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=89|issue=B12|pages=10043–10052}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restores ridge push as one of the dominant factors in plate motion.

=== Opposing Forces ===
Ridge push is primarily opposed by plate drag, which is the drag force of the [[Stiffness|rigid]] lithosphere moving over the weaker, [[Ductility|ductile]] asthenosphere.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefanick|first=M|last2=Jurdy|first2=D.M.|title=Stress observations and driving force models for the South American Plate|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=97|issue=B8|pages=11905–11913|doi=10.1029/91JB01798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models estimate that ridge push is probably just sufficient to overcome plate drag and maintain the motion of the plate in most areas.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahatsente|first=R|title=Global Models of Ridge-Push Force, Geoid, and Lithospheric Strength of Oceanic plates|journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics|volume=174|issue=12|pages=4395–4406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slab pull is similarly opposed by resistance to the subduction of the lithosphere into the mantle at [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Notable Qualifications ===
Research by Rezene Mahatsente indicates that the driving stresses caused by ridge push would be dissipated by [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[earthquake]]s in plate material containing large quantities of unbound water, but they conclude that ridge push is still a significant driving force in existing plates because of the rarity of [[intraplate earthquake]]s in the ocean.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In plates with particularly small or young subducting slabs, ridge push may be the predominant driving force in the plate's motion.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to Stefanick and Jurdy, the ridge push force acting on the South American plate is approximately 5 times the slab pull forces acting at its subducting margins because of the small size of the subducting slabs at the [[Scotia Plate|Scotia]] and [[Caribbean Plate|Caribean]] margins.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Nazca plate also experiences relatively small slab pull, approximately equal to its ridge push, because the plate material is young (no more than 50 million years old) and therefore less dense, with less tendency to sink into the mantle.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This also causes the subducting Nazca slab to experience [[flat slab subduction]], one of the few places in the world where this currently occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutscher|first=M.A.|last2=Spakman|first2=W.|last3=Bijwaard|first3=H.|last4=Engdalh|first4=E.R.|date=2000|title=Geodynamics of flat subduction: Seismicity and tomographic constraints from the Andean margin|url=|journal=Tectonics|volume=19|pages=814–833|doi=10.1029/1999TC001152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sage Bionetworks was founded in 2009 as a spinout of [[Merck &amp; Co.]], who released software, hardware, intellectual property, and staff connected to its Rosetta Inpharmatics unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/08/06/stephen-friend-leaving-high-powered-merck-gig-lights-the-fire-for-open-source-biology-movement/ |title=Stephen Friend, Leaving High-Powered Merck Gig, Lights Fire for Open Source Biology Movement |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A donation from [[Quintiles]] provided early funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/10/06/sage-bionetworks-biologys-open-source-spark-snags-major-donation-from-quintiles/ |title=Sage Bionetworks, Biology’s Open Source Spark, Snags "Major" Donation from Quintiles &amp;#124; Xconomy |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Sage partnered with [[CHDI Foundation]] to develop [[computer simulations]] for studying [[Huntington's disease]].  At the same time Sage also announced a partnership with [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]] wherein Sage would do research to identify [[biological target]]s for [[central nervous system]] diseases.&lt;ref name="march2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sage Bionetworks Launches International Neurobiology Partnerships |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sage+Bionetworks+Launches+International+Neurobiology+Partnerships.-a0252728592 |work=Business Wire |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Sage Bionetworks partnered with the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project to provide expertise and infrastructure for DREAM Challenges on the [[Synapse.org]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2013/02/19/sage-bionetworks-absorbs-dream-plans-open-science-challenges/ |title=Sage Bionetworks Absorbs Dream, Plans Open Science ‘Challenges’ |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shaftpasser2.jpg|thumb|Detail of a shaft passer]]
A '''shaft passer''' is a hypothetical device that allows a spoked wheel to rotate despite having a shaft (such as the axle of another wheel) passing between its spokes. The device is usually mentioned as a joke between [[nerd]]s, in the manner of a [[Snipe hunt|fool's errand]], since there is no evidence of one ever having been constructed until very recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193022 |title = Printable Cable Passer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest printed references to these devices was made by [[Richard Feynman]], who was told by a colleague at [[Frankford Arsenal]] in [[Philadelphia]] that the cable-passing version of the device had been used during both world wars on German [[naval mine]] mooring cables, to prevent the mines from being caught by British cables swept along the sea bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Feynman | first = Richard | title = [[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]] | publisher = Vintage Books | isbn = 978-0-099-17331-1 | page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was supposed to work using a spoked, rimless wheel that allows cables to pass through as it rotates. The ends of the spokes are widened, and the cable is held together by a short curved sleeve through which these spoke ends slide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Francis| first = Devon| title = Their war is not over | journal= Popular Science | year=1946 |issue=January | page = 74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''specification language''' is a [[formal language]] in [[computer science]] used during [[systems analysis]], [[requirements analysis]] and [[systems design]] to describe a system at a much higher level than a [[programming language]], which is used to produce the executable code for a system.

Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the ''what'', not the ''how''. Indeed, it is considered as an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail.

A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as [[algebra]]ic or [[model theory|model-theoretic]] structures that include a collection of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of data values together with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] over those sets.  This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties.

In the ''property-oriented'' approach to specification (taken e.g. by [[Common Algebraic Specification Language|CASL]]), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical [[axiom]]s, usually in a [[logical system]] in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy - often just by their interrelationship.
This is in contrast to so-called [[model-based specification|model-oriented specification]] in frameworks like [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] and [[Z notation|Z]], which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour.

Specifications must be subject to a process of ''refinement'' (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, [[Hartmann pipeline]]s, when
properly applied, may be considered a [[dataflow]] specification which ''is'' directly executable.  Another example is the [[Actor model]] which has no specific application content and must be ''specialized'' to be executable.

An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s of [[program correctness]] (''see [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]'').

A '''sports rating system''' is a system that analyzes the results of sports competitions to provide [[Evaluation|rating]]s for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, [[crowdsourcing]] non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems. Ratings, or '''power ratings''', are numerical representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable so that the game outcome between any two teams can be predicted. [[Ranking]]s, or '''power rankings''', can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports [[standings]] which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.

[[File:UCF at the Texas goal line.jpg|thumb|right|College football players in the United States]]
In the United States, the biggest use of sports ratings systems is to rate [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] college football teams in [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]], choosing teams to play in the [[College Football Playoff]]. Sports ratings systems are also used to help determine the field for the NCAA [[College basketball|men's and women's basketball]] tournaments, men's professional [[golf]] tournaments, professional [[tennis]] tournaments, and [[NASCAR]]. They are often mentioned in discussions about the teams that could or should receive invitations to participate in certain contests, despite not earning the most direct entrance path (such as a league championship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-03-09/sorting-through-teams-on-one-big-bubble |website=[[Sporting News]] |accessdate=2011-03-24 |date=2011-03-09 |last=Fagan |first=Ryan |title=Sorting through teams on one big bubble |quote=This is a look at 20 of the teams (in alphabetical order) residing on this year’s big ol’ bubble.

The two other ranking indexes include margin of victory in their formulas—the Pomeroy ratings (at kenpom.com) and Sagarin ratings (via USA Today)—aren’t new but have played an increased role in discussions about potential seeds during this college basketball season.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer rating systems can tend toward [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], without specific player, team, regional, or style bias. [[Ken Massey]] writes that an advantage of computer rating systems is that they can "objectively track all" 351 college basketball teams, while human polls "have limited value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Ken Massey]] |user= masseyratings|number= 529238966965661696 |date= 3 Nov 2014 |title= @kenpomeroy human polls have limited value.  Computer systems can objectively track all the teams.  http://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm #all351 |access-date= 9 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer ratings are verifiable and repeatable, and are comprehensive, requiring assessment of all selected criteria. By comparison, rating systems relying on human polls include inherent human subjectivity; this may or may not be an attractive property depending on system needs.

== History ==

Sports ratings systems have been around for almost 80 years, when ratings were calculated on paper rather than by computer, as most are today.  Some older computer systems still in use today include: [[Jeff Sagarin|Jeff Sagarin's]] systems, the ''[[New York Times]]'' system, and the [[Dunkel Index]], which dates back to 1929. Before the advent of the college football playoff, the [[Bowl Championship Series]] championship game participants were determined by a combination of expert polls and computer systems.

== Theory ==

Sports ratings systems use a variety of methods for rating teams, but the most prevalent method is called a power rating.  The power rating of a team is a calculation of the team's strength relative to other teams in the same league or division.  The basic idea is to maximize the amount of [[transitive relation]]s in a given data set due to game outcomes.  For example, if A defeats B and B defeats C, then one can safely say that A&gt;B&gt;C.

There are obvious problems with basing a system solely on wins and losses.  For example, if C defeats A, then an [[Intransitivity|intransitive]] relation is established (A&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;A) and a ranking violation will occur if this is the only data available.  Scenarios such as this happen fairly regularly in sports—for example, in the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] beat [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Ohio State beat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], and Michigan beat Penn State.  To address these logical breakdowns, rating systems usually consider other criteria such as the game's score and where the match was held (for example, to assess a [[home field advantage]]).  In most cases though, each team plays a sufficient amount of other games during a given season, which lessens the overall effect of such violations.

From an [[academic]] perspective, the use of [[linear algebra]] and [[statistics]] are popular among many of the systems' authors to determine their ratings. Some academic work is published in forums like the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]], others in traditional statistics, mathematics, psychology, and computer science journals.

If sufficient "inter-divisional" league play is not accomplished, teams in an isolated division may be artificially propped up or down in the overall ratings due to a lack of correlation to other teams in the overall league.  This phenomenon is evident in systems that analyze historical college football seasons, such as when the top [[Ivy League]] teams of the 1970s, like [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], were calculated by some rating systems to be comparable with accomplished powerhouse teams of that era such as [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  This conflicts with the subjective opinion that claims that while good in their own right, they were not nearly as good as those top programs.  However, this may be considered a "pro" by non-[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] teams in Division I-A college football who point out that ratings systems have proven that their top teams belong in the same strata as the BCS teams.  This is evidenced by the 2004 [[University of Utah|Utah]] team that went undefeated in the regular season and earned a BCS bowl bid due to the bump in their overall BCS ratings via the computer ratings component.  They went on to play and defeat the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] champion [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] in the 2005 [[Fiesta Bowl]] by a score of 35-7.  A related example occurred during the 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] where [[George Mason University|George Mason]] were awarded an at-large tournament bid due to their regular season record and their [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI rating]] and rode that opportunity all the way to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]].

Goals of some rating systems differ from one another. For example, systems may be crafted to provide a perfect retrodictive analysis of the games played to-date, while others are predictive and give more weight to future trends rather than past results.  This results in the potential for misinterpretation of rating system results by people unfamiliar with these goals; for example, a rating system designed to give accurate [[point spread]] predictions for gamblers might be ill-suited for use in selecting teams most deserving to play in a championship game or tournament.

==Rating considerations==

===Home advantage===
[[File:France national team fans.jpg|thumb|right|France national basketball team fans]]
{{main article|Home advantage}}
When two teams of equal quality play, the team at home tends to win more often. The size of the effect changes based on the era of play, game type, season length, sport, even [[Circadian advantage|number of time zones crossed]]. But across all conditions, "simply playing at home increases the chances of winning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jamieson/JJ_JASP.pdf|title=The Home Field Advantage in Athletics: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|last=Jamieson|first=Jeremy P.|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1819–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A win away from home is therefore seen more favorably than a win at home, because it was more challenging. Home advantage (which, for sports played on a pitch, is almost always called "home field advantage") is also based on the qualities of the individual stadium and crowd; the advantage in the NFL can be more than a 4-point difference from the stadium with the least advantage to the stadium with the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/bill-barnwell-best-home-field-advantages/|website=[[Grantland]]|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2014|title=Safe at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strength of schedule===
{{main article|Strength of schedule}}
Strength of schedule refers to the quality of a team's opponents. A win against an inferior opponent is usually seen less favorably than a win against a superior opponent. Often teams in the same league, who are compared against each other for championship or playoff consideration, have not played the same opponents. Therefore, judging their relative win-loss records is complicated.
{{quote|text=We looked beyond the record. The committee placed significant value on Oregon's quality of wins.|sign=[[College football playoff]] committee chairman [[Jeff Long (athletic director)|Jeff Long]]|source=press conference, week 12 of the 2014 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russo |first=Ralph D. |title=Oregon up to 2 in playoff rankings; TCU to 4th |url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2014-11-11-FBC-Playoff-Rankings/id-c0570dfb5a0044a798224fbef5da73b8 |agency=Associated Press |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after ranking 9–1 Oregon above 9–0 Florida State}}
The college football playoff committee uses a limited strength-of-schedule algorithm that only considers opponents' records and opponents' opponents' records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Stewart Mandel]] |user= slmandel|number= 532624545300369408 |date= 12 Nov 2014 |title= Committee doesn't use an SOS ranking. It looks at opponents' record and opponents' opponents record. |access-date= 12 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (much like [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]]).

===Points versus wins===
A key dichotomy among sports rating systems lies in the representation of game outcomes. Some systems store final scores as [[Three-valued logic|ternary]] discrete events: wins, draws, and losses. Other systems record the exact final game score, then judge teams based on [[margin of victory]]. Rating teams based on margin of victory is often criticized as creating an incentive for coaches to run up the score, an "unsportsmanlike" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/RICHARDS%253A-BCS-removes-margin-of-victory-element |newspaper=[[Fox Sports]] |date=2001 |accessdate=12 November 2014|last=Richards|first=Darryl|title=BCS removes margin-of-victory element}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other systems choose a middle ground, reducing the [[marginal value]] of additional points as the margin of victory increases. Sagarin chose to clamp the margin of victory to a predetermined amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ncaaf/sagarin/|title=NCAAF Jeff Sagarin Ratings|last=Sagarin|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sagarin|date=Fall 2014|accessdate=12 November 2014|website=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches include the use of a decay function, such as a [[logarithm]] or placement on a [[cumulative distribution function]].

===In-game information===
Beyond points or wins, some system designers choose to include more granular information about the game. Examples include time of possession of the ball, individual statistics, and lead changes. Data about weather, injuries, or "throw-away" games near season's end may affect game outcomes but are difficult to model. "Throw-away games" are games where teams have already earned playoff slots and have secured their playoff seeding before the end of the regular season, and want to rest/protect their starting players by benching them for remaining regular season games. This usually results in unpredictable outcomes and may skew the outcome of rating systems.

===Team composition===
Teams often shift their composition between and within games, and players routinely get injured. Rating a team is often about rating a specific collection of players. Some systems assume [[parity (sports)|parity]] among all members of the league, such as each team being built from an equitable pool of players via a [[Draft (sports)|draft]] or [[free agent|free agency]] system as is done in many major league sports such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. This is certainly not the case in collegiate leagues such as Division I-A football or men's and women's basketball.

===Cold start===
At the beginning of a season, there have been no games from which to judge teams' relative quality. Solutions to the cold start problem often include some measure of the previous season, perhaps weighted by what percent of the team is returning for the new season. [[ARGH Power Ratings]] is an example of a system that uses multiple previous years plus a percentage weight of returning players.

==Rating methods==
{{inc-sport}}

===Permutation of standings===
Several methods offer some permutation of traditional standings. This search for the "real" win-loss record often involves using other data, such as point differential or identity of opponents, to alter a team's record in a way that is easily understandable. Sportswriter [[Gregg Easterbrook]] created a measure of Authentic Games, which only considers games played against opponents deemed to be of sufficiently high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/TMQWeekEleven141118/more-defensive-penalties-causes-change-nfl-tuesday-morning-quarterback|title=More flags on D spins scoreboards|last=Easterbrook|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Easterbrook|date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that all wins are not created equal.
{{quote|text=I went through the first few weeks of games and redid everyone’s records, tagging each game as either a legitimate win or loss, an ass-kicking win or loss, or an either/or game. And if anything else happened in that game with gambling repercussions – a comeback win, a blown lead, major dysfunction, whatever — I tagged that, too.|sign=[[Bill Simmons]], sportswriter|source=[[Grantland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-8-picks-a-gambling-epiphany/|title=Week 8 Picks: A Gambling Epiphany|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Pythagorean====
{{main article|Pythagorean expectation}}
Pythagorean expectation, or Pythagorean projection, calculates a percentage based on the number of points a team has scored and allowed. Typically the formula involves the number of points scored, raised to some exponent, placed in the numerator. Then the number of points the team allowed, raised to the same exponent, is placed in the denominator and added to the value in the numerator. [[Football Outsiders]] has used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schatz|first1=Aaron|last2=Alamar|first2=Ben|last3=Barnwell|first3=Bill |author4=Bill Connelly |author5=Doug Farrar|title=Football Outsiders Almanac 2011: The Essential Guide to the 2011 NFL and College Football Seasons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E84YYAAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1-4662-4613-3|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Pythagorean wins} = \frac{\text{Points For}^{2.37}}{\text{Points For}^{2.37} + \text{Points Against}^{2.37}}\times \text{Games Played}.&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting percentage is often compared to a team's true winning percentage, and a team is said to have "overachieved" or "underachieved" compared to the Pythagorean expectation. For example, [[Bill Barnwell]] calculated that before week 9 of the 2014 NFL season, the [[Arizona Cardinals]] had a Pythagorean record two wins lower than their real record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-at-the-half-breaking-down-the-numbers/|title=NFL at the Half: Breaking Down the Numbers|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Barnwell|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2015|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Simmons]] cites Barnwell's work before week 10 of that season and adds that "any numbers nerd is waving a “REGRESSION!!!!!” flag right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/revisiting-the-y2k-compliant-quarterbacks/|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|title=Revisiting the Y2K-Compliant Quarterbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the Arizona Cardinals' regular season record was 8-1 going into the 10th week of the 2014 season. The Pythagorean win formula implied a winning percentage of 57.5%, based on 208 points scored and 183 points allowed. Multiplied by 9 games played, the Cardinals' Pythagorean expectation was 5.2 wins and 3.8 losses. The team had "overachieved" at that time by 2.8 wins, derived from their actual 8 wins less the expected 5.2 wins, an increase of 0.8 overachieved wins from just a week prior.

===Trading "skill points"===
{{main article|Elo rating system}}
Originally designed by [[Arpad Elo]] as a method for ranking chess players, several people have adapted the Elo rating system for team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football. For instance, [[Jeff Sagarin]] and [[FiveThirtyEight]] publish NFL football rankings using Elo methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/|title=Introducing NFL Elo Ratings|last=Silver|first=Nate|authorlink=Nate Silver|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elo ratings initially assign strength values to each team, and teams trade points based on the outcome of each game.

===Solving equations===

Researchers like Matt Mills use [[Markov chains]] to model college football games, with team strength scores as outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thespread.us/continuous-markov-ratings.html|last=Mills|first=Matt|website=The Spread|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014|title=Using Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Rank College Football Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms like Google's [[PageRank]] have also been adapted to rank football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ranking-nfl-teams-using-network-science-konstantinos-pelechrinis?trk=prof-post/|website=[[LinkedIN]]|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016|title=Ranking NFL teams using Network Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBAnalysis/comments/2ppfg3/modifying_googles_page_ranking_algorithm_to_rank/|website=[[Reddit]]|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|title=Modifying Google's Page Ranking Algorithm to rank teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">'''Starch production''' is an isolation of [[starch]] from plant sources. It takes place in starch plants. Starch industry is a part of [[food processing]] which is using starch as a starting material for production of [[modified starch|starch derivatives]], hydrolysates, [[dextrin]]s.

At first, the raw material for the preparation of the starch was wheat. Currently main starch sources are: 
*[[maize]] (in America) – 70%,
*[[potato]]es (in Europe) – 12%,
*[[wheat]] - 8%,
*[[tapioca]] - 9%,
*[[rice]], [[sorghum]] and other - 1%. (Reference needed)

==Potato starch production==
The production of [[potato starch]] comprises the steps such as delivery and unloading potatoes, cleaning, rasping of [[tubers]], potato juice separation, starch [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]], starch milk rafination, dewatering of refined starch milk and starch [[drying]].

The potato starch production supply chain varies significantly by region.  For example, potato starch in Europe is produced from potatoes grown specifically for this purpose.  However, in the US, potatoes are not grown for starch production and manufacturers must source raw material from food processor waste streams.  The characteristics of these waste streams can vary significantly and require further processing by the US potato starch manufacturer to ensure the end-product functionality and specifications are acceptable.

===Delivery and unloading potatoes===
Potatoes are delivered to the starch plants via [[road transport|road]] or [[rail transport]]. Unloading of potatoes could be done in two ways: 
# dry - using elevators and [[Dump truck|tippers]],
# wet - using strong jet of water.

===Cleaning===
Coarsely cleaning of potatoes takes place during the transport of potatoes to the scrubber by channel. In addition, before the scrubber, [[straw]] and [[stone]]s separators are installed. The main cleaning is conducted in scrubber (different kinds of high specialized machines are used). The remaining stones, [[sludge]] and light [[waste]]s are removed at this step. [[Water]] used for washing is then purified and recycled back into the process.

===Rasping of tubers===
Most often the rasping of potato tubers is carried out with a rotary grater. The purpose of this stage is disruption of [[cell wall]]s, which therefore release the starch. In practice, potato cells are not entirely destroyed and part of the starch remains in the mash.
Potato pulp rapidly turns dark, because [[tyrosine]] presented in the potato is [[oxidation|oxidised]] by [[polyphenol oxidase]], which is located in the cellular juice. Therefore, cellular juice must be separated as soon as possible.

===Potato juice separation===
This allows the recovery full-value [[protein]] from juice and reduces the onerousness of water juice as a sludge.

===Starch extraction===
After separation of potato juice the pulp is directed to the washing starch station, to isolate the starch. Most used are stream-oriented washers. In these machines pulp diluted with water is washed with a strong stream of water to flush out the milk starch. The mash smuggling with water is a waste product – dewatered potato pulp. Starch milk is contaminated by small fiber particles (potato tissue fragments) and the remaining components of the potato juice – that’s why it is called raw starch milk.

===Starch milk raffination===
Raw starch milk is purified in the refining process. This involves the removal of small fibers from the starch milk and then the removal of juice water and starch milk condensation. For this purpose, the screens and [[hydrocyclone]]s are commonly used. Hydrocyclones due to the low output (approximately 0.3 cubic meter per hour) are connected in parallel and works as multihydrocyclones. For the starch milk desanding bihydrocyclones are used. In order to prevent enzymatic darkening of potato juice the chemical refining of starch is carried out using [[sulfurous acid]]. Refined starch milk has a [[density]] of about 22° [[Brix|Be]], which is about 38% of  starch.

===Dewatering of refined starch milk and starch drying===
It is a suspension of starch in water, which needs dewatering up to 20% of [[moisture]].
This is equivalent to the moisture content of commercial starch when stored. High temperatures cannot be used in this process because of the danger of [[starch gelatinization]] which destroys granular structure. It may result in significant changes of the functional starch properties. Therefore, removal of excess water from milk shall be done only under conditions that prevent the gelatinization of starch.

Dewatering of refined starch milk is carried out in two stages. In the first stage the excess water is removed by means of a rotary vacuum filter. Secondly moist starch is dried, without starch pasting. For this purpose a pneumatic dryier is used. In this device moist starch (with water content 36 – 40%) is floating in strong and hot (160&amp;nbsp;°C) air flow and then dried during 2 – 3 seconds. Then, the starch is separated from hot air in [[cyclonic separation|cyclones]]. Due to short time of high temperature drying and intensive water [[evaporation]] from the starch granules, its surface is heated only to 40&amp;nbsp;°C.

Dried starch contains about 21% of water. During the pneumatic transport starch loses additional 1% of water.
 
Received starch is storing separately in [[silo]]s, in [[jute]] bags (100&amp;nbsp;kg) or [[paper]] bags (50&amp;nbsp;kg). There are three kinds of starch: superior extra, superior and prima. Different sorts of starch depend on degree of purity and whiteness. The differences between them are in an acidity and content of mineral substances.

The water which is used in starch production (dirty water) for transportation and cleaning doesn’t have to be totally clean. That’s why clarifier usage enables application of closed cycle which noticeably reduces amount of cleaning water that is needed.
On the other hand, requirements for quality of technological water are the same as for drinking water (microbiological and chemical [[contamination]]).  In addition, this type of water should contain low amounts of metals such as:  [[calcium|Ca]], [[magnesium|Mg]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[manganese|Mn]]; which has bad influence on starch properties.

===Waste products===
- Potato juice is a liquid waste product separated from the potatoes pulp after the rasping, using [[centrifuge]]s or decanters. It contains about 5% of dry substance, including about 2% valuable protein of the potato of high nutritional value, [[mineral]]s, [[vitamin]]s and other. Modern starch plants separate the juice from the mash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfalaval.com/globalassets/documents/industries/food-dairy-and-beverage/starch-and-sweetener/solutions-for-processing-starch.pdf] Alfa Laval Starch production brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

- Potato protein can be extrated from the juice by [[coagulation]] with heat at low pH. About 600&amp;nbsp;kg of coagulated protein from each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg of potato protein can be recovered this way.
The coagulated protein product contains about 80% protein (with the digestibility of about 90%), 2.5% minerals, 1.5% fat, 6% [[nitrogen]]-free substances and 10% water. Because of the full range of the [[exogenous| exogenic]] [[amino acid]]s the formulation is a valuable protein [[Animal feed|feed]]. The remaining potota Juice is used as [[fertilizer]].

- Potato pulp is a side product of washing the starch from the mash. It contains all non-starchy substances insoluble in water (fragments of wall of cells) [[fibre]]s and bounded starch which cannot be mechanically separated from the blended parties of potato. The dry substance of the pulp contains 30% of starch, which makes it a good source for animal feed.
The pulp contains a lot of water, dry solids about 16%, which is inconvenient in [[transportation]] and storage. That’s why it is really often dried and dehydrated.

- Juicy water is a liquid side product obtained after refining of starch milk. It is ten times diluted potato juice. As it is a [[sludge]] and it cannot be discharged to open water. It must be treated as waste water or is used as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starch.dk/isi/energy/effluent.htm] International Starch Institute Aarhus Denmark Pototo starch effluents&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application of potato starch===
{{Main|Potato starch}}
The usage of raw starch is relatively small. Starch is mainly used as material both in the manufacture of food and non-food products. In food processing a lot of starch is converted to starch hydrolysates. Also it is used to receive [[pudding]]s, jellies, desserts, caramel and other food products. In addition, starch is processed to modified starch in order to change material properties. The modified starches have a wide range of applications in many industries. Applications of starch in non-food sectors include: production of [[dextrin]] and adhesives, drilling fluids, biodegradable plastics, gypsum binders and many other. In addition [[modified starch]]es are used as fillers, emulsion stabilizers, consistency modifiers etc. Other important fields of starch application are textiles, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and paints.

[[File:India's Human Spaceflight Program - TMRO.webm|thumb|Michael Clark talks about India's human spaceflight program and the rockets that will enable them in a Space Pod.]]
'''''TMRO''''' (pronounced ''tomorrow'', formerly known as '''''Spacevidcast'''''), is a network of live and on-demand [[High-definition video|HD]] [[webcast]]s about technology, science, space, and human society. TMRO was established as Spacevidcast in 2008 by husband and wife team Benjamin and Cariann Higginbotham.

''TMRO''{{'s}} stated goal is {{cquote|''...to get the planet excited about living among the stars.''}}

In contrast to most space-related podcasts, ''TMRO'' is produced independently and is not associated with any governmental or private organization, which sets it apart from other shows like ''[[NASA Edge]]'' or ''Hubblecast''.&lt;ref name="strib20080630"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/22735284.html |title=Technobabble: Local webcast embarks on space odyssey |work=[[Star Tribune]] |first=Randy A. |last=Salas |date=June 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRTUgbL?url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/22735284.html |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twincitieslive.com/article/day/S20080714.shtml?cat=181275&amp;articleID=181275 |title=Space Vidcast |work=Twin Cities Live |date=July 14, 2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the show hosts were hired by [[SpaceX]], however there is no tie between SpaceX and ''TMRO''.

In addition to traditional episodes, ''TMRO'' also offers some audio and text content as well as content provided through the crowdfunding platform [[Patreon]], including [[Google Hangouts]] and early access to ''TMRO After Dark''. There is also a ''TMRO'' [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] for viewers to discuss space and show topics. The program was awarded the Best Presentation of Space award during NewSpace 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Vision of the Future" and "Best Presentation of Space" Winners Announced |date=July 15, 2010 |url=http://spacefrontier.org/2010/07/15/visionfuture-presentation2010/ |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRI7P5e?url=http://spacefrontier.org/2010/07/visionfuture-presentation2010/ |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show format==
The show is divided into an opener and three main segments. The first segment is Space News, discussing launches, technology, and spaceflight events that have occurred since the previous episode. Podcaster Michael Clark often talks about SpaceX news and provides input on other space topics. The second segment includes that episode's featured topic, which may be an interview or a discussion on a particular topic. During the third segment, viewer comments relating to the previous episode are read and discussed.

==TMRO Space==
TMRO Space was the original TMRO (and Spacevidcast) show before new shows were added.

==Live events and daily-casts==
''Spacevidcast'' has covered a number of live events such as [[Space shuttle program|Shuttle]] and [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] launches, the [[Mars Phoenix|Phoenix Mars]] landing, the launch of [[Jules Verne ATV]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|GLAST Space Telescope]], [[Chandrayaan-2|Chandrayaan-1]], [[Shenzhou 7]], the [[Kepler Mission]] as well as [[List of private spaceflight companies#Satellite launchers|commercial satellite]] launches. The website was one of many outlets to broadcast a live feed of the lunar impact by NASA's [[LCROSS]] spacecraft and participated in [[Guy Laliberté]]'s ''Poetic Social Mission Event: Moving Stars and Earth for Water''. These events are usually summed up in short daily clips dedicated to one or two events.

Additionally, ''Spacevidcast'' streamed [[NASA TV]] with an accompanying chat room through [[UStream]] live 24/7 with an [[HD video]] feed during launches and other significant events.

===2008 Lunar Lander Challenge===
The ''Spacevidcast'' team was the official event webcaster for the X Prize Foundation's [[Lunar Lander Challenge#2008|2008 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge]]. ''Spacevidcast'' streamed continuously from Las Cruces, New Mexico on October 24 and 25. The hosts were on site to interview team leaders and VIP guests. The podcast was also the only media outlet to cover the "Rocket Racing League at [[Spaceport America]]" announcement by the governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]].

===ISDC 2009===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2009 [[International Space Development Conference]], an annual event hosted and organized by the [[National Space Society]]. As part of its coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of the main presentations as well as an option for viewers to send questions via the chat room. The videos were also made available on demand. In addition to direct coverage of the conference, ''Spacevidcast'' also broadcast a regular weekly show from the ISDC 2009 setting and the hosts participated in a panel discussion on May 29 entitled "Space Media 2.0".

===SpaceUp San Diego (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[SpaceUp]] San Diego unconference, the first major space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the San Diego Space Society. As part of their coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of many of the presentations as well as much of the [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks. The videos are now available on demand. The quality of these videos is low only because of a lack of internet connections at the conference and spotty cell phone coverage.

===NewSpace 2010 (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[Space Frontier Foundation]] NewSpace Conference, a yearly conference for NewSpace leaders to meet and organize the future of the [[NewSpace]] movement. Benjamin and Cariann provided live coverage of each of the talks during the weekend. The videos are now available on demand (some are Epic subscriber-only).

===SpaceUp D.C. (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[SpaceUp]] Washington D.C. unconference, the second space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by Evadot founder Michael Doornbos. As part of their coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of many of the presentations and [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks. The videos are now all available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel.

===SpaceUp San Diego (2011)===
''Spacevidcast'' is the exclusive webcaster of the 2011 [[SpaceUp]] San Diego unconference, the third space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the [[San Diego Space Society]] and the first repeat SpaceUp, held on February 12–13, 2011. Cariann Higginbotham, co-host of ''Spacevidcast'', is attending the event and, assisted by corporate and private sponsors, will be providing live video [[webcast]]s of many of the presentations and T-5 talks (similar to [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks). The videos will be available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel and will be viewable live on their website.

===SpaceUp Houston (2011)===
''Spacevidcast'' is the exclusive webcaster of the 2011 [[SpaceUp]] Houston unconference, the fourth space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the Clear Lake NSS/Moon Society and the [[Lunar and Planetary Institute]] on February 12–13, 2011. Benjamin Higginbotham, co-host of ''Spacevidcast'', is attending the event and will be providing live video [[webcast]]s of many of the presentations and demonstrations. The videos will be available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel and will be viewable live on their website.

===Space Shuttle launches===
''Spacevidcast'' was one of the first sources to get High Definition Space Shuttle launches online. These shows progressed until ''Spacevidcast'' was granted media access to the Kennedy Space Center Press site for STS-132 through the end of the program. The ''Spacevidcast'' shuttle coverage was marked as Wired Magazine's three best ways to watch a shuttle launch online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/space-shuttle-streams/ |title=3 Great Ways to Watch the Last Space Shuttle Missions |work=Wired |date=February 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRd5zwC?url=http://www.wired.com/2011/02/space-shuttle-streams/ |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''TMRO'' on Livestream===
During season 7, ''TMRO'' left YouTube streaming and moved to [[Livestream]] for more stable live streaming.

===''TMRO'' on Patreon===
During season 7, ''TMRO'' transitioned from its previous donor on-demand service, called Epic, to the crowdfunding website [[Patreon]].&lt;ref name="Patreon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patreon.com/spacevidcast?ty=a |title=Spacevidcast is creating live webcasts about the cosmos |accessdate=March 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140540/http://www.patreon.com/spacevidcast?ty=a |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valence shell electron pair repulsion''' ('''VSEPR''') '''theory''' is a [[chemical bonding model|model]] used in [[chemistry]] to predict the geometry of individual [[molecule]]s from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms.&lt;ref name="Jolly"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jolly |first=W. L.|title=Modern Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1984 |pages=77–90 |ISBN= 0-07-032760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also named the Gillespie-Nyholm theory after its two main developers, [[Ronald Gillespie]] and [[Ronald Sydney Nyholm|Ronald Nyholm]]. The acronym "VSEPR" is pronounced either "''ves''-pur"&lt;ref name="Petrucci" /&gt;{{rp|410}} or "vuh-''seh''-per".&lt;ref name="H2009"&gt;{{cite book|first= H. Stephen |last=Stoker|title = General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-547-15281-3|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of VSEPR is that the [[valence electron]] pairs surrounding an atom tend to repel each other and will, therefore, adopt an arrangement that minimizes this repulsion, thus determining the molecule's [[molecular geometry|geometry]].  Gillespie has emphasized that the electron-electron repulsion due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is more important in determining molecular geometry than the electrostatic repulsion.&lt;ref name="Fiftyyears"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillespie | first1 = R. J. | year = 2008 | title = Fifty years of the VSEPR model | url = | journal = Coord. Chem. Rev. | volume = 252 | issue = | pages = 1315–1327 | doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2007.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VSEPR theory is based on observable electron density rather than mathematical [[wave function]]s and hence unrelated to [[orbital hybridisation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Gillespie | first=R. J. | year=2004 | title=Teaching molecular geometry with the VSEPR model | journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Educ.]] | volume=81 | issue=3 | pages=298–304 | doi=10.1021/ed081p298 |bibcode = 2004JChEd..81..298G }}&lt;/ref&gt; although both address molecular shape. While it is mainly qualitative, VSEPR has a quantitative basis in quantum chemical topology (QCT) methods such as the [[electron localization function]] (ELF) and the [[atoms in molecules|quantum theory of atoms in molecules]] (QTAIM).&lt;ref name="Fiftyyears"/&gt;

==History==
The idea of a correlation between molecular geometry and number of valence electron pairs (both shared and unshared pairs) was originally proposed in 1939 by Ryutaro Tsuchida in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Chemical Society of Japan|J. Chem. Soc. Jpn.]]|volume=60 |year=1939|issue=3|pages= 245–256|doi=10.1246/nikkashi1921.60.245|script-title=ja:新簡易原子價論 |trans-title=New simple valency theory|first=Ryutarō |last=Tsuchida|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was independently presented in a [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1940 by [[Nevil Sidgwick]] and Herbert Powell of the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sidgwick | first1 = N. V. | last2 = Powell | first2 = H. M. | year = 1940 | title = Bakerian Lecture.

In recent years, VSEPR theory has been criticized as an outdated model from the standpoint of both scientific accuracy and pedagogical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clauss|first=Allen D.|last2=Nelsen|first2=Stephen F.|last3=Ayoub|first3=Mohamed|last4=Moore|first4=John W.|last5=Landis|first5=Clark R.|last6=Weinhold|first6=Frank|date=2014-10-08|title=Rabbit-ears hybrids, VSEPR sterics, and other orbital anachronisms|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C4RP00057A|journal=Chem. Educ. Res. Pract.|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=417–434|doi=10.1039/c4rp00057a|issn=1756-1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the equivalent lone pairs of water and carbonyl compounds in VSEPR theory neglect fundamental differences in the symmetries (σ vs. π) of [[Molecular orbital|molecular orbitals]] and [[Natural bond orbital|natural bond orbitals]] that correspond to them, a difference that is sometimes chemically significant.  Furthermore, there is little evidence, computational or experimental, proposing that lone pairs are "bigger" than bonding pairs.  It has been suggested that [[Bent's rule]] is capable of replacing VSEPR as a simple model for explaining molecular structure.  Nevertheless, VSEPR theory captures many of the essential features of the structure and electron distribution of simple molecules, and most undergraduate [[general chemistry]] courses continue to teach it.

== Overview ==
VSEPR theory is used to predict the arrangement of electron pairs around non-hydrogen atoms in molecules, especially simple and symmetric molecules, where these key, central atoms participate in bonding to two or more other atoms; the geometry of these key atoms and their non-bonding electron pairs in turn determine the geometry of the larger whole.

The number of electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom is determined after drawing the [[Lewis structure]] of the molecule, and expanding it to show all bonding groups and [[lone pair]]s of electrons.&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petrucci |first1=R. H. |first2=Harwood |last2=W. S. |first3=Herring |last3=F. G. |title=General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications |publisher=Prentice-Hall |edition=8th |year=2002 |ISBN=0-13-014329-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|410–417}} In VSEPR theory, a [[double bond]] or [[triple bond]] are treated as a single bonding group.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt; The sum of the number of atoms bonded to a central atom and the number of [[lone pair]]s formed by its nonbonding [[valence electron]]s is known as the central atom's [[steric number]].

The electron pairs (or groups if multiple bonds are present) are assumed to lie on the surface of a sphere centered on the central atom and tend to occupy positions that minimize their mutual repulsions by maximizing the distance between them.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|410–417}}&lt;ref name=Miessler&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. L. |last1=Miessler |first2=D. A. |last2=Tarr |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1999 |pages=54–62 |ISBN=0-13-841891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of electron pairs (or groups), therefore, determines the overall geometry that they will adopt. For example, when there are two electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their mutual repulsion is minimal when they lie at opposite poles of the sphere. Therefore, the central atom is predicted to adopt a ''linear'' geometry. If there are 3 electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their repulsion is minimized by placing them at the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered on the atom. Therefore, the predicted geometry is ''[[triangular|trigonal]]''. Likewise, for 4 electron pairs, the optimal arrangement is ''[[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]]''.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|410–417}}

== Degree of repulsion ==
The overall geometry is further refined by distinguishing between ''bonding'' and ''nonbonding'' electron pairs. The bonding electron pair shared in a [[sigma bond]] with an adjacent atom lies further from the central atom than a nonbonding (lone) pair of that atom, which is held close to its positively charged nucleus. VSEPR theory therefore views repulsion by the lone pair to be greater than the repulsion by a bonding pair. As such, when a molecule has 2 interactions with different degrees of repulsion, VSEPR theory predicts the structure where lone pairs occupy positions that allow them to experience less repulsion. Lone pair–lone pair (lp–lp) repulsions are considered stronger than lone pair–bonding pair (lp–bp) repulsions, which in turn are considered stronger than bonding pair–bonding pair (bp–bp) repulsions, distinctions that then guide decisions about overall geometry when 2 or more non-equivalent positions are possible.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|410–417}} For instance, when 5 valence electron pairs surround a central atom, they adopt a [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] with two collinear ''axial'' positions and three ''equatorial'' positions. An electron pair in an axial position has three close equatorial neighbors only 90° away and a fourth much farther at 180°, while an equatorial electron pair has only two adjacent pairs at 90° and two at 120°. The repulsion from the close neighbors at 90° is more important, so that the axial positions experience more repulsion than the equatorial positions; hence, when there are lone pairs, they tend to occupy equatorial positions as shown in the diagrams of the next section for steric number five.&lt;ref name=Miessler/&gt;

The difference between lone pairs and bonding pairs may also be used to rationalize deviations from idealized geometries. For example, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule has four electron pairs in its valence shell: two lone pairs and two bond pairs.  The four electron pairs are spread so as to point roughly towards the apices of a tetrahedron.  However, the bond angle between the two O–H bonds is only 104.5°, rather than the 109.5° of a regular tetrahedron, because the two lone pairs (whose density or probability envelopes lie closer to the oxygen nucleus) exert a greater mutual repulsion than the two bond pairs.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|410–417}}&lt;ref name=Miessler/&gt;

An advanced-level explanation replaces the above distinction with two rules:
* [[Bent's rule]]: An electron pair of a more electropositive ligand constitutes greater repulsion. This explains why the Cl in PClF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; prefers the equatorial position and why the bond angle in [[oxygen difluoride]] (103.8°) is smaller than that of water (104.5°). Lone pairs are then considered to be a special case of this rule, held by a "ghost ligand" in the limit of electropositivity.
* A higher [[bond order]] constitutes greater repulsion. This explains why in [[phosgene]], the oxygen–chlorine bond angle (124.1°) is larger than the chlorine–chlorine bond angle (111.8°) even though chlorine is more electropositive than oxygen. In the [[carbonate]] ion, all three bond angles are equivalent due to [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]].

==AXE method==

The "AXE method" of electron counting is commonly used when applying the VSEPR theory. The electron pairs around a central atom are represented by a formula AX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''A'' represents the central atom and always has an implied subscript one.  Each ''X'' represents a ligand (an atom bonded to A). Each ''E'' represents a ''lone pair'' of electrons on the central atom.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|410–417}} The total number of ''X'' and ''E'' is known as the [[steric number]]. For example in a molecule AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the atom A has a steric number of 5.

Based on the steric number and distribution of ''X''s and ''E''s, VSEPR theory makes the predictions in the following tables. Note that the geometries are named according to the atomic positions only and not the electron arrangement. For example, the description of AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as a bent molecule means that the three atoms AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are not in one straight line, although the lone pair helps to determine the geometry.

When the [[substituent]] (X) atoms are not all the same, the geometry is still approximately valid, but the bond angles may be slightly different from the ones where all the outside atoms are the same.  For example, the double-bond carbons in alkenes like [[ethylene|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] are AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but the bond angles are not all exactly 120°.  Likewise, [[thionyl chloride|SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but because the X substituents are not identical, the X–A–X angles are not all equal.

As a tool in predicting the geometry adopted with a given number of electron pairs, an often used physical demonstration of the principle of minimal electron pair repulsion utilizes inflated balloons. Through handling, balloons acquire a slight surface electrostatic charge that results in the adoption of roughly the same geometries when they are tied together at their stems as the corresponding number of electron pairs.  For example, five balloons tied together adopt the trigonal bipyramidal geometry, just as do the five bonding pairs of a PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (AX&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) or the two bonding and three non-bonding pairs of a XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  The molecular geometry of the former is also trigonal bipyramidal, whereas that of the latter is linear.

Possible geometries for steric numbers of 10, 11, 12, or 14 are [[gyroelongated square bipyramid|bicapped square antiprismatic]] (or bicapped [[snub disphenoid|dodecadeltahedral]]), [[edge-contracted icosahedron|octadecahedral]], [[regular icosahedron|icosahedral]], and bicapped [[hexagonal antiprism]]atic, respectively. No compounds with steric numbers this high involving [[denticity|monodentate]] ligands exist, and those involving multidentate ligands can often be analysed more simply as complexes with lower steric numbers when some multidentate ligands are treated as a unit.&lt;ref name="wiberg" /&gt;{{rp|1165,1721}}

==Examples==
The [[methane]] molecule (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is tetrahedral because there are four pairs of electrons. The four hydrogen atoms are positioned at the vertices of a [[tetrahedron]], and the bond angle is [[Inverse trigonometric functions|cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]](−{{frac|1|3}})&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;109°&amp;nbsp;28′.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brittin | first1 = W.

The [[ammonia]] molecule (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has three pairs of electrons involved in bonding, but there is a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;{{rp|392–393}} It is not bonded with another atom; however, it influences the overall shape through repulsions. As in methane above, there are four regions of electron density. Therefore, the overall orientation of the regions of electron density is tetrahedral. On the other hand, there are only three outer atoms.

Many transition metal compounds have unusual geometries, which can be ascribed to ligand bonding interaction with the d subshell and to absence of valence shell lone pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = "Non-VSEPR" Structures and Bonding in d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; Systems | first = Martin | last = Kaupp | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie|Angew.

The Kepert model cannot explain the formation of square planar complexes or distorted structures.&lt;!-- weak interaction inferred from the ligands being placed at opposite sides of the atom --&gt;

==Odd-electron molecules==
The VSEPR theory can be extended to molecules with an odd number of electrons by treating the unpaired electron as a "half electron pair" — for example, Gillespie and Nyholm&lt;ref name="Gill1957"/&gt;{{rp|364–365}} suggested that the decrease in the bond angle in the series [[Nitronium ion|{{chem|NO|2|+}}]] (180°), [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (134°), [[Nitrite|{{chem|NO|2|-}}]] (115°) indicates that a given set of bonding electron pairs exert a weaker repulsion on a single non-bonding electron than on a pair of non-bonding electrons. In effect, they considered nitrogen dioxide as an AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, with a geometry intermediate between {{chem|NO|2|+}} and {{chem|NO|2|-}}. Similarly, [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, with a geometry intermediate between [[Chloryl|{{chem|ClO|2|+}}]] and [[chlorite|{{chem|ClO|2|-}}]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Finally, the [[methyl radical]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is predicted to be trigonal pyramidal like the methyl anion ({{chem|CH|3|-}}), but with a larger bond angle (as in the trigonal planar methyl cation ({{chem|CH|3|+}})). However, in this case, the VSEPR prediction is not quite true, as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is actually planar, although its distortion to a pyramidal geometry requires very little energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn |first1=E.

'''X-ray absorption near edge structure''' ('''XANES'''), also known as '''near edge X-ray absorption fine structure''' ('''NEXAFS'''), is a type of [[absorption spectroscopy]] that indicates the features in the X-ray absorption spectra ([[X-ray absorption spectroscopy|XAS]]) of condensed matter due to the photoabsorption [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] for electronic transitions from an atomic core level to final states in the energy region of 50–100 eV above the selected atomic core level ionization energy, where the wavelength of the photoelectron is larger than the interatomic distance between the absorbing atom and its first neighbour atoms.

==Terminology==
Both XANES and NEXAFS are acceptable terms for the same technique. XANES name was invented in 1980 by Antonio Bianconi to indicate strong absorption peaks in X-ray absorption spectra in condensed matter due to multiple scattering resonances above the ionization energy. The name NEXAFS was introduced in 1983 by Jo Stohr and is synonymous with XANES, but is generally used when applied to surface and molecular science.

==Theory==
[[Image:photoabsorb modified.png|thumb|The fundamental processes which contribute to XANES spectra: 1) photoabsorption of an x-ray into a core level followed by photoelectron emission, followed by either 2) (left) filling of the core hole by an electron in another level, accompanied by fluorescence; or (right) filling of the core hole by an electron in another level followed by emission of an Auger electron.|341x341px]]

The fundamental phenomenon underlying XANES is the absorption of an x-ray photon by condensed matter with the formation of many body excited states characterized by a core hole in a selected atomic core level. (see the first Figure). In the single particle theory approximation, the system is separated into one electron in the core levels of the selected atomic species of the system and N-1 passive electrons. In this approximation the final state is described by a core hole in the atomic core level and an excited photoelectron. The final state has a very short life time because of the short life-time of the core hole and the short mean free path of the excited photoelectron with kinetic energy in the range around 20-50 eV. The core hole is filled either via an [[Auger electron spectroscopy|Auger]] process or by capture of an electron from another shell followed by emission of a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] photon. The difference between NEXAFS and traditional [[photoemission]] experiments is that in photoemission, the initial photoelectron itself is measured, while in NEXAFS the fluorescent photon or Auger electron or an inelastically scattered photoelectron may also be measured. The distinction sounds trivial but is actually significant: in photoemission the final state of the emitted electron captured in the detector must be an extended, free-electron state. By contrast in NEXAFS the final state of the photoelectron may be a bound state such as an [[exciton]] since the photoelectron itself need not be detected. The effect of measuring fluorescent photons, Auger electrons, and directly emitted electrons is to sum over all possible final states of the photoelectrons, meaning that what NEXAFS measures is the total joint density of states of the initial core level with all final states, consistent with conservation rules. The distinction is critical because in spectroscopy final states are more susceptible to [[many-body theory|many-body]] effects than initial states, meaning that NEXAFS spectra are more easily calculable than photoemission spectra. Due to the summation over final states, various [[sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rules]] are helpful in the interpretation of NEXAFS spectra. When the x-ray photon energy resonantly connects a core level with a narrow final state in a solid, such as an exciton, readily identifiable characteristic peaks will appear in the spectrum. These narrow characteristic spectral peaks give the NEXAFS technique a lot of its analytical power as illustrated by the B 1s π* exciton shown in the second Figure.

[[Synchrotron radiation]] has a natural [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] that can be utilized to great advantage in NEXAFS studies. The commonly studied molecular adsorbates have [[sigma bond|sigma]] and [[pi bond]]s that may have a particular orientation on a surface. The angle dependence of the x-ray absorption tracks the orientation of resonant bonds due to [[dipole]] [[selection rule]]s.

==Experimental considerations==

[[Image:BnB.png|thumb|left|Normal-incidence boron 1s x-ray absorption spectra for two types of BN powder. The cubic phase shows only σ-bonding while the hexagonal phase shows both π and σ bonding.]]

Soft x-ray absorption spectra are usually measured either through the ''fluorescent yield,'' in which emitted photons are monitored, or ''total electron yield,'' in which the sample is connected to ground through an ammeter and the neutralization current is monitored.    Because NEXAFS measurements require an intense tunable source of soft x-rays, they are performed at [[synchrotron]]s.  Because soft x-rays are absorbed by air, the synchrotron radiation travels from the ring in  an evacuated beam-line to the end-station where the specimen to be studied is mounted. Specialized beam-lines intended for NEXAFS studies often have additional capabilities such as heating a sample or exposing it to a dose of reactive gas.

==Energy range==

===Edge energy range===
In the absorption edge region of metals, the [[photoelectron]] is excited to the first unoccupied level above the [[Fermi level]]. Therefore, its [[mean free path]] in a pure single crystal at zero temperature is as large as infinite, and it remains very large, increasing the energy of the final state up to about 5 eV above the Fermi level. Beyond the role of the unoccupied [[density of states]] and matrix elements in single electron excitations, [[many-body]] effects appear as an "infrared singularity" at the absorption threshold in metals.

In the absorption edge region of insulators the photoelectron is excited to the first unoccupied level above the [[chemical potential]] but the unscreened core hole forms a localized bound state called core [[exciton]].

===EXAFS energy range===
[[Image:Single multiple scattering.jpg|thumb|right|Pictorial view of photoelectron [[scattering]] processes in the single-scattering regime, EXAFS (this assumes the single scattering approximation... multiple scattering can be considered with EXAFS), and in the multiple scattering regime, XANES. In EXAFS the photoelectron is scattered only by a single neighbour atom, in XANES all the scattering pathways, classified according to the number of [[scattering]] event (3), (4), (5) etc. contribute to the absorption cross section.]]

The fine structure in the x-ray absorption spectra in the high energy range extending from about 150 eV beyond the ionization potential is a powerful tool to determine the atomic pair distribution (i.e. interatomic distances) with a time scale of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; s.
In fact the final state of the excited photoelectron in the high kinetic energy range (150-2000 eV ) is determined only by single [[backscattering]] events due to the low amplitude photoelectron scattering.

===NEXAFS energy range===
In the NEXAFS region, starting about 5 eV beyond the absorption threshold, because of the low kinetic energy range (5-150 eV) the photoelectron [[backscattering]] amplitude by neighbor atoms is very large so that multiple [[scattering]] events become dominant in the NEXAFS spectra.

The different energy range between NEXAFS and EXAFS can be also explained in a very simple manner by the comparison between the photoelectron [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the interatomic distance of the photoabsorber-backscatterer pair. The photoelectron kinetic energy is connected with the wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{kinetic} = h\nu - E_\text{binding} = \hbar^2 k^2/(2m) = (2\pi)^2 \hbar^2/(2m\lambda^2),&lt;/math&gt;

which means that for high energy the wavelength is shorter than interatomic distances and hence the NEXAFS region corresponds to a single scattering regime; while for lower E, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is larger than interatomic distances and the XANES region is associated with a multiple [[scattering]] regime.

==Final states==

The absorption peaks of NEXAFS spectra are determined by multiple scattering [[resonance]]s of the photoelectron excited at the atomic absorption site and scattered by neighbor atoms.
The local character of the final states is determined by the short photoelectron [[mean free path]], that is strongly reduced (down to about 0.3&amp;nbsp;nm at 50 eV) in this energy range because of [[inelastic scattering]] of the photoelectron by electron-hole excitations ([[excitons]]) and collective electronic oscillations of the valence electrons called [[plasmons]].

==Applications==

The great power of NEXAFS derives from its elemental specificity.   Because the various elements have different core level energies, NEXAFS permits extraction of the signal from a surface monolayer or even a single buried layer in the presence of a huge background signal.   Buried layers are very important in engineering applications, such as [[hard disk|magnetic recording media]] buried beneath a surface lubricant or dopants below an electrode in an [[integrated circuit]].    Because NEXAFS can also determine the chemical state of elements which are present in bulk in minute quantities, it has found widespread use in [[environmental chemistry]] and [[geochemistry]].   The ability of NEXAFS  to study buried atoms is due to its integration over all final states including inelastically scattered electrons, as opposed to photoemission and Auger spectroscopy, which study atoms only with a layer or two of the surface.

Much chemical information can be extracted from the NEXAFS region: formal [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] (very difficult to experimentally determine in a nondestructive way); coordination environment (e.g., octahedral, tetrahedral coordination) and subtle geometrical distortions of it.

Transitions to bound vacant states just above the [[Fermi level]] can be seen. Thus NEXAFS spectra can be used as a probe of the unoccupied band structure of a material.

The near-edge structure is characteristic of an environment and valence state hence one of its more common uses is in fingerprinting: if you have a mixture of sites/compounds in a sample you can fit the measured spectra with a linear combinations of NEXAFS spectra of known species and determine the proportion of each site/compound in the sample. One example of such a use is the determination of the [[oxidation state]] of the [[plutonium]] in the [[soil]] at [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]].

==History==
The acronym XANES was first used in 1980 during interpretation of multiple scattering resonances spectra measured at the [[Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory]] (SSRL) by A. Bianconi. In 1982 the first paper on the application of XANES for determination of local structural geometrical distortions using multiple scattering theory was published by A. Bianconi, P. J. Durham and [[John Pendry|J. B. Pendry]]. In 1983 the first NEXAFS paper examining molecules adsorbed on surfaces appeared. The first XAFS paper, describing the intermediate region between EXAFS and XANES, appeared in 1987.
