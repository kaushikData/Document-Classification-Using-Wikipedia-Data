The '''abyssal zone''' or '''abyssopelagic zone''' is a layer of the [[pelagic zone]] of the ocean. "Abyss" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄβυσσος}}, meaning bottomless. At depths of {{convert|4000|to|6000|m|ft}}, this zone remains in perpetual darkness. These regions are also characterized by continuous cold and lack of nutrients. The abyssal zone has temperatures around {{convert|2|to|3|C|F}} through the large majority of its mass.&lt;ref name="biome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Sea Biome |url=http://www.untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |publisher=Untamed Science |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095054/http://untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |archivedate=31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the deeper part of the ''midnight zone'' which starts in the [[bathyal zone|bathypelagic]] waters above.&lt;ref name="biome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |last=Nelson |first=Rob |url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |publisher=The Wild Classroom |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100618/http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |archivedate=25 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area below the abyssal zone is the sparsely inhabited [[hadal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418044525/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |archivedate=18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone above is the [[bathyal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"/&gt;

==Trenches==
{{main|Hadal zone}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|200px|left|Layers of the pelagic zone]]

The deep trenches or fissures that plunge down thousands of metres below the ocean floor (for example, the midoceanic trenches such as the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific]]) are almost unexplored.&lt;ref name=zone/&gt; Previously, only the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'', the [[teleoperated|remote control]] [[submarine]] ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaikō]]'' and the ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' have been able to descend to these depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bathyscaph Trieste|url=http://www.bathyscaphtrieste.com/|publisher=Bathyscaphtrieste.com|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's deepest-diving submarine missing|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-07-01-Sub-missing_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company Inc.|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 25, 2012 one vehicle, the ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'' was able to penetrate to a depth of 10,898.4 metres (35,756&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Biology==

Overall, the deep sea is a very food-limited environment. In the abyssal zone, biomass is directly related to the amount of food either supplied from transporting [[ocean currents]] or from the water column above. The [[biological pump]] is thought of as the main driver for cycling organic matter (e.g. particulate organic carbon or [[dissolved organic carbon]]) from the atmosphere into the surface ocean, and eventually to the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|title=Temporal Change in Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosystems: A Review of the Evidence From Recent Time-Series Studies|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|date=2010|volume=58|pages=10–12|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(10)58001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that organisms in the abyssal zone have no access to sunlight, they rely heavily on nutrients sinking from above (known as [[marine snow]]). These nutrients can be in the form of sediments, algae, fecal pellets, or fish carcasses, to name a few. Spatially, the abundance of organisms in the deep ocean is hypothesized to be highest where the surface productivity is the highest, as long as there is efficient export from surface ocean to deep ocean. Studies have shown that marine snow alone does not supply an adequate amount of nutrients to support the population of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]]. However, population booms of algae or animals near the surface ocean can result in heavy pulses of [[particulate organic matter]] that, in a few weeks, will deliver as many nutrients as would normally be delivered over decadal timescales of marine snow transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine biology: Feast and famine on the abyssal plain|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131111185518.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea floor locations, such as [[mid-ocean ridges]], are unique in that they contain [[hydrothermal vents]]. These vents emit geothermically reduced sulfur compounds that allow for microbial [[primary production]], sustaining many benthic organisms in absence of the sunlight required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karl|first1=D.M.|last2=Wirsen|first2=C.O.|last3=Jannasch|first3=H.W.|title=Deep-sea primary production at the Galapagos hydrothermal vents|journal=Science|date=March 21, 1980|volume=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">The '''Atlantic Data Base for Exchange Processes at the Deep Sea Floor''' ('''ADEPD''') was a marine research project funded by the [[European Union|EU]] from 1998 to 2000 as part of MAST III (Marine Science and Technology Programme). The project was coordinated by Prof. Dr. [[Karin Lochte]] at the [[Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research]], Warnemünde with contributions of ten European partners and one institute from the US.

Aim of the ADEPD project was to build up a joint data base for [[deep sea]] [[Biology|biological]] and [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] data from a variety of sources and to conduct a preliminary geographical analysis of these data. Emphasis was on the North Atlantic, since from this area most data are available and it is the most perturbed deep sea region due to human activities. 1775 published and unpublished data sets were collected in two years. This was the first project which has compiled a data base from existing deep sea data, long-term archived and accessible to the scientific community.

Evaluation of the data collection showed that data are clustered in some well investigated areas of the [[Atlantic]], but large regions are devoid of data like the Mid Atlantic Ridge, parts of the South Atlantic and [[Southern Ocean]]. In particular biological data from the deep sea are much more scarce than geochemical ones, since many biological data from past investigations are not accessible in a suitable form at present. Most deep sea research projects did not carry out geochemical and biological studies at the same locations. Therefor, statistical comparisons between biological and geochemical data are still difficult despite the high total amount of data gathered. Different methods employed for the determination of one variable further complicate the matter. One of the major achievements of ADEP was to convert different measurements to common units. This allowed to investigate relationships between different chemical measurements, groups of organisms and turnover rates.

Two very different approaches to estimate the total turnover of organic carbon or oxygen (respiration) at the deep sea floor gave very similar results. Regional differences in both assessments point to methodological shortcomings by one or the other method and to gaps in data coverage. While estimates agreed well in central Atlantic regions, fairly large discrepancies were found at the continental margins. This indicated that there was still insufficient knowledge about transport processes and biological turnover of [[Total organic carbon|organic carbon]] along [[continental margin]]s.

The following recommendations for future research were given on the basis of the ADEPD results:
* It is most important to secure deep sea biological data from so far inaccessible sources and to collate them in a data information system which guarantees long-term stewardship and public access.
* Biological and geochemical studies were mostly carried out separately which seems to be a systematic, scientific pattern and poses a problem in deep sea research. Interdisciplinary studies are essential to better understand of deep sea processes.
* The largest differences in estimates of oxygen fluxes at the sea floor are found at continental margins which export large amounts of organic carbon to the deep sea. The knowledge of transport and biological utilization at the continental margins need further attention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15544">[[File:Shear Moment Diagram.svg|thumb|400px|[[Shear and moment diagram]] for a simply supported beam with a concentrated load at mid-span.]]
A '''bending moment'''  is the reaction induced in a [[structural element]] when an external [[force]] or [[Moment of force|moment]] is applied to the element causing the element to [[bending|bend]].&lt;ref name=timo/&gt;&lt;ref name=beer/&gt; The most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the [[Beam (structure)|beam]].  The diagram shows a beam which is simply supported at both ends.  Simply supported means that each end of the beam can rotate; therefore each end support has no bending moment. The ends can only react to the shear loads.  Other beams can have both ends fixed; therefore each end support has both bending moment and shear reaction loads. Beams can also have one end fixed and one end simply supported.  The simplest type of beam is the cantilever, which is fixed at one end and is free at the other end (neither simple or fixed). In reality, beam supports are usually neither absolutely fixed nor absolutely rotating freely.

The internal reaction loads in a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the structural element can be resolved into a [[resultant force]] and a resultant [[couple (mechanics)|couple]].  For equilibrium, the moment created by external forces (and external moments) must be balanced by the couple induced by the internal loads.  The resultant internal couple is called the '''bending moment''' while the resultant internal force is called the '''shear force''' (if it is transverse to the plane of element) or the '''normal force''' (if it is along the plane of the element).

The bending moment at a [[cross section (geometry)|section]] through a structural element may be defined as "the sum of the moments about that section of all external forces acting to one side of that section". The forces and moments on either side of the section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments, regardless of which side of the section is selected. If clockwise bending moments are taken as negative, then a negative bending moment within an element will cause "sagging", and a positive moment will cause "hogging". It is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] is a point of [[contraflexure]]&amp;mdash;that is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa.

Moments and [[torque]]s are measured as a force multiplied by a distance so they have as unit [[newton-metre]]s (N·m), or [[pound-foot (torque)|pound-foot]] (lbf·ft). The concept of bending moment is very important in [[engineering]] (particularly in [[Civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]]) and [[physics]].

== Background ==
[[Tensile]] and [[compressive]] stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, but are also dependent on the [[second moment of area]] of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Failure in bending will occur when the bending moment is sufficient to induce tensile stresses greater than the [[Yield (engineering)|yield]] stress of the material throughout the entire cross-section.  In structural analysis, this bending failure is called a plastic hinge, since the full load carrying ability of the structural element is not reached until the full cross-section is past the yield stress.  It is possible that failure of a structural element in [[Shearing (physics)|shear]] may occur before failure in bending, however the mechanics of failure in shear and in bending are different.

Moments are calculated by multiplying the external [[vector (geometric)|vector]] [[force]]s (loads or reactions) by the vector distance at which they are applied. When analysing an entire element, it is sensible to calculate moments at both ends of the element, at the beginning, centre and end of any uniformly distributed loads, and directly underneath any point loads. Of course any "pin-joints" within a structure allow free rotation, and so zero moment occurs at these points as there is no way of transmitting turning forces from one side to the other.

It is more common to use the convention that a clockwise bending moment to the left of the point under consideration is taken as positive. This then corresponds to the second derivative of a function which, when positive, indicates a curvature that is 'lower at the centre' i.e. sagging. When defining moments and curvatures in this way calculus can be more readily used to find slopes and deflections.

Critical values within the beam are most commonly annotated using a [[Shear and moment diagram|bending moment diagram]], where negative moments are plotted to scale above a horizontal line and positive below. Bending moment varies linearly over unloaded sections, and parabolically over uniformly loaded sections.

Engineering descriptions of the computation of bending moments can be confusing because of unexplained sign conventions and implicit assumptions.  The descriptions below use vector mechanics to compute moments of force and bending moments in an attempt to explain, from first principles, why particular sign conventions are chosen.

== Computing the moment of force ==
[[File:beam moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the moment of force in a beam.]]
An important part of determining bending moments in practical problems is the computation of moments of force.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a force vector acting at a point '''A''' in a body.  The moment of this force about a reference point ('''O''') is defined as&lt;ref name=beer&gt;{{Citation|last=Beer|first=F.|last2=Johnston|first2=E.R.|title=Vector mechanics for engineers: statics|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1984|pages=62–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}  = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the moment vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector from the reference point ('''O''') to the point of application of the force ('''A''').  The &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; symbol indicates the vector cross product.  For many problems, it is more convenient to compute the moment of force about an axis that passes through the reference point '''O'''.  If the unit vector along the axis is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;, the moment of force about the axis is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = \mathbf{e}\cdot\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{e}\cdot(\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F})
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; indicates the vector dot product.

===  Example ===
The adjacent figure shows a beam that is acted upon by a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.  If the coordinate system is defined by the three unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, we have the following 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{e}_x - F\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{e}_x + 0\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp;  \mathbf{e}_y &amp;  \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 
         \end{matrix}\right| = -Fx\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The moment about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_z = \mathbf{e}_z\cdot\mathbf{M} = -Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sign conventions ===
The negative value suggests that a moment that tends to rotate a body clockwise around an axis should have a '''negative''' sign.  However, the actual sign depends on the choice of the three axes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, if we choose another right handed coordinate system with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_x = \mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{E}_y = -\mathbf{e}_z, \mathbf{E}_z = \mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y -F\,\mathbf{E}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y + 0\,\mathbf{E}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{E}_x &amp;  \mathbf{E}_y &amp;  \mathbf{E}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -F 
         \end{matrix}\right| = Fx\,\mathbf{E}_y 
   \quad \text{and} \quad M_y = \mathbf{E}_y\cdot\mathbf{M} = Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this new choice of axes, a '''positive''' moment tends to rotate body clockwise around an axis.

== Computing the bending moment ==
In a rigid body or in an unconstrained deformable body, the application of a moment of force causes a pure rotation.  But if a deformable body is constrained, it develops internal forces in response to the external force so that equilibrium is maintained.  An example is shown in the figure below.  These internal forces will cause local deformations in the body.

For equilibrium, the sum of the internal force vectors is equal to the applied external force and the sum of the moment vectors created by the internal forces is equal to the moment of the external force.  The internal force and moment vectors are oriented in such a way that the total force (internal + external) and moment (external + internal) of the system is zero.  The internal moment vector is called the '''bending moment'''.&lt;ref name=timo&gt;{{Citation|last=Gere|first=J.M.|last2=Timoshenko|first2=S.P.|title=Mechanics of Materials:Forth edition|year=1996|publisher=Nelson Engineering|isbn=0534934293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bending moments have been used to determine the stress states in arbitrary shaped structures, the physical interpretation of the computed stresses is problematic.  However, physical interpretations of bending moments in beams and plates have a straightforward interpretation as the [[stress resultants]] in a cross-section of the structural element.  For example, in a beam in the figure, the bending moment vector due to stresses in the cross-section ''A'' perpendicular to the ''x''-axis is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{xx} \mathbf{e}_x + \sigma_{xy} \mathbf{e}_y + \sigma_{xz} \mathbf{e}_z)\, dA 
   \quad \text{where} \quad 
    \mathbf{r} = y\,\mathbf{e}_y + z\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt; 
Expanding this expression we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \left(-y\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_z + y\sigma_{xz}\mathbf{e}_x + z\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_y - z\sigma_{xy}\mathbf{e}_x\right)dA =: M_{xx}\,\mathbf{e}_x + M_{xy}\,\mathbf{e}_y + M_{xz}\,\mathbf{e}_z\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We define the bending moment components as 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} M_{xx} \\ M_{xy} \\M_{xz} \end{bmatrix}
    := \int_A \begin{bmatrix} y\sigma_{xz} - z\sigma_{xy} \\ z\sigma_{xx} \\ -y\sigma_{xx} \end{bmatrix}\,dA \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The internal moments are computed about an origin that is at the neutral axis of the beam or plate and the integration is through the thickness (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;)

=== Example ===
[[File:beam bending moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the bending moment in a beam.]]
In the beam shown in the adjacent figure, the external forces are the applied force at point '''A''' (&lt;math&gt;-F\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;) and the reactions at the two support points '''O''' and '''B''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_O = R_O\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}_B = R_B\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;).  The reactions can be computed using balances of forces and moments about point '''A''', i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
    R_O + R_B - F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad -\mathbf{r}_A\times\mathbf{R}_O + \mathbf{r}_B\times\mathbf{R}_B = \mathbf{0} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the beam, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{r}_A = x_A\mathbf{e}_x \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r}_B = (L-x_A)\mathbf{e}_x \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we solve for the reactions we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_O = \left(1 - \frac{x_A}{L}\right) F \quad \text{and} \quad R_B = \frac{x_A}{L}\,F \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Looking at the free body diagram of the part of the beam to the left of point '''X''', the total moment of the external forces about the point '''X''' is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = -(\mathbf{r}_X-\mathbf{r}_A)\times\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{r}_X\times\mathbf{R}_O = 
         \left[(x_A-x)\mathbf{e}_x\right]\times\left(-F\mathbf{e}_y\right)
         - \left(x\mathbf{e}_x\right)\times\left(R_O\mathbf{e}_y\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we compute the cross products, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{M} 
       = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x_A - x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right| -
         \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; R_0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right|
       = F(x-x_A)\,\mathbf{e}_z -R_0x\,\mathbf{e}_z = -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this situation, the only non-zero component of the bending moment is
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For the sum of the moments at '''X''' about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; to be zero, we require
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \mathbf{0} \quad \text{or} \quad -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x) + M_{xz} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad M_{xz} =\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)  \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
At &lt;math&gt;x = x_A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;M_{xz} = Fx_A(L-x_A)/L&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sign convention ===
In the above discussion, it is implicitly assumed that the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is compressed.  That can be seen if we consider a linear distribution of stress in the beam and find the resulting bending moment.  Let the top of the beam be in compression with a stress &lt;math&gt;-\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; and let the bottom of the beam have a stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the stress distribution in the beam is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xx}(y) = -y\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The bending moment due to these stresses is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,(-y\sigma_0)\,dy\,dz\right] = \sigma_0\,I
 &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section of the beam.   Therefore the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is in compression.

Many authors follow a different convention in which the stress resultant &lt;math&gt;M_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
In that case, positive bending moments imply that the top of the beam is in tension.  Of course, the definition of '''top''' depends on the coordinate system being used.  In the examples above, the top is the location with the largest &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate.

'''Bettina Arndt''' (born 1 August 1949) is an Australian sex therapist, journalist, author and clinical psychologist.

== Early life ==
Arndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 – 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''née'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 – 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{Cite web| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028114106/http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1951266.htm | archive-date = 28 October 2013 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1951266.htm|title=Transcripts: Bettina Arndt|work=Talking Heads with Peter Thompson|publisher=[[ABCTV]]|date=18 June 2007|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (brothers Christopher and Nicholas).

== Education ==
In 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to Sydney where she trained as a clinical psychologist specialising in sexual therapy. In 1973, she completed her [[Master of Psychology]] degree at the [[University of New South Wales]], where her thesis was on orgasm problems.&lt;ref name="Overington"&gt;{{Cite news |last= Overington| first= Carolyn | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140528090559/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/ten-questions-bettina-arndt/story-e6frg996-1225926450012 | archive-date = 28 May 2014 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/ten-questions-bettina-arndt/story-e6frg996-1225926450012|title=Ten Questions:Bettina Arndt|work=[[The Australian]]  |date = 20 September 2010|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Arndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982. Her work in sex education also involved post-graduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cadzow | first = Jane | title = The sex advocate | url = http://www.bettinaarndt.com.au/wp-content/uploads/The-Sex-Advocate-Good-Weekend.pdf | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend (supplement)]] &amp;#124; [[The Age]] | date = 28 August 2010 | accessdate = 7 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt moved on to writing about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia.

In 1986, Arndt married the American lawyer Warren Scott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/style/bettina-m-arndt-marries-a-lawyer.html |title=Bettina M. Arndt marries a lawyer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 June 1986|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to New York City. She lived in Manhattan for five years, and while living in the United States wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in [[Canberra]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989). In August 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.

In 2007, the Australian television programme ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' broadcast allegations of plagiarism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Paul Barry]] (presenter) |date= 30 April 2007 |title= Bettina's organic leftovers |series= [[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] |medium= Television  |url= http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1910530.htm |access-date= 7 June 2017 |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Arndt, allegations that were not disputed.

''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire, was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.

Arndt has served on a number of committees advising the Australian government on policy matters, including the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, the National Advisory Committee on Ageing, the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team and the Child Support Review Reference Group.

'''Body integrity dysphoria''' ('''BID''', also referred to as '''body integrity identity disorder''', '''amputee identity disorder''' and '''xenomelia''', formerly called '''apotemnophilia''') is a disorder characterized by a desire to be disabled or discomfort with being able-bodied beginning in early adolescence and resulting in harmful consequences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/256572629|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; BID appears to be related to [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brugger|first1=P|last2=Lenggenhager|first2=B|title=The bodily self and its disorders: neurological, psychological and social aspects.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurology|date=December 2014|volume=27|issue=6|pages=644–52|doi=10.1097/WCO.0000000000000151|pmid=25333602|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/100466/}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with this condition may refer to themselves as "transabled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baril|first1=Alexandre|last2=Trevenen|first2=Kathryn|title=Transabled women lost in translation?

==History==
Apotemnophilia was first described in a 1977 article by psychologists Gregg Furth and [[John Money]] as primarily sexually oriented, in 1986 Money described a similar condition he called "acromotophile", namely sexual arousal over a partner's amputation.  Publications before 2004 were generally [[case study|case studies]].&lt;ref name=Preester2013rev/&gt; The condition received public attention in the late 1990s after a Scottish surgeon, Robert Smith, amputated limbs of two people who were desperate to have this done and were otherwise healthy.&lt;ref name=Preester2013rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Preester|first1=H|title=Merleau-Ponty's sexual schema and the sexual component of body integrity identity disorder.|journal=Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy|date=May 2013|volume=16|issue=2|pages=171–84|doi=10.1007/s11019-011-9367-3|pmid=22139385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Michael First published the first [[clinical research]] in which he surveyed 52 people with the condition, a quarter of whom have had an amputation. Based on that work, First coined the term "body integrity identity disorder" to express what he saw as more of an identity disorder than a paraphilia.&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedda|first1=A|last2=Bottini|first2=G|title=Apotemnophilia, body integrity identity disorder or xenomelia?

==Classification==
As of 2014 it remained unclear whether BID is a form of [[neurodiversity|human diversity]] or a mental disorder, similar to the development of the concept of [[gender dysphoria]]. There was debate about including it in the [[DSM-5]] and it was not included; it was also not included in the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases|ICD-]]10''.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev/&gt; It has been included in the ICD-11, which reached a stable version in June 2018, as 'Body integrity dysphoria' with code 6C21.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ethics of surgically amputating the undesired limb of a person with BID are difficult and controversial.&lt;ref name=Levy2007&gt;{{cite book |author=Levy, Neil |title=Neuroethics — Challenges for the 21st Century |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=GIIj-hNhZrcC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3–5]  |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-68726-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costandi|first1=Mo|title=The science and ethics of voluntary amputation {{!}} Mo Costandi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/may/30/1|work=The Guardian|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dua|first1=A|title=Apotemnophilia: ethical considerations of amputating a healthy limb.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=February 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=75–8|doi=10.1136/jme.2009.031070|pmid=20133399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
BID is a rare, infrequently studied condition in which there is a mismatch between the mental body image and the physical body, characterized by an intense desire for amputation of a limb, usually a leg, or to become blind or deaf.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;  The person sometimes has a sense of sexual arousal connected with the desire for loss of a limb or sense.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;

Some act out their desires, pretending they are amputees using prostheses and other tools to ease their desire to be one. Some people with BID have reported to the media or by interview over the telephone with researchers that they have resorted to self-amputation of a "superfluous" limb; for example, by allowing a train to run over it, or by damaging the limb so badly that surgeons will have to amputate it. However, the medical literature records few, if any, cases of actual self amputation.&lt;ref name=Levy2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

To the extent that generalizations can be made, people with BID appear to start to wish for amputation when they are young, between 8 and 12 years old, and often knew a person with an amputated limb when they are children; however, people with BID tend to seek treatment only when they are much older.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;  People with BID seem to be predominantly male, and while there is no evidence that sexual preference is relevant, there does seem to be a correlation with BID and a person having [[gender dysphoria]] or a [[paraphilia]]; there appears to be a weak correlation with [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;  Family psychiatric history does not appear to be relevant, there does not appear to be any strong correlation with the site of the limb or limbs that the person wishes they did not have, nor with any past trauma to the undesired limb.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

==Causes==
As of 2014 the cause was not clear and was a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
As of 2014 there were no formal diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no [[evidence-based treatment]] for BID; there are reports of the use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[antidepressants]], and surgery to amputate the undesired limb.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bou Khalil|first1=R|last2=Richa|first2=S|title=Apotemnophilia or body integrity identity disorder: a case report review.|journal=The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds|date=December 2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=313–9|doi=10.1177/1534734612464714|pmid=23089967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Outcomes of treated and untreated BID are not known; there are case reports that BID persisted even after amputation.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

'''Building lifecycle management''' or '''BLM''' is the adaptation of [[Product Lifecycle Management|product lifecycle management]] (PLM)-like techniques to the design, construction, and management of [[buildings]]. Building lifecycle management requires accurate and extensive [[Building Information Modeling|building information modeling]] (BIM).

Life-cycle management of the built environment requires a standardized ontology and the integration of disparate competencies, technologies, and processes.

'''Burton MacDonald''' (born September 13, 1939) is a Canadian [[biblical archaeologist]] specialising in the archaeology of [[Jordan]]. He has been a professor at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] since 1965.

==Early life and education==
MacDonald attended [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (St. F. X.) and graduated with a BA in philosophy in 1960. He then began studies at St. Paul's Seminary, part of the [[University of Ottawa]], where he obtained a baccalaureate in theology in 1962, a licentiate in theology in 1964, and a masters in religious education in 1965. After working as a priest and two years teaching at Xavier College (now [[Cape Breton University]]) and St. F. X., he enrolled in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literature at the [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University of America]] (CUA), where he obtained a PhD in 1974 with a dissertation on the biblical [[Tribe of Benjamin]]. He also studied at the ''[[École Biblique et Archéologique Française de Jérusalem|École Biblique et Archéologique Française]]'' in [[Jerusalem]] between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burton MacDonald|url=http://sites.stfx.ca/religious_studies/burton_macdonald|website=St. Francis Xavier University|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
MacDonald returned to St. F. X. in 1972 as a professor in the Department of Theology (later the Department of Religious Studies). He became a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]] in 1989 and served as the chair of the department between 1992 and 1995 and 1996 to 2000. He held the Father Edo Gatto Chair of Christian Studies in 2006.

MacDonald first became involved in archaeological fieldwork whilst studying at the ''École Biblique'', including the sites of [[Gezer]] (1970) and [[Tell el-Hesi]] (1971) in [[Israel]]. He then joined excavations led by [[G. Ernest Wright]] at Idalion, [[Cyprus]] (1971). After further work at Idalion (1974) and Tell el-Hesi (1975), he was introduced to the archaeology of Jordan as a member of the ''Expedition to the Dead Sea Plain'', directed by Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub (1977) and the ''Central Moab Survey'', directed by J. Maxwell Miller (1979).  He also participated in the [[University of Toronto]]'s ''The Wadi Tumilat Project, East Nile Delta, Tell al Maskhuta, Egypt'', under the directorship of John S. Holladay (1978–1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burton MacDonald's Homepage: CV: Archaeological Fieldwork Experience|url=http://people.stfx.ca/bmacdona/welcome.html|website=St. F.X.U.|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald has directed five major field projects, focusing on the [[Edom|Edomite plateau]] in southern Jordan:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5429">'''Classical theism''' is a form of [[theism]] in which [[God]] is characterized as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being, in contrast to other conceptions such as [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], [[polytheism]] and [[Process theology|process theism]].

Classical theism is a form of [[monotheism]]. Whereas most monotheists agree that God is, at minimum, [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]], and [[omnibenevolent|completely good]],&lt;ref&gt;Pojman and Rea, 2&lt;/ref&gt; classical theism asserts that God is both [[Immanence|immanent]] (encompassing or manifested in the material world) and simultaneously [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] (independent of the material universe); [[Divine simplicity|simple]], and having such attributes as [[Immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[impassibility]], and timelessness.&lt;ref name="Craig98"&gt;Craig, 98&lt;/ref&gt; A key concept in classical theism is that "created beings" (ie, material phenomena, whether sentient biological organisms or insentient matter) are dependent for their existence on the one supreme divine Being. Also, although God is wholly transcendent, he not only creates the material universe but also acts upon the material universe in imposing (or organizing) a Higher Order upon that material reality. This order was called by the ancient Greeks ''[[logos]]''.

Classical theism is associated with the tradition of writers like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]], [[Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], [[Maimonides]], [[Averroes]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Craig98"/&gt;  In opposition to this tradition, there are, today, philosophers like [[Alvin Plantinga]] (who rejects divine simplicity), [[Richard Swinburne]] (who rejects divine timelessness) and [[William Lane Craig]] (who rejects both divine simplicity and timelessness),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reasonablefaith.org/divine-simplicity&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/god-time-and-eternity|title=God, Time, and Eternity - Reasonable Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who can be viewed as [[Theistic Personalism|theistic personalists]]. Philosophers like [[David Bentley Hart]] have defended classical theism itself in recent times.

Classical theism was almost universal among Christian theologians prior to the twentieth century. However, some of its recent critics argue that it is taken from pre-Christian philosophers and incompatible with the occasions in the Bible that describe God as emotional or changing. In defence of classical theism's compatibility with the Bible, these passages can be read in an analogous or [[allegory|allegorical]] sense as containing poetic elements, just as many other passages have also long been read. For example, Exodus 31:18&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus|31:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes "the finger of God", and Genesis 3:8&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes God as noisily walking in the garden of Eden. It is inconsistent that most Christian critics of classical theism would read these latter verses in an allegorical sense, but insist that instances which describe change or passion in God are extremely literal in meaning. Moreover, whereas critics of classical theism charge that it has infiltrated Christian theology from pre-Christian roots such as [[Neoplatonism]], in fact the term "classical theism" belies crucial differences between a traditional Christian and Neoplatonic conception of God. For example, whereas [[Arius]] followed the neo-Platonist Plotinus in asserting that God could not become a physical man, [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] defended the doctrine of God's incarnation as the man Jesus, while nevertheless defending the immutability and impassibility of Jesus' divine nature. According to a traditional Christian understanding of the ''[[communicatio idiomatum]]'', it can be rightly said that God suffered and died on the cross, but only by virtue of the [[hypostatic union]] of the impassible divine word with Jesus' passible human soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Ante-Nicene &amp; Nicene and Post-Nicene Church Fathers Collection. Catholic Way Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, while the [[church father]]s made sure to correct the classical theism of pagan sources where it was incompatible with Christianity, it can be argued that many of the modern Christian critics of classical theism are in fact themselves influenced by an overly uncritical adoption of trends within [[process theology]], which itself has non-Christian philosophical roots in the thought of [[Charles Hartshorne]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Crisis Management Initiative''' ('''CMI''') is an independent [[Finland|Finnish]] [[non-governmental organisation]] that works to prevent and [[conflict resolution|resolve conflict]] through informal dialogue and mediation. [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and former [[President of Finland]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] founded CMI in 2000. CMI has offices in [[Helsinki]] and [[Brussels]] as well as a presence in selected countries. The organisation is officially registered as '''Crisis Management Initiative ry'''.

==Function==
CMI states it is focused on contributing to peace processes in three regions: [[MENA|the Middle East and North Africa]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Self-statedly, CMI facilitates dialogue, mediates between conflicting sides, provides capacity-building and mediation support at all stages of conflict management and peace processes, and supports the broader peace building community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|title=Crisis Management Initiative (CMI)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-23|work=Institute for NGO Research|access-date=2018-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070753/https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nobel Peace laureate and former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari founded CMI on 24 August 2000.&lt;ref name="yhdistysnetti_cmi"&gt;{{Cite web | URL = http://yhdistysrekisteri.prh.fi/pertied.htx?kieli=3&amp;reknro=179786 | title = Crisis Management Initiative ry | work = AssociationNet | date = 2017-05-10 | location = Helsinki | publisher = Finnish Patent and Registration Office | accessdate = 2017-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After stepping down as the President of Finland that year, Ahtisaari declined the post of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] because he wanted to focus instead on addressing the root causes of conflicts. President Ahtisaari's long-term vision with CMI was to  contribute to as much as effectively as possible to solving violent conflict throughout the world. The main tasks of the organisation in its early years were to assist Martti Ahtisaari in his numerous international assignments, to participate in policy discussions, and to advocate capacity-building in civilian crisis management.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

This led to CMI taking its own projects, at first concerning crisis management and later on expanding to peace building and conflict resolution projects. One of CMI's most visible assignments, the [[Aceh]] peace process began in late 2004. CMI and its chairman president Ahtisaari were asked to facilitate talks between the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). In 2008, President Ahtisaari was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his leading role in bringing independence to Namibia, Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo, and autonomy for Aceh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Developmental disorders''' comprise a group of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233&gt;{{cite book |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405145498.html |title = Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Fifth Edition |publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd |editors = Michael Rutter, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, Daniel S. Pine, Stephen Scott, Jim Stevenson, Eric Taylor, Anita Thapar |others = Dorothy Bishop and Michael Rutter |year = 2008 |pages = 32–33 |isbn = 978-1-4051-4549-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most narrow concept is used in the category "Specific Disorders of Psychological Development" in the [[ICD-10]].&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; These disorders comprise [[language disorder]]s, [[learning disorder]]s, [[Developmental coordination disorder|motor disorders]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm|title=ICD 10|website=priory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broader definitions [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] is included, and the term used is [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; Yet others include [[antisocial behavior]] and [[schizophrenia]] that begins in childhood and continues through life.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt; However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

Developmental disorders are present from early life. Most improve as the child grows older, but some entail impairments that continue throughout life. There is a strong genetic component; more males are afflicted than females.&lt;ref name = Rutter3233/&gt;

==Emergence==
Learning disabilities are diagnosed when the children are young and just beginning school. Most learning disabilities are found under the age of 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = National, Disabilities Learning | year = 1982 | title = Learning disabilities: Issues on definition | url = | journal = Asha | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 945–947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young children with communication disorders may not speak at all, or may have a limited vocabulary for their age.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;Communication Disorders. (n.d.). Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, WI, Retrieved December 6, 2011, from http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/&lt;/ref&gt; Some children with communication disorders have difficulty understanding simple directions or are unable to name objects.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Most children with communication disorders are able to speak by the time they enter school, however, they continue to have problems with communication.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; School-aged children often have problems understanding and formulating words.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; Teens may have more difficulty with understanding or expressing abstract ideas.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

=== Causes ===
The scientific study of the causes of developmental disorders involves many different theories. Some of the major differences between these theories involves whether or not environment disrupts normal development, or if abnormalities are pre-determined.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karmiloff Annette | year = | title = Development itself is key to understanding developmental disorders | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661398012303 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences| volume =  2| issue = | pages =  389–398| doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01230-3 | pmid=21227254 | date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Normal development occurs with a combination of contributions from both the environment and genetics. The theories vary in the part each factor has to play in normal development, thus affecting how the abnormalities are caused.&lt;ref name="Karmiloff Annette"/&gt;

One theory that supports environmental causes of developmental disorders involves stress in early childhood. Researcher and child psychiatrist [[Bruce D. Perry|Bruce D. Perry, M.D., Ph.D]], theorizes that developmental disorders can be caused by early childhood traumatization.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"&gt;Perry, Bruce D. and Szalavitz, Maia. "The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog", Basic Books, 2006, p.2. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works he compares developmental disorders in traumatized children to adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, linking extreme environmental stress to the cause of developmental difficulties.&lt;ref name="Perry, Bruce D 2006, p.2"/&gt; Other stress theories suggest that even small stresses can accumulate to result in emotional, behavioral, or social disorders in children.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Kim John. “Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids”, Ballantine Books, 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|9780345507983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ddduk.org/|title=Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) project|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ddduk.org|publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRae|first=Jeremy F.|last2=Clayton|first2=Stephen|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Tomas W.|last4=Kaplanis|first4=Joanna|last5=Prigmore|first5=Elena|last6=Rajan|first6=Diana|last7=Sifrim|first7=Alejandro|last8=Aitken|first8=Stuart|last9=Akawi|first9=Nadia|title=Prevalence and architecture of de novo mutations in developmental disorders|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature21062|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature21062|volume=542|year=2017|pages=433–438}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested all 20,000 genes in about 4,300 families with children with rare developmental difficulties in the UK and Ireland in order to identify if these difficulties had a genetic cause.They found 14 new developmental disorders caused by spontaneous genetic mutations not found in either parent (such as a fault in the [[CDK13 (gene)|CDK13 gene]]). They estimated that about one in 300 children are born with spontaneous genetic mutations associated with rare developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38691622|title=Child gene study identifies new developmental disorders|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|date=2017-01-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)===
====Diagnosis====
The first diagnosed case of ASD was published in 1943 by American psychiatrist [[Leo Kanner]].  There is a wide range of cases and severity to ASD so it is very hard to detect the first signs of ASD. A diagnosis of ASD can be made accurately before the child is 3 years old, but the diagnosis of ASD is not commonly confirmed until the child is somewhat older. The age of diagnosis can range from 9 months to 14 years, and the mean age is 4 years old in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/hunting-autisms-earliest-clues|title=Hunting for Autism&amp;#039;s Earliest Clues|date=18 September 2013|website=Autism Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average each case of ASD is tested at three different diagnostic centers before confirmed. Early diagnosis of the disorder can diminish familial stress, speed up referral to special educational programs and influence family planning.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"&gt;Dereu, Mieke. (2010). ''Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Flemish Day-Care Centers with the Checklist for Early Signs of Developmental Disorders.'' Springer Science+Business Media. 1247-1258.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the brain====
The cause of ASD is still uncertain. Autism spectrum disorder is a disorder of the cortex, which controls higher functions, sensation, muscle movements, and memory. What is known is that a child with ASD has a pervasive problem with how the brain is wired. The distribution of white matter, the nerve fibers that link diverse parts of the brain, is abnormal. An ASD child’s brain grows at a very rapid rate and is almost fully grown by the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt; Recent fMRI studies have also found altered connectivity within the social brain areas due to ASD and may be related to the social impairments encountered in ASD.&lt;ref name="Gotts et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Brain |year=2012 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=2711-2725 |title= Fractionation of social brain circuits in autism spectrum disorders |author= Gotts S. J., Simmons W. K., Milbury L. A., Wallace G. L., Cox R. W., Martin A. |pmid= 22791801|doi=10.1093/brain/aws160 |pmc=3437021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symptoms====
Still a lot of information is unclear about ASD and the symptoms have a wide range of severity. Signs include impairments in social interactions, communication and repetitive or restricted patterns of interest or behaviors. There are also different symptoms at different ages based on developmental milestones. Children between 0 and 36 months with ASD show a lack of eye contact, seem to be deaf, lack a social smile, do not like being touched or held, have unusual sensory behavior and show a lack of imitation. Children between 12 and 24 months with ASD show a lack of gestures, prefer to be alone, do not point to objects to indicate interest, are easily frustrated with challenges, and lack of functional play. And finally children between the ages 24 to 36 months with ASD show a lack of symbolic play and an unusual interest in certain objects, or moving objects.&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

====Treatment====
There is no cure for ASD and proper treatment depends on the case and what is most struggled with. Autism spectrum disorder is like many other disorders where when diagnosed early, can be better treated. Different types of therapy are helpful such as music therapy and physical therapy. Other treatments include [[auditory integration training|auditory training]], discrete trial training, [[facilitated communication]], and [[sensory integration therapy]].&lt;ref name="Dereu, Mieke 2010"/&gt;

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)===
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] that is characterised by significant levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsiveness. There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive, and combined (which presents as both hyperactive and inattentive subtypes).&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"&gt;Tresco, Katy E. (2004). ''Attention Deficit Disorders: School-Based Interventions.'' Pennsylvania: Bethlehem.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment options====
Treatment of ADHD often includes a combination of psychological, behavioural, pharmaceutical and educational advice and interventions.

Medications commonly used in the treatment of ADHD are primarily [[stimulant]]s such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[lisdexamphetamine]] and non-stimulants such as [[atomoxetine]].

[[SSRI]] antidepressants may be unhelpful, and could worsen symptoms of ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | volume = 58 Suppl 14
 | pages = 14–29
 | year = 1997
 | month = 
 | pmid = 9418743
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However ADHD is often misdiagnosed as depression, particularly when no hyperactivity is present.

====Symptoms====
Symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Many of the behaviors that are associated with ADHD include poor control over actions resulting in disruptive behavior and academic problems. Another area that is affected by these disorders is the social arena for the person with the disorder. Many children that have this disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships and struggle to fit in socially with their peers.&lt;ref name="Tresco Katy E. 2004"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82953">In [[engineering]] and [[science]], '''dimensional analysis''' is the analysis of the relationships between different [[physical quantities]] by identifying their [[base quantity|base quantities]] (such as [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], and [[electric charge]]) and [[units of measure]] (such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. The [[conversion of units]] from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the '''factor-label method''', also known as the '''unit-factor method''', is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of [[algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Goldberg|title=Fundamentals of Chemistry|edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-322104-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James |last=Ogden|title=The Handbook of Chemical Engineering|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87891-982-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/Measurements/dimensionalanalysis.htm |title=Dimensional Analysis or the Factor Label Method |website=Mr Kent's Chemistry Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''physical dimension''' was introduced by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fourier |first=Joseph |title=Theorie analytique de la chaleur |publisher=Firmin Didot |location=Paris |year=1822 |language=fr |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical quantities that are of the same kind (also called ''commensurable'') have the same dimension (length, time, mass) and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as yards and meters).  If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called ''incommensurable''). For example, asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless.

Any physically meaningful [[equation]] (and any [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]) will have the same dimensions on its left and right sides, a property known as ''dimensional homogeneity''. Checking for dimensional homogeneity is a common application of dimensional analysis, serving as a plausibility check on [[Formal proof|derived]] equations and computations.  It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system in the absence of a more rigorous derivation.

== Concrete numbers and base units ==

A lot of parameters and the measurements(m) in the physical sciences and engineering are expressed as a [[concrete number]] – a numerical quantity(q) and a corresponding dimensional unit.  Often a quantity is expressed in terms of several other quantities; for example, speed is a combination of length and time, e.g. 60 miles per hour or 1.4&amp;nbsp;kilometers per second.  Compound relations with "per" are expressed with [[Division (mathematics)|division]], e.g. 60&amp;nbsp;mi/1&amp;nbsp;h.  Other relations can involve [[multiplication]] (often shown with a [[centered dot]] or [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]), powers (like m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for square meters), or combinations thereof.

A set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s for a [[system of measurement]] is a conventionally chosen set of units, none of which can be expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units of the system can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |author=JCGM 200 |year=2012 |title=International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) |edition=3rd |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224356/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, units for [[length]] and [[time]] are normally chosen as base units.  Units for [[volume]], however, can be factored into the base units of length (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), thus they are considered derived or compound units.

Sometimes the names of units obscure the fact that they are derived units. For example, a [[newton (unit)|newton]] (N) is a unit of [[force]], which will have units of mass (kg) times acceleration (m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). The newton is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 N = 1 kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== Percentages and derivatives ===
Percentages are dimensionless quantities, since they are ratios of two quantities with the same dimensions.  In other words, the % sign can be read as "hundredths", since {{nowrap|1=1% = 1/100}}.

Taking a derivative with respect to a quantity adds the dimension of the variable one is differentiating with respect to, in the denominator. Thus:
* position (''x'') has the dimension L (length);
* derivative of position with respect to time (''dx''/''dt'', [[velocity]]) has dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; – length from position, time due to the derivative;
* the second derivative (''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''/''dt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''dx''/''dt'') / ''dt'', [[acceleration]]) has dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.
In economics, one distinguishes between [[stocks and flows]]: a stock has units of "units" (say, widgets or dollars), while a flow is a derivative of a stock, and has units of "units/time" (say, dollars/year).

In some contexts, dimensional quantities are expressed as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) – but one may argue that in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, which indicates that Debt-to-GDP is the number of years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.

== Conversion factor ==
{{Main article|Conversion factor}}
In dimensional analysis, a ratio which converts one unit of measure into another without changing the quantity is called a [[conversion factor]].  For example, kPa and bar are both units of pressure, and {{nowrap|1=100 kPa = 1 bar}}.  The rules of algebra allow both sides of an equation to be divided by the same expression, so this is equivalent to {{nowrap|1=100 kPa / 1 bar = 1}}.  Since any quantity can be multiplied by 1 without changing it, the expression "{{nowrap|100 kPa / 1 bar}}" can be used to convert from bars to kPa by multiplying it with the quantity to be converted, including units.  For example, {{nowrap|1=5 bar × 100 kPa / 1 bar = 500 kPa}} because {{nowrap|1=5 × 100 / 1 = 500}}, and bar/bar cancels out, so {{nowrap|1=5 bar = 500 kPa}}.

== Dimensional homogeneity ==
{{See also|Apples and oranges}}
The most basic rule of dimensional analysis is that of dimensional homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;John Cimbala and Yunus Cengel (2006), ''Essential of Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications'', McGraw-Hill. Chapter 7: "Dimensional Analysis and Modeling", Section 7-2: "Dimensional homogeneity" [http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073138355/student_view0/chapter7/]&lt;/ref&gt; Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be ''compared,'' ''equated,'' ''added,'' or ''subtracted.''
However, the dimensions form an [[abelian group]] under multiplication, so:
:One may take ''ratios'' of ''incommensurable'' quantities (quantities with different dimensions), and ''multiply'' or ''divide'' them.

For example, it makes no sense to ask whether 1 hour is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer, as these have different dimensions, nor to add 1 hour to 1 kilometer.  However, it makes perfect sense to ask whether 1 mile is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer being the same dimension of physical quantity even though the units are different. On the other hand, if an object travels 100&amp;nbsp;km in 2 hours, one may divide these and conclude that the object's average speed was 50&amp;nbsp;km/h.

The rule implies that in a physically meaningful ''expression'' only quantities of the same dimension can be added, subtracted, or compared. For example, if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rat&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; denote, respectively, the mass of some man, the mass of a rat and the length of that man, the dimensionally homogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rat&lt;/sub&gt;}} is meaningful, but the heterogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;}} is meaningless. However, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;/''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; is fine. Thus, dimensional analysis may be used as a [[sanity check]] of physical equations: the two sides of any equation must be commensurable or have the same dimensions.

Even when two physical quantities have identical dimensions, it may nevertheless be meaningless to compare or add them. For example, although [[torque]] and [[energy]] share the dimension {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2}}, they are fundamentally different physical quantities.

To compare, add, or subtract quantities with the same dimensions but expressed in different units, the standard procedure is first to convert them all to the same units. For example, to compare 32 [[metre]]s with 35 [[yard]]s, use 1 yard = 0.9144&amp;nbsp;m to convert 35 yards to 32.004&amp;nbsp;m.

A related principle is that any physical law that accurately describes the real world must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frits J. |last=de Jong|first2=Wilhelm |last2=Quade|title=Dimensional analysis for economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5BRAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=North Holland |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] must hold true whether distance is measured in miles or kilometers.  This principle gives rise to the form that conversion factors must take between units that measure the same dimension: multiplication by a simple constant.  It also ensures equivalence; for example, if two buildings are the same height in feet, then they must be the same height in meters.

== The factor-label method for converting units ==

The factor-label method is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 [[miles per hour]] can be converted to [[meters per second]] by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{10\ \cancel{\text{mile}}}{1\ \cancel{\text{hour}}} \times \frac{1609.344\text{ meter}}{1\ \cancel{\text{mile}}} \times \frac{1\ \cancel{\text{hour}}}{3600\text{ second}} = 4.4704\ \frac{\text{meter}}{\text{second}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that each conversion factor is equivalent to the value of one. For example, starting with 1 mile = 1609.344 meters and dividing both sides of the equation by 1 mile yields 1 mile / 1 mile = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile, which when simplified yields 1 = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile.

So, when the units ''mile'' and ''hour'' are cancelled out and the arithmetic is done, 10 miles per hour converts to 4.4704 meters per second.

As a more complex example, the [[concentration]] of [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[NOx|&lt;math chem&gt;\color{Blue}\ce{NO}_x&lt;/math&gt;]]) in the [[flue gas]] from an industrial [[furnace]] can be converted to a [[mass flow rate]] expressed in grams per hour (i.e., g/h) of &lt;math chem&gt;\ce{NO}_x&lt;/math&gt; by using the following information as shown below:

; NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentration := 10 [[parts per notation|parts per million]] by volume = 10 ppmv = 10 volumes/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; volumes
; NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; molar mass := 46&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol = 46&amp;nbsp;g/mol
; Flow rate of flue gas := 20 cubic meters per minute = 20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min
: The flue gas exits the furnace at 0 °C temperature and 101.325 kPa absolute pressure.
: The [[standard conditions of temperature and pressure#Molar volume of a gas|molar volume]] of a gas at 0 °C temperature and 101.325 kPa is 22.414 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[kmol]].

:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{10\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{NO}_x}}{10^6\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{gas}}} \times
\frac{20\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{gas}}}{1\ \cancel{\ce{minute}}} \times
\frac{60\ \cancel{\ce{minute}}}{1\ \ce{hour}} \times
\frac{1\ \cancel{\ce{kmol\ NO}_x}}{22.414\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{NO}_x}} \times
\frac{46\ \cancel{\ce{kg\ NO}_x}}{1\ \cancel{\ce{kmol\ NO}_x}} \times
\frac{1000\ \ce{g\ NO}_x}{1 \cancel{\ce{kg\ NO}_x}} =
24.63\ \frac{\ce{g\ NO}_x}{\ce{hour}}
&lt;/math&gt;

After canceling out any dimensional units that appear both in the numerators and denominators of the fractions in the above equation, the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 10 ppm&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; converts to mass flow rate of 24.63&amp;nbsp;grams per hour.

=== Checking equations that involve dimensions ===
The factor-label method can also be used on any mathematical equation to check whether or not the dimensional units on the left hand side of the equation are the same as the dimensional units on the right hand side of the equation. Having the same units on both sides of an equation does not ensure that the equation is correct, but having different units on the two sides (when expressed in terms of base units) of an equation implies that the equation is wrong.

For example, check the [[Gas Laws|Universal Gas Law]] equation of {{nowrap|1=''PV'' = ''nRT''}}, when:
* the pressure ''P'' is in pascals (Pa)
* the volume ''V'' is in cubic meters (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* the amount of substance ''n'' is in moles (mol)
* the [[Gas constant|universal gas law constant ''R'']] is 8.3145 Pa⋅m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(mol⋅K)
* the temperature ''T'' is in kelvins (K)

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{Pa.m^3} = \frac{\cancel{\ce{mol}}}{1} \times
\frac{\ce{Pa.m^3}}{\cancel{\ce{mol}}\ \cancel{\ce{K}}} \times \frac{\cancel{\ce{K}}}{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, when the dimensional units appearing in the numerator and denominator of the equation's right hand side are cancelled out, both sides of the equation have the same dimensional units.

=== Limitations ===
The factor-label method can convert only unit quantities for which the units are in a linear relationship intersecting at 0. Most units fit this paradigm. An example for which it cannot be used is the conversion between [[degrees Celsius]] and [[kelvin]]s (or [[degrees Fahrenheit]]). Between degrees Celsius and kelvins, there is a constant difference rather than a constant ratio, while between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio. There is, however, an [[affine transform]] (&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax+b&lt;/math&gt;, rather than a [[linear transform]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax&lt;/math&gt;) between them.

For example, the freezing point of water is 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°F, and a 5&amp;nbsp;°C change is the same as a 9&amp;nbsp;°F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32&amp;nbsp;°F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9&amp;nbsp;°F and multiplies by 5&amp;nbsp;°C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0&amp;nbsp;°C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 212&amp;nbsp;°F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.

Hence, to convert the numerical quantity value of a temperature ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit to a numerical quantity value ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius, this formula may be used:

:''T''[C] = (''T''[F] − 32) × 5/9.

To convert ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius to ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit, this formula may be used:

:''T''[F] = (''T''[C] × 9/5) + 32.

== Applications ==
Dimensional analysis is most often used in physics and chemistry – and in the mathematics thereof – but finds some applications outside of those fields as well.

=== Mathematics ===
A simple application of dimensional analysis to mathematics is in computing the form of the [[N-sphere#Volume of the n-ball|volume of an ''n''-ball]] (the solid ball in ''n'' dimensions), or the area of its surface, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]: being an ''n''-dimensional figure, the volume scales as &lt;math&gt;x^n,&lt;/math&gt; while the surface area, being &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional, scales as &lt;math&gt;x^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the volume of the ''n''-ball in terms of the radius is &lt;math&gt;C_nr^n,&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt;C_n.&lt;/math&gt; Determining the constant takes more involved mathematics, but the form can be deduced and checked by dimensional analysis alone.

=== Finance, economics, and accounting ===
In finance, economics, and accounting, dimensional analysis is most commonly referred to in terms of the [[Stock and flow|distinction between stocks and flows]]. More generally, dimensional analysis is used in interpreting various [[financial ratios]], economics ratios, and accounting ratios.
* For example, the [[P/E ratio]] has dimensions of time (units of years), and can be interpreted as "years of earnings to earn the price paid".
* In economics, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] also has units of years (debt has units of currency, GDP has units of currency/year).
* More surprisingly, [[bond duration]] also has units of years, which can be shown by dimensional analysis, but takes some financial intuition to understand.
* [[Velocity of money]] has units of 1/years (GDP/money supply has units of currency/year over currency): how often a unit of currency circulates per year.
* Interest rates are often expressed as a percentage, but more properly percent per annum, which has dimensions of 1/years.

=== Fluid mechanics ===
In fluid mechanics, dimensional analysis is performed in order to obtain dimensionless [[Buckingham π theorem|Pi terms]] or groups. According to the principles of dimensional analysis, any prototype can be described by a series of these terms or groups that describe the behaviour of the system. Using suitable Pi terms or groups, it is possible to develop a similar set of Pi terms for a model that has the same dimensional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waite |first1=Lee |last2=Fine |first2=Jerry |title=Applied Biofluid Mechanics |date=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-147217-3 |page=260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Pi terms provide a shortcut to developing a model representing a certain prototype. Common dimensionless groups in fluid mechanics include:

* [[Reynolds number]] (Re), generally important in all types of fluid problems:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho\,Vd}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Froude number]] (Fr), modeling flow with a free surface:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{V}{\sqrt{g\,L}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]] (Eu), used in problems in which pressure is of interest:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eu} = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho V^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Mach number]] (M), important high speed flows where the velocity approaches or exceeds the local speed of sound:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \frac{V}{c},&lt;/math&gt; where: {{mvar|c}} is the local speed of sound.

== History ==
The origins of dimensional analysis have been disputed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macagno |first=Enzo O. |title=Historico-critical review of dimensional analysis |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=292 |issue=6 |pages=391–40 |year=1971 |doi= 10.1016/0016-0032(71)90160-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016003271901608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Roberto De A. |title=The origin of dimensional analysis |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=311 |issue=5 |pages=331–7 |year=1981 |doi= 10.1016/0016-0032(81)90475-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016003271901608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] is generally credited with having made important contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mason |first=Stephen Finney |title=A history of the sciences |publisher=Collier Books |location=New York |year=1962 |page=169 |isbn=978-0-02-093400-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the idea that physical laws like [[Newton's second law|{{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}}]] should be independent of the units employed to measure the physical variables. This led to the conclusion that meaningful laws must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was eventually formalized in the [[Buckingham π theorem]]. However, the first application of dimensional analysis has been credited to the Italian scholar [[François Daviet de Foncenex]] (1734–1799). It was published in 1761, 61 years before the publication of Fourier's work.&lt;ref name="Martins 1981"/&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in establishing modern use of dimensional analysis by distinguishing mass, length, and time as fundamental units, while referring to other units as derived.&lt;ref name="maxwell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Roche |first=John J |title=The Mathematics of Measurement: A Critical History |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=203 |isbn=978-0-387-91581-4 |quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiQOqS-Q6EkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ISBN978-0387915814&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Beginning apparently with Maxwell, mass, length and time began to be interpreted as having a privileged fundamental character and all other quantities as derivative, not merely with respect to measurement, but with respect to their physical status as well.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maxwell defined length, time and mass to be "the three fundamental units", he also noted that gravitational mass can be derived from length and time by assuming a form of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in which the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is taken as unity, thereby defining {{nowrap|1=M = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="maxwell2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming a form of [[Coulomb's law]] in which [[Coulomb's constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as unity, Maxwell then determined that the dimensions of an electrostatic unit of charge were {{nowrap|1=Q = L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref name="maxwell3"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, after substituting his {{nowrap|1=M = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} equation for mass, results in charge having the same dimensions as mass, viz. {{nowrap|1=Q = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Dimensional analysis is also used to derive relationships between the physical quantities that are involved in a particular phenomenon that one wishes to understand and characterize.  It was used for the first time {{harv|Pesic|2005}} in this way in 1872 by [[Lord Rayleigh]], who was trying to understand why the sky is blue.  Rayleigh first published the technique in his 1877 book ''The Theory of Sound''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Baron John William Strutt |last=Rayleigh |title=The Theory of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvxYAAAAYAAJ|year=1877|publisher=Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of the word ''dimension'', in Fourier's ''Theorie de la Chaleur'', was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units. For example, acceleration was considered to have the dimension 1 with respect to the unit of length, and the dimension −2 with respect to the unit of time.{{sfnp|Fourier |1822 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 156]}} This was slightly changed by Maxwell, who said the dimensions of acceleration are LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, instead of just the exponents.&lt;ref name="maxwell4"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, volume 1 |year=1873 |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricandmagne01maxwrich#page/n41/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical examples ==
The [[Buckingham π theorem]] describes how every physically meaningful equation involving ''n'' variables can be equivalently rewritten as an equation of {{nowrap|''n'' − ''m''}} dimensionless parameters, where ''m'' is the rank of the dimensional matrix. Furthermore, and most importantly, it provides a method for computing these dimensionless parameters from the given variables.

A dimensional equation can have the dimensions reduced or eliminated through [[nondimensionalization]], which begins with dimensional analysis, and involves scaling quantities by [[characteristic units]] of a system or [[natural units]] of nature. This gives insight into the fundamental properties of the system, as illustrated in the examples below.

=== Definition ===
The dimension of a [[physical quantity]] can be expressed as a product of the basic physical dimensions such as [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]], each raised to a [[Rational number|rational]] [[Exponentiation|power]]. The ''dimension'' of a physical quantity is more fundamental than some ''scale'' [[units of measurement|unit]] used to express the amount of that physical quantity.  For example, ''mass'' is a dimension, while the [[kilogram]] is a particular scale unit chosen to express a quantity of mass. Except for [[natural units]], the choice of scale is cultural and arbitrary.

There are many possible choices of basic physical dimensions. The [[International System of Units|SI standard]] recommends the usage of the following dimensions and corresponding symbols: [[length]] (L), [[mass]] (M), [[time]] (T), [[electric current]] (I), [[absolute temperature]] (Θ), [[amount of substance]] (N) and [[luminous intensity]] (J). The symbols are by convention usually written in [[roman type|roman]] [[sans serif]] typeface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SI Brochure (8th edition). Section 1.3: Dimensions of quantities | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter1/1-3.html | publisher = [[BIPM]] | accessdate = 2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, the dimension of the quantity ''Q'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~{Q} = \mathsf{L}^a\mathsf{M}^b\mathsf{T}^c\mathsf{I}^d\mathsf{\Theta}^e\mathsf{N}^f\mathsf{J}^g&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', ''g'' are the dimensional exponents. Other physical quantities could be defined as the base quantities, as long as they form a [[linearly independent]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. For instance, one could replace the dimension of [[electrical current]] (I) of the SI basis with a dimension of [[electric charge]] (Q), since Q = IT.

As examples, the dimension of the physical quantity [[speed]] ''v'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~v = \frac{\text{length}}{\text{time}} = \frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}} = \mathsf{LT}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and the dimension of the physical quantity [[force (physics)|force]] ''F'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~F = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration} = \text{mass} \times \frac{\text{length}}{\text{time}^2} = \frac{\mathsf{ML}}{\mathsf{T}^2} = \mathsf{MLT}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

The unit chosen to express a physical quantity and its dimension are related, but not identical concepts. The units of a physical quantity are defined by convention and related to some standard; e.g., length may have units of metres, feet, inches, miles or micrometres; but any length always has a dimension of L, no matter what units of length are chosen to express it. Two different units of the same physical quantity have [[conversion of units|conversion factors]] that relate them. For example, 1&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]] = 2.54&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]; in this case (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm/in) is the conversion factor, which is itself dimensionless. Therefore, multiplying by that conversion factor does not change the dimensions of a physical quantity.

There are also physicists that have cast doubt on the very existence of incompatible fundamental dimensions of physical quantity,&lt;ref name="duff"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Duff |first1=M.J. |last2=Okun |first2=L.B. |last3=Veneziano |first3=G. |title=Trialogue on the number of fundamental constants |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=03 |page=023 |date=September 2002 |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2002/03/023 |arxiv=physics/0110060|bibcode = 2002JHEP...03..023D |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this does not invalidate the usefulness of dimensional analysis.

=== Mathematical properties ===
{{Main article|Buckingham π theorem}}

The dimensions that can be formed from a given collection of basic physical dimensions, such as M, L, and T, form an [[abelian group]]: The identity is written as 1; {{nowrap|1=L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, and the inverse to L is 1/L or L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. L raised to any rational power ''p'' is a member of the group, having an inverse of L&lt;sup&gt;−''p''&lt;/sup&gt; or 1/L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;.  The operation of the group is multiplication, having the usual rules for handling exponents ({{nowrap|1=L&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × L&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = L&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

This group can be described as a [[vector space]] over the rational numbers, with for example dimensional symbol M&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponding to the vector {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'', ''k'')}}. When physical measured quantities (be they like-dimensioned or unlike-dimensioned) are multiplied or divided by one other, their dimensional units are likewise multiplied or divided; this corresponds to addition or subtraction in the vector space. When measurable quantities are raised to a rational power, the same is done to the dimensional symbols attached to those quantities; this corresponds to [[scalar multiplication]] in the vector space.

A basis for such a vector space of dimensional symbols is called a set of [[Base quantity|base quantities]], and all other vectors are called derived units. As in any vector space, one may choose different [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]], which yields different systems of units (e.g., [[ampere#Proposed future definition|choosing]] whether the unit for charge is derived from the unit for current, or vice versa).

The group identity 1, the dimension of dimensionless quantities, corresponds to the origin in this vector space.

The set of units of the physical quantities involved in a problem correspond to a set of vectors (or a matrix). The [[Kernel (linear algebra)#nullity|nullity]] describes some number (e.g., ''m'') of ways in which these vectors can be combined to produce a zero vector. These correspond to producing (from the measurements) a number of dimensionless quantities, {π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., π&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}. (In fact these ways completely span the null subspace of another different space, of powers of the measurements.) Every possible way of multiplying (and [[Exponent (mathematics)|exponentiating]]) together the measured quantities to produce something with the same units as some derived quantity ''X'' can be expressed in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;X = \prod_{i=1}^m (\pi_i)^{k_i}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, every possible [[dimensional analysis#Commensurability|commensurate]] equation for the physics of the system can be rewritten in the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(\pi_1,\pi_2, ..., \pi_m)=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing this restriction can be a powerful tool for obtaining new insight into the system.

=== Mechanics ===
The dimension of physical quantities of interest in [[mechanics]] can be expressed in terms of base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a [[change of basis]]. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must [[Linear span|span]] the space, and be [[linearly independent]].

For example, F, L, M form a set of fundamental dimensions because they form a basis that is equivalent to M, L, T: the former can be expressed as [F = ML/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;], L, M, while the latter can be expressed as M, L, [T = (ML/F)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;].

On the other hand, length, velocity and time {{nowrap|(L, V, T)}} do not form a set of as base dimensions, for two reasons:
* There is no way to obtain mass – or anything derived from it, such as force – without introducing another base dimension (thus, they do not ''span the space'').
* Velocity, being expressible in terms of length and time (V = L/T), is redundant (the set is not ''linearly independent'').

=== Other fields of physics and chemistry ===
Depending on the field of physics, it may be advantageous to choose one or another extended set of dimensional symbols. In electromagnetism, for example, it may be useful to use dimensions of M, L, T, and Q, where Q represents the dimension of [[electric charge]].  In [[thermodynamics]], the base set of dimensions is often extended to include a dimension for temperature, Θ.  In chemistry, the [[amount of substance]] (the number of molecules divided by the [[Avogadro constant]], ≈ {{val|6.02|e=23|u=mol-1}}) is defined as a base dimension, N, as well.
In the interaction of [[relativistic plasma]] with strong laser pulses, a dimensionless [[relativistic similarity parameter]], connected with the symmetry properties of the collisionless [[Vlasov equation]], is constructed from the plasma-, electron- and critical-densities in addition to the electromagnetic vector potential. The choice of the dimensions or even the number of dimensions to be used in different fields of physics is to some extent arbitrary, but consistency in use and ease of communications are common and necessary features.

=== Polynomials and transcendental functions ===
[[Scalar (physics)|Scalar]] arguments to [[transcendental function]]s such as [[Exponential function|exponential]], [[Trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[logarithm]]ic functions, or to [[inhomogeneous polynomials]], must be [[dimensionless number|dimensionless quantities]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  (Note: this requirement is somewhat relaxed in Siano's orientational analysis described below, in which the square of certain dimensioned quantities are dimensionless.)

&lt;!--see discussion page/transcendental functions This requirement is clear when one observes the [[Taylor expansion]]s for these functions (a sum of various powers of the function argument). For example, the logarithm of 3&amp;nbsp;kg is undefined even though the logarithm of&amp;nbsp;3 is nearly&amp;nbsp;0.477. An attempt to compute ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg would produce, if one naively took ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg to mean the dimensionally meaningless "ln&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;kg)",

: &lt;math&gt;2\,\mathrm{kg} - \frac{4\,\mathrm{kg}^2}{2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

which is dimensionally incompatible – the sum has no meaningful dimension – requiring the argument of transcendental functions to be dimensionless.

Another way to understand this problem is that the different coefficients ''scale'' differently under change of units – were one to reconsider this in grams as "ln&amp;nbsp;3000&amp;nbsp;g" instead of "ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg", one could compute ln&amp;nbsp;3000, but in terms of the Taylor series, the degree 1 term would scale by 1000, the degree-2 term would scale by 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so forth – the overall output would not scale as a particular dimension.
--&gt;
While most mathematical identities about dimensionless numbers translate in a straightforward manner to dimensional quantities, care must be taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a − log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for dimensionless numbers a and b, but it does ''not'' hold if a and b are dimensional, because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.

Similarly, while one can evaluate [[monomials]] (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) of dimensional quantities, one cannot evaluate polynomials of mixed degree with dimensionless coefficients on dimensional quantities: for ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the expression (3&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; makes sense (as an area), while for ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'', the expression (3&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m does not make sense.

However, polynomials of mixed degree can make sense if the coefficients are suitably chosen physical quantities that are not dimensionless.  For example,

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-32\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}^2}\right) \cdot t^2 + \left(500\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}\right) \cdot t. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the height to which an object rises in time&amp;nbsp;''t'' if the acceleration of gravity is 32&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second and the initial upward speed is 500&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second.  It is not even necessary for ''t'' to be in ''seconds''.  For example, suppose ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;minutes.  Then the first term would be

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-32\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}^2}\right) \cdot (0.01 \text{ minute})^2 \\[10pt]
  ={} &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot -32 \cdot \left(0.01^2\right) \left(\frac{\text{minute}}{\text{second}}\right)^2 \cdot \text{foot} \\[10pt]
  ={} &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot -32 \cdot \left(0.01^2\right) \cdot 60^2 \cdot \text{foot}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Incorporating units ===
The value of a dimensional physical quantity ''Z'' is written as the product of a [[Units of measurement|unit]] [''Z''] within the dimension and a dimensionless numerical factor, ''n''.&lt;ref name=Pisanty13&gt;For a review of the different conventions in use see: {{cite web |url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/77690 |title=Square bracket notation for dimensions and units: usage and conventions |last1=Pisanty |first1= E|date=2013-09-17 |website=Physics Stack Exchange  |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n \times [Z] = n [Z]&lt;/math&gt;

When like-dimensioned quantities are added or subtracted or compared, it is convenient to express them in consistent units so that the numerical values of these quantities may be directly added or subtracted. But, in concept, there is no problem adding quantities of the same dimension expressed in different units. For example, 1 meter added to 1 foot is a length, but one cannot derive that length by simply adding 1 and 1. A [[Conversion of units|conversion factor]], which is a ratio of like-dimensioned quantities and is equal to the dimensionless unity, is needed:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \ \mbox{ft} = 0.3048 \ \mbox{m} \ &lt;/math&gt;  is identical to &lt;math&gt; 1 = \frac{0.3048 \ \mbox{m}}{1 \ \mbox{ft}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt; 0.3048 \ \frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{ft}} &lt;/math&gt; is identical to the dimensionless 1, so multiplying by this conversion factor changes nothing. Then when adding two quantities of like dimension, but expressed in different units, the appropriate conversion factor, which is essentially the dimensionless 1, is used to convert the quantities to identical units so that their numerical values can be added or subtracted.

Only in this manner is it meaningful to speak of adding like-dimensioned quantities of differing units.

=== Position vs displacement ===
{{Main article|Affine space}}
Some discussions of dimensional analysis implicitly describe all quantities as mathematical vectors. (In mathematics scalars are considered a special case of vectors{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}; vectors can be added to or subtracted from other vectors, and, inter alia, multiplied or divided by scalars. If a vector is used to define a position, this assumes an implicit point of reference: an [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. While this is useful and often perfectly adequate, allowing many important errors to be caught, it can fail to model certain aspects of physics. A more rigorous approach requires distinguishing between position and displacement (or moment in time versus duration, or absolute temperature versus temperature change).

Consider points on a line, each with a position with respect to a given origin, and distances among them. Positions and displacements all have units of length, but their meaning is not interchangeable:
* adding two displacements should yield a new displacement (walking ten paces then twenty paces gets you thirty paces forward),
* adding a displacement to a position should yield a new position (walking one block down the street from an intersection gets you to the next intersection),
* subtracting two positions should yield a displacement,
* but one may ''not'' add two positions.
This illustrates the subtle distinction between ''affine'' quantities (ones modeled by an [[affine space]], such as position) and ''vector'' quantities (ones modeled by a [[vector space]], such as displacement).
* Vector quantities may be added to each other, yielding a new vector quantity, and a vector quantity may be added to a suitable affine quantity (a vector space ''[[group action|acts on]]'' an affine space), yielding a new affine quantity.
* Affine quantities cannot be added, but may be subtracted, yielding ''relative'' quantities which are vectors, and these ''relative differences'' may then be added to each other or to an affine quantity.

Properly then, positions have dimension of ''affine'' length, while displacements have dimension of ''vector'' length. To assign a number to an ''affine'' unit, one must not only choose a unit of measurement, but also a [[Origin (mathematics)|point of reference]], while to assign a number to a ''vector'' unit only requires a unit of measurement.

Thus some physical quantities are better modeled by vectorial quantities while others tend to require affine representation, and the distinction is reflected in their dimensional analysis.

This distinction is particularly important in the case of temperature, for which the numeric value of [[absolute zero]] is not the origin 0 in some scales. For absolute zero,
: 0 K = −273.15 °C = −459.67 °F = 0 °R,
but for temperature differences,
: 1 K = 1 °C ≠ 1 °F = 1 °R.
(Here °R refers to the [[Rankine scale]], not the [[Réaumur scale]]).
Unit conversion for temperature differences is simply a matter of multiplying by, e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −272.15&amp;nbsp;°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Orientation and frame of reference ===
Similar to the issue of a point of reference is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a ''direction''. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a [[frame of reference]].

This leads to the [[#Extensions|extensions]] discussed below, namely Huntley's directed dimensions and Siano's orientational analysis.

== Examples ==

=== A simple example: period of a harmonic oscillator ===
What is the period of [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillation]] {{mvar|T}} of a mass {{mvar|m}} attached to an ideal linear spring with spring constant {{mvar|k}} suspended in gravity of strength {{mvar|g}}? That period is the solution for {{mvar|T}} of some dimensionless equation in the variables {{mvar|T}}, {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|k}}, and {{mvar|g}}.
The four quantities have the following dimensions:  {{mvar|T}}  [T];  {{mvar|m}}  [M]; {{mvar|k}} [M/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]; and  {{mvar|g}} [L/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]. From these we can form only one dimensionless product of powers of our chosen variables, &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;T^2 k/m&lt;/math&gt; {{nowrap|1=[T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · M/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / M = 1]}}, and putting &lt;math&gt;G_1 = C&lt;/math&gt; for some dimensionless constant {{mvar|C}} gives the dimensionless equation sought.  The dimensionless product of powers of variables is sometimes referred to as a dimensionless group of variables; here the term "group" means "collection" rather than mathematical [[Group (mathematics)|group]].  They are often called [[dimensionless number]]s as well.

Note that the variable {{mvar|g}} does not occur in the group. It is easy to see that it is impossible to form a dimensionless product of powers that combines {{mvar|g}} with {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|m}}, and {{mvar|T}}, because {{mvar|g}} is the only quantity that involves the dimension L. This implies that in this problem the {{mvar|g}} is irrelevant. Dimensional analysis can sometimes yield strong statements about the ''irrelevance'' of some quantities in a problem, or the need for additional parameters. If we have chosen enough variables to properly describe the problem, then from this argument we can conclude that the period of the mass on the spring is independent of {{mvar|g}}: it is the same on the earth or the moon. The equation demonstrating the existence of a product of powers for our problem can be written in an entirely equivalent way:  &lt;math&gt;T = \kappa \sqrt\tfrac{m}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, for some dimensionless constant κ (equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt; from the original dimensionless equation).

When faced with a case where dimensional analysis rejects a variable ({{mvar|g}}, here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, another possibility is that the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a dimensionless quantity. That is, however, not the case here.

When dimensional analysis yields only one dimensionless group, as here, there are no unknown functions, and the solution is said to be "complete" – although it still may involve unknown dimensionless constants, such as {{mvar|κ}}.

=== A more complex example: energy of a vibrating wire ===
Consider the case of a vibrating wire of [[length]] ''ℓ'' (L) vibrating with an [[amplitude]] ''A'' (L).  The wire has a [[linear density]] ''ρ'' (M/L) and is under [[Tension (physics)|tension]] ''s'' (ML/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and we want to know the [[energy]] ''E'' (ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the wire.  Let ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''π''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two dimensionless products of [[Power (mathematics)|powers]] of the variables chosen, given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \pi_1 &amp;= \frac{E}{As} \\
  \pi_2 &amp;= \frac{\ell}{A}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The linear density of the wire is not involved. The two groups found can be combined into an equivalent form as an equation
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(\frac{E}{As}, \frac{\ell}{A}\right) = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is some unknown function, or, equivalently as
:&lt;math&gt;E = As f\left(\frac{\ell}{A}\right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is some other unknown function.  Here the unknown function implies that our solution is now incomplete, but dimensional analysis has given us something that may not have been obvious: the energy is proportional to the first power of the tension.  Barring further analytical analysis, we might proceed to experiments to discover the form for the unknown function ''f''.  But our experiments are simpler than in the absence of dimensional analysis.  We'd perform none to verify that the energy is proportional to the tension.  Or perhaps we might guess that the energy is proportional to ''ℓ'', and so infer that {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''ℓs''}}.  The power of dimensional analysis as an aid to experiment and forming hypotheses becomes evident.

The power of dimensional analysis really becomes apparent when it is applied to situations, unlike those given above, that are more complicated, the set of variables involved are not apparent, and the underlying equations hopelessly complex.  Consider, for example, a small pebble sitting on the bed of a river.  If the river flows fast enough, it will actually raise the pebble and cause it to flow along with the water.  At what critical velocity will this occur?  Sorting out the guessed variables is not so easy as before.  But dimensional analysis can be a powerful aid in understanding problems like this, and is usually the very first tool to be applied to complex problems where the underlying equations and constraints are poorly understood. In such cases, the answer may depend on a [[dimensionless number]] such as the [[Reynolds number]], which may be interpreted by dimensional analysis.

=== A third example: demand versus capacity for a rotating disc ===
Consider the case of a thin, solid, parallel-sided rotating disc of axial thickness ''t'' (L) and radius ''R'' (L).  The disc has a density ''ρ'' (M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), rotates at an angular velocity ''ω'' (T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and this leads to a stress ''S'' (ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the material.  There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the plane stress constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid.  As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the plane stress solution breaks down.  If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of plane strain will occur.  However, if this is not the case then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case.  An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables.  Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) non-dimensional groups:

: demand/capacity = ''ρR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''S''
: thickness/radius or aspect ratio = ''t''/''R''

[[File:Dimensional analysis 01.jpg|thumb|Dimensional analysis and numerical experiments for a rotating disc]]

Through the use of numerical experiments using, for example, the finite element method, the nature of the relationship between the two non-dimensional groups can be obtained as shown in the figure.  As this problem only involves two non-dimensional groups, the complete picture is provided in a single plot and this can be used as a design/assessment chart for rotating discs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsay|first1=Angus|title=Dimensional Analysis and Numerical Experiments for a Rotating Disc|url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/technical-notes/dimensional-analysis--numerical-experiments-for-a-rotating-disc/|website=Ramsay Maunder Associates|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

=== Huntley's extension: directed dimensions ===
Huntley {{harv|Huntley|1967}} has pointed out that it is sometimes productive to refine our concept of dimension. Two possible refinements are:
* The magnitude of the components of a vector are to be considered dimensionally distinct. For example, rather than an undifferentiated length dimension L, we may have L&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; represent dimension in the x-direction, and so forth. This requirement stems ultimately from the requirement that each component of a physically meaningful equation (scalar, vector, or tensor) must be dimensionally consistent.
* Mass as a measure of quantity is to be considered dimensionally distinct from mass as a measure of inertia.

As an example of the usefulness of the first refinement, suppose we wish to calculate the [[trajectory#Range and height|distance a cannonball travels]] when fired with a vertical velocity component &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; and a horizontal velocity component &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming it is fired on a flat surface. Assuming no use of directed lengths, the quantities of interest are then &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt;, both dimensioned as LT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, {{mvar|R}}, the distance travelled, having dimension L, and {{mvar|g}} the downward acceleration of gravity, with dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

With these four quantities, we may conclude that the equation for the range {{mvar|R}} may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;R \propto V_\text{x}^a\,V_\text{y}^b\,g^c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Or dimensionally

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L} = \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^{a+b} \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^c\,&lt;/math&gt;

from which we may deduce that &lt;math&gt;a + b + c = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a + b + 2c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which leaves one exponent undetermined. This is to be expected since we have two fundamental dimensions L and T, and four parameters, with one equation.

If, however, we use directed length dimensions, then &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt; will be dimensioned as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, {{mvar|R}} as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|g}} as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The dimensional equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathsf{L}_\mathrm{x} =
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{x}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^a
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{y}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^b 
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{y}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^c
&lt;/math&gt;

and we may solve completely as &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = -1&lt;/math&gt;. The increase in deductive power gained by the use of directed length dimensions is apparent.

In a similar manner, it is sometimes found useful (e.g., in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics) to distinguish between mass as a measure of inertia (inertial mass), and mass as a measure of quantity (substantial mass). For example, consider the derivation of [[Poiseuille's Law]]. We wish to find the rate of mass flow of a viscous fluid through a circular pipe. Without drawing distinctions between inertial and substantial mass we may choose as the relevant variables
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; the mass flow rate with dimension MT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;p_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; the pressure gradient along the pipe with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} the density with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|&amp;eta;}} the dynamic fluid viscosity with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|r}} the radius of the pipe with dimension L

There are three fundamental variables so the above five equations will yield two dimensionless variables which we may take to be &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 = \dot{m}/\eta r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 = p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^5/\dot{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; and we may express the dimensional equation as

:&lt;math&gt;C = \pi_1\pi_2^a = \left(\frac{\dot{m}}{\eta r}\right)\left(\frac{p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^5}{\dot{m}^2}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|C}} and {{mvar|a}} are undetermined constants. If we draw a distinction between inertial mass with dimension &lt;math&gt;M_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and substantial mass with dimension &lt;math&gt;M_\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;, then mass flow rate and density will use substantial mass as the mass parameter, while the pressure gradient and coefficient of viscosity will use inertial mass. We now have four fundamental parameters, and one dimensionless constant, so that the dimensional equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^4}{\eta \dot{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where now only {{mvar|C}} is an undetermined constant (found to be equal to &lt;math&gt;\pi/8&lt;/math&gt; by methods outside of dimensional analysis). This equation may be solved for the mass flow rate to yield [[Poiseuille's law]].

=== Siano's extension: orientational analysis ===

Huntley's extension has some serious drawbacks:

* It does not deal well with vector equations involving the ''[[cross product]],''
* nor does it handle well the use of ''angles'' as physical variables.

It also is often quite difficult to assign the L, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|z}}&lt;/sub&gt;, symbols to the physical variables involved in the problem of interest. He invokes a procedure that involves the "symmetry" of the physical problem. This is often very difficult to apply reliably: It is unclear as to what parts of the problem that the notion of "symmetry" is being invoked. Is it the symmetry of the physical body that forces are acting upon, or to the points, lines or areas at which forces are being applied? What if more than one body is involved with different symmetries?

Consider the spherical bubble attached to a cylindrical tube, where one wants the flow rate of air as a function of the pressure difference in the two parts. What are the Huntley extended dimensions of the viscosity of the air contained in the connected parts? What are the extended dimensions of the pressure of the two parts? Are they the same or different? These difficulties are responsible for the limited application of Huntley's addition to real problems.

Angles are, by convention, considered to be dimensionless variables, and so the use of angles as physical variables in dimensional analysis can give less meaningful results. As an example, consider the projectile problem mentioned above. Suppose that, instead of the x-  and y-components of the initial velocity, we had chosen the magnitude of the velocity {{mvar|v}} and the angle {{mvar|θ}} at which the projectile was fired. The angle is, by convention, considered to be dimensionless, and the magnitude of a vector has no directional quality, so that no dimensionless variable can be composed of the four variables {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|R}}, and {{mvar|θ}}. Conventional analysis will correctly give the powers of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|v}}, but will give no information concerning the dimensionless angle {{mvar|θ}}.

{{harvs|txt=yes|last=Siano|year1=1985-I|year2=1985-II}} has suggested that the directed dimensions of Huntley be replaced by using ''orientational symbols'' {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} to denote vector directions, and an orientationless symbol 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, Huntley's L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; becomes L&amp;thinsp;1&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; with L specifying the dimension of length, and {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} specifying the orientation. Siano further shows that the orientational symbols have an algebra of their own.  Along with the requirement that {{math|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the following multiplication table for the orientation symbols results:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc}
                         &amp; \mathbf{1_0}
                                       &amp; \mathbf{1_\text{x}}
                                                    &amp; \mathbf{1_\text{y}}
                                                                 &amp; \mathbf{1_\text{z}} \\
     \hline
     \mathbf{1_0}        &amp;  1_0        &amp; 1_\text{x} &amp; 1_\text{y} &amp; 1_\text{z}          \\
     \mathbf{1_\text{x}} &amp;  1_\text{x} &amp; 1_0        &amp; 1_\text{z} &amp; 1_\text{y}          \\
     \mathbf{1_\text{y}} &amp;  1_\text{y} &amp; 1_\text{z} &amp; 1_0        &amp; 1_\text{x}          \\
     \mathbf{1_\text{z}} &amp;  1_\text{z} &amp; 1_\text{y} &amp; 1_\text{x} &amp; 1_0
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the orientational symbols form a group (the [[Klein four-group]] or "Viergruppe"). In this system, scalars always have the same orientation as the identity element, independent of the "symmetry of the problem".  Physical quantities that are vectors have the orientation expected:  a force or a velocity in the z-direction has the orientation of {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  For angles, consider an angle {{mvar|θ}} that lies in the z-plane.  Form a right triangle in the z-plane with {{mvar|θ}} being one of the acute angles.  The side of the right triangle adjacent to the angle then has an orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the side opposite has an orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Then, since {{math|1=tan(''θ'') = 1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = ''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...}} we conclude that an angle in the xy-plane must have an orientation {{math|1=1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is not unreasonable.  Analogous reasoning forces the conclusion that {{math|1=sin(''θ'')}} has orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} while {{math|cos(''θ'')}} has orientation 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  These are different, so one concludes (correctly), for example, that there are no solutions of physical equations that are of the form {{math|''a'' cos(''θ'') + ''b'' sin(''θ'')}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real scalars. Note that an expression such as &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta+\pi/2)=\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is not dimensionally inconsistent since it is a special case of the sum of angles formula and should properly be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \sin\left(a\,1_\text{z} + b\,1_\text{z}\right) =
    \sin\left(a\,1_\text{z}) \cos(b\,1_\text{z}\right) +
    \sin\left(b\,1_\text{z}) \cos(a\,1_\text{z}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

which for &lt;math&gt;a = \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta\,1_\text{z} + [\pi/2]\,1_\text{z}) = 1_\text{z}\cos(\theta\,1_\text{z})&lt;/math&gt;. Physical quantities may be expressed as complex numbers (e.g. &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;) which imply that the complex quantity {{mvar|i}} has an orientation equal to that of the angle it is associated with ({{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the above example).

The assignment of orientational symbols to physical quantities and the requirement that physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually be used in a way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems.  In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can.  If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral.  This puts it into "normal form".  The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information is that one of the powers of a certain variable is even or odd.

As an example, for the projectile problem, using orientational symbols, θ, being in the xy-plane will thus have dimension {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the range of the projectile {{mvar|R}} will be of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;R = g^a\,v^b\,\theta^c\text{ which means }\mathsf{L}\,1_\mathrm{x} \sim
\left(\frac{\mathsf{L}\,1_\text{y}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^a \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^b\,1_\mathsf{z}^c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Dimensional homogeneity will now correctly yield {{math|1=''a'' = −1}} and {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}, and orientational homogeneity requires that {{mvar|c}} be an odd integer. In fact the required function of theta will be {{math|sin(''θ'')cos(''θ'')}} which is a series of odd powers of {{mvar|θ}}.

It is seen that the Taylor series of {{math|sin(''θ'')}} and {{math|cos(''θ'')}} are orientationally homogeneous using the above multiplication table, while expressions like {{math|cos(''θ'') + sin(''θ'')}} and {{math|exp(''θ'')}} are not, and are (correctly) deemed unphysical.

It should be clear that the multiplication rule used for the orientational symbols is not the same as that for the cross product of two vectors.  The cross product of two identical vectors is zero, while the product of two identical orientational symbols is the identity element.

== Dimensionless concepts ==

=== Constants ===
{{Main article|Dimensionless quantity}}
The dimensionless constants that arise in the results obtained, such as the C in the Poiseuille's Law problem and the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; in the spring problems discussed above, come from a more detailed analysis of the underlying physics and often arise from integrating some differential equation.  Dimensional analysis itself has little to say about these constants, but it is useful to know that they very often have a magnitude of order unity.  This observation can allow one to sometimes make "[[back of the envelope]]" calculations about the phenomenon of interest, and therefore be able to more efficiently design experiments to measure it, or to judge whether it is important, etc.

=== Formalisms ===
Paradoxically, dimensional analysis can be a useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the [[Ising model]] can be used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As we approach the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on "dimensional grounds" that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be &lt;math&gt;\sim 1/\xi^{d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the lattice.

It has been argued by some physicists, e.g., [[Michael Duff (physicist)|M. J. Duff]],&lt;ref name="duff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Duff |first=M.J. |eprint=hep-th/0208093v3 |title=Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants |version= |date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the laws of physics are inherently dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, there was no way to relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: ''[[Speed of light|c]]'', ''[[Planck constant|ħ]]'', and ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'', in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.

Just as in the case of critical properties of lattice models, one can recover the results of dimensional analysis in the appropriate scaling limit; e.g., dimensional analysis in mechanics can be derived by reinserting the constants ''ħ'', ''c'', and ''G'' (but we can now consider them to be dimensionless) and demanding that a nonsingular relation between quantities exists in the limit &lt;math&gt;c\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\hbar\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G\rightarrow  0&lt;/math&gt;. In problems involving a gravitational field the latter limit should be taken such that the field stays finite.

=== Natural units ===
{{main article|Natural units}}

If {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and a suitable fixed unit of energy is chosen, then all quantities of length ''L'', mass ''M'' and time ''T'' can be expressed (dimensionally) as a power of energy ''E'', because length, mass and time can be expressed using speed ''v'', action ''S'', and energy ''E'':&lt;ref name=Martin08/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{E}{v^2},\quad L = \frac{Sv}{E}, \quad t = \frac{S}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

though speed and action are dimensionless ({{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''c'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}) – so the only remaining quantity with dimension is energy. In terms of powers of dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{E}^n = \mathsf{M}^p\mathsf{L}^q\mathsf{T}^r = \mathsf{E}^{p-q-r} &lt;/math&gt;

This is particularly useful in particle physics and high energy physics, in which case the energy unit is the electron volt (eV). Dimensional checks and estimates become very simple in this system.

However, if electric charges and currents are involved, another unit to be fixed is for electric charge, normally the [[electron charge]] ''e'' though other choices are possible.

The [[1996 farm bill]] (P.L. 104-127) reauthorized and streamlined the program. 

The program was also reauthorized in the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 6203).  

DLT is administered by the [[Rural Utilities Service]].

An '''ecosystem model''' is an [[abstract model|abstract]], usually [[mathematical model|mathematical]], representation of an [[ecological system]] (ranging in scale from an individual [[population]], to an [[ecological community]], or even an entire [[biome]]), which is studied to better understand the real system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, Charles A.S.|author2=Day, John W.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecosystem Modeling in Theory and Practice: An Introduction with Case Histories|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87081-216-3|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data gathered from the field, ecological relationships—such as the relation of sunlight and water availability to [[photosynthetic]] rate, or that between [[predator and prey]] populations—are derived, and these are combined to form [[ecosystem]] models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as [[natural resource]] management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/0-387-21563-8_1 |chapter=Opportunities for Using Ecological Models for Resource Management |title=Ecological Modeling for Resource Management |pages=3–19 |year=2003 |last1=Dale |first1=Virginia H. |isbn=978-0-387-95493-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecotoxicology]] and [[environmental health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pastorok, Robert A.|chapter=Introduction|title=Ecological modeling in risk assessment: chemical effects on populations, ecosystems, and landscapes|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56670-574-5|page=7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forbes, Valery E.|chapter=The Role of Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessments Seen From an Academic's Point of View|editor=Thorbek, Pernille|title=Ecological Models for Regulatory Risk Assessments of Pesticides: Developing a Strategy for the Future|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4398-0511-4|page=89|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYzT5ZIy2NEC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palladino, Paolo|chapter=Ecological Modeling and Integrated Pest Management|title=Entomology, ecology and agriculture: the making of scientific careers in North America, 1885-1985|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1996|isbn=978-3-7186-5907-4|page=153|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0JgLY_0QlWEC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wildlife conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millspaugh, Joshua J.|chapter=General Principles for Developing Landscape Models for Wildlife Conservation|title=Models for planning wildlife conservation in large landscapes|publisher=Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-12-373631-4|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLtcJs2f810C&amp;pg=PA1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological modelling has even been applied to archaeology with varying degrees of success, for example, combining with archaeological models to explain the diversity and mobility of stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2013.08.004 |title=Multiple Optima in Hoabinhian flaked stone artefact palaeoeconomics and palaeoecology at two archaeological sites in Northwest Thailand |journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=553–564 |year=2013 |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of models==
There are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) ''analytic'' models and (2) ''simulation'' / ''computational'' models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|title=Handbook of environmental and ecological modeling|publisher=CRC Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56670-202-7|pages=403–404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGJ1Jm6txQEC&amp;pg=PA403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant, William Edward|author2=Swannack, Todd M.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecological modeling: a common-sense approach to theory and practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-6168-8|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3qUumawqEoC&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecopath]] is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model [[marine ecosystems]]. It is widely used by marine and fisheries scientists as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jmsc.2000.0726 |title=Ecopath, Ecosim, and Ecospace as tools for evaluating ecosystem impact of fisheries |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=697–706 |year=2000 |last1=Pauly |first1=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.09.003 |title=Ecopath with Ecosim: Methods, capabilities and limitations |journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=172 |issue=2–4 |pages=109–139 |year=2004 |last1=Christensen |first1=Villy |last2=Walters |first2=Carl J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen V (2009) [ftp://ftp.fisheries.ubc.ca/FCRR/17-3.pdf#page=166  "The future of Ecopath"] In: Palomares, MLD, Morissette L, Cisneros-Montemayor A, Varkey D, Coll M, Piroddi C (Eds), ''Ecopath 25 Years Conference Proceedings: Extended Abstracts'', Fisheries Centre Research Reports '''17'''(3): 159–160.

==Model design==
[[File:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the Silver Springs model (Odum, 1971). Note the aggregation into functional groups such as "herbivores" or "decomposers".&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). Environment, Power, and Society. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soetaert, Karline|author2=Herman, Peter M.J.|last-author-amp=yes|title=A practical guide to ecological modelling: using R as a simulation platform|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4020-8623-6|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this [[complexity]], [[ecosystem]] models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillman, Michael|author2=Hails, Rosemary|last-author-amp=yes|title=An introduction to ecological modelling: putting practice into theory|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|isbn=978-0-632-03634-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U8Uf10TpyIC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Felix|chapter=What are the General Conditions Under Which Ecological Models Can Be Applied|editor=Jopp, Fred|display-editors=etal|title=Modeling Complex Ecological Dynamics|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-05028-2|pages=13–14|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEgIo-BOzF0C&amp;pg=PA13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of [[state variable]]s and [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]] that describe the nature of the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5733/afin.052.0112 |title=Functional Feeding Groups as a Taxonomic Surrogate for a Grassland Arthropod Assemblage |journal=African Invertebrates |volume=52 |pages=217–228 |year=2011 |last1=Buschke |first1=Falko T. |last2=Seaman |first2=Maitland T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of [[space]] used.  Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. ''Spatially explicit models'' (also called "spatially distributed" or "landscape" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCallum, Hamish|chapter=Spatial Parameters|title=Population parameters: estimation for ecological models|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-86542-740-2|page=184|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFKIbI4cLUEC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tenhunen, John D.|display-editors=etal|title=Ecosystem approaches to landscape management in Central Europe|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-3-540-67267-8|pages=586–587|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSanEfM25uAC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ball, George L.|chapter=Ecological modeling|title=Encyclopedia of environmental science|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=978-0-412-74050-3|pages=154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0iX2z48qkUC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sklar, Fred H.|author2=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=The Use and Uncertainties of Spatial Data for Landscape Models: An Overview with Examples from the Florida Everglades|editor=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|title=Spatial uncertainty in ecology: implications for remote sensing and GIS applications|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-387-95129-4|page=15|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbczI9mw2v8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
After construction, models are ''validated'' to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model's output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|author2=Bendoricchio, G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Fundamentals of ecological modelling|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|isbn=978-0-08-044028-6|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geNPWdVBbDYC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pastorok, Robert A.|chapter=Introduction|title=Ecological modeling in risk assessment: chemical effects on populations, ecosystems, and landscapes|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56670-574-5|page=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shifley, S.R.|editor=Millspaugh, Joshua J.|editor2=Thompson, Frank Richard|chapter=Validation of Landscape-Scale Decision Support Models That Predict Vegetation and Wildlife Dynamics|title=Models for planning wildlife conservation in large landscapes|publisher=Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-12-373631-4|page=419|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLtcJs2f810C&amp;pg=PA419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voinov, Alexey|title=Systems Science and Modeling for Ecological Economics|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-372583-7|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nol8DOt-qe8C&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuter, Hauke|chapter=How Valid Are Model Results?

One of the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Earlier work on [[smallpox]] by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[human overpopulation]] by [[Thomas Malthus]] predates that of Lotka and Volterra, but is not strictly ecological in nature&lt;/ref&gt; and most well-known, ecological models is the [[predation|predator-prey]] model of [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1925)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lotka | first=A.

Volterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in [[fish]] and [[shark]] populations observed in the [[Adriatic Sea]] after the [[First World War]] (when [[fishery|fishing]] was curtailed).  However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Begon | first=M. | last2=Harper | first2=J. L. | last3=Townsend | first3=C. R. | year=1988 | title=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities | publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications Inc., Oxford, UK | title-link=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models:  modelled biological [[population]]s experience [[Malthusian growth model|growth]], interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or [[Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|competitors]]) and suffer [[mortality rate|mortality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80211-5 |title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=311–326 |year=1989 |last1=Arditi |first1=Roger |last2=Ginzburg |first2=Lev R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R.

Enquiry into the '''evolution of ageing''' aims to explain why survival, reproductive success, and functioning of almost all living organisms decline at old age. Leading hypotheses &lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkwood|first1=TB|title=Evolution of ageing.|journal=Nature|date=24 November 1977|volume=270|issue=5635|pages=301–4|pmid=593350|doi=10.1038/270301a0|bibcode=1977Natur.270..301K}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that a combination of limited resources, and an increasing risk of death by environmental causes determine an "optimal" level of '''self-maintenance''', i.e. the repair of molecular and cellular level damage that accumulates over time. Allocation of limited resources into such damage repair is traded-off with investment into reproduction, which determines the individual's Darwinian fitness. In consequence, traits that improve an individual's performance in early life are favored by selection, even if the same traits have negative effects late in life, when the individual has already passed on their genes to the next generation.

==History==
[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre to make room for the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a [[teleological]] or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a ''purpose'' for ageing has been identified, but not a ''mechanism'' by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every reason to think that the opposite is true: ageing ''decreases'' individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.

Theories suggesting that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design (such as Weismann's "programmed death" theory) are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing. The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=2013|volume=15|pages=527–543|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255170953_Viscous_populations_evolve_altruistic_programmed_aging_in_ability_conflict_in_a_changing_environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutation accumulation==
The first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. It formed from discussions in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and the [[selection shadow]] concept. Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect.  Nature is a highly competitive place, and almost all animals in nature die before they attain old age. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul – not much [[selection pressure]] for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would be dead anyway, killed by predators, disease, or accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151|title=The Evolution of Aging|last1=Fabian|first1=Daniel|last2=Flatt|first2=Thomas|date=2011|website=[[Scitable]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation''. The mechanism of action involves random, detrimental ''germline'' mutations of a kind that happen to show their effect only late in life. Unlike most detrimental mutations, these would not be efficiently weeded out by natural selection. On the grand scale, senescence would just be the summation of deleterious genes that only present in older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monaco|first=Thiago Oliveira|last2=Silveira|first2=Paulo Sergio Panse|date=May 2009|title=Aging is not Senescence: A Short Computer Demonstration and Implications for Medical Practice|journal=Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)|volume=64|issue=5|pages=451–457|doi=10.1590/S1807-59322009000500013|issn=1807-5932|pmc=2694250|pmid=19488612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they would 'accumulate' and, perhaps, cause all the decline and damage that we associate with ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Medawar, P.B.|title=An Unsolved Problem of Biology|publisher=H.K. Lewis|location=London|year=1952}}
Edney, E.B. and Gill, R.W. 1968. Delineates the theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/220281a0|vauthors=Edney EB, Gill RW |title=Evolution of senescence and specific longevity|journal=Nature|volume=220|issue=5164|pages=281–2|date=October 1968|pmid=5684860|bibcode=1968Natur.220..281E}} Further describes theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern genetics science has disclosed a possible problem with the mutation accumulation concept in that it is now known that [[gene]]s are typically [[Gene expression|expressed]] in specific tissues at specific times (see [[regulation of gene expression]]). Expression is controlled by some genetic "program" that activates different genes at different times in the normal growth, development, and day-to-day life of the organism. Defects in genes cause problems ([[genetic disease]]s) when they are not properly expressed when required. A problem late in life suggests that the genetic program called for expression of a gene only in late life and the mutational defect prevented proper expression. This implies existence of a program that called for different gene expression at that point in life. Why, given Medawar's concept, would there exist genes only needed in late life or a program that called for different expression only in late life? The ''maintenance mechanism'' theory (discussed below) avoids this problem.

Medawar's concept suggested that the [[evolution]] process was affected by the age at which an organism was capable of reproducing. Characteristics that adversely affected an organism prior to that age would severely limit the organism's ability to propagate its characteristics and thus would be highly "selected against" by [[natural selection]]. Characteristics that caused the same adverse effects that only appeared well after that age would have relatively little effect on the organism's ability to [[Reproduce|propagate]] and therefore might be allowed by natural selection. This concept fits well with the observed multiplicity of mammal life spans (and differing ages of sexual maturity) and is important to all of the subsequent theories of ageing discussed below.

=== Role of extrinsic mortality ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Young cohorts, not depleted in numbers yet by extrinsic mortality, contribute far more to the next generation than the few remaining older cohorts, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations, which affect only these few older individuals, is very weak. The mutations may not be selected against, therefore, and may spread over evolutionary time into the population.

The major testable prediction made by this model is that species that have high extrinsic mortality in nature will age more quickly and have shorter [[Intrinsic lifespan|intrinsic lifespans]]. This is borne out among mammals, the best-studied in terms of life history. There is a correlation among mammals between body size and [[Life expectancy|lifespan]], such that larger species live longer than smaller species under controlled/optimum conditions, but there are notable exceptions. For instance, many bats and rodents are of similar size, yet bats live much longer. For instance, the [[little brown bat]], half the size of a [[mouse]], can live 30 years in the wild. A mouse will only live 2–3 years even under optimum conditions. The explanation is that bats have fewer predators, and therefore low extrinsic mortality. More individuals survive to later ages, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations is stronger. Fewer late-acting deleterious mutations equates to lower mortality and therefore a longer lifespan. Birds are also warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5–10 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals. [[Seabird|Seabirds]], which, in general, have the fewest predators of all birds, live longest.

When examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and often their sociality, help them avoid becoming prey. High position in the [[food chain]], intelligence and cooperativeness all reduce extrinsic mortality in species.

==Antagonistic pleiotropy==
{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}
Medawar's theory was further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose a bit of its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that even a little bit of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.

Williams's objection has turned out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. Another problem with Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as [[eukaryotic]] life. [[Baker's yeast]], [[worm]]s, [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], and [[mice]] all share some of the same ageing genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guarente L, Kenyon C |title=Genetic pathways that regulate ageing in model organisms|journal=Nature|volume=408|issue=6809|pages=255–62|date=November 2000|pmid=11089983 |doi=10.1038/35041700|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/abs/408255a0.html}} Shows similarities between ageing genes in model organisms.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams (1957) proposed his own theory, called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy means one gene that has two or more effects on the [[phenotype]]. In antagonistic pleiotropy, one of these effects is beneficial and another is detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on. If evolution is a race to have the most offspring the fastest, then enhanced early fertility could be selected even if it came with a price tag that included decline and death later on.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2406060|author=Williams, G.C.|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|issue=4|pages=398–411|year=1957|format=PDF|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|jstor=2406060|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-13|df=}} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ageing was a side effect of necessary functions, Williams considered any alteration of the ageing process to be "impossible."

Antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, but this is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.

Another difficulty with antagonistic pleiotropy and other theories that suppose that ageing is an adverse side effect of some beneficial function is that the linkage between adverse and beneficial effects would need to be ''rigid'' in the sense that the evolution process would not be able to evolve a way to accomplish the benefit without incurring the adverse effect even over a very long time span. Such a rigid relationship has not been experimentally demonstrated and, in general, evolution is able to independently and individually adjust myriad organism characteristics.

In breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their fertility. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artefact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2410382|author1=Leroi, A.M. |author2=Chippindale, A.K. |author3=Rose, M.R. |title=Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1. The role of genotype-by-environment interaction|journal=Evolution|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1244–57|year=1994|jstor=2410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposable soma theory==
{{main|Disposable soma theory of aging}}
A third mainstream theory of ageing, the '[[Disposable soma theory of aging|'Disposable soma'' theory]], proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], presumes that the body must budget the amount of energy available to it. The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance. With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do none of these things quite as well as it would like. It is the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/270301a0|author=Kirkwood TB|title=Evolution of ageing|journal=Nature|volume=270|issue=5635|pages=301–4|date=November 1977|pmid=593350 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html|bibcode=1977Natur.270..301K}} Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt; A caveat to the disposable soma theory suggests that time, rather than energy, is a limiting resource that may be critical to an organism. The concept is that each organism must reproduce in an optimal period in order to ensure the greatest chance of success for the offspring. This optimal period is dictated by the ecological niche of the organism but in essence, it limits the time that any given organism can devote to growth and development prior to bearing offspring. Thus, developmental rate and gestational rate are subject to evolutionary pressure. The need to accelerate gestation limits the time allocated to damage repair at the cellular level, resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer gestation. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lorenzini, A, Stamato, T. Sell, C.|title=The disposable soma theory revisited: Time as a resource in the theories of aging|volume=15|year=2011|doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302|journal=Cell Cycle|pages=3853–3856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are arguments against the disposable soma theory. The theory clearly predicts that a shortage of food should make the compromise more severe all around; but in many experiments, ongoing since 1930, it has been demonstrated that animals live longer when fed substantially less than controls. This is the [[caloric restriction]] (CR) effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weindruch, R. |author2=Walford, R.L. |title=The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction|publisher=Thomas|location=Springfield, IL |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/019262339602400618|author=Weindruch R|title=The Retardation of Aging by Caloric Restriction: Studies in Rodents and Primates|journal=Toxicologic Pathology|volume=24|issue=6|pages=742–5|year=1996|url=http://tpx.sagepub.com/content/24/6/742.short |pmid=8994305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masoro EJ|title=Overview of caloric restriction and ageing|journal=Mech. Ageing Dev.|volume=126|issue=9|pages=913–22|date=September 2005|pmid=15885745|doi=10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.012|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047-6374(05)00078-3}} Overview of caloric restriction and aging.&lt;/ref&gt; and it cannot be easily reconciled with the Disposable Soma theory. Though by decreasing energy expenditure the damage generated (by [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], for instance) is expected to be reduced and the total energy budget might indeed be reduced, but the investment in repair function might still be relatively the same. But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, reproductive output is also lower. So CR does thus not completely dismiss disposable soma theory.

With respect to such limitations Kriete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kriete, A.|title=Robustness and aging-a systems-level perspective |journal=Biosystems|volume=112|pages=37–48|year=2013|pmid=23562399|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264713000695 |doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2013.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed consideration of systems-level properties like [[Robustness (evolution)|robustness]] to characterize ageing as a robustness tradeoff. According to this concept living systems evolve into a state of [[highly optimized tolerance]] promoting traits beneficial for survival and fitness at the cost of fragilities driving the ageing phenotype. The view is compatible with aspects of the antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theory, but offers additional mechanisms rooted in [[complex systems]] theory.

==Other problems with the classical ageing theories==
A raised criticism for all three mainstream theories based on classical evolutionary process concepts is the potential existence of 'deliberate' metabolic mechanisms that work to promote death.

One is ''[[apoptosis]]'', or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is responsible for killing infected cells, cancerous cells, and cells that are simply in the wrong place during development. There are clear benefits to apoptosis, so the existence of apoptosis isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. The problem is that apoptosis seems to ramp up late in life and kill healthy cells, causing weakness and degeneration  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. And, paradoxically, apoptosis has been observed as a kind of 'altruistic suicide' in colonies of [[yeast]] under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gourlay CW, Du W, Ayscough KR |title=Apoptosis in yeast--mechanisms and benefits to a unicellular organism|journal=Mol. Microbiol.|volume=62|issue=6|pages=1515–21|date=December 2006|pmid=17087770|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05486.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0950-382X&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=62&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1515}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a direct hint that senescence arose because it conferred a direct evolutionary advantage, rather than some kind of side effect of genes that have other evolutionary advantages (pleiotropy).

A second 'deliberate' mechanism is called ''replicative senescence'' or cellular [[senescence]]. Metaphorically, a cell may be said to 'count' (with its ''[[telomeres]]'') the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The molecular biology of cancer?|quote=This has resulted in speculation that cellular senescence evolved as a cancer suppression mechanism at a time when the life expectancy for humans was far shorter than it is today.|first1= M.|last1=Blasco|first2=S.|last2=Pelengaris|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1814-9|oclc=263712202|date=2006-02-28|page=285}}

More strictly, cells cannot 'count' the number of times they have divided {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Telomeres are not a counting mechanism {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, though they may be used to indicate the number of times a particular [[chromosome]] has been replicated. Cellular processes for genetic material [[DNA replication|replication]] occur in both directions along [[DNA]], 5' to 3' and on the other strand, 3' to 5'. As the 3' or 5' end is impossible for [[DNA polymerase]] to grab at the 1 base pair mark, a handful of basepairs (10-15) are cut off each replication. Over time, this cutting short of the DNA results in no telomeres, and the cell is unable to replicate that chromosome without cutting into genes.

The dilemma is that classical evolutionary theory says that what is maintained in a lineage is that which ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could ''only'' evolve as a side effect, or [[epiphenomenon]] of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical [[evolution]] theory (See [[neo-Darwinism]]) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mitteldorf, J.|title=Ageing selected for its own sake|journal=Evol.

[[Semelparous]] organisms and others that die suddenly following reproduction (e.g. [[salmon]], [[octopus]], marsupial mouse ([[brown antechinus]]), etc.) also represent instances of organisms who incorporate a lifespan-limiting feature. Sudden death is more obviously an instance of programmed death or a purposeful adaptation than gradual ageing. Biological elements clearly associated with evolved mechanisms such as [[hormone]] signalling have been identified in the death mechanisms of organisms such as the [[octopus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wodinsky, J.|title=Hormonal Inhibition of Feeding and Death in Octopus: Control by Optic Gland Secretion|journal=Science|volume=198|issue=4320|pages=948–51|year=1977|pmid=17787564|doi=10.1126/science.198.4320.948|bibcode=1977Sci...198..948W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of new evolution concepts on ageing theories==
At the time most of the non-programmed ageing theories were developed, there was very little scientific disagreement with classical theories (i.e. [[Neo-Darwinism]]) regarding the process of evolution. However, in addition to suicidal behaviour of [[semelparous]] species (not handled by the classical ageing theories) other apparently individually adverse organism characteristics such as [[altruism]] and [[sexual reproduction]] were observed. In response to these ''other'' conflicts, adjustments to classical theory were proposed:
*Various '''[[group selection]]''' theories (beginning in 1962) propose that benefit to a group could offset the individually adverse nature of a characteristic such as [[altruism]]. The same principle could be applied to characteristics that limited life span and theories proposing group benefits for limited lifespans appeared.
*'''[[Evolvability]]''' theories (beginning in 1995) suggest that a characteristic that increased an organism's ability to evolve could also offset an individual disadvantage and thus be evolved and retained. Multiple evolvability benefits of a limited lifespan were subsequently proposed in addition to those originally proposed by Weismann.

===Ageing theories based on group selection===
Group selection is often criticized to be too slow to happen in real biology. However, Jiang-Nan Yang&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; recently showed with an [[individual-based model]] that the evolution of altruistic ageing occurs under fairly general conditions by kin/group selection. Group selection can be based on population viscosity (limited offspring dispersal, first proposed by Hamilton (1964) for kin selection) that is widely present in natural populations. This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. Although early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=D.S. |author2=Pollock, G.B. |author3=Dugatkin, L.A|title=Can altruism evolve in purely viscous populations?|journal=Evol. Ecol.|year=1992|volume=6|pages=331–341|doi=10.1007/bf02270969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taylor (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=P.D.|title=Altruism in viscous populations – an inclusive fitness model.|journal=Evol. Ecol.|year=1992|volume=6|pages=352–356|doi=10.1007/bf02270971}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that pure population viscosity cannot lead to cooperation/altruism because of the exact cancelling out of the benefit of kin cooperation and the cost of kin competition, this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient for the evolution of cooperation.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; Mitteldorf and D.S. Wilson (2000) later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitteldorf|first=Joshua|author2=Wilson, D.S.|title=Population viscosity and the evolution of altruism|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|year=2000|volume=204|pages=481–496|url=http://web.pdx.edu/~jeff/group_sel_workshop/mitteldorf_wilson.pdf|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang (2013) further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruistic ageing even if the population does not fluctuate, this is because local competition among the young will result in an increased average local inherited fitness of survived progenies after the elimination of the less adapted by natural selection, since the young do not have strong age-associated abilities and have to depend more on inherited abilities to compete.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; In Yang (2013)'s model, altruistic ageing is stabilized by higher-level selection instead of just kin selection.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt;

Mitteldorf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mitteldorf, J.|title=Chaotic population dynamics and the evolution of ageing: proposing a demographic theory of senescence|journal=Evol. Ecol.

Populations in nature are subject to boom and bust cycles. Often overpopulation can be punished by famine or by epidemic. Either one could wipe out an entire population. Senescence is a means by which a species can 'take control' of its own death rate, and level out the boom-bust cycles. This story may be more plausible than the Weismann hypothesis as a mechanistic explanation, because it addresses the question of how [[group selection]] can be rapid enough to compete with individual selection.

===Ageing theories based on evolvability===
Goldsmith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldsmith TC|title=Aging, evolvability, and the individual benefit requirement; medical implications of aging theory controversies|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|volume=252|issue=4|pages=764–8|date=June 2008|pmid=18396295|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.035 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(08)00101-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that in addition to increasing the generation rate, and thereby evolution rate, a limited lifespan improves the evolution process by limiting the ability of older individuals to dominate the [[gene pool]]. Further, the evolution of characteristics such as intelligence and immunity may specially require a limited lifespan because otherwise acquired characteristics such as experience or exposure to pathogens would tend to override the selection of the beneficial inheritable characteristic. An older and more experienced, but less intelligent animal would have a fitness advantage over a younger, more intelligent animal except for the effects of ageing.

Skulachev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skulachev VP|title=Aging is a specific biological function rather than the result of a disorder in complex living systems: biochemical evidence in support of Weismann's hypothesis|journal=Biochemistry Mosc.|volume=62|issue=11|pages=1191–5|date=November 1997|pmid=9467841}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that programmed ageing assists the evolution process by providing a gradually increasing challenge or obstacle to survival and reproduction, and therefore enhancing the selection of beneficial characteristics. In this sense, ageing would act in a manner similar to that of mating rituals that take the form of contests or trials that must be overcome in order to mate (another individually adverse observation). This suggests an advantage of gradual ageing over sudden death as a means of lifespan regulation.

Weissmann's 1889 ageing theory was essentially an [[evolvability]] theory. Ageing or otherwise purposely limited lifespan helps evolution by freeing resources for younger, and therefore, presumably better-adapted individuals.

Yang (2013)'s model&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; is also based on mechanisms of evolvability. Ageing accelerates the accumulation of novel adaptive genes in local populations. However, Yang changed the terminology of "evolvability" into "genetic creativity" throughout his paper to facilitate the understanding of how ageing can have a shorter-term benefit than the word "evolvability" would imply.

Lenart and Vašku (2016) &lt;ref name="LenartBienertová-Vašků2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenart|first1=Peter|last2=Bienertová-Vašků|first2=Julie|title=Keeping up with the Red Queen: the pace of aging as an adaptation|journal=Biogerontology|year=2016|issn=1389-5729|doi=10.1007/s10522-016-9674-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also invoked evolvability as the main mechanism driving evolution of aging. However, they proposed that even though the actual rate of aging can be an adaptation the aging itself is inevitable. In other words, evolution can change speed of aging but some aging no matter how slow will always occur.

==Mechanism==
If organisms purposely limit their lifespans via ageing or semelparous behaviour, the associated evolved mechanisms could be very complex, just as mechanisms that provide for mentation, vision, digestion, or other biological function are typically very complex. Such a mechanism could involve hormones, signalling, sensing of external conditions, and other complex functions typical of evolved mechanisms. Such complex mechanisms could explain all of the observations of ageing and semelparous behaviours as described below.

It is typical for a given biological function to be controlled by a single mechanism that is capable of sensing the germane conditions and then executing the necessary function  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. The mechanism signals all the systems and tissues that need to respond to that function by means of organism-wide signals ([[hormone]]s). If ageing is indeed a biological function, we would expect all or most manifestations of ageing to be similarly controlled by a common mechanism. Various observations (listed below) indeed suggest the existence of a common control mechanism.

It is also typical for biological functions to be modulated by or synchronized to external events or conditions. The [[circadian rhythm]] and synchronization of mating behaviour to planetary cues are examples. In the case of ageing seen as a biological function, the [[calorie restriction|caloric restriction effect]] may well be an example of the ageing function being modulated in order to optimize organism lifespan in response to external conditions. Temporary extension of lifespan under famine conditions would aid in group survival because extending lifespan, combined with less-frequent reproduction, would reduce the resources required to maintain a given population.{{Dubious|date=March 2018}}

Theories to the effect that ageing results by default (mutation accumulation) or is an adverse side effect of some other function are logically much more limited and suffer when compared to empirical evidence of complex mechanisms. The choice of ageing theory therefore is logically essentially determined by one's position regarding evolutionary processes, and some theorists reject programmed ageing based entirely on evolutionary process considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=SJ|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Carnes|first3=BA|title=No truth to the fountain of youth |journal=Scientific American|volume=286|issue=6|pages=92–5|year=2002|pmid=12030096|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0602-92|bibcode=2002SciAm.286f..92O}} Article stating that programmed ageing is "impossible" because of "the way evolution works."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance theories===
It is generally accepted that deteriorative processes (wear, other molecular damage) exist and that living organisms have mechanisms to counter deterioration. Wounds heal; dead cells are replaced; claws regrow.

A non-programmed theory of mammal ageing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holliday R|title=Aging is no longer an unsolved problem in biology |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.|volume=1067|pages=1–9|date=May 2006|pmid=16803964 |doi=10.1196/annals.1354.002|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=1067&amp;spage=1|bibcode=2006NYASA1067....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fits with classical evolution theory and Medawar's concept is that different mammal species possess different capabilities for maintenance and repair. Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes that are each more effective than those of shorter-lived species. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, had less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.

A corresponding programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldsmith, T.|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms|journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59–64|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002|url=}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the repair mechanisms are in turn controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and also capable of producing the specific lifespan needed by the particular species. In this view, the differences between short- and long-lived species are in the control mechanisms, as opposed to each individual maintenance mechanism.

===DNA damage theory===
{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}

The [[DNA damage theory of aging]] is a prominent explanation for aging at the molecular level.  This theory postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is the primary cause of aging.&lt;ref name="pmid7031747"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gensler HL, Bernstein H |title=DNA damage as the primary cause of aging |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=279–303 |year=1981 |pmid=7031747 |doi= 10.1086/412317|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with this theory, genetic elements that regulate [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] in [[somatic cell]]s were proposed to have pleiotropic effects that are beneficial during early development but allow deleterious consequences later in life.&lt;ref name="pmid7031747" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H.

===Evidence===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}

* Complex programmed death mechanisms exist in semelparous species (e.g. octopus), including hormone signalling, nervous system involvement, etc. If a limited lifespan is generally useful as predicted by the programmed ageing theories, it would be unusual for an octopus to possess a more complex mechanism for accomplishing that function than a mammal.
* "Ageing genes" with no other apparent function. However to date no evidence that such genes exist has been found. 
* Caloric restriction effect: ''reduction'' of available resources ''increases'' lifespan. This behavior has a plausible group benefit in enhancing the survival of a group under famine conditions and also suggests common control.
* [[Progeria]] and [[Werner syndrome]] are both [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single-gene genetic diseases]] that cause acceleration of many or most symptoms of ageing. The fact that a single gene malfunction can cause similar effects on many different manifestations of ageing suggests a common mechanism. However, both genes affected influence DNA stability and so can be explained by stochastic theories of ageing that attribute ageing to accumulation of DNA damage. 
*Although mammal lifespans vary over an approximately 100:1 range, manifestations of ageing (cancer, arthritis, weakness, sensory deficit, etc.) are similar in different species. This suggests that the deterioration mechanisms and corresponding maintenance mechanisms operate over a short period (less than the lifespan of a short-lived mammal). All the mammals therefore need all the maintenance mechanisms. This suggests that the difference between mammals is in a control mechanism or repair efficiency. 
*Lifespan varies greatly among otherwise very similar species (e.g. different varieties of [[salmon]] 3:1, different fish 600:1) suggesting that relatively few genes control lifespan and that relatively minor changes to [[genotype]] could cause major differences in lifespan. This could be consistent with a common control mechanism for lifespan but note that this does not in itself provide evidence for programmed aging but is equally consistent with traditional theories.

==Problems with programmed ageing theories==
Contrary to the theory of programmed death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in the majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but the age-dependence of death rates is very smooth and monotonic. However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skulachev|first=Vladimir P.|title=The programmed death phenomena, ageing, and the Samurai law of biology|journal=Experimental Gerontology|year=2001|volume=36|pages=995–1024|doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(01)00109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live longer. It is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.

The death rates at extreme old ages start to slow down, which is the opposite of what would be expected if death by ageing was programmed. From an individual-selection point of view, having genes that would not result in a programmed death by ageing would displace genes that cause programmed death by ageing, as individuals would produce more offspring in their longer lifespan and they could increase the survival of their offspring by providing longer parental support.&lt;ref name=Garilov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavrilov|first1=Leonid A|first2=Natalia S.|last2=Gavrilova|title=Evolutionary Theories of Aging and Longevity|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=7 February 2002|issue=2|pages=339–356|doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96|citeseerx=10.1.1.3.4950|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biogerontology considerations==
Theories of ageing affect efforts to understand and find treatments for age-related conditions (see [[Biogerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontology]]):
*Those who believe in the idea that ageing is an unavoidable side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore "impossible",&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.
*Those believing in default theories of multiple maintenance mechanisms tend to believe that ways might be found to enhance the operation of some of those mechanisms. Perhaps they can be assisted by anti-oxidants or other agents.
*Those who believe in programmed ageing suppose that ways might be found to interfere with the operation of the part of the ageing mechanism that appears to be common to multiple symptoms, essentially "slowing down the clock" and delaying multiple manifestations. Such effect might be obtained by fooling a sense function. One such effort is an attempt to find a "mimetic" that would "mime" the anti-ageing effect of [[calorie restriction]] without having to actually radically restrict diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen D, Guarente L |title=SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics|journal=Trends Mol Med|volume=13|issue=2|pages=64–71|date=February 2007|pmid=17207661|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4914(06)00286-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Exploration Upper Stage (EUS)''' is being developed as a large second stage for Block 1B of the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), succeeding Block 1's [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage|Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage]]. It will be powered by four [[RL10]]C-3&lt;ref name=RL10C-Oct/&gt; engines burning [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] to produce a total of {{convert|99,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|lk=out}} thrust. {{asof|February 2015}} the SLS Block 1B is baselined at 105 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advanced Boosters progress towards a solid future for SLS|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/02/advanced-boosters-towards-solid-future-sls/|accessdate=2015-03-12|publisher=NasaSpaceflight.com|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EUS is expected to first fly on the [[Exploration Mission 3]] launch of the SLS scheduled for 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA updates Lunar Gateway plans|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/09/nasa-lunar-gateway-plans/|accessdate=2018-10-05|publisher=NasaSpaceflight.com|date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Block 1 configuration of SLS will have the ability to insert 70 metric tons&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=SLS|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_lau/sls.htm|website=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; into low Earth orbit (LEO) using [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle-derived]] 5-segment [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Boosters]] and a core stage powered by four [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|RS-25]] engines. Its second stage, the [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage#ICPS|ICPS]], will be considered part of the 70 t payload and on [[Exploration Mission 1|EM-1]] it will be placed, along with the Orion crew capsule, on a 1,800&amp;nbsp;km by -93&amp;nbsp;km [[suborbital]] trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. At apogee, the ICPS will perform an insertion burn to raise the perigee and put itself and Orion into a stable orbit, and will later perform a [[translunar injection]] burn to send the uncrewed Orion capsule on a [[circumlunar]] excursion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Launch System Data Sheet|url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/sls0.html|website=SpaceLaunchReport.com|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve on the 70 metric ton Block 1, NASA considered a Block 1A upgrade which would replace the Shuttle-heritage boosters with advanced solid or [[liquid rocket boosters|liquid boosters]], and a Block 1B upgrade which would develop an improved second stage. This improved stage was originally named the Dual Use Upper Stage (DUUS, pronounced "duce")&lt;ref name=nsfpdr&gt;{{cite web|title=SLS prepares for PDR – Evolution eyes Dual-Use Upper Stage|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/06/sls-pdr-evolved-rocket-dual-upper-stage/|website=NASASpaceflight.com|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later renamed the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) due to DUUS sounding like a profanity in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=SLS positioning for ARRM and Europa missions|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/03/sls-positioning-arrm-europa-missions/|website=NASA Spaceflight|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to this cluster of [[RL10|RL10A-3]] engines, the SLS Block IB 2nd stage, the EUS, will likewise contain a cluster of these engines but will surpass the clustered performance of the above S-IV with just 4 [[RL10|RL10B-2]] derived engines and do so without the weight saving [[S-IV|common bulkhead]] of the S-IV.]]
Following concerns that the more powerful Block 1A boosters would have resulted in high acceleration during launch, which would have been unsuitable for the Orion crew vehicle and could have resulted in a costly redesign of the SLS core,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=Wind Tunnel testing conducted on SLS configurations, including Block 1B|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/wind-tunnel-testing-sls-configurations-block-1b/|website=NASA SpaceFlight|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA announced in 2014 that it would proceed with development of Block 1B with the EUS before advanced boosters.&lt;ref name=nsfe/&gt; In April 2016 it was reported NASA has chosen to use a design based on four [[RL10]]-C3 engines for the EUS,&lt;ref name=rl10 /&gt; and in Oct 2016 NASA confirmed they had ordered 10 of the engines.&lt;ref name="RL10C-Oct" /&gt;

==Role &amp; comparable stages==
The EUS is to complete the SLS's [[boost phase|ascent phase]] and then re-ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond [[low Earth orbit]], similar in function to the 3rd stage on the [[Saturn V]], the [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] powered [[S-IVB]] but closer to the 2nd stage on the [[Saturn I]], the [[S-IV]] in engine layout, as it contained a cluster of RL-10 engines and was likewise a 2nd stage on the vehicle stack.

The 2nd stage of the SLS Block 1B, the EUS, powered by a cluster of four RL10 engines will produce slightly more thrust than the Saturn I's six engined [[S-IV]] of the 1960s.

Prior to finalization of second stage options for the SLS Block 1B, a more powerful [[Earth Departure Stage]] was under development, which would have been powered by up to three of the much more powerful [[J-2X]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLS Launch Vehicle specifications take shape as development continues|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/03/sls-specifications-take-shape-development-continues/|website=NASASpaceflight.com|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technological development of the J-2X was expected to take considerably more time, so the EDS was dropped in favor of the EUS, which will use the already-developed RL10.  According to NASA, the J-2X will be overpowered for the lunar and asteroid missions of the Block 1 and 1B SLS; its development has been put on hold (though not abandoned) until stages capable of transferring heavy payloads to Mars are required (currently expected in the 2030s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/nasa-s-j-2x-engine-be-mothballed-after-testing|title=NASA’s J-2X Engine To Be Mothballed After Testing|website=aviationweek.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''The Four Minute Men''' were a group of volunteers authorized by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], to give four-minute speeches on topics given to them by The [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI). In 1917-1918, around 7,555,190 speeches were given in 5,200 communities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;. The topics dealt with the American war effort in the First World War and were presented during the four minutes between reels changing in movie theaters across the country. Also, the speeches were made to be four minutes so that they could be given at town meetings, restaurants, and other places that had an audience. This is an instance of "viral marketing" before its time.

== History==
{{Main|Presidency of Woodrow Wilson#Propaganda}}
On April, 6th 1917 the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] declared war on Germany. President Wilson was determined to rouse the public.

Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI), headed by [[George Creel]].&lt;ref&gt;George Creel,  [https://archive.org/details/howweadvertameri00creerich ''How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe.'' (1920)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980). [https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America’s Persuaders'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.
[[File:111-SC-16569 - NARA - 55193236.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas Fairbanks delivering a speech in support of the 3rd Liberty Loan]]

CPI Director [[George Creel]] boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.  Ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Committee on public information, ''Complete Report of the Committee on Public Information: 1917, 1918, 1919'' (1920) [https://archive.org/details/CompleteReportCommitteeOnPublicInformation191719181919 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
With many millions of [[German Americans]] in the United States, as well as [[Irish Americans]] and [[Scandinavian Americans]] and poor rural Southerners, with strong isolationist feelings, there was a strong need for a [[propaganda]] campaign to stir support for the war. This effort had many unique challenges to meet to address the existing [[political climate]]. Wilson needed to speak directly to the fragmented and spread out audience in the United States.  He had to address the country's self-perception to generate support for the war. The Four-Minute Men provided an answer to these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Four Minute Men urged citizens to purchase [[Liberty Bonds]] and Thrift Stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA796|title=The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress, Volume 1918|date=1919|publisher=T.

==Addressing challenges==
The Four Minute Men idea became a useful tool in the propaganda campaign because it addressed a specific [[rhetorical situation]]. One of the challenges of the effort was the fragmented audience of the United States. Many different heritages were represented in the United States, and the president needed their support for the war. To address each groups specific needs, the director of the Four Minute Men, William McCormick Blair, delegated the duty of speaking to local men. Well known and respected community figures often volunteered for the Four Minute Men program. This gave the speeches a local voice. Also, the four minute men were given general topics and talking points to follow and rotated between theaters to help the speeches seem fresh, instead of generic propaganda speeches.

These speeches usually celebrated Woodrow Wilson as a larger than life character and the Germans as less-than-human huns. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The four minute men was a division of the Committee on Public Information, headed by [[George Creel]]. The Committee on Public Information appointed William McCormick Blair as director of the Four Minute Men. Blair appointed state chairmen of the Four Minute Men, who then would appoint a city or community chairman. Each of these appointments needed to be approved in Washington. The local chairman would then appoint a number of speakers to cover the theaters in the city or community for which he is responsible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">'''Genetic ecology''' is the study of the stability and expression of varying genetic material within abiotic mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Kellenberger, E. (15 May 1994) "Genetic ecology: a new interdisciplinary science, fundamental for evolution, biodiversity and biosafety evaluations" ''Experientia'' vol50:5 pp. 429–437&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, genetic data is not thought of outside of any organism save for criminal for criminal forensics. However, genetic material has the ability to be taken up by various organisms that exist within an abiotic medium through natural transformations that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, J. (1994) ''The Transformation of Genetics'' The Rockefeller University, New York, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this field of study focuses on interaction, exchange, and expression of genetic material that may not be shared by species had they not been in the same environment.

==History==

E.B. Ford was the first geneticist to begin work in this field of study. E.B. Ford worked mostly during the 1950s and is most noted for his work with ''Maniola jurtina'' and published a book entitled ''Ecological Genetics'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/1405100338/Lowe_Ecological%20Genetics_sample%20chapter.pdf?q=ecological ''Ecological Genetics''] (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter S.W. ''et. al'' (2017) "EB Ford revisited: assessing the long-term stability of wing-spot patterns and population genetic structure of the meadow brown butterfly on the Isles of Scilly" ''Heredity''&lt;/ref&gt; This type of evolutionary biological study was only possible after gel electrophoresis had been designed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tiselius, A.

This field of study began to become more popular following the 1980s with the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR 1985) and poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis  (p. 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.L. ''et. al'' (7 September 1967) "Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels" ''Biochem Biophys Res Commun''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9577.html "The History of PCR"] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; With this technology, segments of DNA could be sequenced, amplified, and proteins produced using bacterial transformations. The genetic material along with the proteins could be analyzed and more correct phylogenetic trees could be created. 

Since E.B. Ford's research, multiple other genetic ecologists have continued study within the field of genetic ecology such as PT Hanford&lt;ref&gt;Handford PT. (1973) "Patterns of variation in a number of genetic systems in Maniola jurtina" Isles of Scilly. ''Proc R Soc B Biol Sci'' 183: 285–300. |&lt;/ref&gt; Alina von Thaden,&lt;ref&gt;Thaden, A.

==Gene transfer==

Genetic information may transfer throughout an ecosystem in multiple ways. The first of which, on the smallest scale, being bacterial gene transfer (see [[bacterial transformations]]). Bacteria have the ability to exchange DNA. This DNA exchange, or [[horizontal gene transfer]], may provide various species of bacteria with the genetic information they need to survive in an environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amrls.cvm.msu.edu/microbiology/molecular-basis-for-antimicrobial-resistance/acquired-resistance/acquisition-of-antimicrobial-resistance-via-horizontal-gene-transfer "Horizontal Gene Transfer"]. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; This can help many bacterial species survive within an environment.

A similar event has the ability to happen between plants and bacteria. For example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens has the ability to introduce genes into plants to cause the development of Gall disease. This occurs through genetic transfer between the ''A. tumefaciens'' and between the plant in question.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/biosecurity/education/dualuse-agriculture/2.-agricultural-biotechnology/methods-of-gene-transfer-in-plants.html "Methods of Gene Transfer in Plants"] (2011) ''Agricultural Biosecurity''&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, a similar event occurs each time viral infections occur within living organisms. The [[viruses]], whether positive or negative sense viruses, require a living organism to replicate their genes and produce more viruses. Once a virus is inside a living organism, it utilizes polymerases, ribosomes, and other biomolecules to replicate its own genetic material and to produce more virus genetic material similar to the original virus.&lt;ref&gt;7. Weaver, R. (2012). ''Molecular biology'' (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, gene transfer may occur through many varying means. Thus, the study of this gene transfer throughout each ecosystem, whether it be through a bacterial ecosystem or through the ecosystem of an organism, genetic ecology is the study of this gene transfer and its causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53206">[[Genetic engineering]] can be accomplished using multiple techniques. There are a number of steps that are followed before a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO) is created. Genetic engineers must first choose what [[gene]] they wish to insert, modify or delete. The gene must then be isolated and incorporated, along with other genetic elements, into a suitable [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]. This vector is then used to insert the gene into the host organism, creating the GMO.

The ability to genetically engineer organisms is built on years of research and discovery on how genes function and how we can manipulate them.Humans have been manipulating genetics since early [[domestication]] attempts around 12,000 BC. Following the discovery of genes by [[Gregor Mendel]] and the [[Griffith's experiment|proof]] that they were involved in inheritance tools were developed that allowed there direct manipulation. Important advances included the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s and [[DNA ligase]]s and the development of [[polymerase chain reaction]] and [[sequencing]].

This allowed the gene of interest to be isolated and then incorporated into a vector. Often a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region was added as well as a [[selectable marker]] gene. The gene may be modified further at this point to make it [[Expression (genetics)|express]] more efficiently. This vector is then inserted into the host organism's [[genome]]. For animals, the gene is typically inserted into [[embryonic stem cells]], while in plants it can be inserted into any tissue that can be [[Tissue culture|cultured]] into a fully developed plant. Common techniques include [[microinjection]], [[viral vectors|virus-mediated]], [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated]] or [[Gene gun|biolistics]]. Further tests are carried out on the resulting organism to ensure stable integration, [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] and expression. First generation offspring are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]], requiring them to be inbred to create the homozygous pattern necessary for stable inheritance. Homozygosity must be confirmed in second generation specimens.

Traditional techniques inserted the genes randomly into the hosts genome. Advances have allowed genes to be inserted at specific locations within a genome, which reduces the unintended side effects of random insertion. Early targeting systems relied on [[meganuclease]]s and [[zinc finger nuclease]]s. Since 2009 more accurate and easier systems to implement have been developed. [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) and the [[Cas9|Cas9-guideRNA system]] (adapted from [[CRISPR]])  are the two most commonly used. They may potentially be useful in [[gene therapy]] and other procedures that require accurate or high through put targeting.

== History ==
{{see also|History of genetic engineering}}
Many different discoveries and advancements lead to the development of [[genetic engineering]]. Human-directed genetic manipulation began with the [[domestication]] of plants and animals through [[artificial selection]] in about 12,000 BC.&lt;ref name="Root"&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WGDYHvOHwmwC}}|first=Clive |last=Root | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Groups|isbn=9780313339875}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Various techniques were developed to aid in breeding and selection. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] was one way rapid changes in an organisms makeup could be introduced. Hybridization most likely first occurred when humans first grew similar, yet slightly different plants in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsbury|first=Noel| name-list-format = vanc |title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dGSj-CFxk-QC}}|date=15 October 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-43705-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} Some plants were able to be propagated by [[vegetative cloning]].&lt;ref name="Kingsbury" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

[[Mendelian inheritance|Genetic inheritance]] was first discovered by [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1865, following experiments crossing peas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartl DL, Orel V | title = What did Gregor Mendel think he discovered? | journal = Genetics | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–53 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1644269 | pmc = 1205000 | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/131/2/245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Frederick Griffith]] [[Griffith's experiment|proved]] the existence of a "transforming principle" involved in inheritance, which was identified as DNA in 1944 by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty]]. [[Frederick Sanger]] developed a method for sequencing DNA in 1977, greatly increasing the genetic information available to researchers.

After discovering the existence and properties of [[DNA]], tools had to be developed that allowed it to be manipulated. In 1970 [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smiths]] lab discovered [[restriction enzymes]], enabling scientists to isolate genes from an organism's genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 5905–8 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15840723 | pmc = 1087929 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500923102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5905R }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA ligase]]s, which join broken DNA together, were discovered earlier in 1967.&lt;ref name="WeissRichardson1967"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss B, Richardson CC | title = Enzymatic breakage and joining of deoxyribonucleic acid, I. Repair of single-strand breaks in DNA by an enzyme system from Escherichia coli infected with T4 bacteriophage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 1021–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 5340583 | pmc = 224649 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.4.1021 | bibcode = 1967PNAS...57.1021W }}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining the two enzymes it became possible to "cut and paste" DNA sequences to create [[recombinant DNA]]. [[Plasmid]]s, discovered in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederberg J | title = Cell genetics and hereditary symbiosis | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 403–30 | date = October 1952 | pmid = 13003535 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.1952.32.4.403 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.458.985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became important [[Vector (molecular biology)|tools]] for transferring information between cells and [[molecular cloning|replicating]] DNA sequences.  [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, allowed small sections of DNA to be amplified (replicated) and aided identification and isolation of genetic material.

As well as manipulating DNA, techniques had to be developed for its insertion into an organism's genome. Griffith's experiment had already shown that some bacteria had [[natural competence|the ability to naturally uptake and express foreign DNA]]. Artificial competence was induced in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in 1970 by treating them with [[calcium chloride]] solution (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandel M, Higa A | title = Calcium-dependent bacteriophage DNA infection | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–62 | date = October 1970 | pmid = 4922220 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90051-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation using [[electroporation]] was developed in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency and bacterial range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirth R, Friesenegger A, Fiedler S | title = Transformation of various species of gram-negative bacteria belonging to 11 different genera by electroporation | journal = Molecular &amp; General Genetics | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 175–7 | date = March 1989 | pmid = 2659971 | doi = 10.1007/BF00332248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', had been discovered. In the early 1970s it was found that this bacteria inserted its DNA into plants using a [[Ti plasmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Nester| first = Eugene | title = Agrobacterium: The Natural Genetic Engineer (100 Years Later) | url = http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Agrobacterium.aspx | access-date = 14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with ''A. tumefaciens'' and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zambryski P, Joos H, Genetello C, Leemans J, Montagu MV, Schell J | title = Ti plasmid vector for the introduction of DNA into plant cells without alteration of their normal regeneration capacity | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2143–50 | year = 1983 | pmid = 16453482 | pmc = 555426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choosing target genes ==
The first step is to identify the target gene or genes to insert into the host organism. This is driven by the goal for the resultant organism. In some cases only one or two genes are affected. For more complex objectives entire [[biosynthetic pathway]]s involving multiple genes may be involved. Once found genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification, creating [[genetically modified bacteria]] in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80&amp;nbsp;°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Rediscovering Biology - Online Textbook: Unit 13 Genetically Modified Organisms|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic screen]]s can be carried out to determine potential genes followed by other tests identify the best candidates. A simple screen involves randomly [[Mutation|mutating]] DNA with chemicals or radiation and then selecting those that display the desired trait. For organisms where mutation is not practical, scientist instead look for individuals among the population who present the characteristic through naturally-occurring mutations. Processes that look at a [[phenotype]] and then try and identify the gene responsible are called [[forward genetics]]. The gene then needs to be [[Genetic mapping|mapped]] by comparing the inheritance of the phenotype with known [[genetic marker]]s. Genes that are close together are likely to be inherited together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alberts|first=Bruce |last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis|first3=Julian |last4=Raff|first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter|first6=Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition=   | chapter = Studying Gene Expression and Function | chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/ | location = New York | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option is [[reverse genetics]]. This approach involves targeting a specific gene with a mutation and then observing what phenotype develops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mutation can be designed to [[Null allele|inactivate the gene]] or only allow it to become active only under certain conditions. [[Conditional mutation]]s are useful for identifying genes that are normally lethal if non-functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Anthony JF |last2=Miller |first2=Jeffrey H. |last3=Suzuki |first3=David T. |last4=Lewontin |first4=Richard C. |last5=Gelbart |first5=William M | name-list-format = vanc |date=2000 | title = An Introduction to Genetic Analysis | edition=   7th | chapter = Mutant types | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22011/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; As genes with similar functions share similar sequences ([[Sequence homology|homologous]]) it is possible to predict the likely function of a gene by comparing its sequence to that of well-studied genes from [[model organism]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The development of [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[transcriptome]]s and [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] has made it much easier to find desirable genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jWJ1CgAAQBAJ|page=242}}|title=Current Technologies in Plant Molecular Breeding: A Guide Book of Plant Molecular Breeding for Researchers|last=Koh|first=Hee-Jong|last2=Kwon|first2=Suk-Yoon|last3=Thomson|first3=Michael| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-08-26|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789401799966|location=|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacteria ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' was first discovered in 1901 as the causative agent in the death of [[silkworms]]. Due to these insecticidal properties the bacteria was used as a [[biological insecticide]], developed commercially in 1938. The [[cry protein]]s were discovered to provide the insecticidal activity in 1956 and by the 1980s scientists had successfully cloned the gene that codes for this protein and expressed it in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roh JY, Choi JY, Li MS, Jin BR, Je YH | title = Bacillus thuringiensis as a specific, safe, and effective tool for insect pest control | journal = Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–59 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 18051264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luck may also be involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/how-to-make-a-gmo/|title=How to Make a GMO |date=2015-08-09|work=Science in the News|access-date=2017-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene that provides resistance to the [[glyphosate]] herbicide was found, after seven years searching, in bacteria that were surviving in the outflow pipe of a [[Monsanto]] [[Glyphosate|RoundUp]] manufacturing facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler J | title = The growing menace from superweeds | journal = Scientific American | volume = 304 | issue = 5 | pages = 74–9 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21595408 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0511-74 | bibcode = 2011SciAm.304e..74A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals the majority of genes used are [[growth hormone]] genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The process of genetic modification|author=Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4955e/y4955e06.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene manipulation==
All genetic engineering processes involve the modification of DNA. Traditionally DNA was isolated from the cells of organisms. Later, genes came to be [[molecular cloning|cloned]] from a DNA segment after the creation of a [[DNA library]] or [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesised]]. Once isolated, additional genetic elements are added to the gene to allow it to be expressed in the host organism and to aid selection.

=== Extraction from cells ===
{{Main|DNA extraction}}
First the cell must be gently [[Lysis|opened]], exposing the DNA without causing too much damage to it. The methods used vary depending on the type of cell. Once open, the DNA must be separated from the other cellular components. A ruptured cell contains proteins and other cell debris. By mixing with [[Phenol–chloroform extraction|phenol and/or chloroform]], followed by [[Centrifuge|centrifuging]], the nucleic acids can be separated from this debris into an upper [[aqueous phase]]. This aqueous phase can be removed and further purified if necessary by repeating the phenol-chloroform steps. The nucleic acids can then be [[precipitated]] from the aqueous solution using [[ethanol]] or [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]]. Any [[RNA]] can be removed by adding a [[ribonuclease]] that will degrade it. Many companies now sell kits that simplify the process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g1v6WMHVkTgC}}|title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering | vauthors = Nicholl ST |date=29 May 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-47178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene isolation ===
The gene of interest must be separated from the extracted DNA. If the sequence is not known then a common method is to break the DNA up with a random digestion method. This is usually accomplished using [[restriction enzymes]] (enzymes that cut DNA). A partial [[restriction digest]] cuts only some of the restriction sites, resulting in overlapping DNA fragment segments. The DNA fragments are put into individual [[plasmid|plasmid vectors]] and grown inside bacteria. Once in the bacteria the plasmid is copied as the [[Bacterial growth|bacteria divides]]. To determine if a useful gene is present on a particular fragment the DNA library is screened for the desired [[phenotype]]. If the phenotype is detected then it is possible that the bacteria contains the target gene.

If the gene does not have a detectable phenotype or a DNA library does not contain the correct gene, other methods must be used to isolate it. If the position of the gene can be determined using [[molecular markers]] then [[chromosome walking]] is one way to isolate the correct DNA fragment. If the gene expresses close [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to a known gene in another species, then it could be isolated by searching for genes in the library that closely match the known gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PfJviR3cCtYC|page=85}}|title=Genetic Techniques for Biological Research: A Case Study Approach|last=Michels|first=Corinne A.| name-list-format = vanc |date=10 June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89919-8|pp=85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For known DNA sequences, restriction enzymes that cut the DNA on either side of the gene can be used. [[Gel electrophoresis]] then sorts the fragments according to length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J |title= Isolating, Cloning, and Sequencing DNA|edition=  4th |location=New York|publisher=Garland Science|year= 2002|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26837/|chapter=8|displayauthors= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gels can separate sequences that differ by a single [[Base pair|base-pair]]. The DNA can be visualised by staining it with [[ethidium bromide]] and photographing under [[UV light]]. A [[DNA ladder|marker]] with fragments of known lengths can be laid alongside the DNA to estimate the size of each band. The DNA band at the correct size should contain the gene, where it can be excised from the gel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|40–41}} Another technique to isolate genes of known sequences involves [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufman RI, Nixon BT | title = Use of PCR to isolate genes encoding sigma54-dependent activators from diverse bacteria | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 178 | issue = 13 | pages = 3967–70 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8682806 | pmc = 232662 | doi = 10.1128/jb.178.13.3967-3970.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PCR is a powerful tool that can amplify a given sequence, which can then be isolated through gel electrophoresis. Its effectiveness drops with larger genes and it has the potential to introduce errors into the sequence.

It is possible to artificially [[Gene synthesis|synthesise genes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang J, Luo Y, Zhao H | title = Synthetic biology: putting synthesis into biology | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–20 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21064036| pmc = 3057768 | doi = 10.1002/wsbm.104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some synthetic sequences are available commercially, forgoing many of these early steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/tw/en/home/life-science/cloning/gene-synthesis/geneart-gene-synthesis.html|title=GeneArt Gene Synthesis|website=www.thermofisher.com |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modification ===
The gene to be inserted must be combined with other genetic elements in order for it to work properly. The gene can be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. As well as the gene to be inserted most [[DNA construct|constructs]] contain a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region as well as a [[selectable marker]] gene. The promoter region initiates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene and can be used to control the location and level of gene expression, while the terminator region ends transcription. A selectable marker, which in most cases confers [[antibiotic resistance]] to the organism it is expressed in, is used to determine which cells are transformed with the new gene. The constructs are made using [[recombinant DNA]] techniques, such as [[restriction digest]]s, [[DNA ligase|ligations]] and [[molecular cloning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg P, Mertz JE | title = Personal reflections on the origins and emergence of recombinant DNA technology | journal = Genetics | volume = 184 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–17 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20061565 | pmc = 2815933 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.109.112144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inserting DNA into the host genome==
{{Main|Gene delivery||}}Once the gene is constructed it must be stably integrated into the target organisms genome or exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. There are a number of techniques available for inserting the gene into the host genome and they vary depending on the type of organism targeted. In multicellular [[eukaryote]]s, if the [[transgene]] is incorporated into the host's [[germline]] cells, the resulting host cell can pass the transgene to its [[Offspring|progeny]]. If the transgene is incorporated into [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells, the transgene can not be inherited.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nayerossadat N, Maedeh T, Ali PA | title = Viral and nonviral delivery systems for gene delivery | journal = Advanced Biomedical Research | volume = 1 | pages = 27 | date = 6 July 2012 | pmid = 23210086 | pmc = 3507026 | doi = 10.4103/2277-9175.98152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation ===
{{Main|Transformation (genetics)}}
[[File:Bacterial Transformation.svg|thumb|Bacterial transformation involves moving a gene from one bacteria to another. It is integrated into the recipients plasmid. and can then be expressed by the new host.]]
Transformation is the direct alteration of a cells genetic components by passing the genetic material through the [[cell membrane]]. About 1% of bacteria are naturally able to [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]], but this ability can be induced in other bacteria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen I, Dubnau D | title = DNA uptake during bacterial transformation | journal = Nature Reviews.

Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing [[divalent]] [[cation]]s (often [[calcium chloride]]) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse (heat shock). Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA to enter the host cell. It is suggested that exposing the cells to divalent cations in cold condition may change or weaken the cell surface structure, making it more permeable to DNA. The heat-pulse is thought to create a thermal imbalance across the cell membrane, which forces the DNA to enter the cells through either cell pores or the damaged cell wall. [[Electroporation]] is another method of promoting competence.  In this method the cells are briefly shocked with an [[electric field]] of 10-20 [[Volt|kV]]/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter.  After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell's membrane-repair mechanisms. Up-taken DNA can either integrate with the bacterials genome or, more commonly, exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]].

The bacteria will attach to many of the plant cells exposed by the cuts. The bacteria uses [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] to transfer a DNA segment called [[T-DNA]] from its plasmid into the plant. The transferred DNA is piloted to the plant cell nucleus and integrated into the host plants genomic DNA.The plasmid T-DNA is integrated semi-randomly into the [[genome]] of the host cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Francis KE, Spiker S | title = Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana transformants without selection reveals a high occurrence of silenced T-DNA integrations | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–77 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15659104 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313x.2004.02312.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By modifying the plasmid to express the gene of interest, researchers can insert their chosen gene stably into the plants genome.

Another method used to transform plant cells is [[biolistics]], where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Graham |last=Head |last2=Hull |first2=Roger H |last3=Tzotzos |first3=George T. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Genetically Modified Plants: Assessing Safety and Managing Risk |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=2009 |page=244 |isbn=978-0-12-374106-6 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genetic material enters the cells and transforms them. This method can be used on plants that are not susceptible to ''Agrobacterium'' infection and also allows transformation of plant [[plastids]].

Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Darbani |first1=Behrooz |last2=Farajnia |first2=Safar |last3=Toorchi |first3=Mahmoud |last4=Zakerbostanabad |first4=Saeed |last5=Noeparvar |first5=Shahin |last6=Neal Stewart |first6=C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=DNA-Delivery Methods to Produce Transgenic Plants |journal=Biotechnology (Faisalabad) |date=March 2008 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=385–402 |doi=10.3923/biotech.2008.385.402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfection ===
{{Main|Transfection}}
Transformation has a [[Malignant transformation|different meaning]] in relation to animals, indicating progression to a cancerous state, so the process used to insert foreign DNA into animal cells is usually called transfection.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21052/|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Garland Science|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8153-4072-0|location=New York|page=G:35 |author-link1=Bruce Alberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways to directly introduce DNA into animal cells ''[[in vitro]]''. Often these cells are [[stem cell]]s that are used for [[gene therapy]]. Chemical based methods uses natural or synthetic compounds to form particles that facilitate the transfer of genes into cells.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamimura K, Suda T, Zhang G, Liu D | title = Advances in Gene Delivery Systems | journal = Pharmaceutical Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 293–306 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22200988 | pmc = 3245684 | doi = 10.2165/11594020-000000000-00000 | doi-broken-date = 2018-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These synthetic vectors have the ability to bind DNA and accommodate large genetic transfers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pack DW, Hoffman AS, Pun S, Stayton PS | title = Design and development of polymers for gene delivery | journal = Nature Reviews.

Positively charged liposomes bind with DNA, while polymers can designed that interact with DNA.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; They form lipoplexes and polyplexes respectively, which are then up-taken by the cells. Other techniques include using electroporation and biolistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biocyclopedia.com/index/genetics/genetic_engineering_and_biotechnology_gene_transfer_methods_and_transgenic_organisms/gene_transfer_transfection_methods_in_animals.php|title=Gene transfer (transfection) methods in animals {{!}} Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology  Gene Transfer Methods and Transgenic Organisms {{!}} Genetics, Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Botany {{!}} Biocyclopedia.com|last=Biocyclopedia.com|website=biocyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create [[transgenic animals]] the DNA must be inserted into viable embryos or eggs. This is usually accomplished using [[microinjection]], where DNA is injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Superovulation|Superovulated]] fertilised eggs are collected at the single cell stage and cultured ''in vitro''. When the [[Pronucleus|pronuclei]] from the sperm head and egg are visible through the [[protoplasm]] the genetic material is injected into one of them. The [[oocyte]] is then implanted in the [[oviduct]] of a [[Pseudopregnancy|pseudopregnant]] animal.&lt;ref name="tulane"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tulane.edu/sse/tgmouse/pronuclear.cfm | title = Pronuclear Injection |last=Mullin|first=Ann | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Tulane University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is Embryonic Stem Cell-Mediated Gene Transfer. The gene is transfected into [[embryonic stem cell]]s and then they are inserted into mouse [[blastocyst]]s that are then implanted into foster mothers. The resulting offspring are [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]], and further mating can produce mice fully transgenic with the gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/transgenicanimalscom/contact-me/embryonic-stem-cell-mediated-gene-transfer|title=Embryonic Stem Cell-Mediated Gene Transfer - transgenicanimals|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transduction ===
{{Main|Transduction (genetics)}}

Transduction is the process by which foreign [[DNA]] is introduced into a cell by a [[virus]] or [[viral vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Transduction, Genetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically modified viruses can be used as [[viral vector]]s to transfer target genes to another organism in [[gene therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/pages/2006chapter4.aspx|title=Stemcells Redirection|website=stemcells.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; First the virulent genes are removed from the virus and the target genes are inserted instead. The sequences that allow the virus to insert the genes into the host organism must be left intact. Popular virus vectors are developed from [[retrovirus]]es or [[adenoviruses]]. Other viruses used as vectors include, [[lentivirus]]es, [[pox viruses]] and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes viruses]]. The type of virus used will depend on the cells targeted and whether the DNA is to be altered permanently or temporarily.

=== Regeneration ===
As often only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through the use of [[Plant tissue culture|tissue c]][[Plant tissue culture|ulture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuomela M, Stanescu I, Krohn K | title = Validation overview of bio-analytical methods | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 12 Suppl 1 | issue = S1 | pages = S131–8 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16231045 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-M4lR-pxqJMC|title=Plant Cell and Tissue Culture| vauthors = Narayanaswamy S |date=1994|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780074602775|location=|pages=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each plant species has different requirements for successful regeneration. If successful, the technique produces an adult plant that contains the [[transgene]] in every cell.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the [[embryonic stem cells]].&lt;ref name = "NRC_2004" /&gt; Offspring can be screened for the gene. All offspring from the first generation are [[heterozygous]] for the inserted gene and must be inbred to produce a [[homozygous]] specimen.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally so regeneration is not necessary. [[Selectable markers]] are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells.

Cells that have been successfully transformed with the DNA contain the marker gene, while those not transformed will not. By growing the cells in the presence of an antibiotic or chemical that [[Selection (biology)|selects]] or marks the cells expressing that gene, it is possible to separate modified from unmodified cells. Another screening method involves a [[DNA probe]] that sticks only to the inserted gene. These markers are usually present in the transgenic organism, although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hohn B, Levy AA, Puchta H | title = Elimination of selection markers from transgenic plants | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–43 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11287227 | doi = 10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00188-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confirmation ===

Finding that a recombinant organism contains the inserted genes is not usually sufficient to ensure that they will be appropriately expressed in the intended tissues. Further testing using PCR, [[Southern hybridization]], and [[DNA sequencing]] is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aGkXFmqOcyIC&amp;dq=Genetic+Engineering+analysis+of+DNA+PCR+Southern+sequencing|title=Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods|last=Setlow|first=Jane K.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2002-10-31|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306472800|location=|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene. Once confirmed methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used to assess gene expression, transcription, RNA processing patterns and expression and localization of protein product(s). These include [[northern hybridization|northern hybridisation]], quantitative [[RT-PCR]], [[Western blot]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[ELISA]] and phenotypic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deepak S, Kottapalli K, Rakwal R, Oros G, Rangappa K, Iwahashi H, Masuo Y, Agrawal G | title = Real-Time PCR: Revolutionizing Detection and Expression Analysis of Genes | journal = Current Genomics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 234–51 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18645596 | pmc = 2430684 | doi = 10.2174/138920207781386960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When appropriate, the organism's offspring are studied to confirm that the transgene and associated [[phenotype]] are stably inherited.

== Gene targeting ==
{{Main|Gene targeting|Genome editing}}

Traditional methods of genetic engineering generally insert the new genetic material randomly within the host genome.  This can impair or alter other genes within the organism. Methods were developed that inserted the new genetic material into [[Locus (genetics)|specific sites]] within an organism genome. Early methods that targeted genes at certain sites within a genome relied on [[homologous recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Cell Biology|vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, Matsudaira P, Baltimore D, Darnell J|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7167-3136-8|edition= 4th|chapter=Chapter 8.5: Gene Replacement and Transgenic Animals: DNA Is Transferred into Eukaryotic Cells in Various Ways}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating DNA constructs that contain a template that matches the targeted genome sequence, it is possible that the HR processes within the cell will insert the construct at the desired location. Using this method on [[embryonic stem cell]]s led to the development of [[transgenic mice]] with targeted [[Gene knockouts|knocked out]]. It has also been possible to [[Gene knock-in|knock in]] genes or alter [[gene expression]] patterns.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rocha-Martins|first=Maurício|last2=Cavalheiro|first2=Gabriel R.|last3=Matos-Rodrigues|first3=Gabriel E.|last4=Martins|first4=Rodrigo a.

If a vital gene is knocked out it can prove lethal to the organism. In order to study the function of these genes, [[Site-specific recombinase technology|site specific recombinases]] (SSR) were used. The two most common types are the [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-LoxP]] and [[FLP-FRT recombination|Flp-FRT]] systems. [[Cre recombinase]] is an enzyme that removes DNA by homologous recombination between binding sequences known as Lox-P sites. The Flip-FRT system operates in a similar way, with the Flip recombinase recognizing FRT sequences. By crossing an organism containing the recombinase sites flanking the gene of interest with an organism that expresses the SSR under control of [[Promoter (genetics)|tissue specific promoters]], it is possible to knock out or switch on genes only in certain cells. This has also been used to remove marker genes from transgenic animals. Further modifications of these systems allowed researchers to induce recombination only under certain conditions, allowing genes to be knocked out or expressed at desired times or [[Prenatal development|stages of development]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Genome editing uses artificially engineered [[nuclease]]s that create specific [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]]  at desired locations in the genome. The breaks are subject to cellular [[DNA repair]] processes that can be exploited for targeted gene knock-out, correction or insertion at high frequencies. If a donor DNA containing the appropriate sequence (homologies) is present, then new genetic material containing the transgene will be integrated at the targeted site with high efficiency by [[homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are four families of engineered nucleases: [[meganuclease]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grizot S, Smith J, Daboussi F, Prieto J, Redondo P, Merino N, Villate M, Thomas S, Lemaire L, Montoya G, Blanco FJ, Pâques F, Duchateau P | title = Efficient targeting of a SCID gene by an engineered single-chain homing endonuclease | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 16 | pages = 5405–19 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19584299 | pmc = 2760784 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp548 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao H, Smith J, Yang M, Jones S, Djukanovic V, Nicholson MG, West A, Bidney D, Falco SC, Jantz D, Lyznik LA | title = Heritable targeted mutagenesis in maize using a designed endonuclease | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–87 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19811621 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04041.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend JA, Wright DA, Winfrey RJ, Fu F, Maeder ML, Joung JK, Voytas DF | title = High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 442–5 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404258 | pmc = 2743854 | doi = 10.1038/nature07845 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..442T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shukla VK, Doyon Y, Miller JC, DeKelver RC, Moehle EA, Worden SE, Mitchell JC, Arnold NL, Gopalan S, Meng X, Choi VM, Rock JM, Wu YY, Katibah GE, Zhifang G, McCaskill D, Simpson MA, Blakeslee B, Greenwalt SA, Butler HJ, Hinkley SJ, Zhang L, Rebar EJ, Gregory PD, Urnov FD | title = Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 437–41 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404259 | doi = 10.1038/nature07992 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..437S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALEN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christian M, Cermak T, Doyle EL, Schmidt C, Zhang F, Hummel A, Bogdanove AJ, Voytas DF | title = Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases | journal = Genetics | volume = 186 | issue = 2 | pages = 757–61 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20660643 | pmc = 2942870 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.110.120717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li T, Huang S, Jiang WZ, Wright D, Spalding MH, Weeks DP, Yang B | title = TAL nucleases (TALNs): hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 359–72 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20699274 | pmc = 3017587 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; t[[CRISPR|he CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPRassociated protein (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esvelt KM, Wang HH | title = Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 641 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23340847 | pmc = 3564264 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Tan WS, Carlson DF, Walton MW, Fahrenkrug SC, Hackett PB | title = Precision editing of large animal genomes | volume = 80 | issue =  | pages = 37–97 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23084873 | pmc = 3683964 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-404742-6.00002-8 | isbn = 9780124047426 | series = Advances in Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the four types, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas are the two most commonly used.&lt;ref name=pmid28451378&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s13578-017-0148-4 |pmid=28451378 |pmc=5404292 |title=Plant genome editing with TALEN and CRISPR |journal=Cell &amp; Bioscience |volume=7 |pages=21 |year=2017 |last1=Malzahn |first1=Aimee |last2=Lowder |first2=Levi |last3=Qi |first3=Yiping }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances have looked at combining multiple systems to  exploit the best features of both (e.g. megaTAL that are a fusion of a TALE DNA binding domain and a meganuclease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boissel S, Jarjour J, Astrakhan A, Adey A, Gouble A, Duchateau P, Shendure J, Stoddard BL, Certo MT, Baker D, Scharenberg AM | title = megaTALs: a rare-cleaving nuclease architecture for therapeutic genome engineering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 2591–601 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24285304 | pmc = 3936731 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has also focused on developing strategies to create gene knock-out or corrections without creating double stranded breaks (base editors).&lt;ref name=pmid28451378/&gt;

=== Meganucleases and Zinc finger nucleases ===
Meganucleases were first used in 1988 in mammalian cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7882137 |year=1994 |last1=Choulika |first1=A. |title=The yeast I-Sce I meganuclease induces site-directed chromosomal recombination in mammalian cells |journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences.

F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meganucleases are [[endodeoxyribonucleases]] that function as restriction enzymes with long recognition sites, making them are more specific to their target site than other [[restriction enzyme]]s. This increases their specificity and reduces their toxicity as they will not target as many sites within a genome. The most studied meganucleases are the [[Homing endonuclease#Structural families|LAGLIDADG family]]. While meganucleases are still quite susceptible to off-target binding, which makes them less attractive than other gene editing tools, their smaller size still makes them attractive particularly for viral vectorization perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), used for the first time in 1996, are typically created through the fusion of Zinc-finger domains and the ''Fok''I nuclease domain. ZFNs have thus the ability to cleave DNA at target sites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll D | title = Genome engineering with zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Genetics | volume = 188 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–82 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21828278 | pmc = 3176093 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.131433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By engineering the zinc finger domain to target a specific site within the genome, it is possible to edit the genomic sequence at the desired [[Locus (genetics)|location]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva G, Poirot L, Galetto R, Smith J, Montoya G, Duchateau P, Pâques F | title = Meganucleases and other tools for targeted genome engineering: perspectives and challenges for gene therapy | journal = Current Gene Therapy | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–27 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21182466 | pmc = 3267165 | doi = 10.2174/156652311794520111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva GH, Belfort M, Wende W, Pingoud A | title = From monomeric to homodimeric endonucleases and back: engineering novel specificity of LAGLIDADG enzymes | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 361 | issue = 4 | pages = 744–54 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16872628 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; ZFNs have a greater specificity, but still hold the potential to bind to non-specific sequences.. While a certain amount of off-target cleavage is acceptable for creating transgenic model organisms, they might not be optimal for all human gene therapy treatments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== TALEN and CRISPR ===
Access to the code governing the DNA recognition by transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) in 2009 opened the way to the development of a new class of efficient TAL-based gene editing tools. TALE, proteins secreted by the Xanthomonas plant pathogen, bind with great specificity to genes within the plant host and initiate [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]  of the genes helping infection. Engineering TALE by fusing the DNA binding core to the [[Fok1 nuclease|''Fok''I nuclease]] catalytic domain allowed creation of a new tool of designer nucleases, the TALE nuclease (TALEN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.120717 |pmid=20660643 |pmc=2942870 |title=Targeting DNA Double-Strand Breaks with TAL Effector Nucleases |journal=Genetics |volume=186 |issue=2 |pages=757–761 |year=2010 |last1=Christian |first1=M. |last2=Cermak |first2=T. |last3=Doyle |first3=E.

F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one of the greatest specificities of all the current engineered nucleases. Due to the presence of repeat sequences, they are difficult to construct through standard molecular biology procedure and rely on more complicated method of such as [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden gate cloning]].&lt;ref name=pmid28451378/&gt; 

In 2011, another major breakthrough technology was developed based on CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat / CRISPR associated protein) systems that function as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and [[archaea]].  The CRISPR/Cas system allows bacteria and archaea to fight against invading viruses by cleaving viral DNA and inserting pieces of that DNA into their own genome. The organism then transcribed this DNA into [[RNA]] and combined with [[Cas9]] proteins to make double-stranded breaks in the invading viral DNA. By pairing Cas proteins with a designed guide RNA CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to induce double-stranded breaks at specific points within DNA sequences. It was later demonstrating that CRISPR/Cas9 could edit human cells in a dish. Although the early generation lacks the specificity of TALEN, the major advantage of this technology is the simplicity of the design. It also allows multiple sites to be targeted simultaneously, allowing the editing of multiple genes at once. [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] is a more recently discovered system that requires a different guide RNA to create particular double-stranded breaks (leaves overhangs when cleaving the DNA) when compared to CRISPR/Cas9.&lt;ref name=pmid28451378/&gt;

'''Human migration''' is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location. The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title=  Migrations country wise|accessdate=7 June 2014}}. One of the major migration rushes took place in the gold run in 19th century in California, Australia, and Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who moves from their home to another place because of natural disaster or civil disturbance may be described as a [[refugee]] or, especially within the same country, a [[displaced person]]. A person seeking refuge from political, religious, or other forms of persecution is usually described as an [[asylum seeker]].

[[Nomad]]ic movements are normally not regarded as migrations as there is no intention to settle in the new place and because the movement is generally [[Seasonal human migration|seasonal]]. Only a few nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Also, the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places.

Many estimates of statistics in worldwide migration patterns exist.

The [[World Bank]] has published its ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' annually since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organisation for Migration]] (IOM) has published a yearly ''World Migration Report'' since 1999. The [[United Nations Statistics Division]] also keeps a database on worldwide migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/wallchart2013.htm | title=United Nations Population Division &amp;#124; Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in research on migration via the Internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oiarzabal | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Reips | first2 = U.-D. | year = 2012 | title = Migration and diaspora in the age of information and communication technologies | url = | journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1333–1338 | doi = 10.1080/1369183X.2012.698202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reips, U.-D., &amp; Buffardi, L. (2012). Studying migrants with the help of the Internet: Methods from psychology, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 38(9), 1405–1424. doi:10.1080/1369183X.2012.698208 http://www.uni-konstanz.de/iscience/reips/pubs/papers/2012ReipsBuffardi_JEMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial internal migration can also take place within a country, either [[seasonal human migration]] (mainly related to agriculture and to tourism to urban places), or shifts of population into cities ([[urbanisation]]) or out of cities ([[suburbanisation]]). Studies of worldwide migration patterns, however, tend to limit their scope to [[international migration]].

The World Bank's ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' of 2011 lists the following estimates for the year 2010: total number of immigrants: 215.8 million or 3.2% of world population.  In 2013, the percentage of international migrants worldwide increased by 33% with 59% of migrants targeting developed regions.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unfpa.org/resources/international-migration-2013-wall-chart|title= International Migration 2013 (wall chart) |year= 2013 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost half of these migrants are women, which is one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half century.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Women migrate alone or with their family members and community. Even though female migration is largely viewed as associations rather than independent migration, emerging studies argue complex and manifold reasons for this.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, M. (2008). Series Introduction in Palriwala and Uberoi (Eds.), Women and Migration in Asia (p. 359). New Delhi: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-3675-6}} (Pb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often{{quantify|date=September 2015}} a distinction is made {{by whom|date=September 2015}} between voluntary and involuntary migration, or between [[refugee]]s fleeing political conflict or natural disaster vs. economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]], but these distinctions are difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated. The World Bank's report estimates that, as of 2010, 16.3 million or 7.6% of migrants qualified as refugees. At the end of 2012, approximately 15.4 million people were refugees and persons in refugee-like situations - 87% of them found asylum in developing countries.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

Structurally, there is substantial South-South and North-North migration, i.e., most emigrants from high-income O.E.C.D. countries migrate to other high-income countries, and a substantial part (estimated at 43%) of emigrants from developing countries migrate to other developing countries. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that "[while the North has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000 (32 million) compared to the South (25 million), the South recorded a higher growth rate.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2013 the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in the developing regions (2.3%) slightly exceeded that of the developed regions (2.1%).&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

==Forced Migration==


The Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM), launched in 2003, published a report in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The 90-page report, along with supporting evidence, is available on the GCIM website [http://www.gcim.org gcim.org]&lt;/ref&gt; International migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the [[Global Forum on Migration and Development]] and the [[Global Migration Group]], both established in 2006.

The United Nations reported that 2014 had the highest level of forced migration on record: 59.5 million individuals, caused by "persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations", as compared with 51.2 million in 2013 (an increase of 8.3 million) and with 37.5 million a decade prior. {{As of | 2015}} one of every 122 humans is a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Worldwide displacement hits all-time high as war and persecution increase |url = http://www.unhcr.org/558193896.html |accessdate = 2015-09-21 |first = United Nations High Commissioner for |last = Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] has published 5 maps showing human migrations in progress in 2015 based on the UN report.&lt;ref&gt;

==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==

===Overview===

Numerous causes impel migrants to move to another country. For instance, [[globalization]] has increased the demand for workers in order to sustain national economies. Thus one category of [[economic migrant]]s - generally from impoverished developing countries - migrates to obtain sufficient income for survival.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unfpa.org/migration | title=Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such migrants often send some of their income home to family members in the form of [[remittances|economic remittances]], which have become an economic staple in a number of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jason de Parle, "A Good Provider is One Who Leaves", ''New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; People may also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict, of [[human rights violations | human-rights violations]], of violence, or to escape persecution. In 2013 it was estimated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} that around 51.2 million people fell into this category.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Other reasons people may move include to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather. This type of movement, usually from rural to urban areas, may class as [[internal migration]].&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Socio-cultural and geo-historical factors also play a major role. In North Africa, for example, emigrating Europe counts as a sign of social prestige. Moreover, many countries were former [[colony | colonies]]. This means that many have relatives who live legally in the (former) colonial [[metropole]], and who often provide important help for immigrants arriving in that metropole.&lt;ref&gt;
For example: [[Moroccans in France]], [[Filipino Americans | Filipinos in the United States of America]], [[Koreans in Japan]] or [[Samoans in New Zealand]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Relatives may help with job research and with accommodation. The geographical proximity of Africa to Europe and the long historical ties between Northern and Southern Mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Fanack|title= The Key Drivers of North African Illegal Migration to Europe|url= https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|website= Fanack.com|accessdate= 14 July 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150714172715/https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|archivedate= 14 July 2015|df= | quote = The proximity of North Africa to southern Europe, the liberal mobility policies of most European countries, and the historical links between northern and southern Mediterranean countries are all key factors encouraging people to migrate to Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of theories attempt to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"&gt;
Jennissen, R. 2007. "Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach." Population Research and Policy Review 26(4). 411 – 36.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economic theory===
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}This theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007" /&gt;

===Dual labor market theory===

Dual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===New economics of labor migration===

This theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt; Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers’ ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration'', April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation'', November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative deprivation theory===
{{main|Relative deprivation}}
Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===World systems theory===

[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===

Old migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants" draft paper présented in the international conference on “Crossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development”, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco – March 2–4, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper&lt;/ref&gt; studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration" Revue Algérienne d’Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N°: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration&lt;/ref&gt; explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].

==Sociological and Political Science theories==

===Sociology===
{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level; [[social conflict theory]] examines migration through the prism of competition for power and resources; [[structural functionalism]], based on the ideas of [[Émile Durkheim]], examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie|despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s.

More recently, as attention shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sBJTOhDpauQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=schiller+basch#v=onepage&amp;q=schiller%20basch&amp;f=false|title=Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States|last=Basch|first=Linda|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|last3=Blanc|first3=Christina Szanton|date=2005-09-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135307035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, work on social remittances by [[Peggy Levitt]] and others has led to a stronger conceptualisation of how migrants affect socio-political processes in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|date=1998|title=Social Remittances: Migration Driven Local-Level Forms of Cultural Diffusion|jstor=2547666|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=32|issue=4|pages=926–948|doi=10.2307/2547666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have put forth a number of theoretical frameworks on migration, offering different perspectives on processes of [[International security|security]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Faist|first=Thomas|date=2006|pages=103–119|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781403984678_6|isbn=9781349532650|title=Migration, Citizenship, Ethnos|chapter=The Migration-Security Nexus: International Migration and Security Before and After 9/11|hdl=2043/686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamson|first=Fiona B.|date=July 2006|title=Crossing Borders: International Migration and National Security|journal=International Security|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–199|doi=10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.165|issn=0162-2889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[citizenship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-citizenship-9780198805854?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship|date=2017-08-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198805854|editor-last=Shachar|editor-first=Ayelet|series=Oxford Handbooks in Law|location=Oxford, New York|editor-last2=Bauboeck|editor-first2=Rainer|editor-last3=Bloemraad|editor-first3=Irene|editor-last4=Vink|editor-first4=Maarten}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wERHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration|title=Migration Theory: Talking across Disciplines|last=Brettell|first=Caroline B.|last2=Hollifield|first2=James F.|date=2014-08-25|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317805984|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political importance of [[diaspora]]s has also become a growing field of interest, as scholars examine questions of diaspora [[activism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2006-02-23|title=Towards a Political Theory of Migrant Transnationalism|journal=International Migration Review|volume=37|issue=3|pages=700–723|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00155.x|issn=0197-9183}}&lt;/ref&gt; state-diaspora relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Délano|first=Alexandra|last2=Gamlen|first2=Alan|date=July 2014|title=Comparing and theorizing state–diaspora relations|journal=Political Geography|volume=41|pages=43–53|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.05.005|issn=0962-6298|hdl=2440/102448}}&lt;/ref&gt; out-of-country [[voting]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lafleur|first=Jean-Michel|date=2014|title=The enfranchisement of citizens abroad: variations and explanations|journal=Democratization|volume=22 |issue=5|pages=840–860|doi=10.1080/13510347.2014.979163|url=https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/181007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states' [[soft power]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2018|title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=39 |issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1177/0192512118759902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, the majority of work has focused on immigration politics, viewing migration from the perspective of the country of destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oec_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration#v=onepage&amp;q=Oxford%20handbook%20citizenship%20migration&amp;f=false|title=Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective, Third Edition|last=Hollifield|first=James|last2=Martin|first2=Philip L.|last3=Orrenius|first3=Pia|date=2014-07-30|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804787352|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[emigration]] processes, political scientists have expanded on [[Albert O.

==Historical theories==

===Ravenstein===
Certain laws of [[social sciences|social science]] have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834–1913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:

# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''
# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.
# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.
# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.
# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.
# ''most migrants are adults.
# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.
# ''migration stage by stage.
# ''urban rural difference.
# ''migration and technology.
# ''economic condition.

===Lee===
Lee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|author= Everett S. Lee|year= 1966|publisher= University of Pennsylvania|volume=3|pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large. (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–99)

===Climate cycles===
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in [[Climate change|climatic cycles]], which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially [[Mongolia]] and to its west the [[Altai mountains|Altai]]. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term "migratory domino effect" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Université de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other models===
* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''&lt;ref&gt;Idyorough, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.

The Institute is non-partisan, autonomous from any partisan political organizations or interests and does not engage in advocacy.  It is based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] and its national membership comes from the legal, public policy and administration, and political science communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs03881.html See '''''Corporations Canada - Letters of Patent''''', File Number 447384-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject Matter==

Parliamentary and Political Law means the field of law, legal scholarship and legal practice relating to the functions and operations of parliamentary, governmental and judicial institutions and their respective officials.

Parliamentary Law means the body of law dealing with the establishment and functioning of parliamentary institutions, and includes the law of parliamentary privilege.

Political Law means the body of law dealing with the structure of the State and the processes of governing, with the application of legal, public policy and political instruments of governing, and with the impact of law on democratic governing.

Within the overall domain of public law, Parliamentary and Political Law is complementary to constitutional law and administrative law.  As an interdisciplinary study, it is distinct from, yet linked to, political science, and public policy and administration.

The Institute (and through its Journal) specializes in the interdisciplinary, comprehensive and comparative analysis of these topics.

==Publications and Programs==

The Institute publishes [http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/journal.aspx?section=36 The Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law] three times a year, which is available through [[Carswell (publishers)|Carswell Thomson]].

It also hosts a bi-annual conference, and The Third ''Law and Parliament'' Conference was held
November 2009 at the [[University of Toronto]].

'''Jaap van Ginneken''' (born September 8, 1943 in [[Hilversum]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] psychologist and communication scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Major interviews in Dutch:&lt;br /&gt;

PKZ, Belgium: {{YouTube|aSS0WNus8ws|Interview Jaap van Ginneken en Ludo Daems}} {{nl icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Van Ginneken completed a bachelor's degree at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], a master’s at the [[University of Amsterdam]], followed by a brief stint at the [[École pratique des Hautes études]] en sciences sociales in Paris, and finally a Ph. D. with distinction on [[mass psychology]] and [[crowd psychology]]. He taught at various universities, ultimately as a long-time associate professor at the International School and Communication Science Department of the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kumar, ''The writers dictionary'', Farmington Hills, Michigan: St. James Press 2011 (26th ed.). {{ISBN|1-55862-756-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Journalism==
For most of the 1970s, he worked as a Paris-based newspaper correspondent and roving reporter on third world affairs for Dutch media, with isolated contributions to foreign newspapers such as the French ''[[Le Monde]]'' and the British ''[[The Guardian]]''. In line with the spirit of [[May 1968 in France]] and widespread opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, he adhered to the [[unequal exchange]] and [[dependency theory]], and came to sympathize with [[liberation movements]] and [[third world]] revolutions. Two of his early  books then focused on the new conflicts arising from them. ''The rise and fall of Lin Piao'' (and the so-called ‘Gang of Four’) dealt with ultraleftism during the Chinese cultural revolution. ''The third Indochina war'' dealt with the subsequent confrontation between China, Vietnam and Cambodia.
In the course of the early 1980s, however, Van Ginneken recognized that he had become too much of a [[fellow traveler]], and returned to academic work in his original fields.

==Academic Work==
This covered three themes: first the history of science, second social, political and mass psychology, third media images of other cultures. On the first theme, he published a series of studies on the history of [[political psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;‘Outline of a cultural history’. Ch. 1, pp. 3-22, in W. Stone &amp; P. Schaffner (1988), ''The psychology of politics'', New York: Springer. French transl.: [http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/handle/2042/15128 "Hermès: documents irevues"]{{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[crowd psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;''Crowds, psychology and politics''. Reviews:

Ch. 7, pp. 220-244, in J. Jansz &amp; P. van Drunen (eds., 2004), ''A social history of psychology'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; He just completed a biography of Kurt Baschwitz: a Jewish- German- Dutch pioneer of communication studies and social psychology. The second theme concerned new approaches to [[mass psychology]] and [[collective behavior]] sociology, in line with [[complex adaptive systems]] and [[chaos theory]] ''in Collective behavior and public opinion – Rapid shifts'',&lt;ref&gt;''Collective behavior and public opinion''. (Dutch: ''Brein-bevingen''). Review: [http://readon.sg/det_11264691.aspx "Read On"].&lt;/ref&gt; with a further Dutch title on [[self-organization]] and [[swarming]].&lt;ref&gt;''De kracht van de zwerm – Zelfsturing in de organisatie'', Amsterdam: ''Amstel/ Business Contact'', 2009 (illustrated).

The third theme concerned a series of studies on [[media psychology]], and [[stereotypes]] about [[cultural identity]]. In the international [[news media]]: with ''Understanding global news''.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding global news''. (Dutch: ''De schepping van de wereld in het nieuws''). Review: [http://ecs.sagepub.com/content/2/3/423.extract "Sage Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt; In movies: with ''Screening difference – How Hollywood blockbusters imagine race, ethnicity and culture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Screening difference''.

[http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/69/4/323.abstract abstract: ''International Communication Gazette''].&lt;/ref&gt; with further Dutch titles on classical comic strips, interpersonal communication and the immigration debate.

Next to his academic work, Van Ginneken always remained involved in a wide range of non-academic projects, for instance in [[science communication]]: for national events, major museums and prime-time television. Today, he is an independent speaker and writer, based near Nice in France.

The Knuth Prize has been awarded since 1996 and includes an award of $5000. The prize is awarded by [[ACM SIGACT]] and by [[IEEE Computer Society]]'s Technical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. Prizes are awarded in alternation at the ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]] and at the IEEE [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]], which are among the most prestigious conferences in [[theoretical computer science]].

In contrast with the [[Gödel Prize]], which recognizes outstanding papers, the Knuth Prize is awarded to individuals for their overall impact in the field.

==Winners==
Since the prize was instituted in 1996, it has been awarded to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/Knuth/ | title = Knuth Prize | publisher = ACM SIGACT | date = February 17, 2014 | accessdate = September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winner lives in upstate New York. He is married to Gail P. Stuart and has three children. His interests include [[science]], [[technology]], American [[popular culture]], and theories of [[sustainability]].

Winner is known for his articles and books on science, technology, and society. He also spent several years as a reporter, rock music critic, and contributing editor for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/about/|title=About: Brief Biography|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and politics==
In 1980 Winner proposed that technologies embody social relations, i.e. power.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in ''Daedalus'', Vol. 109, No. 1, Winter 1980. Reprinted in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] and Judy Wajcman (London: Open University Press, 1985; second edition 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; To the question he poses "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", Winner identifies two ways in which artifacts can have politics.  The first, involving technical arrangements and social order, concerns how the invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts or the larger system becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community.  This way "transcends the simple categories of 'intended' and 'unintended' altogether", representing "instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and crushing setbacks by others" (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;25-6, 1999).  It implies that the process of technological development is critical in determining the politics of an artifact; hence the importance of incorporating all stakeholders in it. (Determining who the stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are other questions entirely.)

The second way in which artifacts can have politics refers to artifacts that correlate with particular kinds of political relationships, which Winner refers to as inherently political artifacts (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;22, 1999).  He distinguishes between two types of inherently political artifacts: those that require a particular sociological system and those that are strongly compatible with a particular sociological system (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;29, 1999).  A further distinction is made between conditions internal to the workings of a given technical system and those that are external to it (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;33, 1999).  This second way in which artifacts can have politics can be further articulated as consisting of four 'types' of artifacts: those requiring a particular internal sociological system, those compatible with a particular internal sociological system, those requiring a particular external sociological system, and those compatible with a particular external sociological system.

Certain features of Winner's thesis have been criticized by other scholars, including [[Bernward Joerges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2628379/Do_Politics_Have_Artefacts_1999_ An attempted rebuttal to Winner’s argument is Bernward Joerges’ “Do Politics have Artefacts?” (Requires sign-in)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such criticisms are often narrowly focused upon particular cases in Winner's essays, the height of the bridges built by Robert Moses on the Long Island Parkway, for example, and tend to overlook his general arguments about the interweaving of political institutions and technological devices.

==Music==
Winner contributed piano and backing vocals to the hoax album [[The Masked Marauders]] created by ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"&gt;{{citation | title = The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings | publisher = Rhino Records | accessdate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of educational technologies ==
Over the years one focus of Winner's criticism has been the excessive use of technologies in the classroom, both in K-12 schools and higher education. Winner's critique is well explained in his article "Information Technology and Educational Amnesia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=2009-12-01|title=Information Technology and Educational Amnesia|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/other-writings/2017/6/13/information-technology-and-educational-amnesia|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=7|issue=6|pages=587-591|doi=10.2304/pfie.2009.7.6.587|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed in his satirical lecture, "The Automatic Professor Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/videos-and-music/|title=Videos and Music|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3191">A '''lapalissade''' is an obvious truth&amp;mdash;i.e. a [[truism]] or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]&amp;mdash;which produces a comical effect. It is derived from the name [[Jacques de la Palice]], and the word is used in several languages.&lt;ref name=lebouc&gt;Georges Lebouc, ''2500 noms propres devenus communs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=zl-IBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT389 p. 389]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chabanne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Baker, ''Surrealism, History and Revolution'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmOr-yv5ySsC&amp;pg=PA195 p.195] &lt;!--Basically a redundant ref; I added it only to attest the English usage--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
La Palice's [[epitaph]] reads&lt;ref name="chabanne"&gt;Michel Chabanne (14 June 2007), comment on [http://www.mon-expression.info/une-verite-de-la-palice Encyclopédie des Expressions: Une vérité de La Palice / Une lapalissade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234315/http://www.mon-expression.info/une-verite-de-la-palice |date=2009-03-03 }}. Accessed 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lebouc/&gt;
:''"Ci-gît le Seigneur de La Palice: s'il n'était pas mort, il ferait encore envie."''
:("Here lies the Seigneur de La Palice: If he weren't dead, he would still be envied.")
These words were misread (accidentally or intentionally) as "''...il ſerait [serait] encore en vie''" ("...he would still be alive"), where the [[long s]] aids in the confusion.  In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed, including "''... que deux jours avant sa mort / il était encore en vie''" ("... that two days before his death / he was still quite alive") and "''... et quand il était tout nu, / il n'avait point de chemise''"
("... and when he was stark naked / he didn't wear a shirt").

In the early 18th century [[Bernard de la Monnoye]] collected over 50 of these humorous "La Palice" quatrains, and published them as a burlesque [[The Song of la Palice|Song of La Palice]]. From that song came the [[French language|French]] term ''[[wikt:lapalissade|lapalissade]]'' meaning an utterly obvious truth&amp;mdash;i.e. a [[truism]] or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], and it was borrowed into several other languages. Since that day, when you say something very obvious, your interlocutor answers : ''"La Palice would have said as much !"'' (in French : ''"La Palice en aurait dit autant !"'').

==Similar terms==

In [[Spanish culture]], an analog is a folkloric character {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedro Grullo|es}} (Perogrullo) with his ''[[wikt:es:perogrullada|perogrullada]]s'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CJXBbIXnKKwC&amp;pg=PA131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Verdad de Pedro Grullo, que a la mano cerrada, la llama puño" (The truth of Pedro Grullo, when his hand is closed, he calls it a fist).&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of Spanish proverbs, 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPEIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 p. 382]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, one might reference "[[Captain Obvious]]" as having spoken a [[self-evident]] truth. Other kinds of trite expressions are  "[[platitude]]" and "[[wikt:bromide|bromide]]".

==History==
For as long as there have been words and pictures, the people of the world have been consuming media. Improved [[technology]] such as the [[printing press]] has fed increased consumption. Around 1600 the [[camera obscura]] was perfected. Light was inverted through a small hole or lens from outside, and projected onto a surface or screen, creating a moving image. This new medium had a very small effect on society compared to the old ones. The [[History of photography|development of photography]] in the middle 19th century made those images permanent, greatly reducing the cost of pictures. By the end of the century millions of consumers were seeing new, professionally-made photographs every day.

In the 1860s mechanisms such as the [[zoetrope]], [[mutoscope]] and [[praxinoscope]] that produced two-dimensional drawings in motion were created. They were displayed in public halls for people to observe.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=A. |last2=Pritchard |first2=M. E. |title=An examination of the relation of gender, mass media influence, and loneliness to disordered eating among college students |journal=Eating and Weight Disorders – Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity |year=2009 |volume=14 |issue=2–3 |pages=e144–e147 |doi=10.1007/BF03327813}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[new media]] foreshadowed the [[mass media]] consumption of later years.

Around the 1880s, the development of the [[motion picture camera]] allowed individual component images to be captured and stored on a single reel. Motion pictures were projected onto a screen to be viewed by an audience. This moving camera affected the progression of the world immensely, beginning the [[American film industry]] as well as early international movements such as [[German Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]] and the [[Soviet Montage]]. For the first time people could tell stories on film, and distribute their works to consumers worldwide.

In the 1920s electronic [[History of television|television was working]] in laboratories,&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt; and in the 1930s hundreds of receivers were in use worldwide. By 1941 the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) was broadcasting two 15-minute newscasts a day to a tiny audience on its New York television station. However, the television industry did not begin to boom until the general [[post–World War II economic expansion]].&lt;ref name="Hobza et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobza |first1=C. L. |last2=Walker |first2=K. E. |last3=Yakushko |first3=O. |last4=Peugh |first4=J. L. |year=2007 |title=What about men?

Computers were developed in the middle 20th century, and commercialized in the 1960s. Apple and other companies sold computers for hobbyists in the 1970s, and in 1981 [[IBM]] released computers intended for consumers.

On August 6, 1991 the [[internet]] and [[World Wide Web]], long in use by computer specialists, became available to the public. This was the start of the commercialized Internet that people use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andreassen |first=C. S. |title=Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review |journal=Current Addiction Reports |year=2015 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=175–184 |doi=10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Friends Reunited]], the first [[social media]] site, was released to the public. Since then, [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and other social networks have been created. Facebook and Twitter are the top social media sites in terms of usage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amanda L. |last1=Forest |first2=Joanne V. |last2=Wood |title=When Social Networking Is Not Working: Individuals With Low Self-Esteem Recognize but Do Not Reap the Benefits of Self-Disclosure on Facebook |journal=Psychological Science |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=295–302 |doi=10.1177/0956797611429709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Facebook has a total of 1,230,000,000 consumers while Twitter has 645,750,000. Both companies are worth billions of dollars, and continue to grow.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burrow |first1=Anthony L. |last2=Rainone |first2=Nicolette |year=2017 |title=How many ''likes'' did I get?: Purpose moderates links between positive social media feedback and self-esteem |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=69 |pages=232–236 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2016.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall media consumption has immensely increased over time, from the era of the introduction of motion pictures, to the age of social networks and the internet.

==People involved==

Media is the sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group. The first source of media was solely word of mouth. When written language was established, scrolls were passed, but mass communication was never an option. It wasn't until the printing press that media could be consumed on a high level. Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith and businessman from the mining town of Mainz in southern Germany printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Johannes Gutenberg and the Printing Press|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/gstartinventors/a/Gutenberg.htm|publisher=Inventors.About}}&lt;/ref&gt; His technology allowed books, newspapers, and flyers to be printed and distributed on a mass level.

The first newspaper written on paper was done by Benjamin Harris in the British-American Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ringer|first=Wesley|title=History of the Bible: How The Bible Came To Us|url=http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/bibleorigin.html|publisher=godandscience|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a newspaper was one of the most influential pieces in media consumption history, because it pertained to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Harris|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255892/Benjamin-Harris|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually communication reached an electronic state, and the telegraph was invented. Harrison Dyar, who sent electrical sparks through chemically treated paper tape to burn dots and dashes, invented the first telegraph in the USA.&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Electric Telegraph and Telegraphy|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/telegraph.htm|publisher=inventors.about}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telegraph was the first piece of equipment that allowed users to send electronic messages. A more developed version came from Samuel Morse, whose telegraph printed code on tape and was operated using a keypad and an earpiece.&lt;ref name="Bellis"/&gt; The pattern of communication soon became known as Morse code.

Inventors Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both independently designed the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Telephone – Alexander Graham Bell|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/telephone.htm|publisher=inventors.about|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone was simple enough for everyone to use and didn't require learning a code.

Soon after the telephone came the radio. Combining technology from both the telegraph and telephone, Guglielmo Marconi sent and received his first radio signal in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The Invention of Radio|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1947, after a long period of development, television exploded as a medium. Not one person is responsible for the creation of the television, but Marvin Middlemark invented "rabbit ears" in 1930, which allowed for televisions to be a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Television history|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Television.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television has by far been the most influential consumed media, and allowed news to spread on a visual level.

In 1976, Apple created the first consumer computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Computers|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/blcoindex.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer was the start of mass written communication using email. Apple continues to be a leading company in computer use.

In 1998, the first ever social media site [[SixDegrees.com]] was created by [[Andrew Weinreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|title=The Brief History of Social Media|date=2012-03-16|access-date=2017-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316122748/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other users. Shortly later in 1999, [[Friends Reunited]] was created by Steve and Julie Pankhurst and friend Jason Porter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/12114738/Steve-Pankhurst-Friends-Reunited-millionaire-Geeky-techies-are-the-new-celebrities.html|title=Steve Pankhurst, Friends Reunited millionaire: 'Geeky techies are the new celebrities'|last=Stanford|first=Peter|date=2016|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites like MySpace created by [[Tom Anderson]] gained prominence in the early 2000s. By 2006, Facebook created by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and Twitter created by [[Jack Dorsey]] both became available to users throughout the world. These sites remain some of the most popular social networks on the Internet.

==Increase==

Among other factors, a person's access to media technology affects the amount and quality of his or her intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Aeron|title=Political Communication and Social Theory|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for instance, "U.C. San Diego scientists in 2009 estimated the 'average' American consumes 34 [[gigabyte]]s of media a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phelps|first=Andrew|title=Ethan Zuckerman wants you to eat your (news) vegetables – or at least have better information|journal=Nieman Journalism Lab|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of media consumption among individuals is increasing as new technologies are created. According to phys.org, a new study done by a researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, says that by 2015, the sum of media asked for and delivered to consumers on mobile devices and their homes would take more than 15 hours a day to see or hear,&lt;ref name="Zverin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zverin|first=Jan|title=U.S. Media Consumption to Rise to 15.5 Hours a Day – Per Person – by 2015|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/u.s._media_consumption_to_rise_to_15.5_hours_a_day_per_person_by_2015|publisher=UC San Diego New Press|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount equivalent to watching nine DVDs' worth of data per person per day.&lt;ref name="Zverin"/&gt;

With [[social media]] networks rapidly growing such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], our world of media consumption is reaching a younger and younger age group, making our consumption that much larger as a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|title=Instagram is the Fastest-Growing Social Site Globally, Mobile Devices Rule Over PCs For Access|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/21/instagram-is-the-fastest-growing-social-site-globally-mobile-devices-rule-over-pcs-for-social-access/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/|publisher=Pew Research Internet Project|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Media: We Need a Plan|url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/managing-media-we-need-a-plan.aspx|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, news, entertainment, shopping and buying are all now at the tip of our fingers, anytime, anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanac|first=Mary|title=A Whole Grocery Store at Your Fingertips|date=January 4, 2013|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects==
There are a number of positive effects of media consumption. Television can have positive effects on children as they are growing up. Shows like ''Sesame Street'' teach valuable lessons to children in developmental stages, such as math, the alphabet, kindness, racial equality, and cooperation.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmc=2792691|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dora the Explorer'' introduces foreign language to children of all backgrounds in a fun, cooperative environment.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

[[Mass media]] has a huge grasp on today's adolescents.  Many young people use different types of social media daily.  Mass media can be used to socialize adolescents from around the world and can help to give them a fundamental understanding of [[social norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopher E|first=Beaudoin|year=2014|title=The Mass Media and Adolescent Socialization: A Prospective Study in the Context of Unhealthy Food Advertising|url=|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly; Columbia|volume=91|pages=544–561|via=ABI/INFORM Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media relating to advertising can also have a positive effect. Some alcohol manufacturers are known to spend at least ten percent of their budget on warnings about the dangers of drinking and driving.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; Also, studies show that milk consumption (though controversial) shot up in children fifteen years of age and younger due to print and broadcast advertisements.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

Many [[video game]]s can also have positive effects. Games like [[Wii]] Tennis and Wii Fit improve hand-eye coordination as well as general mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/11/video-games.aspx|title=Video Games Play May Provide Learning, Health, Social Benefits|website=www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games, including shooting games, with an abundance of violence, improves a child's learning, physical as well as mental health and social skills. These games that are rated for mature adults are beneficial to the development of children according to a study that was published by the American Psychological Association ([[American Psychological Association|APA]]). The study showed that there is a need to look at the positive effects as well as the negative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=January 2014|title=The benefits of playing video games|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|issn=1935-990X|pmid=24295515}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child plays a video game, they naturally develop problem-solving skills. Strategic video games, such as role-playing games, release statistics that the more intense game play improved in problem solving skills and there is a significant rise in school grades as well, according to a study that was taken over a several year span but was published in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study also showcased that the creativity of children was also enhanced by playing all genres of video games, including once again violent games. Research revealed that video games benefit children more than using other sources of technology.

The internet itself is a huge positive for people of all ages, as it now is a personal library for anyone who has access.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; The number of educational websites and services offered are so immense that research has become a task much easier than it was in the past. Social media has also provided many benefits for people over time, as it has been evaluated as a pro-social way of interacting with people all over the world.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbooks Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Media Use: A Positive Psychology Approach – Oxford Handbooks|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195398809.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195398809-e-10|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those in education, on both sides of the fence media consumption is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youthrelationships.org/free-lesson-plans|title=Critical Media Literacy: Free Lesson Plans|last=|first=|date=|website=Western Centre for School and Mental Health|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors as well as students across all grade levels consume media for school curricula in Ontario.  Media literacy is prominent to the youth who enter an era where the media is a surrounding factor.  When a student learns to approach certain media sources with a critical lens, its understood that all forms of media have no sense of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication, 5th edition|last=Pavlik, McIntosh|first=John, Shawn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who consume media are capable of questioning the media they are consuming, that relatively improves knowledge. To broaden their understanding and knowledge, they often find it easier to question an author's purpose, the reasoning for certain images being used, the representation of content and its meaning to certain individuals, and overall the effects of the media being consumed and a personal as well as social level. Media relating to learning is a source as well as a tool. Since its start many use [[Rosetta Stone (software)]] to help guide them into learning a new language. It is a source that is compatible because it is portable and can be used in several platforms i.e. (iPad, Tablet, Phone Apps Websites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecv.missouri.edu/Word%20and%20PDF/Issue%206/6-2.pdf|title=Rosetta Stone and Language Proficiency of International Secondary School|last=Griffin|first=Robert|last2=Martinez|first2=James|date=2014|website=|publisher=ECV: Engaging Cultures and Voices|access-date=March 24, 2017|last3=Martin|first3=Ellice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative effects==
Media consumption can have a wide range of negative behavioral and emotional effects.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant, Thompson|first=Jennings, Susan|title=Fundamentals of Media Effects|year=2013|publisher=Waveland Press Inc.|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instances of [[violence in movies]], television, video games and websites which can affect one's level of aggression. These violent depictions can desensitize viewers to acts of violence and can also provoke mimicking of the acts. Since violence is so rampant in media, viewers believe they live in a more violent world than they actually do.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"/&gt;

The reach of media is expanding globally and with this television has become a vice around the world. Television addiction has been labeled as the plug in drug since 1977. Over the years televisions are now located in almost every home, according to most recent estimates taken by Nielsen in the U.S. alone there are 116.4&amp;nbsp;million T.V. homes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/nielsen-estimates-116-4-million-tv-homes-in-the-us-for-the-2015-16-tv-season.html|title=NIELSEN ESTIMATES 116.4 MILLION TV HOMES IN THE U.S. FOR THE 2015–16 TV SEASON|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television can have a negative impact on adolescents and cause them to behave in a manner that is not part of normal social norm. In an article about media violence on society it states that extensive TV viewing among adolescents and young adults is associated with subsequent aggressive acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5564/2377.full|title=The Effects of Media Violence on Society|first1=Craig A.|last1=Anderson|first2=Brad J.|last2=Bushman|date=29 March 2002|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2377–2379|doi=10.1126/science.1070765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that portray violent acts can change an adolescent's view on violence and this may lead them to develop aggressive behavior.  These shows usually portray a person who commits a crime or resorts to violence.  They also show that these people go unpunished for their crime, creating the notion that crime is something a person can get away with.  Studies show that 65% of people between the age of 8 to 18 have a television in their room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/2/423|title=Children, Adolescents, and Television|author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education|journal=Pediatrics|year=2001|volume=107|issue=2|doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.423|pmid=11158483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average high-schooler watches, on average,14 hours of television a week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=May–June 2003|title=Impact of media use on children and youth|journal=Paediatr Child Health|volume=8|pages=301–306|via=|pmc=2792691|pmid=20020034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive television viewing and computer game playing has also been associated with many psychiatric symptoms, especially emotional and behavioral symptoms, somatic complaints, attention problems such as hyperactivity, and family interaction problems.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/978 |first1=Markus |last1=Dworak |first2=Thomas |last2=Schierl |first3=Thomas |last3=Bruns |first4=Heiko Klaus |last4=Strüder |title=Impact of Singular Excessive Computer Game and Television Exposure on Sleep Patterns and Memory Performance of School-aged Children |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0476 |pmid=17974734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When adolescents watch television for long periods of time they spend less time being active and engaged in physical activity. Many adolescents who spend large amounts of time watching television see actors as role models and try to emulate them by trying to be like them this can also have a negative impact on people's [[body image]]s, mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After seeing beautiful and thinner than average women in the media, viewers may feel worse about themselves and sometimes develop eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamiya|first=Yuko|first2=Thomas F. |last2=Cash |first3=Susan E. |last3=Melnyk |first4=Heidi D. |last4=Posavac |first5=Steven S. |last5=Posavac |title=Women's exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images: body image effects of media-ideal internalization and impact-reduction interventions|year=2005|journal=Body Image|volume=2|issue=1|pages=74–80|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the reason obesity rates have greatly increased in the last 20 years is due to increased media consumption. This is due to the fact that children are spending much more time playing video games and watching television than exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boero|first=Natalie|title=All the News that's Fat to Print: The American 'Obesity Epidemic' and the Media|journal=Qualitative Sociology|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1007/s11133-006-9010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social media is said to also cause anxiety and depression. Research suggests that young people who spend more than 2 hours per day on social media are more likely to report poor mental health, including psychological distress.

Numerous studies have also shown that media consumption has a significant association with poor sleep quality. Television and computer game exposure affect children's sleep and deteriorate verbal cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"/&gt;

Another problem that has developed due to increased media consumption is that people are becoming less independent. With [[text messaging]] and social media, people want [[instant gratification]] from their friends and often feel hurt if they do not receive an immediate response. Instead of having [[self-validation]], people often need validation from others.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|at=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with independence is that since children frequently get cellphones when they are very young, they are always connected and never truly alone. Today, many children do not have the [[rite of passage]] of being on their own because they can always call their parents if they need help or are frightened.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"/&gt;

Minorities are often put in a negative light in the media as well, with blacks being portrayed as criminals, Hispanics portrayed as illegal aliens, and people from the Middle East portrayed as terrorists. Research has shown that consuming much media with headlines that depict minorities in negative ways can affect how people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://proxygsu-alta.galileo.usg.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/952541470?accountid=14055|journal=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|volume=55|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt;

==Effects on Self-Esteem ==
Media has played a huge role in society for years in selling people on the expectations of how an ideal male and female body should look. These images of the "ideal body" can have a very negative effect on self-esteem in both men and women.&lt;ref name="Paxton, S. J. 2006"/&gt; These images can play significant roll in eating disorders in men and women as well.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard" /&gt; The idea of body comparison goes back to Festinger's (1954) Social Comparison Theory. Festinger argues that individuals make body comparisons in areas for which they relate. If someone who is over weight and is an environment that focuses on health, thinness, or body images (e.g. the gym or the beach) they may be more likely to see thinness as an ideal that can increase dissatisfaction with their own body.The more a person engages in body comparison, the more likely they may struggle with low self-esteem and a negative body image.&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007"/&gt; Women are sold to believe that to be beautiful, they must be a size zero and have long legs.  Men are sold the notion that they must big biceps and zero body fat. Reading magazines with images of toned muscular men has been reported to lower body and self-esteem in men and they start worrying more about their own health and physical fitness.&lt;ref name="Hobza et al." /&gt;

== Social Media ==
The amount of time spent on social media can inform people about their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Andreassen, C.S. Curr Addict Rep (2015) 2: 175. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that individuals with lower self-esteem may have an easier time expressing themselves on social media rather than in the real world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people use metrics such as how many people are following them and likes to measure acceptance or rejection from peers. One study from the ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', argues that individuals who feel accepted and part of the "in crowd" have a higher sense of self-esteem than those who do not feel as though they are a part of these crowds.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"/&gt;

==Semiotics of American youth media consumption==
American youth have personal [[television set]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[iPod]]s and [[cell phone]]s all at their disposal. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping.  As of 2008, the average American age 8 to 18 reported more than 6 hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of "[[media multitasking]]"—using several forms of media at the same time—multiplies that figure to 8.5 hours of media exposure daily. Media exposure begins early, increases until children begin school, then climbs to peak at almost 8 hours daily among 11 and 12-year-old children. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=D|first2=Ulla|last2=Foehr|title=Trends in Media Use|journal=The Future of Children|year=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=11–37|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[teenager]]s ages 12 to 17, 78% have a cell phone, and 47% of those own [[smartphone]]s. 23% of teens have a [[tablet computer]] and 93% have a computer or access to one at home. Of teenagers ages 14 to 17, 74% access the Internet on [[mobile device]]s occasionally. One in four teens are cell-mostly users, meaning that when accessing the Internet, they mostly use their cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teens and Technology 2013|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TeensandTechnology2013.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media consumption, especially [[social media]] consumption, plays a major role in the [[socialization]] and social habits of [[adolescent]]s. Socializing through media differs from socializing through school, community, family, and other social situations. Since the adolescents have a greater control over their media choices than over other social situations face-to-face, many develop self-socialization. This is where we actively influence our own social development and outcomes because of the vast array of choices. Adolescents can choose media that best fits their personalities and preferences, which in turn create youth that have a skewed view of the world and limited [[social interaction]] skills. Socialization can be awkward for youth, especially with the integration of media. Media, parents, and peers may all convey differing messages to adolescents. With multiple views of how to approach a situation, confusion can be apparent and the youth may often give up or internalize their social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnett|first=J|title=Adolescents' uses of media for self-socialization|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=1995|volume=24|issue=5|pages=519–533|doi=10.1007/bf01537054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social semiotics]] make up a large part of how adolescents learn and employ social interaction. Impressionable adolescents regularly imitate the sign systems they see in the media. These [[semiotic]] systems affect their behavior through [[connotations]], [[narratives]], and [[myths]]. Adolescents are shaped by the sign systems in the media they consume. For example, many young girls in the 1990s dressed and acted like the [[Spice Girls]], a popular band. Similarly, [[boy bands]] created a trend of many teenage boys frosting their hair in the early 2000s. With more exposure to the media and images of models, young women are more likely to conform to the ideal of being thin. [[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia]], [[bulimia]] and models smoking convey to girls that a feminine person is thin, beautiful, and must do certain things to her body to be attractive. A code of femininity (see [[media and gender]]) implies today that a "true" woman is thin, girlish, frail, passive, and focused on serving others.  On the other hand, the code of masculinity for a young boy growing up in our culture may include the ideals of cowboys and secret agents. The images, myths, and narratives of these ideas imply that a "true" man is a problem solver, physically strong, emotionally inexpressive, and a daredevil who doesn't care about rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dotson|first=M. J.|first2=E. M.|last2=Hyatt|title=Major influence factors in children's consumer socialization|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=22|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1108/07363760510576536|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood of signs, images, narratives, and myths surrounding us influence our behavior by the use of codes. [[Codes]] are maps of meaning, systems of signs that people use to interpret their own and others' behavior. Codes connect semiotic systems of meaning with social structure and values. The idea of being judged on femininity or clothing relates to experiences later in life with job interviews and being successful.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiotics and Advertising|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/semiotics_and_ads/index.html|accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs, myths, and codes do not affect us physically like a drug, but psychologically. We think with signs, though we don't eat, breathe, or physically interact with them. The power that sign systems have is their role in generating and maintaining shared expectations and shared interpretive frameworks. [[Sign]]s do not force us to have certain interpretations. They open a door, creating the context for other people's interpretations of us, and even more importantly, our own expectations of what others think. Sign systems are merely tools, but they have become the common currency for communicating. Signs have become something we can accept or criticize, but not ignore.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"/&gt;

Media consumption has become part of our culture code and has shaped the youth through socialization and how they interpret the signs and world around them. For example, older generations see the symbol for a phone and think that it is something to call someone with. The younger generations, especially the youth now, see a phone as a mini-computer and a way to avoid physical contact or face-to-face communication.

== Effect on Public Attitudes Regarding Crime and Justice==
[[File:Law and Order SVU.png|thumb|Law &amp; Order: SVU
Television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime.
]]
Media consumption affects the public's perception of the justice system through the relationship of fear regarding crime, the perceived effectiveness of law enforcement, and the general attitudes about punishment for crime.  The law and the legal system have continually been portrayed in mass media through negative portrayals of criminals, deviants, and law enforcement officials, which in turn affects the overall perception of these by the public.

A research study done by Dowler in 2003, showed that the effects of media consumption does influence public attitudes regarding crime and justice.  In this study a relationship between media and crime was found to be dependent on characteristics of the message and receiving audience, where substantial amounts of local crimes reported raised fear, while lower crime amounts lead to a feeling of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is2/dowler.html|title=Media consumption and public attitudes toward crime and justice: The relationship between fear of crime, punitive attitudes, and perceived police effectiveness|last=Dowler|first=K.|year=2003|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Gerbner's empirical studies of the impact of media consumption discovered that television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime than those who are not consuming that type of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|date=1986|title=Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process|url=http://wiki.commres.org/pds/CultivationTheory/LivingWithTelevision_TheDynamicsoftheCultivationProcess.pdf|journal=Perspectives on media effects|volume=|pages=17–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Chermak, McGarrell, &amp; Gruenewald focused on media coverage of police misconduct which produced results where the more the citizens consumed the misconduct media the more they believed in the officer's guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chermak|first=S.|last2=McGarrell|first2=E.|last3=Gruenewald|first3=J.|date=2006-04-01|title=Media coverage of police misconduct and attitudes toward police|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/13639510610667664|journal=Policing: An International Journal|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–281|doi=10.1108/13639510610667664|issn=1363-951X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings showed the more a citizen exposed themselves to media consumption regarding a specific case, the more likely they felt about the officer's guilt.  This same study also indicated that race effects were more pronounced after media coverage of the case.  The indication that news consumption had no significant effects on the general attitudes towards police, police services, or concerns about police harassment were also concluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">'''Miller's law''' can refer to three different principles.

==In communication==
Miller's law, part of his theory of communication, was formulated by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], Princeton Professor and psychologist.

It instructs us to [[suspension of judgement|suspend judgment]] about what someone is saying so that we can first understand them without imbuing their message with our own personal interpretations. The law states: 

{{quote| text=To understand what another person is saying, you must assume that it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of.| source=[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrr.com/aa/new.htm|title=Language in Emergency MEDICINE|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work911.com/communication/miller.htm|title=What is Miller's Law and what is it for?|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In psychology==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.&lt;ref name="escher02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">The '''Monod equation''' is a [[mathematical model]] for the growth of microorganisms. It is named for [[Jacques Monod]] who proposed using an equation of this form to relate microbial growth rates in an aqueous environment to the concentration of a limiting nutrient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacques |last=Monod |year=1949 |title=The Growth of Bacterial Cultures |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=3 |pages=371 |doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.03.100149.002103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monod |first=J. |year=1942 |title=Recherches sur la croissance des Cultures Bactériennes |publisher=Hermann |location=Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dochain |first=D. |year=1986 |title=On-line parameter estimation, adaptave state estimation and adaptave control of fermentation processes |work=Thése |publisher=Leuven University |location=Louvain la Neuve, Belgium }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monod equation has the same form as the [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten equation]], but differs in that it is [[Empirical relationship|empirical]] while the latter is based on theoretical considerations.

The Monod equation is commonly used in [[environmental engineering]]. For example, it is used in the [[activated sludge model]] for [[sewage treatment]].

== Equation ==

The Monod equation is:&lt;ref name="ESM 219"&gt;{{cite web |title=ESM 219: Lecture 5: Growth and Kinetics |url=http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/219/Lectures/Lecture_4_ESM219_06.ppt.pdf |archivedate=December 29, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229043435/http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/219/Lectures/Lecture_4_ESM219_06.ppt.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mu = \mu_\max {S \over K_s + S} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Monod 3.svg|thumb|200px|The specific growth rate μ as a function of substrate concentration S.]]

where:
* ''μ'' is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms
* ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum specific growth rate of the microorganisms
* ''S'' is the concentration of the [[Limiting factor|limiting]] [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] for growth
* ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the "half-velocity constant"—the value of ''S'' when ''μ''/''μ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5

''μ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are empirical coefficients to the Monod equation. They will differ between species and based on the ambient environmental conditions.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Application notes ===

The rate of substrate utilization is related to the specific growth rate as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |last2=Eddy |year=2003 |title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment &amp; Reuse |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw–Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-041878-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_iBSAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''u&lt;/sub&gt; = −''μX''/''Y''

where:
* ''X'' is the total biomass (since the specific growth rate, μ is normalized to the total biomass)
* Y is the yield coefficient

r&lt;sub&gt;su&lt;/sub&gt; is negative by convention.

In some applications, multiple terms of the form [S/(K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + S)] are multiplied together where more than one nutrient or growth factor has the potential to be limiting (e.g. organic matter and oxygen are both necessary to [[Heterotrophic]] bacteria). When the yield coefficient, being the ratio of mass of microorganisms to mass of substrate utilized,  becomes very large this signifies that there is deficiency of substrate available for utilization.

=== Graphical determination of constants ===

As with the [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten equation]] graphical methods may be used to fit the coefficients of the Monod equation:&lt;ref name="ESM 219" /&gt;

* [[Lineweaver–Burk plot]]

The term was first coined by [[Alfred A. Tomatis]] who used [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's music]] as the listening stimulus in his work attempting to cure a variety of disorders. The approach has been popularized in Don Campbell's book, ''The Mozart Effect'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Don|title=The Mozart Effect : tapping the power of music to heal the body, strengthen the mind, and unlock the creative spirit|date=1997|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0380974184|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted scores on one portion of the [[IQ]] test.&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = Frances H.| last2 = Shaw | first2 = Gordon L.| last3 = Ky | first3 = Catherine N.| doi = 10.1038/365611a0 | title = Music and spatial task performance | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 365 | issue = 6447 | pages = 611 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8413624| pmc = | url = http://www.uwosh.edu/psychology/faculty-and-staff/frances-rauscher-ph.d/Rauscher_ShawKy_1993.pdf/view}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|United States' Governor of Georgia]], [[Zell Miller]], proposed a budget to provide every child born in Georgia with a CD of [[classical music]].

==Alfred A. Tomatis==
The concept of the "Mozart effect" was described by French researcher [[Alfred A. Tomatis|Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis]] in his 1991 book ''Pourquoi Mozart?'' (''Why Mozart?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/Mozart.html|title=Mozart on the Brain|first=Lars|last=Sorensen|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to "retrain" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Billie M.|last2=Andrews|first2=Susan R.|title=An historical commentary on the physiological effects of music: Tomatis, Mozart and neuropsychology|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=174–188|doi=10.1007/BF02688778|pmid=11286370|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rauscher ''et al.'' 1993 study==
Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on [[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning]], and the results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]]  by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial-reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured).&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"/&gt;

==Popularization==
While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in "spatial intelligence", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, ''[[New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] wrote in a light-hearted article, "researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the world's greatest composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=CLASSICAL VIEW; Listening To Prozac . . . Er, Mozart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/classical-view-listening-to-prozac-er-mozart.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; " A 1997 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. 

The 1997 book by Don Campbell, ''The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit'', discusses the theory that listening to [[Mozart]] (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's [[IQ]] and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their [[neural development|mental development]].

After ''The Mozart Effect'', Campbell wrote a follow-up book, ''The Mozart Effect For Children'', and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance "deep rest and rejuvenation", "intelligence and learning", and "creativity and imagination". Campbell defines the term as "an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve [[memory]] or [[awareness]]. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|attention deficit disorder]], [[autism]], and other mental and physical disorders and diseases".&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Don |title=The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit |year=1997 |isbn=0-380-97418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results.

==Political impact==
The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when [[Zell Miller]], governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated "No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess." Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's "[[Ode to Joy]]" on a tape recorder and asked "Now, don't you feel smarter already?" Miller asked [[Yoel Levi]], music director of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Symphony]], to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative [[Buddy DeLoach|Homer DeLoach]] said "I asked about the possibility of including some [[Charlie Daniels]] or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |title=Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A12 |date=1998-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research and meta-analyses ==
While some supportive reports have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T., Brown, T. |title=Reexamination of the effect of Mozart's music on spatial task performance|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=131|issue=4|pages=365|doi=10.1080/00223989709603522|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thompson, W.F., Schellenberg, E.G. &amp; Husain, G. |title=Arousal, mood, and the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=248–51|pmid=11437309|year=2001|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Husain, G., Thompson, W.F. &amp; Schellenberg, E.G. |title=Effects of musical tempo and mode on arousal, mood, and spatial abilities: Re-examination of the "Mozart effect"|journal=Music Perception|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.20.2.151|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving.&lt;ref name="Ilie"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ilie, G., &amp; Thompson, W.F. |year=2011|title= Experiential and cognitive changes following seven minutes exposure to music and speech|journal= Music Perception|volume= 28|issue=3|pages= 247–264|doi=10.1525/mp.2011.28.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|doi=10.1348/026151002166433|title=Listening to Mozart does not improve children's spatial ability: Final curtains for the Mozart effect|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=241|last1 = McKelvie|first1 = Pippa|last2=Low|first2=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schellenberg, E.G., &amp; Hallam, S. |title=Music listening and cognitive abilities in 10 and 11 year olds: The Blur effect|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1060|pages=202–9|pmid=16597767|year=2005|doi=10.1196/annals.1360.013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1507375/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="bridgett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of listening to Mozart and Bach on the performance of a mathematical test|pmid=10939064|last=Bridgett |first=D.J.|author2=Cuevas, J.|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=90|issue=3 Pt 2|year=2000 |pages=1171–1175|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999  a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F.| title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 400 | issue = 6747 | pages = 826–827| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid =  10476958| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = K.

Chabris reported a  [[meta-analysis]] demonstrating that "any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation", called "enjoyment arousal". For example, he cites a study that found that "listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a [[Stephen King]] story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard". Steele et. al. found that "listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment".&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steele |first=M |title=Papers by Steele casting doubt on the Mozart effect |publisher=appstate.edu |url=http://www.acs.appstate.edu/~kms/research/Steele.htm |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords.&lt;ref name="Husain"/&gt;

Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding [[publication bias]] when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietschnig|first1=Jakob|last2=Voracek|first2=Martin|last3=Formann|first3=Anton K.|title=Mozart effect–Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=3|year=2010|pages=314–323|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|last2=Shaw|first2=Gordon L.|last3=Ky|first3=Katherine N.|title=Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=185|issue=1|year=1995|pages=44–47|pmid=7731551|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lynn E.|title=Another failure to generalize the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=87|issue=5|year=2000|pages=325–30|pmid=11026433|doi=10.2466/pr0.2000.87.1.325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Martin H.|last2=West|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Estell|first3=David B.|title=The Mozart effect: Arousal, preference, and spatial performance.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=S|issue=1|year=2006|pages=26–32|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Arousal and mood factors in the "Mozart effect"|pmid=11011888|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=91|issue=1|year=2000|pages=188–190|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms//documents/Arousal.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.91.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt; The "neural resonance" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"/&gt;

Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that "... passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Schumacher |title=Macht Mozart schlau? |url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |publisher=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |page=183 |accessdate=2009-05-22 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172239/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular presentations of the "Mozart effect", including Alex Ross's comment that "listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter" and Zell Miller's "don't you feel smarter" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to "intelligence." Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect,&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added):
{{quote|Our results on the effects of listening to ''Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K. 448'' on spatial–temporal task performance have generated much interest but several misconceptions, many of which are reflected in attempts to replicate the research. The comments by Chabris and Steele et al. echo the most common of these: that listening to Mozart enhances intelligence. ''We made no such claim.'' The effect is limited to spatial–temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering.}}

On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;ref name="rauschernyt"&gt;Goode, Erica (1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/mozart-for-baby-some-say-maybe-not.html "Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"]. ''The New York Times'', 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, "the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a "myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology |isbn=1405131128|author1=Lilienfeld, Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |author2=Lynn, Steven Jay |author3=Ruscio, John |author4=Beyerstein, Barry L. |year=2009|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Emory University]] psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book ''[[50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University of Vienna|authorlink1=University of Vienna|title=Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100510075415.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health benefits===
Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/mozart.html |title=The Mozart Effect |publisher=epilepsy.org |accessdate= 2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109052504/http://epilepsy.org.uk/info/treatment/mozart-effect|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|K.448]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)]], only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer [[Yanni]], entitled "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" (version from ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]] performed at the [[Acropolis]]'').&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt; It was determined to have the "Mozart effect", by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in [[tempo]], structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yanni in Words67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanni |author2=Rensin, David |title=Yanni in Words |publisher=[[Miramax Books]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-4013-5194-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of Mozart's music==
While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to [[seizure]] onset&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=J. R.|last2=Daaboul|first2=Y.|last3=Fino|first3=J. J.|last4=Shaw|first4=G.

J. |doi=10.1080/01616412.1998.11740543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German [[sewage treatment]] plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.  Anton Stucki, chief operator of the [[Treuenbrietzen]] plant was quoted as saying, "We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything—including the water, the sewage and the cells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Sewage plant plays Mozart to stimulate microbes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">'''Mucosal immunology''' is the study of [[immune system]] responses that occur at [[Mucous membrane|mucosal membranes]] of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]], the [[Genitourinary system|urogenital tract]] and the [[respiratory system]], i.e., surfaces that are in contact with the external environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/mucosal-immunology|title=Mucosal immunology - Latest research and news {{!}} Nature|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Health|healthy states]], the mucosal immune system provides protection against [[pathogen]]s but maintains a tolerance towards non-harmful [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbes and benign environmental substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the oral and gut mucosa, the secretion of IgA provides an immune response to potential antigens in food without a large and unnecessary systemic immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Helbert, M. (2017). Immunology for medical students (Third ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mucosal membranes are the primary contact point between a host and its environment, a large amount of [[Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue|secondary lymphoid tissue]] is found here. The [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]], or MALT, provides the organism with an important first line of defense. Along with the [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]], the [[tonsils]] and MALT are also considered to be secondary lymphoid tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The mucosal immune system provides three main functions: serving as the body's first line defense from antigens and infection, preventing systemic immune responses to commensal bacteria and food antigens (primarily food proteins in the [[Gut-associated lymphoid tissue]], so-called [[oral tolerance]]), and regulating appropriate immune responses to pathogens encountered on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

At birth, the [[infant|neonate]]'s mucosal immune system is relatively undeveloped, but the colonization of [[intestinal flora]] promotes its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torow|first=N.|last2=Marsland|first2=B.

The '''Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology''' is a Polish scientific research organization and a part of [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] headquartered in [[Warsaw]], Poland. Founded in 1918, it is a leading institution in the country in the field of [[neurobiology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[biochemistry]].

== About the Institute ==
The Institute comprises laboratories and equipment for, amongst others, [[confocal microscopy]], electron microscopy, scanning and flow cytometry, magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiology, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Currently, the Institute is home to 40 laboratories organised into 4 departments, as well as 6 core facility laboratories forming the Neurobiology Center established in 2013.

The Institute's scientific teams conduct research in neurobiology, neurophysiology, and molecular biology. The experiments are interdisciplinary in character. The research concentrates on systems of varying complexity, from whole organisms through tissues, individual cells, cellular organelles to proteins and genes. The research topics often concentrate on determining signalling pathways whose disruption leads to the development of disease.

As of January 1, 2014 the Nencki Institute has once again become the owner of the Mikołajki Research Station [1]. The Station is the site of research in the areas of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem ecology, and environmental monitoring.

The Station/Institute is empowered to bestow [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and DSc doctoral degrees.

The laboratories of the Nencki Institute are organised into 4 separate Departments: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell
Neurobiology, and Neurophysiology. There are also 6 other laboratories that constitute the Neurobiology Center.

The research conducted in the Departments of Neurophysiology and Molecular and Cell Neurobiology mainly deals with the cognitive functions of the Brain. The dominant theme is the plasticity of the nervous system under normal and pathological conditions. We study the effects of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, epileptogenesis and the consequences of re-innervation, as well as emotional disturbances in humans.

The research at the Department of Cell Biology is chiefly directed towards elucidating signalling cascades and regulatory
mechanisms of gene expression involved in tumour transformation and the immune response, including the participation of membrane lipids in signal transfer by immunoreceptors, as well as the genetic regulation of cytoskeletal reorganisation.

The Department of Biochemistry concentrates its research efforts on describing the molecular mechanisms of lipid-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the regulation of calcium-mediated signal pathways,  kinesine functioning, the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the development of pathologies, as well as the elucidation of the structure and function of intracellular ion channels.

The Neurobiology Center conducts interdisciplinary basic research (based on, for example, brain imaging, animal modeling, or bioinformatics) as well as research on novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods in relation to the nervous system. This work is conducted in collaboration with many Warsaw institutes and universities as part of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme
project entitled "Centre for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT 2007-2013” - but also with research facilities around the world.

== Early history ==

It was founded in 1918/19, shortly after the reestablishment of Poland as an independent country. It was based on three pre-existing laboratories affiliated with the Scientific Society of Warsaw (Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie): Laboratory of Neurobiology (in existence since 1911), Laboratory of Physiology (in existence since 1913) and Laboratory of General Biology (established in 1918). Formation and development of the Institute was supported in part by a donation of Nadine Sieber-Shumova, a close co-worker of [[Marceli Nencki]] from Berne and St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;(1994). [http://www.ane.pl/pdf/5420.pdf 75th ANNIVERSARY of the NENCKI INSTITUTE OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY]. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. , 54: 163-200&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades the Institute gained prominence in the field of biological research in Poland.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} One of its major figures was the neurophysiologist [[Jerzy Konorski]] who discovered [[operant conditioning|secondary conditioned reflexes]]. The outbreak of [[World War II]] interrupted a period of its intensive expansion in the field of experimental biology, over a dozen of the Institute's staff lost their lives, and its premises (including most of its 30,000-volume library) was destroyed.

== Post World War II ==

The surviving staff members (professors Jan Dembowski, Jerzy Konorski, and Włodzimierz Niemierko) re-established the Nencki Institute. In 1952 the Institute was incorporated into the newly founded [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], and the Institute's director, Prof. Dembowski, became the first President of the Academy. During the period  1953-55, a newly erected building at 3 Pasteur Street in Warsaw became the new home of the Nencki Institute.

== Recent developments ==

In 1990, the Institute was invited to become a member institution of the Global Network for [[Molecular and Cell Biology]] (MCBN) within [[UNESCO]]. The Institute hires new researchers and awards approximately 15 doctoral degrees annually and is competitive in securing external funding for research projects. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Two European Centres of Excellence were recently formed within the Institute. The Institute has a PhD programme shared with the [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]].

== Structure of the Institute ==

The departments within the Institute are:

* Department of Cell Biology
* Department of Biochemistry
* Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology
* Department of Neurophysiology
* Neurobiology Center

The Institute has also state of the art cytometry laboratory, animal house, electron microscopy core facility, informatics laboratory, and on-site library.

'''''Nitrosomonas europaea''''' is a [[Gram-negative]] obligate [[chemolithoautotroph]] that can derive all its energy and reductant for growth from the oxidation of [[ammonia]] to nitrite and lives in several places such as [[soil]], [[sewage]], freshwater, the walls of buildings and on the surface of monuments especially in polluted areas where the air contains high levels of [[nitrogen]] compounds.

Due to the large amounts of ammonia this [[bacterium]] needs to consume for energy to divide, cell division can take up to several days. This is perhaps one reason why this microbe is not studied very much. This microbe has been shown to be an ammonia-oxidizing soil bacterium and it is known to have a range of substrates that might be useful in [[bioremediation]].  Several studies are still being done with the bacterium, but will take some time due to the slow cell division rate and the high amounts of nitrogen needed to live.

While not using [[photosynthesis]] for energy is not unique, "burning" ammonia with oxygen is. Both are characteristics of ''Nitrosomonas europaea''. This microbe tolerates a pH of 6.0-9.0, the optimal conditions being slightly basic; has an [[aerobic metabolism]]; and prefers a temperature between 20-30 degrees Celsius. Most are mobile with [[flagella]] located in the polar regions although some species are nonmobile.

The reaction catalysed by these bacteria is the first step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. ''Nitrosomonas europaea'' are also important in the treatment of industrial and sewage waste in the first step of oxidizing ammonia to nitrate. Evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) contribute significantly to the global production of [[nitrous oxide]] (produced by the reduction of nitrite). Other evidence reveals that AOB are a possible source of nitric oxide via the oxidation of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caranto|first=Jonathan D.|last2=Lancaster|first2=Kyle M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Nitric oxide is an obligate bacterial nitrification intermediate produced by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/31/8217|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=31|pages=8217–8222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704504114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28716929|pmc=5547625}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nitrosomonas europaea'' is also capable of degrading [[benzene]] as well as a variety of [[Halogen|halogenated organic compounds]], including [[trichloroethylene]] and [[vinyl chloride]]. The ability of nitrifying organisms to degrade some pollutants may make these organisms attractive for controlled bioremediation in nitrifying soils and waters.

''Nitrosomonas europaea'' is also accountable for nitric acid production which can cause the dissolution of some stone and other construction materials found on statues and in buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Orbicules''' (syn. [[Ubisch]] bodies, con-peito grains) are small acellular structures of [[sporopollenin]] (known size range from &lt; 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 15&amp;nbsp;µm, but usually sub-micrometre) that might occur on the inner tangential and radial walls of [[Tapetum (botany)|tapetal cells]]. Their function is unclear at this moment. Current consensus is that they are just a by-product of pollen wall sporopollenin synthesis.

In [[pathology]], '''perineural invasion''', abbreviated '''PNI''', refers to the [[invasion (cancer)|invasion]] of [[cancer]] to the space surrounding a [[nerve]]. It is common in head and neck cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. 

==Significance==
Cancers with PNI usually have a poorer prognosis,&lt;ref name=pmid16985741&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Potter | first1 = SR. | last2 = Partin | first2 = AW. | title = The significance of perineural invasion found on needle biopsy of the prostate: implications for definitive therapy. | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–90 | month =  | year = 2000 | doi =  | PMID = 16985741 | pmc=1476100}}&lt;/ref&gt; as PNI is thought to be indicative of perineural spread, which can make resection of malignant lesions more difficult.

===Prostate cancer===
In prostate cancer, PNI in needle biopsies is poor prognosticator;&lt;ref name=pmid16985741/&gt; however, in [[prostatectomy]] specimens it is unclear whether it carries a worse prognosis.&lt;ref name=pmid10632123&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bostwick | first1 = DG. | last2 = Foster | first2 = CS. | title = Predictive factors in prostate cancer: current concepts from the 1999 College of American Pathologists Conference on Solid Tumor Prognostic Factors and the 1999 World Health Organization Second International Consultation on Prostate Cancer. | journal = Semin Urol Oncol | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–72 |date=Nov 1999 | doi =  | PMID = 10632123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one study, PNI was found in approximately 90% of radical prostatectomy specimens, and PNI outside of the prostate, especially, was associated with a poorer prognosis.&lt;ref name=pmid18500264&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Merrilees | first1 = AD. | last2 = Bethwaite | first2 = PB. | last3 = Russell | first3 = GL. | last4 = Robinson | first4 = RG. | last5 = Delahunt | first5 = B. | title = Parameters of perineural invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens lack prognostic significance. | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | pages = 1095–100 |date=Sep 2008 | doi = 10.1038/modpathol.2008.81 | PMID = 18500264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists controversies about whether PNI has prognostic significance toward cancer malignancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23520">'''Public history''' is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of [[history]] who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[archival science]], [[oral history]], museum [[curator]]ship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are [[museums]], historic homes and [[historic site]]s, parks, battlefields, [[archives]],  film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Definition==
Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined.  Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians:
* use of the methods of the historical discipline
* an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or [[antiquarian]] purposes
* an emphasis on professional training and practice
* an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past

These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based [[National Council on Public History]]:  "To promote the utility of history in social through professional practice.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncph.org/Portals/13/About%20the%20Council/NCPHsFirstDecade.pdf Reflections on an Idea: NCPH’s First Decade]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;69–85&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, "Public history is a movement,  methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public."  However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncph.org/WhatisPublicHistory/tabid/282/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Public History Redux"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Public History News'' (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if [[shared historical authority]] should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many "publics" for public history complicates the task of definition.  For example, historian [[Peter Novick]] has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called ''private'' history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or ''popular'' history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream:  The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' (1988), 510-21&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Stanton, '' The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Kean]] and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between "historians" and "their publics"'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), ''People and their Pasts: Public History Today'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0909/0909pub1.cfm "A Picture of Public History]:  Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals" in ''Public History News'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, those who embrace the term ''public historian'' accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings.

==Related fields==

Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/3-2015-2/public-history-sublation-german-debate/ Marko Demantowsky, ''“Public History” – Sublation of a German Debate?'', Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include:
* [[Applied history]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Cultural Heritage Management]]
* [[Digital History]]
* [[Heritage Interpretation]]
* [[Historic Preservation]]
* [[Historical archaeology]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Oral History]]
* [[Public humanities]]

In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making.  This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be "public history."

==History==

Public history has many antecedents.  These include [[Museum#History museums|history museums]],  [[Historical society|historical societies]],  public and private [[archive]]s and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, [[Historic preservation|preservation organizations]], historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, [[historical fiction]]).  Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmilla Jordanova, ''The Practice of History'' (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''Public History Review'', vol 10, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Historians in Public:  the Practice of American History, 1890-1970'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, ''Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History'' (Iowa City:  University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as “public history”. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups—for example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities—rather than the  [[Great man theory|“great men”]] who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced [[social history]] as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.&lt;ref&gt;James Green, ''Taking History to Heart:  The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements'' (Amherst, Massachusetts:  [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'', p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the [[United States Bicentennial]] to multiculturalist projects in [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]], paralleled by widespread public interest in [[genealogy]], the tracing of folk and family [[Roots revival|“roots”]], and other history-related activities. In the wake of [[deindustrialization]] in many industrial places, governments also supported [[Urban renewal|regeneration or revitalization projects]] that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for [[place branding|“re-branding”]] a depressed area.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Dicks, ''Culture on Display:  The Production of Contemporary Visitability'' (Maidenhead, UK:  Open University Press, 2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] and the Canadian government's addition of “historical researcher” as a civil service category in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;John R. English, "The Tradition of Public History in Canada," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rise of [[cultural tourism]] and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field.

In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wesley Johnson, "The Origins of ''The Public Historian'' and the National Council on Public History," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of “public history” as a field in its own right.  Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field.  The launch of a professional journal, ''[[The Public Historian]]'', in 1978, and the founding of the [[National Council on Public History]] in 1979 further served to give public-minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods.

Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic “jobs crisis” in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.&lt;ref&gt;English, "Tradition of Public History in Canada"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick, "Public History in Canada:  An Introduction," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Public history also exists as an identifiable field in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]] and Paula Hamilton, “What Makes History Public?” ''Public History Review'' 1992, pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Liddington, "What is Public History?  Publics and Their Pasts, Meanings and Practices," ''Oral History'' (Spring 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. Sutcliffe, "Gleams and Echoes of Public History in Western Europe:  Before and After the Rotterdam Conference," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 6, No. 4 (Fall 1984), pp. 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; and other places. In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Public History Network|url=http://www.historiapublica.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label “public history.”  The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifph.hypotheses.org International Federation for Public History - Fédération Internationale pour l'Histoire Publique]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/PHN-2012-September1.pdf Serge Noiret: Next Steps for the International Federation, Public History News, Volume 32, Number 4, September 2012, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; IFPH is also a permanent &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html#public Internal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203723/http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal ''[[Public History Weekly]]''.

Public history continues to develop and define itself.  There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with [[digital history]], with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge.  In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual [http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=105 NCPH Book Award].  In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians’ sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn Létourneau, and David Northrup, "Canadians and Their Pasts:  An Exploration in Historical Consciousness," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  While high-profile “history wars” have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, [[History wars|Australia's]] ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples,  the furor over [[Jack Granatstein]]’s 1998 book “Who Killed Canadian History?”, or the 1994 controversy over the [[National Museum of American History]]'s planned exhibit on the [[Enola Gay#Recent developments|Enola Gay]] bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings.

An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like [[If This House Could Talk]] are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html  |title= Connecting Neighbors through their buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The [[National Council on Public History]]'s Robert Kelley Memorial Award, “honors distinguished and outstanding achievements by individuals, institutions, non-profit or corporate entities for having made significant inroads in making history relevant to individual lives of ordinary people outside of academia.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=477 Robert Kelley Memorial Award]&lt;/ref&gt; Its recipients reflect a broad mix of scholarly, governmental, and popular projects:

'''RX J1856.5-3754''' (also called '''RX J185635-3754''', '''RX J185635-375''', and various other designations) is a nearby [[neutron star]] in the constellation [[Corona Australis]].

==Discovery and location==
[[File:Zooming in on the very faint neutron star RX J1856.5-3754.ogg|thumb|left|Zooming in on the very faint neutron star RX J1856.5-3754]]
RX J1856.5-3754 is thought to have formed in a [[supernova]] explosion of its [[companion star]] about one million years ago and is moving at 108&amp;nbsp;km/s across the sky. It was discovered in 1992, and observations in 1996 confirmed that it is a neutron star, the closest to [[Earth]] discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Martin (2012) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IvDZqZz0Q-QC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=RX+J1856.5-3754+closest+to+earth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BLwmn4pphy&amp;sig=gNG2Ba8eIl_J8sFp36bLzvSlZUs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBGoVChMI1ve1uaiByQIVyVcUCh1oUAZF#v=onepage&amp;q=RX%20J1856.5-3754%20closest%20to%20earth&amp;f=false ''Universe''].
[[Dorling Kindersley]]. p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally thought to be about 150–200 [[light-year]]s away,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2580 "The Mystery of the Lonely Neutron Star"]. [[European Southern Observatory]] press release, September 11, 2000.  Accessed online at spaceref.com May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but further observations using the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in 2002 indicate that its distance is greater—about 400 light-years.&lt;ref name="Drake2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho2007"/&gt;

RX J1856 is one of the [[The Magnificent Seven (neutron stars)|Magnificent Seven]], a group of young neutron stars at distances between 200 and 500 [[parsec]]s (652 and 1630 [[light years]]) of [[Earth]].

== Quark star hypothesis ==
By combining Chandra X-ray Observatory and [[Hubble Space Telescope]] data, astronomers previously estimated that RX J1856 radiates like a solid body with a temperature of 700,000 [[Celsius|°C]] and has a diameter of about 4–8&amp;nbsp;km. This estimated size was too small to reconcile with the standard models of neutron stars, therefore it was suggested that it might be a [[quark star]].&lt;ref name="Drake2002"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Drake J. J.
 | display-authors = etal
 | title = Is RX J1856.5-3754 a Quark Star?

 | doi = 10.1086/340368
|arxiv = astro-ph/0204159 |bibcode = 2002ApJ...572..996D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later refined analysis&lt;ref name="Ho2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Truemper2004"/&gt; of improved Chandra and Hubble observations revealed that the surface temperature of the star is lower, only 434,000&amp;nbsp;°C, and respectively the diameter is larger, about 14&amp;nbsp;km (with account of the effects of [[general relativity]], the observed radius appears about 17&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Ho2007"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">The '''reading span task''' ('''RST''') is a common [[memory span]] task widely cited in, and adapted for, investigations of [[working memory]], [[cognitive processing]], and [[reading comprehension]] that was first published by [[Meredyth Daneman]] and [[Patricia Carpenter]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=daneman&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Carpenter, P. A. (1980). Individual differences in working memory and reading. [[Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior]], 19(4), 450-466.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task==

===Original===

The original RST required participants to read series of unconnected sentences aloud and to remember the final word of each sentence of a series (grouped according to the total number of sentences). With each sentence presented on a card, participants were cued to recall the memorized end-of-sentence words in their original order by a blank card at the end of a series. The number of sentences of a series was incrementally increased until a participant's reading span, or the maximum number of final words correctly recalled, was found.

The reading span task was the first instance of the family of "complex span" tasks (as opposed to "simple span" tasks). It is a complex verbal test because it draws upon both storage and processing (i.e., reading) elements of working memory, while simple verbal tests (e.g., word span) require the storage element alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lobley, K.J., Baddeley, A.D., &amp; Gathercole, S.E. (2005). Phonological similarity effects in verbal complex span. ''The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'', ''58A'', 1462–1478.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===

Besides the "listening span" variant also developed by Daneman and Carpenter,&lt;ref name=daneman /&gt; several variants have been developed in recent years based upon the RST.&lt;ref&gt;Desmette, D., Hupet, M., Schelstraete, M.A., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (1995). Adaptation en langue française du "Reading Span Test" de Daneman et Carpenter. [A French adaptation of Daneman and Carpenter's "Reading Span Test"] ''L'Annee Psychologique'', ''95'', 459–482.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, H., &amp; Osaka, N. (2004). Effect of concreteness of target word on verbal working memory: An evaluation using Japanese version of reading span test. ''Japanese Journal of Psychology'', ''71'', 51–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaPointe, L.B., &amp; Engle, R.W. (1990). Simple and complex word spans as measures of working memory capacity. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition'', ''16'', 1118–1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, J.S., &amp; Whitney, P.J. (2002). Developing L2 oral proficiency through synchronous CMC: Output, working memory, and interlanguage development. ''CALICO Journal'', ''20(1)'', 7–32.

''Discourse Processes'', ''14'', 133–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, P., Arnett, P.A., Driver, A., &amp; Budd, D. (2001). Measuring central executive functioning: What's in a reading span?. ''Brain and Cognition'', ''45'', 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Noort|first=Maurits|last2=Bosch|first2=Peggy|last3=Haverkort|first3=Marco|last4=Hugdahl|first4=Kenneth|date=2008|title=A Standard Computerized Version of the Reading Span Test in Different Languages|url=http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1015-5759.24.1.35|journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment|volume=24|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1027/1015-5759.24.1.35|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems===

In an attempt to formulate a standardized version of the RST, numerous problems with the original and variants of it have been critically examined.

==Findings==

Daneman and Carpenter found that reading span was much more strongly related to reading comprehension than word span. Later research corroborated the finding that reading span is more closely related to language comprehension than word span.&lt;ref&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Merikle, P. M. (1996). Working memory and language comprehension: a meta-analysis. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 3, 422-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological basis===

In a twin study of middle-aged men, a heritability rating of .51 was found for reading span, where genetic influences came from a common latent phenotype, viewed as most likely reflecting an executive function component.&lt;ref&gt;Kremen, W., Jacobsen, K., Xian, H., Eisen, S., Eaves, L., Tsuang, M., et al. (2007). Genetics of verbal working memory processes: A twin study of middle-aged men. ''Neuropsychology'', ''21''(5), 569-580. {{doi|10.1037/0894-4105.21.5.569}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
;Review of Religious Research
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Sacred Journeys'' is a study of conversion into the Divine Light Mission. It includes follow-up information on persons who remained and those who left the movement. [...] The book represents the work of a well-intentioned, compassionate sociologist living in a town where many important events of the Divine Light Mission were occurring. [...] The book has no great insights, no definitive findings and no challenging hypotheses. [...] He [Downton] skillfully intersperses quotations from the guru with his comments. In doing these things, he achieves more than sometimes in the making of books. ''Review of Religious Research, Vol. 21, No. 3. (Summer, 1980).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Smurfette principle''' is the practice in media, such as film, television series and television networks, to include only one woman in an otherwise entirely male ensemble.&lt;ref name="DayKugler2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lori Day|author2=Charlotte Kugler|title=Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip, and So Much More|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6k2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-61374-859-6|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/07/the-problem-with-smurfette/242690/|title=The Problem With Smurfette|last=Richards|first=Jason|date=2011-07-28|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Katha Pollitt]] in 1991 in ''[[The New York Times]]'':&lt;ref name="hers"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/magazine/hers-the-smurfette-principle.html Hers; The Smurfette Principle].

She may or may not play a major role in the story, but typically is “everything female.” Some examples that Pollitt cites include the mother figure, a “glamour queen,” or a female sidekick of sorts.&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt; As a consequence, works employing this [[Trope (literature)|trope]] often fail the [[Bechdel test]], an indicator of gender bias in fiction.{{quote|Contemporary shows are either essentially all-male, like "[[Garfield]]", or are organized on what I call the Smurfette principle: a group of male buddies will be accented by a lone female, stereotypically defined... The message is clear. Boys are the norm, girls the variation; boys are central, girls peripheral; boys are individuals, girls types. Boys define the group, its story and its code of values. Girls exist only in relation to boys.}}This term continues to be used in discourse to describe not only "preschool culture," but also popular media from the last 40 years.

== Origin ==
Pollitt observed this as what she thought of in terms of a common media practice while shopping for her daughter’s Christmas toys. The initial use of the term was in relation to “preschool culture,” that to Pollitt, would hinder a child’s understanding of gender. She goes further to say, “The sexism in preschool culture deforms both boys and girls. Little girls learn to split their consciousness, filtering their dreams and ambitions through boy characters while admiring the clothes of the princess.”&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In 2011 Pollitt discussed her term again in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She said that the issue is still highly prevalent in the current media. She specifically cited the then major blockbuster, ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', which had only one female main character (played by [[Elle Fanning]]). Also at this time, she extended the principle to include television networks. The only major anchor in the MSNBC lineup in 2011, according to Pollitt was [[Rachel Maddow]]. She said, "there's one Rachel Maddow, and then there's that whole male lineup. There's Ed [Schultz], there used to be Keith [Olbermann], and Lawrence O'Donnell, and now there's going to be Al Sharpton. It's quite remarkable that there's only this one woman, and it's never equal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This term has not disappeared by any means, making many appearances in popular literature and discourse. Journalists complain that major blockbusters that will turn out millions of dollars, include only one female, and this trend is not fading anytime soon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/movies/the-smurfette-principle-why-can%E2%80%99t-hollywood-accept-gender-equality/ar-BBGz820?li=AA5a2k|title=The Smurfette Principle: why can’t Hollywood accept gender equality?|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible in ensemble movie posters, like with [[Ocean's Eleven|''Ocean's Eleven'']], [[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']] and [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4616798/movie-posters-single-woman/|title=This Is the Disturbing Movie Poster 'Smurfette Principle'|last=TIME|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Rose looks at Eleven’s situation in the TV show ''[[Stranger Things]]'', where she is essentially replaced (while on her own adventures) by Max, another young girl, who is also teased, then “lusted after,” another common reaction to a lone female character.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The “Smurfette,” or sole female cast member, has been understood to typically have a stereotypical role of a romantic partner, a “brooding badass,” or exists to deflate the tension of an all-male cast.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a result of the discontent about the lack of women, a new pattern has emerged, of “gender-inversion,” casts of exclusively female actresses, like ''[[Ocean's 8|Ocean’s 8]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]''.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tn2magazine.ie/smurfette-principle/|title=The Smurfette Principle|date=2017-08-25|work=TN2 Magazine|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] found that only “10% of all films have a gender balanced cast,” thus reinforcing the existence of the lack of fair female representation, i.e. the Smurfette Principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|title=Gender Bias Without Borders - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In an article and video for ''Bitch Magazine'', [[Anita Sarkeesian]] asserts that the reoccurrence of this issue is that media from the 1980s and 1990s is continuously being remade, which still typically adhere to this principle, creating an ongoing cycle. She also called on the film industry to include more female characters, or even a female dominated cast, ''and'' pass the [[Bechdel test]]. After these are kept in mind and actually accomplished, meaningful diversity will be possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/tropes-vs-women-3-the-smurfette-principle/|title=Tropes vs. Women: #3 The Smurfette Principle|date=2011-04-21|work=Feminist Frequency|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in scholarship ==
Rickie Solinger, in a review of some of Pollitt’s major works up to 1993, stated that the “Smurfette Principle” is applicable to preschoolers and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|date=1995|editor-last=Pollitt|editor-first=Katha|title=First-Class Citizen|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4022132|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.2307/4022132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Susina, a scholar and researcher of child and adolescent literature, used the term in a 1995 edition of the journal, ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', to back up his assertion that children’s literature is being “dumbed down” as a larger symptom of cultural problems, particularly that entertainment is like “junk food,” or unrewarding to the audience. He uses Pollitt’s term as evidence that a lack of women contributes to low quality media for children and also that the popular media has picked up on this issue in major publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susina|first=Jan|date=1993|title=Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/244499|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=v–ix|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256|issn=1080-6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Examples==
Named after [[Smurfette]], the only female among [[the Smurfs]] (a group of comic book creatures), the principle has been observed in the following works among others:

A '''teaching hospital''' is a [[hospital]] or medical center that provides [[medical education]] and training to future and current [[health professional]]s. Teaching hospitals are often affiliated with medical schools and work closely with medical students throughout their period of matriculation, and especially during their clerkship (internship) years.  In most cases, teaching hospitals also offer Graduate Medical Education (GME)/ physician residency programs, where medical school graduates train under a supervising (attending) physician to assist with the coordination of care. 

In addition to offering medical education to medical students and physician residents, many teaching hospitals also serve as research institutes.

==History==
Although institutions for caring for the sick are known to have existed much earlier in history, the first teaching hospital, where students were authorized to methodically practice on patients under the supervision of physicians as part of their education, was reportedly the [[Academy of Gundishapur]] in the [[Persian Empire]] during the [[Sassanid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|E. Browne]], ''Islamic Medicine'', 2002, p.16, {{ISBN|81-87570-19-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

Many [[United States|American]] television shows, usually [[medical drama]]s, take place in teaching hospitals. Some examples are:

*''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that takes place in the [[fictional]] St. Eligius Hospital (located in the [[South End, Boston|South End]] neighborhood of [[Boston]])
*''[[Chicago Hope]]'' that takes place in the fictional Chicago Hope Hospital (located in [[Chicago]])
*''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' that takes place in the fictional County General Hospital (located in Chicago)
*''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' that takes place in the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital (located in the state of [[California]])
*''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' that takes place in the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital (located in the state of [[New Jersey]])
*''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' that takes place in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (located in [[Seattle]])
*''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' where the second season is set in the fictional C+U+R+E Institute, owned by Cathy Munsch ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]), which was originally the Our Lady Of Perpetual Suffering Hospital until a massacre occurred there on Halloween night in 1986. The location of the C+U+R+E Institute is never mentioned.

Some Canadian shows take place in teaching hospitals as well. For example, ''[[Saving Hope (TV series)|Saving Hope]]'' takes place in the fictional Hope Zion Hospital (located in [[Toronto]]).

In the [[United Kingdom]], the 1980s television documentary series ''Jimmy's'' was set in [[St James's University Hospital, Leeds]] (nicknamed Jimmy's), which formerly claimed to be the largest teaching hospital in [[Europe]].

Paris has many renowned teaching hospitals: [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Pitié-Salpêtrière]], [[Hôpital Cochin|Cochin]], [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Necker]] or [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]]. They appear in many films and TV shows. An ''ER'' episode, for example, is set in [[Hôpital Saint-Antoine]] (AP-HP). Many patients are surprised to see medical students at their bedside: they know they are in top hospitals without knowing those hospitals are teaching hospitals.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

A scene in the 1992 film, [[Lorenzo's Oil]], Lorenzo is shown at the [[Boston Children's Hospital]]

{{Shia Islam}}
Ja'fari principles ({{lang-fa|علم اصول در مکتب جعفری}}) refers to regulations, history and eminent persons and scholars during the development of shia's [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].

==History and development==
===Imami jurists and early works===
Considering different stances in relation to Juridical rules and principles, there are some parties in the schools of Principles. These schools try to apply analytical approaches in their methodology. There are somebodies such as Zorarah Ibn Aayon, Muhammad Ibn Moslem, Abu Basir and also Hisham Ibn Salem.Among these individuals, Hisham Ibn Salem and His Pupils had eminent roles in development of principles among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9844&lt;/ref&gt; In this period two problems are so important such as difference of hadith in one hand and the distinctions of Ijtihad or authority in other hand.There are two early scholars in principles of jurisprudence who were eminent including [[Hisham ibn Hakam]] and Yunes Ibn Abd Al Rahman.some scholars know Hisham ibn hakam and hisham ibn salem among the outstanding pupils of Imam Sadiq and Imam Kazim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Mansour Hashemi|Tashbih and tanzih|Daneshnameh Jahan Islami in Pesian|vol=1|p=3554|cite book=http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/3554/%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%85}}&lt;/ref&gt; they wrote important books in the field of principles of jurisprudence such as "Kitab Al Akhbar" and " Kayfa Taseh" or "How it is correct?"

===Period of establishment===
It seems that the dominant current was the Adherents of Hadith during the fourth century of Lunar hijrah. They didn't any need to knowledge of principles and put it away.In other hand the relatives of Nobakhti begun a new movement in the sphere of theology and [[kalam]] among shia and Imamiyyah.Abu Sahl Nobakhti, the popular theologian of Shia schools, could presented a new and complete theological system along with Shia characters.In Fact Abu Sahl Nobakhti concerned with the principles through the theological works such a way that He referred to some questions in the field of the principles.According to Madlung this approach of Abu Sahl Nobakhti and his theological system was along with defending of Imami creeds and theological beliefs.Maybe the most important Abu Sahl's essay in the principles is the essay of "Naqz Al Shafe'ei or the refusing the shafe'ei which is written against Shafe'ei and also counted as the first completed work in the principles among imamiyyah.besided he written some books on the subjects of refusing Qyias in jurisprudence and ijtihad Al R'ay.Of course there is no track from these works and they are lost.During the fourth century of Hijrah, already one trend is very dominant which is indeed on the basis of refusing of Qiyas and R'ay in jurisprudence. Also there were many books concerned with these subjects among imami Theologians. for example Hasan ibn Mousa Nobakhti wrote a book by the name of "A book on the khabar Vahed and Amal".according to this works there is no appication for Qiyas and R'ay.Among The first Mutakalim Jurist in fourth century is Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani as some one who possessed a school which his method was similar to Twelve Imams of Shia and somehow like the Mutazilite schools of thought.

====Ibn Abi Aqil And his thought====
His complete name was Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani and he came from the [[Yemen]]. He was contemporary with Shaykh Koleini.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jafar sobhani|Al Vasit fi Feqh|vol=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil counted as pioneer jurist in the principles. He could establishing an approach on which His juridical methodology was dependent on Quranic rules and known traditions.He is the author of a legal work entitled Mutamassak bi Habl Al Rasul, which was one of the most renowned legal sources during the 4th and 5thllOth and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Modarrsei TabaTabaei|1984|p=35|introduction to shi'i law}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first one who arrange the knowledge of [[fiqh]] and give consistency ti it.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/15/6/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn Jonayd Eskafi====
[[Ibn Jonayd Eskafi]]  was one of the first and eminent Shia jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513&lt;/ref&gt; He had different approach in understanding of Shia's traditions. He believed that there is a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith on which the Juridical tradition of Imams is not according to Saying but to Ray or opinion.He was an eminent religious scholars among elites.Also Ibn Nadim knows him as great scholars among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/200&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important book in Fiqh is Tahzib Al Shia le Ahkam Al Shariah.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of development===
Needness to Usul becomes indispensable when Shia community far away from twelve periods. Also appearance of new subjects intensify this necessity.in development epoch we confronted with three eminent masters in the field of Usul and extending it namely [[Shaykh Mufid]], [[Sharif Murtaza]], [[Sallar Deylami]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]].

====Shaykh Mufid====

===Period of flourishing===
this period begans from the end of Sixth into middle of eighth lunar hijrah.Scholars written many detailed books in the fielf of principles.They concerned with principles in detail and accuracy.Scholars such as Ibn Zohreh halabi,Sadid Al Din Hemsi,Najm Al Din Helli,Allameh Helli,Amid Al Din A'araji,Zia Al Din A'araji,Fakhr Al Mohaqeqin, Muhammad Ibn Makki known as first martyr,Shaykh Abdullah Soyouri,Zain Al DIn Ibn Nour Al Din Ali Ibn Ahmad known A Second Martyr, all of them lived in this period.

====Ibn Zohreh Halabi====
His whole name is Ezz Al Din A l Makarem Sayyed Hamzeh Ibn Ali Ibn Zohreh. According To Moreza Mutahhari he learened Tusi's Nihayah under Ibn Hajib.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.motahari.ir/Content/933/321&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 20th book attributed to him. diversity of them shows his all arounded.His eminent book in principle is Qanyat Al Nozu fi Elmi Al Usul Va foru.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/947&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the still existent town of [[Al Hillah]] (in what is now [[Iraq]]), commonly viewed as the [[Shi'a Islam in Iraq|centre of Shia Islam]] when [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] leaders were in control over [[Baghdad]] during his life.&lt;ref name="jafri"/&gt; He entered into a prominent family of [[Ulama|Shia jurists]] and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected ''mujtahid'' and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle [[Muhaqqiq al-Hilli]] was also a renowned scholar.He studied [[Islamic theology|theology]] and [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus.&lt;ref name="tehrani"&gt;Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.52 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent some time at the newly established [[Maragheh observatory]], where he studied [[Avicennism|Avicennan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] under [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and was also introduced to the works of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"&gt;Schmidkte, S. ḤELLI, ḤASAN B. YUSOF B. MOṬAHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver [[jurisprudence]] is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on [[usul al-fiqh]], he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are ''al-Mukhtalaf'' (''The Disagreement'') and ''al-Muntaha'' (''The End''). ''Mukhtalaf'' is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the ''Muntaha'' is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, ''Qawa'id ul-Ahkam'', which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is ''Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha'', which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, ''[[Hajj]]'' or ''[[Salat]]'').&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"/&gt;

====Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin====
Muhaqqiq was born in the city of [[al-Hilla]], [[Iraq]], where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied [[theology]], [[fiqh]] and [[usul al-fiqh]] under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there.He has many credible books in principles like Mabadi Al Osul,Fakhryyah and others.

====First martyr====
{{main article|Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili}}
Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili al-[[Jezzine|Jizzini]]&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073551|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1334–1385) also known as '''Shahid Awwal''' (Arabic: الشهيد الأول''ash-Shahid al-Awwal''  "The First Martyr"), is the author of Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (Arabic: الدمشقية اللمعة, The Damascene Glitter") and was a [[Shi'a]] scholar. Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as "Shahid Awwal" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner.When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al-[[Hilla]] in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used [[taqiyya]] to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"/&gt;

====Second martyr====
{{main article|Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili}}
Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506-1558) was a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] scholar. He was born in 911 AH. in Jabal Amel.His Magnum opus is the first commentary of ''The Damascene Glitter'' by [[Shahid Awwal]] called ''The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter'' (Arabic: ''ar-Rawda-l-Bahiyah fi Sharh allam'a-d-Dimashqiya''   الروضة البهيّة في شرح اللمعة الدمشقيّة ).

===Period of Decline===
The appearance of Akhbari lies in this period.This school  "crystalized" as a distinct movement with the writings of [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]] (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and early post-Safavid era.  However, shortly thereafter [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (d. 1792), along with other Usuli [[mujtahid]]s, crushed the Akhbari movement.&lt;ref name="momen222"&gt;{{Citation| last =Momen| first =Moojan| author-link =

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akhbārī ideology is that nothing but the aḥadīth of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]]'', arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics,  clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.

====Against akhbarism====
*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

==Contemporary periods==
[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the infallibles (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.&lt;ref&gt;This has been translated into English twice: by [[Roy Mottahedeh]] as "Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence" (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-85168-393-2}} and anonymously as "The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law" (2003) {{ISBN|978-1-904063-12-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English version==
Uşūl al-Fiqh, the [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodology of jurisprudence]], which is usually – and inaccurately, if not incorrectly – translated “principles of jurisprudence,” is an Islamic science which is developed by Shiite scholars in two recent centuries into an unparalleled intellectual, logical system of thought and a comprehensive branch of knowledge which not only serves as the logic of jurisprudence but as an independent science dealing with some hermeneutical problems.

Lack of precise English equivalents to expressions and terms of this complicated science indicates the least difficulties of preparing the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.

"[http://bayanbox.ir/download/6126480921220660060/USUL-AL-FIQH.pdf An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence (Uşūl al-Fiqh)-A Shiite Approach]" is the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.[http://www.lib.ir/book/60869565/An-introduction-to-methodology-of-Islamic-Jurispru/]

This book is written by Alireza Hodaee, Professor of [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]] and the Essentials of Islamic Law, University of Tehran.[http://usuli.ir/2016/07/04/usul-al-fiqh/]

It should be noted that most of complicated arguments of such profound science cannot be presented in an introductory work; they should be pursued in detailed books written by great Shiite Uşūlīs.

[[File:Wendel Dietterlin.png|150px|right]]
'''Wendel Dietterlin''' (c.1550&amp;ndash;1599), sometimes '''Wendel Dietterlin the Elder''', to distinguish him from his son, was a German [[Northern Mannerism|mannerist]] painter, [[printmaker]] and [[architectural theory|architectural theoretician]]. Most of his paintings are now lost, and he is best known&lt;ref&gt;Heck.&lt;/ref&gt; for his treatise on architectural ornament, ''Architectura'', published in its final edition in Nuremberg in 1598.

==Life==
Dietterlin was born at [[Pfullendorf]] in [[Württemberg]]; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in [[Swabia]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703. According to Martin, he was the son of a Pfullendorf painter named Balthus Grapp or Krapf. Michèle-Caroline Heck, in her biography of Dietterlin in ''Grove'', claims that he "was the son of a Protestant pastor and spent his childhood in Lissenheim before moving to Strasbourg with his widowed mother."&lt;/ref&gt; spent most of his life in [[Strasbourg]] (then Strassburg), where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570, and where he is known to have painted frescos for the ''Bruderhof'', the Bishop's residence, in 1575, but he is later recorded in [[Hagenau]] in 1583 and in [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]] in 1589. He also worked on large projects in Stuttgart for some time (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[Strasbourg]].

==Paintings==
In Strasbourg, Dietterlin worked on the decoration of the ''Neuer Bau'' (currently the building of the [[Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie, Strasbourg|Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie]]) in 1589. Between 1590 and 1592 he was employed in [[Stuttgart]] with the execution of a large (57 metres long and 20 metres wide) ceiling painting in the upper hall of the ''[[Neues Lusthaus]]'', a building constructed by [[Duke of Württemberg|Duke Ludwig of Württemberg]] for entertainment purposes. In addition to the ceiling, Dietterlin painted the walls of the hall. The Renaissance ''Lusthaus'' having later been rebuilt several times and almost entirely replaced in 1845 by the new ''Hoftheater'' (which was destroyed in a fire in 1902, when some of the remains of the original building came to light),&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; nothing is now preserved of the paintings from the hall, but they are depicted in a 1619 etching by the Strasbourg-based painter and engraver [[Friedrich Brentel]] showing the interior of the large room.&lt;ref&gt;Heck; Borries.&lt;/ref&gt; Other of his paintings are known from engravings by Matthäus Greuter and by his own grandson Bartholomäus Dietterlin. The style, with "exaggerated foreshortenings", appears influenced by North Italian models, such as [[Giulio Romano]]'s frescos in Mantua, through German intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;

His only extant painting is a ''Resurrection of Lazarus'' (in the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]]), signed and dated 1582 or 1587.

==The ''Architectura''==
[[File:Dietterlin, Architectura, Composita, plate 178.jpg|thumb|Columns of the Composite order in Wendel Dietterlin's version. From ''Architectura'', plate 178.]]
Dietterlin's architectural treatise ''Architectvra: Von Außtheilung, Symmetria vnd Proportion der Fünff Seulen'' was first published in separate parts in 1593 and 1594, and finally in a combined and expanded edition in 1598. The book described the [[classical order]]s and their character and proper use, as was traditional in such books. Dietterlin, however, showed less interest in the proportions of the order than in their ornamentation. According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton, Dietterlin treats the orders "more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation".&lt;ref&gt;"Även om gravyrserien följer den gängse grupperingen toscana – dorica – ionica – corintia – composita utgör dessa klassiska ordningar till synes mera en utgångspunkt eller förevändning för utvecklandet av en bisarr ornamental fantasi än didaktiska skådeexempel på klassisk arkitekturdekoration." Fulton, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other theoreticians, he ascribed masculine and feminine qualities to the orders. In giving them an appropriate ornamentation that would agree with these qualities, he borrowed from older forms of ornament, including [[Gothic tracery]]. Dietterlin was dependent on many older models, and like other representatives of the Northern Renaissance (such as [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]) he filled his surfaces with [[scrollwork]], [[strapwork]], gemshapes and [[grotesque]]s. Dietterlin had Northern European contemporaries who likewise integrated Gothic elements in their designs, but he was unusual in the degree of blending of elements of different origin. While others kept Gothic elements clearly separate from Renaissance forms, Dietterlin would cover Renaissance elements in Gothic tracery or allow one to morph midway into the other.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, p. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5552">'''Wisdom literature''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] common in the [[ancient Near East]]. It consists of statements by [[sage (philosophy)|sages]] and [[Wisdom|wise]] men that offer teachings about divinity and [[virtue]]. Although this genre uses techniques of traditional oral story-telling, it was disseminated in written form.

The literary genre of [[mirrors for princes]], which has a long history in [[Islamic literature|Islamic]] and Western [[Renaissance literature]], is a secular cognate of wisdom literature. In [[Classical Antiquity]], the [[didactic]] poetry of [[Hesiod]], particularly his ''[[Works and Days]],'' was regarded as a source of knowledge similar to the wisdom literature of [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Israel]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Ancient Egyptian literature==
{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian philosophy}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
In [[ancient Egyptian literature]], wisdom literature belonged to the ''[[sebayt]]'' ("teaching") genre which flourished during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] and became [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical during the [[New Kingdom]]. Notable works of this genre include the ''[[Instructions of Kagemni]]'', ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'', the ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat]]'', and the ''[[Loyalist Teaching]]''.

==Biblical wisdom literature and Jewish texts==
The most famous examples of wisdom literature are found in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Crenshaw|Crenshaw, James L.]] ''"The Wisdom Literature"'', in Knight, Douglas A. and Tucker, Gene M. (eds), ''The Hebrew Bible and Its Modern Interpreters'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Bernhard W.|authorlink=Bernhard Anderson|title=The Living World of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2sOAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Longmans|pages=570ff|chapter=The Beginning of Widom – Israels Wisdom literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sapiential Books ===
&lt;!--"Sapiential Books" redirects here--&gt;
The term "Sapiential Books" or "Books of Wisdom" is used in [[biblical studies]] to refer to a subset of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the [[Septuagint]] translation. There are seven of these books, namely the books of [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], the [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), the [[Book of Wisdom]] and [[Sirach]] (Ecclesiasticus). Not all the Psalms are usually regarded as belonging to the Wisdom tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, D. J., ''Handbook on the Wisdom Books and Psalms'' ([[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids, MI]]: [[Baker Publishing Group]], 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4ARZdgdyAMC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 141].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], the Books of Wisdom other than the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach are regarded as part of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' or "Writings". In [[Christianity]], Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are included in the [[Old Testament]] by all traditions, while Wisdom, and Sirach are regarded in some traditions as [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] works which are placed in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] within the Anglican and Protestant [[Bible translations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{wwbible|Old Testament, 355–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sapiential Books are in the broad tradition of wisdom literature that was found widely in the [[Ancient Near East]], including many religions other than Judaism.

==== Septuagint ====
{{Further|Chokhmah}}
The Greek noun ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|σοφῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophíā}}) is the translation of "wisdom" in the Greek [[Septuagint]] for [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] ''Ḥokmot'' ({{rtl-lang|he|[[wikt:חכמות|חכמות]]}}, {{transl|he|khakhamút}}). Wisdom is a central topic in the "Sapiential" Books, i.e., [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Wisdom]], [[Wisdom of Sirach]], and to some extent [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] (the last three are [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocryphal]] / [[Deuterocanonical books]] of the [[Old Testament]]).

(2009). In ''Penguin dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896&amp;ndash;1934) during the last ten years of his life.&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A.

Vygotsky: ''Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky and some other educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. Of Young Children. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|thumb|Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934]]

The concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' intelligence. He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone learners.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"&gt;''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that maths and writing don’t come naturally, that these are concepts taught in schools and tend to come along with some difficulty, while Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.&lt;ref name="Theories"&gt;Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others. They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and “pull the students along.”&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

Vygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. of Young Children. pp. 25&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a question: "if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?" He concluded that they were not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Stages of development. (2010). In Curriculum connections psychology: Cognitive development. Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vygotsky's untimely death interrupted his work on the zone of proximal development, and it remained mostly incomplete.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaretskii|first=V.

==Definition==
Since Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, E. (2006). Zone of proximal development. In ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt;

Any function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function’s actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bozhovich, E. D. (2009). Zone of Proximal Development: The Diagnostic Capabilities and Limitations of Indirect Collaboration. Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology, 47(6), 48-69. Retrieved from EBSCOHost Database&lt;/ref&gt; This context can impact the diagnosis of a function’s potential level of development.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009" /&gt;

Vygotsky stated that we can’t just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

In the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky’s definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context &lt;ref&gt;Fani, Tayebeh &amp; Ghaemi, Farid. (2011). Implications of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) in Teacher Education: ZPTD and Self-scaffolding. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences. 29. 1549-1554. 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.396. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Scaffolding==

The concept of the ZPD is widely used to study children's mental development as it relates to education. The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of "support points" for performing an action.&lt;ref&gt;Obukhova, L. F., &amp; Korepanova, I. A. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development: A Spatiotemporal Model. ''Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology'', 47(6), 25-47. {{doi|10.2753/RPO1061-0405470602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer to permit the child to work within the ZPD.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"&gt;Morgan, A. (2009, July 28). What is "Scaffolding" and the "ZPD"? Retrieved October 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"/&gt; According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wass, R., &amp; Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary—much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. "Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Balaban, Nancy. (1995). "Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person." In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"/&gt; 

One example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.&lt;ref name="Wells 1999"&gt;Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.

Another example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.

The concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill. 

== Implications for educators ==
Various investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., &amp; Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name="Wass" /&gt; Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development. &lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.&lt;ref&gt;Kuusisaari, H. (2014). Teachers at the zone of proximal development: Collaboration promoting or hindering the development process. ''Teaching and Teacher Education'', ''43'', 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt;
