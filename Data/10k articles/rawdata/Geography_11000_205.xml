The '''administrative divisions of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|административна подела Србије}} / ''аdministrativna podela Srbije'') are regulated by the [[Government of Serbia]] ''Enactment'' of 29 January 1992,&lt;ref name="uredba"&gt;Government of Serbia: [http://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/cms/view.php?id=1010 Districts In Serbia]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Law on Territorial Organization adopted by the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] on 29 December 2007.&lt;ref name="zakon"&gt;[http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/cir/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=466&amp;t=Z# Law on Territorial Organization and Local Self-Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513114716/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/cir/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=466&amp;t=Z%23 |date=2011-05-13 }}, Parliament of Serbia {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lokalni i pokrajinski izbori u maju|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=278577|accessdate=20 March 2017|work=b92.net|agency=Beta, Tanjug|date=29 December 2007|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serbia]] is divided into 29 [[List of districts of Serbia|districts]] by the ''Enactment'' of 29 January 1992, while the units of the territorial organization are: [[Municipalities and cities of Serbia|municipalities and cities]] and autonomous provinces, by the Law on Territorial Organization.&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt;

==Regions==
{{Main article|Statistical regions of Serbia}}

[[File:Statistical regions of Serbia.svg|thumb|right|200px|Statistical regions of Serbia]]
;Autonomous provinces
Serbia has two autonomous provinces: [[Vojvodina]] in the north (39 municipalities and 6 cities) and [[Kosovo and Metohija]]&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt; in the south (28 municipalities and 1 city).

The province of Vojvodina has its own [[Assembly of Vojvodina|assembly]] and [[Government of Vojvodina|government]]. It enjoys autonomy on certain matters, such as infrastructure, science, education and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Закон о утврђивању надлежности Аутономне Покрајине Војводине|trans_title=The Law Establishing the Jurisdiction of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|wslanguage=sr|author=Republic of Serbia}} {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija has been transferred to the administration of [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] since June 1999, following the [[Kosovo War]]. In February 2008, the [[Government of Kosovo]] unilaterally [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] from Serbia, a move recognized by {{Numrec|Kos}} countries (including most of the [[European Union]] and the United States) but not recognized by Serbia, Russia, China, India, Spain, Brazil, Georgia, Indonesia or the [[United Nations]].

;Statistical regions
The five statistical regions of Serbia are:
* [[Vojvodina]]
* [[Belgrade]]
* [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]]
* [[Southern and Eastern Serbia]]
* [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo and Metohija]]

==Districts==
{{Main article|List of districts of Serbia}}

[[File:Districts of Serbia.png|thumb|right|Districts of Serbia]]
[[District]]s are the first level administrative subdivisions of the country and largest entities, constituted of municipalities and cities. Districts are regional centers of state authority, but have no assemblies of their own; they present purely administrative divisions, and host various state institutions such as funds, office branches and courts. Districts are not defined by the Law on Territorial Organisation, but are organised under the Government's Enactment of 29 January 1992.&lt;ref name="uredba"/&gt;

Serbia is divided into 29 districts (7 in Vojvodina, 9 in [[Southern and Eastern Serbia]], 8 in [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]] and 5 in Kosovo and Metohija), while the city of Belgrade presents a district of its own.

==Municipalities and cities==
{{Main article|Municipalities and cities of Serbia}}

;Municipalities
Serbia is divided into 145 [[municipality|municipalities]] and 29 [[cities]],&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt; which form the basic units of [[local government]]. Each municipality has its own assembly (elected every four years in local elections), a municipal president, public service property and a budget. Municipalities usually have more than 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt;

Municipalities comprise [[local community|local communities]], which mostly correspond to settlements (villages) in the rural areas (several small villages can comprise one local community, and large villages can contain several communities). Urban areas are also divided into local communities. Their roles include communication of elected municipal representatives with citizens, organization of [[Initiative|citizen initiative]]s related with public service and communal issues. They are presided over by ''councils'', elected in semi-formal elections, whose members are basically volunteers. The role of local communities is far more important in rural areas; due to proximity to municipal centers, many urban local communities are defunct.

;Cities
{{Main article|List of cities in Serbia}}
Cities are another type of local self-government. Territories with the status of "city" usually have more than 100,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt; but are otherwise very similar to municipalities. There are 27 cities, each having an assembly and budget of its own. Only cities have [[mayors]], although the presidents of the municipalities are often referred to as "mayors" in everyday usage.

The city may or may not be divided into "city municipalities". Six cities, [[Belgrade]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Niš]], [[Požarevac]], [[Užice]] and [[Vranje]] comprise several municipalities, divided into urban and suburban areas. Competences of cities and their municipalities are divided. Of those, only Novi Sad did not undergo the full transformation, as the newly formed municipality of [[Petrovaradin]] exists only formally; thus, the ''[[City municipality of Novi Sad]]'' is largely equated to ''City of Novi Sad'' (and the single largest municipality in the country, with around 300,000 residents).

==Subdivisions of Kosovo==
{{Main article|Subdivisions of Kosovo}}
Although the Serbian laws treat Kosovo as every other part of Serbia, and divide it into 5 districts, 28 municipalities and 1 city,&lt;ref name="zakon"/&gt; the [[UNMIK]] administration adopted new territorial organisation of Kosovo in 2000. This move is not recognized by Serbia, but is recognized by the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Kosovo]]. According to the new subdivision, Kosovo is divided into [[Districts of Kosovo|7 (new) districts]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} and [[Municipalities of Kosovo|37 municipalities]] (8 new municipalities were created: [[Mališevo]], [[Elez Han]], [[Gračanica, Kosovo|Gračanica]], [[Junik]], [[Klokot-Vrbovac]], [[Mamuša]], [[Parteš]] and [[Ranilug]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Mission in Kosovo: [http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13982.html Municipal profiles]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Serb" districts function in the areas where [[Kosovo Serbs]] live, but are only recognized by Serbs, while the "UNMIK" districts, which function in all of Kosovo, are recognized only by [[Kosovo Albanians]].

'''Bat Galim''' ({{lang-he|בת גלים}}, ''lit.'' Daughter of the Waves) is a neighborhood of [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], located at the foot of [[Mt. Carmel]] on the Mediterranean coast. Bat Galim is known for its promenade and sandy beaches. The neighborhood spans from [[Rambam Hospital|Rambam hospital]] in the North to the [[Cable cars in Haifa|Haifa Cable Cars]] in the South, and from the Mediterranean Sea's shore line in the West to [[Haifa Bat Galim railway station|Bat Galim's train station]] on the East.   

==History==
Bat Galim was the first point of Jewish settlement in modern Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=WesternHaifa |title=Haifa Municipality - Aliya Web Site |publisher=.haifa.muni.il |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012075858/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=WesternHaifa |archivedate=2013-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood was established in the 1920s as a garden suburb of private homes designed by the [[Bauhaus]] architect [[Richard Kaufmann]]. During the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], Bat Galim was Haifa's entertainment center. The "Casino," a landmark building on the Bat Galim promenade, housed a cafe patronized by British officers, although it was never used for gambling.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3138466,00.html |title=Can Bat Galim be saved? - Israel Travel, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the center of water sports in the country, and a swimming pool was built there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Sport+in+Israel/Rule+Britannia+The+British+Influence+and+the+Maccabiah+Games.htm Rule Britannia: The British  Influence and the Maccabiah Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rambam Hospital|Rambam Medical Center]], the [[Technion]]'s [[Rappaport Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine and the Rappaport Family Institute for Research]] in the Medical Sciences are situated in the north of Bat Galim, near the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/eng/TheTechnionCampus.html |title=Welcome to Technion Graduate School |publisher=Graduate.technion.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307083648/http://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Eng/TheTechnionCampus.html |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bat Galim and nearby neighborhoods are served by the [[Haifa Bat Galim Railway Station]]. Bat Galim is the lower station of the [[Haifa Cable Car]], which runs up and down the Carmel from Stella Maris.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt;

==Demographics==
Bat Galim is a mixed neighborhood consisting of families from many different nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds including Jewish families who lived there prior to WWII, hence there's a large elderly presence, many immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Christian and Muslim minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.theinstitute.org.il/files/articles/batgalim.pdf|title= Future of Bat Galim 2013|publisher = JDC|date=4 August 2013|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the last several years, Bat Galim has seen an inception of medical students, both native and international, who come to study and intern at the [[Rambam Hospital|Rambam hospital]].  
The neighborhood also has an eclectic community with many self proclaimed artists and artisans who started an annual tradition where they open their homes to the public for a few days in September to showcase and sell their crafts which include hand-made pottery, glass art, jewelry, photographs and paintings of the neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://haifahaifa.co.il/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-9-%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%91%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D/|title= Bat Galim 9 Festival of open houses in Bat Galim|publisher = haifahaifa.co.il|date=13 September 2018|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This annual event attracts people from all over the country and also features live music, entertainment for the kids, lectures, architectural tours of the city and a speech by the [[Mayor of Haifa]].

==Beach and Surfing==
Bat Galim is a popular location for surfers, including wave, wind and kite surfing, year round, with many international competitions taking place there. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=https://www.israel21c.org/surfs-up-israels-top-10-surfing-beaches/|title= Israel’s top 10 surfing beaches|publisher=Israel 21c|first=Jessica|last= Steinberg|date=26 September 2010|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the surfers, there are many swimmers, with three supervised beaches along the shore including the popular "Lagoona" beach specifically for swimmers and the "Backdoor" beach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=https://www.haifatrail.com/haifa-trail-segment17-eng.htm#./images/sect-17/Haifa-Trail-Sect17-P1030270.jpg/|title= Bat Galim - the Seaside Neighborhood|publisher=Haifa Trail|first=Guy|last= Shachar|date=18 August 2013|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for wave surfers.

The [[German language|German]] term '''''Bezirk''''' (plural ''Bezirke'', derived from {{lang-la|circulus}}, "circle") translated as "[[district]]" can refer to the following types of [[administrative division]]s:

* ''[[Stadtbezirk]]'', a subdivision of a city in the sense of a [[borough]] (e.g. in [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|Berlin]], [[Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg|Hamburg]] or [[Districts of Vienna|Vienna]]), often again subdivided into several [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]] and [[neighbourhood]]s. According to German ''[[Gemeindeordnung]]'' codes, the [[city council]] resolves upon the implementation by municipal [[by-law]] (''Satzung''). In some cities the ''Bezirke'' have limited powers delegated to them by the city's local government, including an assembly resulting from [[local election]]s and an own 'mayor' (''[[Burgomaster|Bürgermeister]]''). In the German [[States of Germany|states]] of [[Hesse]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] any [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] is authorized to implement ''[[Ortsbezirk]]e'' with own advisory councils and local administrators. The state law in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] commits the municipal administration of an [[independent city]] to subdivide the urban area into ''Stadtbezirke''.
* In [[Austria]], the word ''Bezirk'' is used with different meanings in three different contexts:
** Some of the tasks of the administrative branch of the national and regional governments are fulfilled by the 95 [[District Captaincy (Austria)|district captaincies]] (''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'', also translated as ''district administrative office''). The area a district administrative office is responsible for is often, although informally, called a district (''Bezirk''). A number of [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]], currently 15, are not served by any district administrative office. Their respective municipal bureaucracies handle the tasks normally performed by the district administrative office.
** The cities of [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]] are divided into municipal districts (''Stadtbezirke''), assisting the respective municipal governments.
** From the point of view of the [[judiciary of Austria]], the country is subdivided into 115 judicial districts (''Gerichtsbezirke''), each corresponding to one of the country's 115 lowest-level trial courts.
* The [[Italy|Italian]] autonomous provinces of [[Trentino]] and [[South Tyrol]], are divided into ''[[Districts of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Bezirksgemeinschaft]]en'' ({{lang-it|comunità comprensoriali}}).
* The [[districts of Switzerland]] are called ''Bezirke'' in several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. In [[Switzerland as a federal state]], every canton is free to implement its own administrative structure. The intermediate administrative level above the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|Swiss municipalities]] is also referred to as ''Verwaltungsregion'' or ''Verwaltungskreis'', ''Wahlkreis'', ''Amtei'' or ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'', as well as {{lang-fr|districts}} in [[Suisse romande]] and {{lang-it|distretto}} in Svizzera italiana. In [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], the six historic ''Bezirke'' are self-governing bodies, some with regional ''[[Landsgemeinde]]'' assemblies, similar to the municipal ''Kreise'' of [[Graubünden]]. The six ''Bezirke'' of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] are identically equal to municipalities.
* Historically the primary [[administrative divisions of East Germany]] from 1952 were called ''Bezirke''. They were implemented by an administrative reform to supersede the East German federated states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]. The capital [[East Berlin]] was officially equated by resolution of the [[State Council of East Germany]] in 1961. Though legislative assemblies (''Bezirkstage'') and executive councils (''Räte'') existed, the ''Bezirke'' according to the top-down principle of [[democratic centralism]] enjoyed no autonomy nor any self-governing rights. They were abolished by law which the East German [[People's Chamber]] passed in 1990 on the eve of the [[German reunification]].
*During the [[Second World War]], a special [[administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|administrative division of Nazi Germany]] was officially classified as "Bezirk": ''[[Bezirk Bialystok]]''.

'''Buada''' is a [[Districts of Nauru|district]] in the [[Pacific]] nation of [[Nauru]]. It is the only district in [[Buada Constituency]]. It has a population of 739 (2011).

==Geography==
The only landlocked district in the Republic of Nauru, it is in the southwestern part of the island, and covers the central [[Buada Lagoon]]. Buada is a fertile piece in Nauru and mostly wet and tropical due to the mass vegetation (compared to the rest of the island). It covers an area of {{convert|2.6|km2|abbr=on}}, which in comparison with other of Nauru's districts, makes it among the largest.

Buada has retained more vegetation than other districts, where, because of mining, much vegetation has been lost. The proximity of the Buada Lagoon has been relevant to the survival of vegetation.

==History==
The district held the ancient name Arenibok as early as the 1500s to the late 1800s. The Germans referred to it as 'Bush Village' (1889) after agreeing to its new boundaries located by the Germans, the locals during 1890 named it Buada (ghost land) which is still referred to nowadays.

The last of the few Irutsi clans consisting of four members only, along with the largest of all clans, the Eamwit, inhabited Buada ever since it was known by its original name Arenibok. Few of the other two clans, namely the Emea and the Deiboe clans, also resided with their relatives in Buada

The 10 year [[Nauruan Tribal War]] began in this district during a wedding festival in Aujo hamlet in 1878, when a drunk white opened fire and accidentally killed the lad Giubu of the Eamwit clan, nephew of chief Teiauw of the Eaoru clan and a great-nephew of the chief Aremwa.

Arenibok (now Buada) had four main villages, namely Arenibok and Redeto, villages on the banks of the great Arenibok Sea (now Buada Lagoon) and two other villages of Noreo on the steep slopes towards the south and Aujo with its few hamlets towards inland to the north.

==Notable people==
*[[Ruben Kun]], who represented Buada in the [[Parliament of Nauru]], served as [[President of Nauru]] from 1996 to 1997.
*[[Roland Kun]] (son of Ruben Kun) is the current (2012) representative for Buada district to the Parliament of Nauru.

Calcareous grassland is an important habitat for insects, particularly [[butterflies]], and is kept at a [[plagioclimax]] by [[grazing]] [[animal]]s, usually sheep and sometimes cattle. [[Rabbit]]s used to play a part but due to the onset of [[myxomatosis]] their numbers decreased so dramatically that they no longer have much of a grazing effect.

'''Carl Gunnar Feilberg ''' (1894–1972) was a Danish [[geographer]], [[ethnographer]] and explorer of [[Asia]].

== Life ==
Feilberg was born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] on October 22, 1894. His father was Henning Frederik Feilberg (1865 - 1940)  and his mother Anny Caroline Louise Olsen (1867 - 1934)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/Anny-Feilberg/6000000003757900790&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from the Østersøgades gymnasium, Copenhagen in 1912. He attended the [[University of Copenhagen]] and in 1919 he was awarded a [[Master of Theology]] ([[Cand.theol.|Candidatus theologiæ]]) with excellence for the university's historical prize essay  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accessit He married Martha Siegumfeldt and they had a son Anders F S Feilberg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appletree.com/Carl_Gunnar_Feilberg_1{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Hellerup]] in Denmark on January 6, 1972.&lt;ref name=DBL&gt;Danish Biographical Lexicon, available at http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Naturvidenskab_og_teknik/Geograf/C._G._Feilberg?highlight=Carl%20Gunnar%20Feilberg ''Accessed 2012-07-18''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Feilberg was appointed to the Chair of [[Human Geography]] at [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1949.
By the help of the Danish company,[http://www.kampsax.dk/ Kampsax], Feilberg travelled in 1935 to [[Iran]], where he carried out ethnographical fieldwork in Bala Geriveh among the [[Papi District|Papi]] tribe in Southern [[Luristan]] in [[Iran]] from the end of March to the end of July. Feilberg, who carried out fieldwork among the Lur pastoralists, dealt with the history of nomadism through an intricate analysis of the structure and distribution of the black tent (''La tente Noire'', Copenhagen, 1944). During his stay in the district of [[Luristan]] in [[Iran]] he gathered the huge number of material cultures of the nomads of [[Luristan]] and gave them to the [[Danish National Museum|National Museum of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedram Khosrownejad LURISTAN NOMADIC MATERIAL CULTURES IN DENMARK,(The History of Luristan nomad’s material cultures in the [[Moesgård Museum]] of Denmark){{cite web|url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/Events/2004/Middle_East/PedramKhosrownejad.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714040809/http://www.diis.dk/graphics/Events/2004/Middle_East/PedramKhosrownejad.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feilberg, funded by the [[Carlsberg Foundation]], stayed with KAMPSAX engineers (in Bala Gariveh, southern Luristan) who had been contracted during the mid-1930s to build the [[Trans-Iranian railway]]. He made collections of ethnographic materials and took many pictures of people, working and relaxing; of tents and winter dwellings; of tools, rugs, carpets, and other domestic equipment; of animals; and of weddings and musical instruments. The photographs and collections are curated at the [[Danish National Museum]] (Copenhagen) and at the [[Moesgård Museum|Prehistoric Museum (Moesgaard)]].&lt;ref&gt;Nomads of Luristan: History, Material Culture, and Pastoralism in Western Iran  by Patty Jo Watson, Journal of the American Oriental Society, The / July-Sept, 1996 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_n3_v116/ai_n28679160/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dinner Falls''' is a mix of three [[waterfall]]s that display [[Waterfall#Types|plunge]], [[Waterfall#Types|segmented]] and [[Waterfall#Types|cascade]] characteristics on the upper [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] located in the [[Far North Queensland|Far North]]  region of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].

==Location and features==
The waterfall is located approximately {{convert|25|km}} south of [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]] on the [[Atherton Tableland]] near the [[Mount Hypipamee Crater]] in the [[Mount Hypipamee National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wettropics.gov.au/ttd/trackdtl?idtrack=54 |title=Things to Do Dinner Falls Circuit |accessdate=7 August 2009 |date= |work= |publisher=Wet Tropics Management Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226222244/http://wettropics.gov.au/ttd/trackdtl?idtrack=54 |archivedate=26 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottommost of the waterfall series is a long cascade fall; the middle section of the falls is a trio of segmented drops; while the uppermost section of the falls has a triangular shape as it plunges off the tableland plateau.&lt;ref name=wow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-dinner-falls.html|title=Dinner Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|publisher=Johnny T.

'''ERM Electronic Systems ltd.''' Aka: '''ERM Advanced Telematics''' is an [[Israel]]i electronic company focused on the design, development and manufacture of vehicle security &amp; [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] devices for the [[telematics]] and [[fleet management]] industry.
ERM Advanced Telematics has a global operation offering telematics devices for Stolen Vehicle Recovery ([[Stolen Vehicle Recovery|SVR]]) and Fleet Management ([[Fleet Management Services|FMS]]), all incorporated with vehicle security.

As of June 2013, the company manufactured over 950,000 active devices worldwide.

Since 2006, ERM is a subsidiary of [[Ituran|Ituran Group]] (NASDAQ:ITRN).&lt;ref name=globes&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000133602 Ituran buys control of ERM for $2.8m ], Globes Sep 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate history ==
ERM Advanced Telematics was founded in May 1985 as ERM Electronic Systems ltd by Meir Hayman. The company was focused on [[Anti-theft system|vehicle security systems]] and manufactured its devices using third party manufacturing facilities.

1998 - ERM moved to its new location in [[Rishon-LeZion|Rishon LeZion]] where, for the first time, launched its new SMT lines and since then all design, manufacturing and assembling is done in-house.

March 2000 - Cellular network based [[machine to machine|M2M]] (Machine to Machine), being much cheaper and easy spread due to cellular providers efforts, made its tone and slowly conquered markets from the old RF. Soon, ERM began manufacturing its first line of telematics device - SkyLink.

September 2006 - Ituran, being a public company, acquired 51% of ERM Electronic Systems and started moving all its new customers to [[GSM]]/[[GPS]] technology based on ERM's devices.&lt;ref name=globes /&gt;

ERM then launched its new StarLink Family of telematics products and started gaining new knowledge about automotive worldwide.

January 2013 - ERM was re-branded as an international manufacturer and changed its name to '''ERM Advanced Telematics'''.

March 2015 - ERM launches its ERM Telematics India office in Bangalore

[[Image:Satellite image of Antigua And Barbuda in September 2002.jpg|thumb|350px|A satellite image of Antigua and Barbuda.]]
[[Antigua and Barbuda]] lie in the eastern arc of the [[Leeward Islands]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]], separating the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the [[Caribbean Sea]]. [[Antigua]] is 650&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Puerto Rico]]; [[Barbuda]] lies 48&amp;nbsp;km due north of Antigua, and the uninhabited island of [[Redonda]] is 56&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Antigua. 

The largest island Antigua, is 21&amp;nbsp;km (about a dozen miles) across and 281&amp;nbsp;km² (about a hundred square miles) in area. Barbuda covers 161&amp;nbsp;km² while Redonda encompasses a 1.6&amp;nbsp;km². The capital of Antigua and Barbuda is [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], located at St. John's Harbour on the northwest coast of Antigua. The principal city of Barbuda is [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]], located on [[Codrington Lagoon]].

==Mountains and Hills==
Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by [[limestone]] formations than [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]]. The highest point on Antigua is [[Mount Obama]] (formerly Boggy Peak), the remnant of a [[volcanic]] crater rising 402 metres (1319 ft). This mountain is located amid a bulge of [[hills]] of volcanic origin in the southwestern part of the island. Lake Estate is the third tallest recorded point on Antigua.

The limestone formations in the northeast and northwest are separated from the southwestern volcanic area by a central plain of [[clay]] formations. The map of northeastern Antigua features several small and tiny islands, some inhabited. Barbuda's highest elevation is 42 metres (146 ft), part of the highland plateau east of Codrington. The shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater. Tiny [[Redonda]] rises to 246 meters and has very little level ground, while Barbuda, as already noted, is very flat with few if any hills.

==The Coast, Islands, and the Ocean==
===Oceans and Seas===
Antigua and Barbuda are located in the eastern Caribbean Sea. The open Atlantic Ocean lies to the north and east. There are many coral reefs in the vicinity of Antigua and Barbuda. The island of [[Guadeloupe]] lies to the southern, on the far side of the [[Guadeloupe Passage]] from Antigua.

===The Coast and Beaches===
Antigua and Barbuda is famous for its beaches, estimated at 365, particularly those on Antigua itself. The most noteworthy feature of Barbuda’s coastline is the natural lagoon on the western side of the island.

==Climate==
=== Wind ===
The islands' tropical [[climate]] is moderated by fairly constant northeast tradewinds, with velocities ranging between {{convert|30|and|48|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. There is little precipitation because of the islands' low elevations. 

===Rainfall and temperature===
Rainfall averages {{convert|990|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. 

[[Hurricane]]s strike on an average of once a year. Temperatures average {{convert|27|°C|1}}, with a range from {{convert|23|°C|1}} in the winter to {{convert|30|°C}} in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February.  Its low [[humidity]] makes it one of the most temperate climates in the world.

==Vegetation==
The sandy soil on much of the islands has only scrub vegetation. Some parts of Antigua are more fertile–most notably the central plain–due to the [[volcanic ash]] in the soil. These areas support some tropical vegetation and agricultural uses. The planting of [[acacia]], [[mahogany]], and red and white cedar on Antigua has led to as much as 11% of the land becoming forested, helping to conserve the soil and water.

[[File:Sanilfefonso22jf.JPG|right|thumb|A grassland in the [[Philippines]]]]
[[File:Grasslands-menggu.JPG|thumb|An [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland in the [[People's Republic of China]]]]'''Grasslands ''' are areas where the [[vegetation]] is dominated by [[grass]]es ([[Poaceae]]); however, sedge ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rush ([[Juncaceae]]) families can also be found along with variable proportions of [[legumes]], like [[clover]], and other [[herbaceous plant|herbs]]. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. Grasslands are found in most [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Earth]]. For example, there are five [[terrestrial ecoregion]] classifications (subdivisions) of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]] ([[ecosystem]]), which is one of eight [[terrestrial ecozone]]s of the Earth's surface.

==Vegetation==
Grassland vegetation can vary in height from very short, as in [[Calcareous grassland|chalk grassland]], to quite tall, as in the case of [[North America]]n [[tallgrass prairie]], [[South America]]n grasslands and [[Africa]]n [[savanna]].
[[File:Konza1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Konza Prairie|Konza]] [[tallgrass prairie]] in the [[Flint Hills]] of northeastern [[Kansas]]]]
Woody plants, shrubs or trees may occur on some grasslands – forming [[savannas]], scrubby grassland or semi-wooded grassland, such as the African savannas or the [[Iberia]]n [[Dehesa (pastoral management)|dehesa]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/grasslands.php University of California Museum of Paleontology Grasslands website]. Ucmp.berkeley.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

As flowering [[plant]]s and trees, grasses grow in great concentrations in [[climate]]s where annual [[rain]]fall ranges between {{convert|500|and|900|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Laboratory/Biome/biograssland.html NASA Earth Observatory webpage]. Earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The root systems of perennial grasses and [[forb]]s form complex mats that hold the [[soil]] in place.

==Evolution==
Graminoids are among the most versatile [[organism|life form]]s. They became widespread toward the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, and fossilized [[dinosaur]] feces ([[coprolite]]s) have been found containing [[phytolith]]s of a variety of grasses that include grasses that are related to modern [[rice]] and [[bamboo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1121020|title=Dinosaurs Dined on Grass|year=2005|last1=Piperno|first1=D. R.|journal=Science|volume=310|issue=5751|pages=1126–8|pmid=16293745|last2=Sues|first2=HD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of mountains in the [[western United States]] during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, a period of some 25 million years, created a continental climate favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined, and grasslands became much more widespread. Following the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, grasslands expanded in range in the hotter, drier climates, and began to become the dominant land feature worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

== Climates ==
Grasslands often occur in areas with annual precipitation is between {{convert|600|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|mm|abbr=on}}  and average mean annual temperatures ranges from −5 and 20&amp;nbsp;°C (Woodward et al. 2004). However, some grasslands occur in colder (−20&amp;nbsp;°C) and hotter (30&amp;nbsp;°C) climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Laboratory/Biome/biograssland.html EO Experiments: Grassland Biome]. Earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Grassland can exist in habitats that are frequently disturbed by grazing or fire, as such disturbance prevents the encroachment of woody species. Species richness is particularly high in grasslands of low soil fertility such as [[serpentine barrens]] and [[calcareous]] grasslands, where woody encroachment is prevented as low nutrient levels in the soil may inhibit the growth of forest and shrub species.

== Biodiversity and conservation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Grasslands dominated by unsown wild-plant communities ("unimproved grasslands") can be called either natural or "semi-natural" habitat. The majority of grasslands in temperate climates are "semi-natural". Although their plant communities are natural, their maintenance depends upon anthropogenic activities such as low-intensity farming, which maintains these grasslands through grazing and cutting regimes. These grasslands contain many species of wild plants, including grasses, sedges, rushes, and herbs; 25 or more species per square meter is not unusual.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Chalk downlands in England can support over 40 species per square meter. In many parts of the world, few examples have escaped agricultural improvement (fertilizing, weed killing, plowing or re-seeding). For example, original North American prairie grasslands or lowland wildflower meadows in the UK are now rare and their associated wild flora equally threatened. Associated with the wild-plant diversity of the "unimproved" grasslands is usually a rich invertebrate fauna; there are also many species of birds that are grassland "specialists", such as the [[snipe]] and the [[great bustard]]. Agriculturally improved grasslands, which dominate modern intensive agricultural landscapes, are usually poor in wild plant species due to the original diversity of plants having been destroyed by cultivation, the original wild-plant communities having been replaced by sown monocultures of cultivated varieties of grasses and clovers, such as [[perennial ryegrass]] and [[white clover]]. In many parts of the world, "unimproved" grasslands are one of the most threatened types of habitat, and a target for acquisition by wildlife conservation groups or for special grants to landowners who are encouraged to manage them appropriately.

== Human impact and economic importance ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:Prau.JPG|right|thumb|Grassland in [[Cantabria]], northern [[Spain]]]]
[[File:Morton Arboretum grassland.jpg|thumb|left|A restored grassland ecosystem at [[Morton Arboretum]] in [[Illinois]]]]

Grassland vegetation often remains dominant in a particular area usually due to [[grazing]], cutting, or natural or man-made fires, all discouraging colonization by and survival of tree and shrub [[seedling]]s. Some of the world's largest expanses of grassland are found in the African savanna, and these are maintained by wild [[herbivore]]s as well as by nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] and their [[cattle]], sheep or goats.

Grasslands may occur naturally or as the result of human activity. Grasslands created and maintained by human activity are called '''anthropogenic grasslands'''. Hunting cultures around the world often set regular fires to maintain and extend grasslands, and prevent fire-intolerant trees and shrubs from taking hold. The tallgrass [[prairie]]s in the [[Midwestern United States|U.S. Midwest]] may have been extended eastward into [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]] by human agency. Much grassland in [[northwest Europe]] developed after the [[Neolithic Period]] when people gradually cleared the forest to create areas for raising their livestock.

The professional study of grasslands falls under the category of [[rangeland management]], which focuses on [[ecosystem services]] associated with the grass-dominated arid and semi-arid rangelands of the world. Rangelands account for an estimated 70% of the earth's landmass; thus, many cultures including those of the United States are indebted to the economics that the world's grasslands have to offer, from producing grazing animals, tourism, ecosystems services such as clean water and air, and energy extraction.

==== Tropical and subtropical====
These grasslands are classified with tropical and subtropical [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]]s as the [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome]]. Notable tropical and subtropical grasslands include the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]] grasslands of [[South America]].

==== Temperate ====
Mid-latitude grasslands, including the [[prairie]] and [[List of California native plants#Selected grasses|Pacific grasslands]] of [[North America]], the [[Pampas]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]], calcareous [[downland]], and the [[steppe]]s of [[Europe]]. They are classified with temperate savannas and shrublands as the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome]]. Temperate grasslands are the home to many large [[herbivores]], such as [[bison]], [[gazelle]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, and [[wild horse]]s. [[Carnivores]] like [[lion]]s, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s are also found in temperate grasslands. Other animals of this region include: [[deer]], [[prairie dog]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[jack rabbit]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fox]], [[owl]]s, [[badger]]s, blackbirds (both [[Common blackbird|Old]] and [[New World blackbird|New World]] varieties), [[grasshopper]]s, [[meadowlark]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[quail]]s, [[hawk]]s and [[hyena]]s.

==== Flooded ====
Grasslands that are flooded seasonally or year-round, like the [[Everglades]] of [[Florida]], the [[Pantanal]] of [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] or the [[Esteros del Ibera]] in [[Argentina]], are classified with flooded savannas as the [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands and savannas biome]] and occur mostly in the tropics and subtropics.

[[Watermeadow]]s are grasslands that are deliberately flooded for short periods.

==== Montane ====
[[File:AntelopeValleyCAgrassland.JPG|thumb|Grassland in the [[Antelope Valley]], [[California]]]]
High-altitude grasslands located on high [[mountain ranges]] around the world, like the [[Páramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. They are part of the [[montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grasslands and shrublands biome]] and also constitute [[tundra]].

==== Tundra prairies ====
Similar to montane grasslands, polar [[Arctic tundra]] can have grasses, but high soil moisture means that few tundras are grass-dominated today. However, during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, a polar grassland known as [[steppe-tundra]] occupied large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. These are in the [[Tundra|tundra biome]].

====Desert and xeric ====
Also called desert grasslands, this is composed of sparse grassland ecoregions located in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands|deserts and xeric shrublands biome]].

== Animals ==

[[Mite]]s, insect [[larva]]e, [[nematode]]s and [[earthworm]]s inhabit deep soil, which can reach {{convert|6|m}} underground in undisturbed grasslands on the richest soils of the world. These invertebrates, along with symbiotic [[fungi]], extend the root systems, break apart hard soil, enrich it with [[urea]] and other natural fertilizers, trap minerals and water and promote growth. Some types of fungi make the plants more resistant to insect and microbial attacks.

Grassland in all its form supports a vast variety of mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects. Typical large mammals include the [[blue wildebeest]], [[American bison]], [[giant anteater]] and [[Przewalski's horse]].

While grasslands in general support diverse wildlife, given the lack of hiding places for predators, the African [[savanna]] regions support a much greater diversity in wildlife than do temperate grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nceas.ucsb.edu/biomes/grassland.html University of California – Santa Barbara Temperate Grasslands website]. Kids.nceas.ucsb.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence for grassland being much the product of animal behaviour and movement;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managingwholes.com/grazing-heals-land.htm How can grazing heal land?]. ManagingWholes.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; some examples include migratory herds of antelope trampling vegetation and [[African bush elephant]]s eating [[acacia]] saplings before the plant has a chance to grow into a mature tree.

{{No footnotes|date=April 2018}}

The '''''Harmonia Macrocosmica''''' is a [[star atlas]] written by [[Andreas Cellarius]] and published in 1660 by [[Johannes Janssonius]]. The first part of the atlas contains copper plate prints depicting the world systems of [[Claudius Ptolemy]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and [[Tycho Brahe]]. At the end are star maps of the classical and further [[constellations]], the latter ones as introduced by [[Julius Schiller]] in his ''Coelum stellatum christianum'' of 1627.

For [[History of cartography#Dutch celestial cartography in the Age of Exploration|its importance in the history]] of [[celestial cartography]], the ''Harmonia Macrocosmica'' is considered as one of the notable masterworks from the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography]] (c. 1570s–1670s), along with [[Abraham Ortelius]]'s ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' and [[Johannes Blaeu]]'s ''[[Atlas Maior]]''. It is often described as the most beautiful [[celestial atlas]] ever published. 

== History ==
In the foreword to his ''Chronologica'', [[Gerard Mercator]] stated the intention to publish an atlas which would cover everything of the then-known cosmos, geography and history of the earth. During his life, Mercator published five volumes of his atlas, the last one being published by his son [[Rumold Mercator|Rumold]]. After Mercator's death, the Amsterdam cartographer [[Johannes Janssonius]] took over the project. 
He and fellow-cartographer [[Hendricus Hondius]] published their ''Novus Atlas'' in 1636, which featured over 320 maps in four languages. In 1660, Andreas Cellarius' ''Harmonia Macrocosmica'' was published as the seventh volume of the project. With the final addition of a volume describing the cities of the world from 1657, the project was finally completed.

== Origins of the engravings ==
Of the various engravers and authors who worked on the plates of the atlas, only two have signed their work. The frontispiece of the atlas was created by Frederik Hendrik van den Hove and ten other plates were engraved by Johannes van Loon. Moreover, all the designs of the classical constellations were taken from the ones created by [[Jan Pieterszoon Saenredam]].

'''Hkakabo Razi''' ({{lang-my|ခါကာဘိုရာဇီ}}, {{IPA-my|kʰàkàbò ɹàzì|pron}}; {{zh|s=开加博峰|t=開加博峰|p=Kāijiābó Fēng}}) is believed to be [[Myanmar]]'s highest [[mountain]], and with its height of {{convert|5881|m}} the probable highest mountain in South East Asia. It is located in the northern [[Myanmar]] state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]] in an outlying subrange of the Greater [[Himalaya]]n mountain system near the border tri-point with [[India]] and China. Its highest status has recently been challenged by [[Gamlang Razi]] (5870 m), {{convert|6.6|km}} WSW far away on the Chinese border.&lt;ref name=gamlang&gt;Kayleigh Long, [http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/8200-gamlang-razi-expedition-reaches-summit.html Gamlang Razi expedition reaches summit], [[The Myanmar Times]], 19 September 2013.&lt;br&gt;Trevor Brown, [http://blog.junipersys.com/gamlang-razi-elevation/ Gamlang Razi – Setting the Elevation Straight]&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak is enclosed within [[Khakaborazi National Park]]. The park is entirely mountainous and is characterized by broad-leaved evergreen [[rain forest]], a sub-tropical temperate zone from {{convert|8000|to(-)|9000|ft|m}}, then broad-leaved, semi-deciduous forest and finally needle-leaved evergreen, snow forest. Above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, the highest forest zone is alpine, different not only in kind from the forest, but different in history and origin. Still higher up, around {{convert|15000|ft|m}}, cold, barren, windswept terrain and permanent [[snow]] and [[glaciers]] dominate. At around {{convert|17500|ft|m}}, there is a large ice cap with several outlet glaciers.

==Environmental protection==
Hkakabo Razi was established as a natural reserve on January 30, 1996 and as a national park on November 10, 1998. The [[Khakaborazi National Park]] is the last stronghold for biodiversity in Myanmar. Extraordinarily rich flora and fauna, ranging from lowland tropical to alpine species still await proper research and identification. They have barely been studied, and the park remains an excellent center for field study for students of botany, geology, zoology and geography.

A study was done by the Forest Department with the assistance of [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] during 1997 and 1998. The results have been presented in [[ICIMOD]] sponsored Workshop "Sub-regional Consultation on Conservation of Hkakabo Razi Mountain Ecosystems in Eastern Himalayas", held in [[Putao]], Myanmar during 25–29 October 1999. This was followed in 2001 with an international, interdisciplinary team of scientists from the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in San Francisco, National Geographic Society, Harvard University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Myanmar Forestry Ministry. On 11 September 2001, herpetologist [[Joseph Bruno Slowinski|Joseph Slowinski]], team leader from California Academy of Sciences, was bitten by a venomous [[krait]] and died in the field.

In 2002-2003, P. Christiaan Klieger, anthropologist from California Academy of Sciences and photographer Dong Lin retraced their previous steps, and succeeded in making the first anthropological survey of the Hkakabo Razi region.  On foot they reached the northern-most village in Myanmar, [[Tahaundam]], which is inhabited by about 200 Khampa Tibetans, including mountaineer Nyama Gyaltsen (see below).&lt;ref name="Klieger2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Klieger |first=P. Christiaan |year=2006 |chapter=A Tale of the Tibeto-Burman 'Pygmies' |editor=P. Christiaan Klieger |title=Proceedings of the Tenth Seminar of the IATS, 2003, Volume 2 Tibetan Borderlands |place=Leiden |publisher=Brill Academic Press |isbn=978-90-04-15482-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region will shortly be opened to the general public through eco-tourism by the Myanmar authorities. The government is collecting information for development in that regard and a number of scientific expeditions have been already accepted in the region.

Only a few Westerners ever made it to Mt. Hkakabo Razi, the National Park or anywhere close to it. Captain B.E.A. Pritchard was the first Westerner to visit the Alun Dung valley, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1784147|title = Explorations on the Burma-Tibet Frontier|journal = The Geographical Journal|volume = 80|issue = 6|pages = 465|last1 = Ward|first1 = F.

==Climbing history==
[[Takashi Ozaki]] (Japan, 1951-May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka "Aung Tse"; Burma) made the first ascent in 1996.&lt;ref name=naka/&gt; Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but was turned back due to bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;Frederique Gely-Ozaki, [https://www.himalayanclub.org/hj/52/4/hkakabo-razi/ Hkakabo Razi], The Himalayan Journal, Volume 52, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The route to basecamp is long (four weeks) and arduous through dense rain forest with many unbridged stream crossings. The recentness of the first ascent can also be attributed to the policy that foreigners were not allowed into the area until 1993.

In 2013, the nearby peak of [[Gamlang Razi]] was climbed and measured at 5,870 meters (19,259&amp;nbsp;ft) using an advanced version of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], making it possibly the highest in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Tyson, [http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13201212951/Gamlang-Razi Gamlang Razi. A first ascent in Myanmar's mysterious mountains.], [[The American Alpine Journal]], 56, page 45 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Ozaki had confirmed Hkakabo's height as 5881 m, but he did not yet have the GPS equipment to measure the exact height of Hkakabo Razi.&lt;ref name=gamlang/&gt;

In August 2014 an all-Burmese expedition took a new route up the north face.&lt;ref&gt;Myi Nyi Aung, [https://climberdoelone.wordpress.com/2014/08/31/invitation-of-nature-mt-hkakabo-razi-ascent-from-north-face-31-08-2014/ Invitation of Nature (Mt. Hkakabo Razi-North Face ascent 31.08.2014) Expedition Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Two team-members, Ko Aung Myint Myat and Ko Wai Yan Min Thu, reached the summit on August 31 for the second ascent of the mountain, placing a flag, plaque and Buddha image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burmese-climbers-reach-hkakabo-razis-peak.html Burmese Climbers Reach Hkakabo Razi's Peak], [[The Irrawaddy]], 1 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The climbers ran out of batteries right after summiting and radio contact was lost. After they failed to return to the lower camps, a rescue operation was set into place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/special-features/197-travel-2014/11697-before-travellers-go-explorers.html Before travellers go explorers], [[The Myanmar Times]], 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The search for the missing climbers continued into October. It involved a helicopter crash landing, leading to the death of one pilot and an 11-day survival trek by the other pilot and the passenger mountaineer.&lt;ref&gt;San Yamin Aung, [http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burmese-pilot-found-dead-hkakabo-razi.html Burmese Pilot Found Dead in Kachin State], The Irrawaddy, 9 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/454169/ A crash course in survival], [[Bangkok Post]], 4 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, a [[National Geographic Society]] / [[The North Face]] sponsored expedition set out to measure the height of Hkakabo Razi using the same equipment as the Gamlang Razi team. The 2014 group was led by Hilaree O'Neill, and also included Mark David Jenkins, Cory Richards, Renan Ozturk, [[Emily Harrington]] and Taylor Rees. On November 7, 2014, Jenkins, Richards, and Ozturk made the final attempt at the summit but turned back at 5,742 meters (18,840&amp;nbsp;ft). They estimated that the summit lay an additional 800 feet (''ca.'' 240 meter) higher.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley McMillan, [http://news-beta.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/150116-burma-climb-myanmar-hkakabo-razi/ On Myanmar's Mystery Peak, Drama and a Challenge Like No Other], National Geographic Magazine, January 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 it was announced that three Myanmar mountaineers would ascend the mountain sometime that year, &lt;ref&gt;AFP, [https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/myanmar-climbers-eye-hkakabo-razi-the-peak-conquered-only-once/ Myanmar climbers eye Hkakabo Razi, the peak conquered only once], Frontier Myanmar, August 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; but due to various reasons the team postponed the climb until further notice. &lt;ref&gt;Soe Thu Aung, [http://www.mizzima.com/news/hkakabo-razi-summit-climb-plan-postponed/ Hkakabo Razi summit climb plan postponed], Mizzima, News from Myanmar, August 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jovan Cvijić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Цвијић}}, {{IPA-sh|jɔ̌ʋan tsʋǐːjitɕ|pron}}; 12 October 1865&amp;nbsp;– 16 January 1927) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Geography|geographer]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologist]], president of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences]] and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Belgrade]]. Cvijić is considered the founder of geography in Serbia. He began his scientific career as a geographer and [[geologist]], and continued his activity as a [[Human geography|human geographer]] and [[sociologist]].

== Early life and family ==

Cvijić was born on {{OldStyleDate|October 11||September 29}} 1865 in [[Loznica]], then part of the [[Principality of Serbia]]. His family was part of the Spasojević branch of the [[Piva, Montenegro|Piva tribe (''Pivljani'')]] in [[Old Herzegovina]] (currently [[Montenegro]]). Cvijić's father, Todor, was a merchant; his grandfather, Živko, was head of Loznica and a supporter of the [[House of Obrenović]] in [[Mačva]]. Živko fought in the 1844 [[Katana Uprising]] against the [[Defenders of the Constitution]], and died after torture.

Cvijić's great-grandfather, Cvijo Spasojević, [[patriarch]] of the Cvijić family, was a well-known ''[[hajduk]]'' leader in Old Herzegovina and fought the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. After its failure in 1813 he moved to Loznica, built a house and opened a store.

His father, Todor (d. 1900) was a trader before accepting a clerkship in the municipality. Cvijić's mother, Marija (born Avramović), was from a family in the village of Koremita in the [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]] region (near Tronoša and Tršić, birthplace of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]]). Todor and Marija had two sons, Živko and Jovan, and three daughters. Cvijić often said that in his childhood his spiritual education was primarily influenced by his mother and her family; he said less about his father and his father's family. However, in his works on ethnic psychology Cvijić praised the [[Dinaric race]] of his father.

== Education ==

[[File:Јован Цвијић, млад.jpg|thumb|alt=Old photograph of mustachioed young man|Cvijić as a young man]]

After completing elementary school Cvijić attended [[grammar school]] in Loznica for two years, in [[Šabac]] for his third and fourth years, and graduated from the [[First_Belgrade_Gymnasium|First Belgrade Gymnasium]]'s department of natural sciences and mathematics in 1884. After graduation, he wanted to study medicine, but Loznica could not provide him a scholarship to study abroad. A grammar-school teacher suggested that he attend geography classes at the ''Velika skola'' in Belgrade (now the [[University of Belgrade]]). Cvijić took his advice, enrolling in the natural sciences department and graduating in 1889. Cvijić studied in several languages; in grammar school, he studied English, German and French, which was helpful at university (which had little work translated into [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), and wrote his scientific and other papers in those three languages.

During the 1888–89 school year Cvijić was a geography teacher at the Second Male Grammar School in Belgrade, and in 1889 enrolled to study physical geography and geology at [[Vienna University]]. At that time geomorphology was taught by [[Albrecht Penck]], [[geotectonics]] by Professor Sis (president of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences#History|Austrian Academy]]) and climatology by [[Julius von Hann]].

Cvijić received his PhD from Vienna University in 1893.&lt;ref name=WDL&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnographic Map of the Balkan Peninsula|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/93/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis was ''Das Karstphanomen'', introducing him to the scientific world, and was later translated into several languages (into Serbian as ''Karst'' in 1895).

== Marriage ==
In 1911, Cvijić married Ljubica Nikolić, a widow from Belgrade, née Krstić (1879–1941).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sanu.ac.rs/GalerijaPics/2015JovanCvijicAtlasEng.pdf "The Belgrade Atlas of Jovan Cvijić: Century and a half since the birth: 1865–2015", Tatjana Korićanac, p. 23, Gallery of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts; 135, Belgrade, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Cvijić did his first (and most important) field research in eastern Serbia, observing the structure of the [[Kučaj mountains]] and Prekonoska Cave in his PhD [[thesis]] (accepted in Vienna on January 22, 1893).

[[File:Cvijic, Jovan - Breisemeister, William A. - Carte ethnographique de la Péninsule balkanique (pd).jpg|thumb|alt=Old, multicolored map of southeastern Europe|Ethnographic map of the [[Balkans]], co-authored by Cvijić]]

He was interested in [[geology]] and [[geomorphology]]. Cvijić's [[monograph]] on lime [[karst]] was well received in European scientific circles, and an introductory academic lecture established him as the first [[South Slavs|South Slav]]ic [[tectonics|tectonicist]]. The [[Serbia]]n lime fields had been studied only peripherally by Otto von Pirch (1830), [[Ami Boué]] (1840), [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]], [[Milan Milićević]], [[Jovan Žujović]] and Vladimir Karić before him. Cvijić studied [[Midžor]] and [[Rila]] in the [[Balkan Mountains]], recognizing the glacial origin of 102 mountain lakes. It was previously unknown that the region was influenced by the [[last glacial period]], and Cvijić's discovery was a turning point in the study of regional [[Dispersion (geology)|dispersion]].

Cvijić conducted a pioneering human-geographical survey in "Balkan Peninsula 1918", 1922–I, 1931–II, based on his research of Balkan [[personality type]]s. He researched for 38 years, leading expeditions in the Balkans, the southern [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Anatolia]] which produced a number of research papers. Cvijić's two-volume ''Geomorphology'' is an important starting point for research into the Balkan peninsula.

=== Karst geomorphology ===
When studying under [[Albrecht Penck]]'s tutelage he was encouraged to focus on the study of [[karst]] phenomena in the northern [[Dinaric Alps]] which was a region Penck was already acknowledged with. His first major work was ''Das Karstphänomen'' published in 1893. This work was a publication of the key points of his [[doctoral thesis]]. ''Das Karstphänomen'' was published as a slightly modified translation in [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] in 1895. This work describes landforms such as [[karren]], [[doline]]s and [[polje]]s. In a 1918 publication, Cvijić proposed a [[cycle of erosion|cyclical model]] for karstic landscape development.&lt;ref name=Derek2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cvijić |first1=Jovan |date=1918 |title=Hydrographie souterraine et évolution morphologique du Karst |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/rga_0249-6178_1918_num_6_4_4727 |journal= Recueil des travaux de l'institut de géographie alpine |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=375–426 |doi= |access-date=June 5, 2017 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this work written in French were made accessible to English-language scientists in 1921 when it was commented by E.M. Sanders. Differences in climate and geology were used by Cvijić to explain various shapes and types of karst landforms, sometimes incorrectly. Nevertheless, his views on the role of climate on the development of karst were more accurate than those of various [[climatic geomorphology|climatic geomorphologist]]s that succeeded him and who greatly exaggerated the role of climate.&lt;ref name=Derek2007/&gt;

It has been attributed to Cvijić that the term karst prevailed over [[Edouard Martel]]'s proposed term "Le Causse". Another terminology usage indebted to Cvijić is that of [[doline]], a term he introduced, and that overlaps with that of [[sinkhole]].  Eventually, Cvijić emerged as the "father of karst geomorphology".&lt;ref name=Derek2007/&gt;

=== Human geography ===

In his human-geographical research, Cvijić studied migrations, village and town habitat, types of housing and the culture of populations in regions influenced by a variety of civilizations, psychological types, folklore and dress. He traveled during difficult social and political times, exposing himself to unpleasant and life-threatening situations (especially in countries under Ottoman and Austrian rule before [[World War I]]). During these trips Cvijić became acquainted with the living conditions of the Balkan population, leading to his interest in ethnographic and psycho-social issues; he noted how little he had known about the difficulty of life in [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] until 1896&amp;ndash;1898. Until then, he later said, he had little of the interest in folklore, ethnology and national politics he later developed. Cvijić organized a number of research expeditions to dangerous, unexplored regions.

In 1896 Cvijić published "Instructions for studying villages in Serbia and other Serbian lands", which was later revised to apply to other Balkan regions. In Serbia, interest developed in folkloric research; this encouraged the first systematically-gathered data in ethnology. The research was conducted by Cvijić's students and colleagues and interested laypeople (primarily village teachers and priests), constituting a large, unified scientific effort.

Cvijić's thesis on the effects of climate and geography on human life is the basis of his approach to human geography, where he emphasizes that humankind is ecologically sensitive. When classifying anthropological types Cvijić considered social structure (work, endogamy, exogamy and migration) the primary factor, stressing the effects of the physical environment on a population's psyche. His basic concepts are presented in the 1902 Balkan-peninsula paper, "Human-geography problems". Influenced by Cvijić's paper, Milorad Dragić (a former student) elaborated on psychological anthropological research in his 1911 paper "Instructions for studying settlements and psychological characteristics" (after which Cvijić expanded his thesis on "The Balkan peninsula and South Slavic lands" in Serbian).

Cvijić introduced the term 'metanastasic movements', which referred to slow, gradual, a place-to-place human movement. He and his students took wide exploration of this phenomenon, eventually establishing the Serbian ethnological-historic school which gathered ethnological material from all around the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]] and encompassed exploration of written sources.{{sfn|Džaja|1999|p=43}}

The sparking of interest in human-geographical and ethnographical research was one of the greatest achievements of Cvijić's scientific career. His efforts and research helped him gather crucial data, which he used during negotiations on the state borders of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after World War I.

==== Influence on Yugoslav state borders ====

After World War I Cvijić helped determine the state borders of the new [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] state, using his research in [[demography]] and human geography in the negotiations; his data was used in determining the ethnic expansion of the [[South Slavs]].

French geographer [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] invited Cvijić to Paris on behalf of the [[University of Paris]] twice (in 1917 and at the beginning of 1919), where he lectured on Balkan physical and political geography. At the end of 1918, the Serbian government named him their chief expert on ethnographic borders; in 1919, he was elected president of a unit dealing with territorial issues as part of the state delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Here, with [[Mihajlo Pupin]] (another influential scientist), Cvijić's efforts in creating ethnographic charts of the Yugoslav countries in 1918&amp;ndash;1919 helped determine the borders of a new country: the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians. It was agreed that the new country should incorporate [[Banat]], [[Baranja]], [[Dalmatia]] and the Bled triangle ([[Bled]], [[Bohinj]] and [[Triglav]]).

==== Controversy ====
Cvijić' s scientific impartiality has been criticized for his support of Serbia's political advancement;&lt;ref name="hic"/&gt; his geographic work was used to scientifically justify [[Greater Serbia]]n politics and territorial claims.&lt;ref name="hic"&gt;[http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/cvijic.htm Jovan Cvijic, Selected statements]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&amp;nbsp;... For economic independence, Serbia must acquire access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and one part of the [[Albania]]n coastline: by [[Military occupation|occupation]] of the territory or by acquiring economic and transportation rights to this region. This, therefore, implies occupying an ethnographically foreign territory, but one that must be occupied due to particularly important economic interests and vital needs.&lt;ref name="hic"/&gt;''}}

According to Cvijić, [[Bulgarians]] were "different from the other South Slavs in their ethnic composition". He described as Slav three ethnographic groups previously considered Bulgarians: the [[Macedonian Slavs]], the [[Shopi]] and the [[Torlaks]]. Cvijić excluded the region around [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria's capital) from the Bulgarian group, maintained that the three groups above were Slavic (and therefore Serbian).&lt;ref&gt;[http://promacedonia.org/en/ib/i_banac.html "The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics", Ivo Banac, pp. 307–328, Cornell University Press, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that Serbia could govern a much larger area that the territory it held.&lt;ref&gt;Cvijic, "O nacionalnom radu", commemorative speech 1907, reprinted in Govori i Clanci, I, Beograd 1921 pp. 51–76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==

After Cvijić's return from [[Vienna]] in March 1893 he became a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy of the ''Velika Skola'' in Belgrade, teaching geography, physical geography and ethnography. Traveling as a student and a professor throughout the Balkans later in life, he developed an interest in folklore and culture and organized ethnographical research in the department of geography.

After the ''Velika Skola'' became the University of Belgrade on October 12, 1905, Cvijić was one of eight tenured professors; the others were [[Jovan Žujović]], [[Sima Lozanić]], [[Mihailo Petrović Alas]], [[Andra Stevanović]], [[Dragoljub Pavlović]], [[Milić Radovanović]] and [[Ljubomir Jovanović]], and they chose other colleagues for tenured positions.

Cvijić played an active role in reforming the school, helping found an ethnography department whose first professor was his oldest student and assistant, [[Jovan Erdeljanović]] (followed by [[Tihomir Đorđević]]); Cvijić remained in the geography department. He was influential in establishing five new faculties: medicine, agriculture and theology in Belgrade, philosophy in Skopje and the [[Subotica Law School]].

== Critique of education ==
Cvijić thought that the grammar-school education of that era should last seven years, instead of eight, and felt that young men should be included early in adult life and independent work.

{{quote|Grammar school forms the intelligence and character perhaps even deeper and stronger than university; it influences the spirit and moral value of future intellectuals. Besides university, the moral and spiritual situation and its development depend on the type of grammar school, what will its civilization get, and in the end, will it slow or interfere with the development of great personalities, which show the properties of one nation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}}}

He published detailed instructions for conducting field research into populations and habitats to help his colleagues, including the 1907 article "On scientific research and our University".

== Legacy ==
{{quote|You should get used to constant thinking about a problem, work, profession until you find a solution. There are bright moments, especially bright nights, which are rare; where you can find an answer to a question or come up with a research plan. That time of spiritual lucidity and creativity should be put to use, and not thinking about rest according to that ordinary human, oriental laziness. That does not hurt the body, and if it does hurt, the body exists in order to be spent properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Državna Štamp.

With a group of geographers and biologists, Cvijić founded the Serbian Geographic Society in Belgrade in 1910 and was its president until his death. In 1912 he began a magazine, the ''Serbian Geographic Society Herald'', which is still published. Cvijić conducted weekly seminars for science students, which were also attended by teachers from Belgrade grammar schools. He founded the Faculty of Philosophy's Geographical Institute in 1923 (the first such organization in the Balkans), managing it until his death.

In 1947, the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] founded the Jovan Cvijić Geographical Institute in Belgrade to advance the science of geography. On November 21–22, 2002, the Academy hosted a meeting on "the socio-political work of Jovan Cvijić".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Social-political work of Jovan Cvijić |url=http://www.sanu.ac.rs/ciril/skupovi/cvijic.htm |accessdate=}} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jovan Cvijić's house]] is housed in his family's house in Belgrade at 5 Jelena Ćetković Street. Since 1996, the house (built in 1905) has been declared a cultural monument by the state and was decorated by [[Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak]]; Cvijić favored a decorative style based on Balkan folklore. The museum features manuscripts, letters, notes, books, paintings, geographical charts, atlases and personal items, and occasional lectures are presented.

In Serbia, a number of schools and streets are named after Cvijić and he is still considered the most important Serbian geographer. His work has been continued by his students, six of whom later became members of the Serbian Academy (including [[Pavle Vujević]], [[Borivoje Z. Milojević]] and [[Milisav Lutovac]]). The scientist's life and work were researched by geographer Milorad Vasović for his 454-page book, ''Jovan Cvijić: Scientist, Public Worker, Statesman'' (1994).

== Academic honors ==

Cvijić received a number of awards. He belonged to 30 scientific societies (academies, geographical and natural societies), receiving ten decorations. Cvijić received a gold medal for his work in 1924 from the [[New York City|New York]] Geographical Society and medals from England and France. Two varieties of [[saffron]] were named after him.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Khunjerab Pass''' ({{Lang-zh|红其拉甫口岸}}; {{Lang-ur|درہ خنجراب}}) (elevation {{convert|4880|m|ft|disp=or}}) is a high [[mountain pass]] in the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in a [[strategic]] position on the northern border of [[Pakistan]] (Region of [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]’s [[Hunza District|Hunza]] and [[Nagar District|Nagar]] Districts) and on the southwest border of [[People's Republic of China|China]] (the [[Xinjiang]] region)

==Etymology==

Its name is derived from two words of the local [[Wakhi language]] : 'Khun' means Blood and 'Jerav' means a creek coming from spring water/water falling.

==Highest Border crossing in the world==
{{main|Karakoram Highway}}

The Khunjerab Pass is the highest paved international border crossing in the world and the highest point on the [[Karakoram Highway]].  The [[roadway]] across the pass was completed in 1982, and has superseded the unpaved [[Mintaka Pass|Mintaka]] and [[Kilik Pass|Kilik]] Passes as the primary passage across the Karakoram Range. The choice of Khunjerab Pass for Karakoram Highway was decided in 1966: China citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead.&lt;ref name="dfdaily"&gt;{{Cite web

A feasibility study started in November 2009 for a line connecting [[Havelian]] {{convert|750|km|0|abbr=on}} away in Pakistan and [[Kashgar]] {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=on}} in Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/13/Kashi.html&lt;/ref&gt;. However no progress has been made thereafter and this project is also not part of the current CPEC plan.

The '''Kizil Caves''' (also romanized '''Qizil Caves''', spelling variant '''Qyzyl''') are a set of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves located near Kizil Township ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|克孜尔乡}}, ''Kèzī'ěr Xiāng'') in [[Baicheng County]], [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]. The site is located on the northern bank of the [[Muzat River]] 65 kilometres (75&amp;nbsp;km by road) west of [[Kucha]].&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  The caves are said to be the earliest major Buddhist cave complex in China,&lt;ref name="tcg"/&gt; with development occurring between the 3rd and 8th centuries.

==Caves==
The Kizil Caves complex is the largest of the ancient Buddhist cave sites that are associated with the ancient [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] kingdom of [[Kucha]], as well as the largest in Xinjiang.  Other cave sites in the Kucha region include the [[Kumtura Thousand Buddha Caves|Kumtura Caves]] and Simsim Caves.

There are 236 cave temples in Kizil, carved into the cliff stretching from east to west for a length of 2&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="tokharian"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tokharian Buddhism in Kucha: Buddhism of Indo-European Centum Speakers in Chinese Turkestan before the 10th Century C.E |url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp085_tokharian_buddhism_kucha.pdf |journal=Sino-Platonic Papers |author=Manko Namba Walter |number=85 |date=October 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 135 are still relatively intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/cave/default.htm |title= Caves as Canvas: Hidden Images of Worship Along the Ancient Silk Road |work=Sackler Gallery |publisher=Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest caves are dated, based in part on radioactive carbon dating, to around the year 300.&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/exhibit/religion/buddhism/tarim/kizil.html |title=Kucha and the Kizil Caves |author=Daniel C. Waugh |work=Silk Road Seattle |publisher=University of Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most researchers believe that the caves were probably abandoned sometime around the beginning of the 8th century, after Tang influence reached the area.&lt;ref name="kizil"/&gt;  Documents written in [[Tocharian languages]] were found in Kizil, and a few of the caves contain Tocharian inscriptions which give the names of a few rulers.

Many of the caves have a central pillar design whereby pilgrims may circumambulate around a central column which is a representation of the [[stupa]].   A large vaulted chamber is located in front of the column and a smaller rear chamber behind with two tunnel-like corridors on the sides linking these spaces.  In the front chamber, a three-dimensional image of Buddha would have been housed in a large niche serving as the focus of the interior, however, none of these sculptures have survived at Kizil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/cave/3b.htm |title= Caves as Canvas: Hidden Images of Worship Along the Ancient Silk Road - Architecture, Decoration, and Function |work=Sackler Gallery |publisher=Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rear chamber may feature the [[parinirvana]] scene in the form of a mural or large sculpture, and in some cases, a combination of both.

There are three other types of caves: square caves, caves with large image, and monastic cells (kuti).  Around two-thirds of the caves are kutis which are monks' living quarters and store-houses, and these caves do not contain mural paintings.

==Murals==
In 1906, the German expedition team of [[Albert von Le Coq]] and [[Albert Grünwedel]] explored the Kizil Caves. While Grünwedel was primarily interested in copying the murals, von le Coq chose to remove many of the murals.  Most of the fragments removed are now in [[Museum of Asian Art]] (formerly  Museum für Indische Kunst) in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/cave/2.htm |title= Caves as Canvas: Hidden Images of Worship Along the Ancient Silk Road - The Rediscovery of Qizil|publisher=Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other explorers removed some fragments of murals and may now be found in museums in Russia, Japan, Korea and United States.  Although the site has been both damaged and looted, around 5000 square metres of wall paintings remained,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scenery.cultural-china.com/en/172Scenery10859.html Kizil Thousand-Buddha Caves: Valuable Record of Buddhism Culture in Xinjiang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728002901/http://scenery.cultural-china.com/en/172Scenery10859.html |date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These murals mostly depict [[Jataka]] stories, [[avadana]]s, and legends of the Buddha, and are an artistic representation in the tradition of the [[Hinayana]] school of the [[Sarvastivada]]s.&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;

According to a text found in Kucha, the paintings in some of the caves were commissioned by a Tokharian (Thogar) king called "Mendre" with the advice of Anandavarman, a high-ranking monk.  The king ordered an Indian artist, Naravahanadatta, and a Syrian artist, Priyaratna, with their disciples to paint the caves.&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;  The neighbouring Khotanese kings Vijayavardhana and Murlimin also assisted with the painting of another cave by sending artists to the site.

A notable feature of the murals in Kizil is the extensive use of blue pigments, including the precious [[ultramarine]] pigment derived from [[lapis lazuli]] from Afghanistan. In the classification of the art of the region by [[Ernst Waldschmidt]], there are three distinct periods:&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;  the murals from the first phase are characterized by the use of reddish pigments, while those from the second phase used bluish pigments in abundance.&lt;ref name="kizil"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Transmission of Buddhist Culture: The Kizil Grottoes and the Great Translator Kumārajīva |url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/rarebook/04/index.html.en |author=Makiko Onishi, Asanobu Kitamoto }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earlier paintings reflect more [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Indian]] or Gandharan influences, while the second ones show Iranian ([[Sassanian]]) influences.&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt;  Later caves seem to have fewer legends and/or jatakas, being replaced by the repetitive designs of numerous small Buddhas (the so-called thousand Buddha motif), or sitting Buddhas with nimbuses.&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;  The paintings of the first two phases showed a lack of Chinese elements.&lt;ref name="kizil"/&gt;  The last phase, the Turkic-Chinese period, is most in evidence in the [[Turfan]] area, but in Kizil only two caves showed Tang Chinese influence.
 
Another characteristic of the Kizil murals is the division into diamond-shaped blocks in the vault ceilings of the main room of many caves. Buddhist scenes are depicted inside these diamond-shapes in many layers on top of one another to show the narrative sequences of the scenes.&lt;ref name="tokharian"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11230">This is a list of all the [[ultra-prominent peak]]s (with [[topographic prominence]] greater than {{convert|1500|m|disp=or}}) in [[Europe]], that are not already listed in the top part of the [[List of Alpine peaks by prominence]]. The two lists together cover all the ultra-prominent mountains of Europe. The column "Col" denotes the highest elevation to which one must descend from a peak in order to reach peaks with higher elevations; note that the elevation of any peak is the sum of its prominence and col.

For ease of reference, the list is divided into sections. Islands in the North Atlantic that are territories of European countries have also been included (with the exception of [[Greenland]]), and so have peaks in European Russia and the Caucasus states.

== List of Presidents of the ROC (since 1912) ==
{{Main article|List of Presidents of the Republic of China}}

This is a list of the '''[[President of the Republic of China|Presidents of the Republic of China]]''' (1912–present）due to the [[Taiwan]] currently making up almost all of its de facto territory although the government-in-exile was recognized by the United Nations (to 25 October 1971), the United States (to 1 January 1979) and other Western countries. The Republic of China President is called 總統 (zǒngtǒng), and from 1912–1928, 大總統 (dàzǒngtǒng).

All the names on this list follow the [[Oriental]] convention with the family name first and given name second.

* [[Näckströms bro]] (connecting [[Norrmalm]] and [[Blasieholmen]])

Additionally, during the cold winters in the 19th century, ice in the city harbour made it necessary to replace ferries by temporary [[pontoon bridge]]s sometimes more than 300 m in length.&lt;ref name="Dufwa" /&gt;

The '''Maldives Islands''' is a group of islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] composing today's [[Maldives|Republic of Maldives]] and the island of [[Minicoy]] in the [[Lakshadweep|Union Territory of Lakshadweep]] of [[India]].

Historically Minicoy was within the domain of the [[sultan]]s of the Maldives. In 1790 Minicoy was surrendered to the Court of Directors of the [[East India Company]] and thus became part of the territory of the [[Madras presidency]] of [[British India]]. In 1858, following the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, the control of British India transferred from the East India Company to the [[the Crown|British Crown]], and a decade later [[Queen Victoria]] was proclaimed empress. At the time of the [[partition of India]] of 1947, Minicoy transferred automatically to the new [[Union of India]], while the remainder of the Maldives continued as a self-governing sultanate, ultimately achieving full independence in 1965.

Linguistically, Minicoy remains linked to the rest of the island group.

It should not be confused with the modern [[Mazandaran Province]] in northern [[Iran]], formerly known as [[Tabarestan]].&lt;ref name=najibi/&gt; Besides the Shahnameh, there are also references to Mazandaran in the [[Avesta]].&lt;ref name=najibi/&gt;

It is not clear where Mazandaran was located – various places have been suggested. Some scholars believe that Mazandaran was a region in India,&lt;ref name=dowlatabadi/&gt; others believe that Mazandaran is in the [[Levant]] or [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=najibi/&gt; but there is no consensus between scholars.

== In the Shahnameh ==
{{See also|Rostam's Seven Labours}}

In the ''Shahnameh'', Mazandaran is the land of great ''Divs'' (demons). It is such a horrible place that no [[Shah of Iran]] dared to go there to conquer the land. One day, a Div came to [[Kai Kavus]] to read a poem for him to describe the beauties of Mazandaran. Being impressed by the Div's description, Kai Kavus, who is an irrational and unwise man, decides to conquer Mazandaran. Everyone is opposed to this decision, because even great kings such as [[Jamshid]] and [[Fereydun]] wouldn't try to conquer the land. Nonetheless, Kai Kavus insists upon it. He goes there, but is defeated and imprisoned by the Divs of the area. He and two-thirds of his army are [[Blinding (punishment)|blinded]] by the Divs. He writes a letter to [[Zāl]] to ask him to come and rescue him, but [[Zāl]] is old and can't go. Instead, he sends [[Rostam]], who is a child. Rostam has to pass [[Rostam's Seven Labours|Haft Khan]] in order to get to Mazandaran.

Prior to the above, there are some references to Mazandaran, in the story of [[Zāl]] and [[Rudaba]]. It seems that [[Sām]], the grandfather of [[Rostam]], had conquered Mazandaran at the time of [[Manuchehr]].&lt;ref name=najibi/&gt;

Mazandaran was inhabited by a population that was different from other [[Iranians]]. They did't believe in God, and instead they were magicians; and for this reason, they could not be defeated by man's power, only God's power could defeat them.&lt;ref name=dowlatabadi/&gt;

The manuscript was destroyed during the Second World War, but there are two transcriptions of the original. The Epitome was part of the same manuscript as the so-called Liber de Morte Alexandri Magni Testamentumque (which may have been written by the same epitomator, as suggested by E. Baynham).

The sources of the [[anonymous work|anonymous author]] have much in common with the historian [[Cleitarchus]], through the writings of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]. Non-Cleitarchan elements in the [[manuscript|text]] seem to reflect a certain [[Judaism|Hebraic]] view concerning Alexander.&lt;ref name="Loube"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Worthington"/&gt;

The ''Epitome'' paints a unique portrait of Alexander and includes some information not found elsewhere but in view of its late authorship and the few additional historical fact it offers, the value of the ''Metz Epitome'' lies in its interpretation of Alexander's career rather than as a source for it.&lt;ref name="Loube"/&gt;

The '''National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics''', or NCED, is an NSF Science and Technology Center- a collaborative
partnership among educational, research, and public/private entities that aims to create new knowledge of significant benefit to society. 
Its mission is to understand the dynamics of the coupled processes that shape the Earth’s surface—physical, biological, geochemical, and anthropogenic—and how they will respond to climate, land use, and management change. NCED is headquartered at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="nced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nced.umn.edu/|title=Welcome to NCED!|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

NCED is building interdisciplinary Earth-surface science by integrating elements of geomorphology,ecology, hydrology, sedimentary geology, engineering, economics, and geochemistry. It is creating a predictive Earth-surface science by integrating the advances and approaches of theory, laboratory experiments, numerical modeling,and fieldwork

NCED research is unified by a focus on channel networks and their surroundings. The center's three research initiatives (“Integrated Programs”) approach channel networks from a source-to-sink perspective, looking at watersheds (Watersheds), individual stream
reaches (Streams), and depositional systems (Deltas).

:In the ''Watersheds'' Integrated Program, NCED researchers work to develop quantitative expressions for the fundamental geomorphic and biological processes involved in landscape evolution, and combine that knowledge with digital topographic data to predict the locations of landslide hazards, large algal blooms, or other properties of interest. NCED ''Watersheds'' research seeks to build watershed-scale numerical models of real landscapes to explore problems of long time-scale controls on landscape evolution and short time-scale responses of aquatic ecosystems to land-use change.

:NCED ''Streams'' research works to move the practice of stream restoration beyond analogy and experiential anecdote toward multidisciplinary quantitative prediction. The ''Streams'' research program involves biologists, civil engineers, ecologists, geochemists, geologists, hydrologists, and economists in a concerted effort to develop practical, predictive models of river systems that can guide stream and watershed restoration practice.

:NCED ''Deltas'' research seeks to understand the processes of delta dynamics to inform the present-day restoration of the Mississippi River Delta. Research in this program uses the subsurface stratigraphy of modern deltas to infer rates, spatial patterns, and mechanisms of natural (pre-human) delta building processes. Simultaneously, researchers at the center perform experiments and field studies to develop predictive models of the processes by which deltas build land and maintain themselves and their associated ecosystems against subsidence and sea-level rise.

The '''Newark Earthworks''' in [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]] and [[Heath, Ohio]], consist of three sections of preserved [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]: the Great Circle Earthworks, the Octagon Earthworks, and the Wright Earthworks. This complex, built by the [[Hopewell culture]] between 100 CE and 500 CE, contains the largest earthen [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]]s in the world, being about 3,000 acres in extent. Today, the preserved site covers {{convert|206|acres}}, and is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].  A designated [[National Historic Landmark]], in 2006, the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the "official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio."&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

This is part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, one of 14 sites nominated in January 2008 by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for potential submission by the [[United States|US]] to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octagonmoonrise.org/World%20Heritage%20Designation.html |title=Newark Earthworks Day |publisher=Octagonmoonrise.org |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Built by the pre-European contact [[Hopewell culture]] between 100 CE and 500 CE,&lt;ref&gt; Woodward, Susan L. and Jerry N. McDonald, Indian Mounds of the Ohio Valley: A Guide to Adena and Hopewell Sites,  The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company, Blacksburg, Virginia,  1986  p.16-23&lt;/ref&gt; the earthworks were used as places of ceremony, social gathering, trade, worship, and honoring the dead.&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt;&lt;ref name=OhioHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the primary purpose of the Octagon earthwork itself was believed to have been scientific. The Newark Earthwork site is the largest surviving Hopewell earthwork complex in North America. The culture built many [[Mound builder (people)|earthen mounds]].  Over decades, they built the single largest [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] enclosure complex in the [[Ohio River Valley]].  The earthworks cover several square miles.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; Scholars have demonstrated that the Octagon Earthworks comprise a lunar [[observatory]] for tracking the moon's orbit during its 18.6-year cycle.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

== Great Circle Earthworks ==
[[File:A Mound in the Great Circle Earthworks, Heath.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A mound in the Great Circle Earthworks]]
[[File:End of a ditch at the Great Circle in Newark.jpg|right|thumb|One end of the Great Circle Earthworks, part of the Newark Earthworks.]]
The {{convert|1054|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Newark Great Circle is one of the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]], at least in construction effort. A {{convert|5|ft|m|sing=on}} deep moat is encompassed by walls that are {{convert|8|ft|m}} high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; 

Researchers have used [[Geodesy|archaeogeodesy]] and [[archaeoastronomy]] to analyze the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the earthworks.  This research has revealed that the [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[culture]]s in the area had advanced scientific understanding as the basis of their complex construction.

Today, the Great Circle Earthworks are preserved in a public park in [[Heath, Ohio|Heath]].

==Octagon Earthworks==
Fifty acres total, the Octagon Earthworks consists of an Observatory Mound, Observatory Circle, and the interconnected Octagon span nearly {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in length. It has eight {{convert|550|ft|m|sing=on}}-long walls, from {{convert|5|ft|m}} to {{convert|6|ft|m}} high. The Octagon Earthworks are joined by parallel walls to a circular embankment enclosing {{convert|20|acres}}.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt;

In 1982 researchers from [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]] concluded that the complex was a lunar observatory, designed to track motions of the moon, including the northernmost point of the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar orbit. When viewed from the observatory mound the moon rises at that time within one-half of a degree of the octagon's exact center. The earthwork is twice as precise as the complex at [[Stonehenge]] (assuming Stonehenge is an observatory, which is a disputed theory).&lt;ref name="Maag"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Maag |title=Ohio Indian Mounds: Hallowed Ground and a Nice Par 3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/national/28mounds.html |work=New York Times |date=2005-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newark Works Squier and Davis Plate XXV.jpg|thumb|left|150px|19th-century plan of the Works]]
From 1892 to 1908, the state of [[Ohio]] used the Octagon Earthworks as a [[militia]] [[Military camp|encampment]]. Immediately after this, the Newark Board of Trade owned the property, until 1918. In 1910, they leased the property to Mound Builders Country Club (MBCC), which developed the site as a golf course. As a result of a [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]] Common Pleas Court case, a trustee was named to manage the property from 1918 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

In 1997 the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio Historical Society (now the Ohio History Connection)]] signed a lease until 2078 with the country club. MBCC maintains, secures, and provides some public access to the land. Some citizens believe the country club is an inappropriate use of the sacred site.&lt;ref name=OhioVisit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=Visit|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been increasing public interest in the earthworks. Activists have pressed for more public access to the site to witness the moonrise, which observance was planned in the design and construction by the original native builders.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

==Wright Earthworks==
The Wright Earthworks consist of a fragment of a geometrically near-perfect square enclosure and part of one wall that originally formed a set of parallel embankments, which travelled from the enclosure to a large oval yard. The Newark square's sides formerly ranged from about {{convert|940|ft|m}} to {{convert|940|ft|m}} in length, enclosing a total area of about {{convert|20|acres}}.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; Farming and construction, associated with building the [[Ohio Canal]] and the streets and houses of the city of Newark, destroyed much of the square enclosure and its associated mounds. The remaining segment of one wall of the square is less than {{convert|200|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2753 |title=Wright Earthworks – Ohio History Central – A product of the Ohio Historical Society |publisher=Ohio History Central |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wright Earthworks are named in honor of Mrs. Frances Rees Wright, who donated the site to the Ohio Historical Society in 1934.&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt;

The '''Norwegian Barents Secretariat''' aims at developing the Norwegian-Russian relations in the north by promoting and funding Norwegian-Russian cooperation projects. On behalf of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretariat grant funds to bilateral Norwegian-Russian cooperation projects. The Secretariat grants approximately 200 Norwegian-Russian projects annually.

The Secretariat is also a center of competence on Norwegian-Russian relations, by carrying through and finance various types of reviews or reports on relevant topics in the region. The Secretariat also coordinate the national goals with the regional political priorities within the frames of the multilateral Barents Cooperation, and work as a resource center for the councils, committees and working groups of the Barents Cooperation. 

Head of the Norwegian Barents Secretariat is [[Lars Georg Fordal]] (in office since sept 1st, 2016).

The online newspaper ''BarentsObserver'', which covers far northern news issues, with news stories from Russia, Norway, Sweden and Finland, published in English and Russian, was established in 2002 and operated under the aegis of the Barents Secretariat between 2005 and 2015.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;[http://www.barentsobserver.com/index.php?cat=16313 News from the Barents Region (About)], barentsobserver.com, Retrieved August 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://barentsobserver.com/en/news-barents-region About BarentsObserver], old website, not updated since November 2015, as read on February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; After a conflict between owners and editors in the end of 2015, a new website "The Independent Barents Observer" was established in October 2015, owned by its editors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarentsobserver.com/content/about-us About us], The Independent Barents Observer, as read on February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">The '''politics of [[Liaoning]]''' Province in the [[People's Republic of China]] is structured in a single party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The Governor of Liaoning (辽宁省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of [[Liaoning]]. However, in the province's single party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Liaoning [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary (辽宁省委书记), colloquially termed the "Liaoning [[CPC Party Chief]]".

Previous to 1949 and the takeover of the Communist forces, Liaoning was governed by the [[Fengtian Clique]] of warlords and interchangeably officials of the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] bureaucracy. During the [[Qing Dynasty]] Liaoning was known as the province of Fengtian, and was governed by a ''zongdu'' or [[Viceroy]] (The Viceroy of the Three Eastern Provinces 东三省总督), along with the provinces of [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]. The province itself also had a governor (''xunfu'').

The '''Réunion hotspot''' is a [[volcanic]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] which currently lies under the island of [[Réunion]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]] and the southern part of the [[Mascarene Plateau]] are volcanic traces of the Réunion hotspot.&lt;ref name="Verzhbitsky"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=E. V. Verzhbitsky|title=Geothermal regime and genesis of the Ninety-East and Chagos-Laccadive ridges|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370702000686|journal=Journal of Geodynamics |volume=35 |year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0264-3707(02)00068-6|issue=3|pages=289|bibcode = 2003JGeo...35..289V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotspot is believed to have been active for over 65 million years. A huge eruption of this hotspot 65 million years ago is thought to have laid down the [[Deccan Traps]], a vast bed of [[basalt]] lava that covers part of central [[India]], and opened a rift which separated India from the [[Mascarene Plateau|Seychelles Plateau]]. The Deccan Traps eruption coincided roughly with the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s, and there is considerable speculation that the two events were related. As the Indian plate drifted north, the hotspot continued to punch through the plate, creating a string of volcanic islands and undersea plateaux. The [[Laccadive Islands]], the [[Maldives]], and the [[Chagos Archipelago]] are [[atoll]]s resting on former volcanoes created 60–45 million years ago that subsequently submerged below sea level. About 45 million years ago the [[rift (geology)|mid-ocean rift]] crossed over the hotspot, and the hotspot passed under the [[African Plate]].

The hotspot appears to have been relatively quiet 45–10 million years ago, when activity resumed, creating the [[Mascarene Islands]], which include [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]]. Mauritius and Rodrigues Ridge were created 8–10 million years ago, and Rodrigues and Réunion Islands in the last two million years. [[Piton de la Fournaise]], a [[shield volcano]] on the southeastern corner of Réunion, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting last in August 2015.&lt;ref name="Klemetti"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Klemetti, Erik|year=2014|title=New Eruption at Piton de la Fournaise on Reunion Island|journal=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/new-eruption-at-piton-de-la-fournaise-on-reunion-island/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWxgguM1|archivedate=22 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samoa hotspot''' is a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] located in the south [[Pacific Ocean]].
The hotspot model describes a hot upwelling plume of [[magma]] through the [[Earth's crust]] as an explanation of how [[volcanic island]]s are formed. The hotspot idea came from [[J. Tuzo Wilson]] in 1963 based on the [[Hawaii]] volcanic island chain. 

In theory, the Samoa hotspot is based on the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific Tectonic Plate]] traveling over a fixed hotspot located deep underneath the [[Samoan Islands]].&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{cite web

The Samoa hotspot includes the Samoan Islands ([[American Samoa]] and [[Samoa]]), and extends to the islands of Uvea or [[Wallis Island]] (Wallis and Futuna) and [[Niulakita]] ([[Tuvalu]]), as well as the submerged [[Pasco banks]] and [[Alexa Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceandots.com/pacific/bankx/ |title=Samoan Hotspot Trail |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223043232/http://oceandots.com/pacific/bankx/ |archivedate=December 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Pacific Plate moves slowly over the hotspot, thermal activity builds up and is released in magma plume spewing through the Earth's crust, forming each island in a chain. The Samoa islands generally lie in a straight line, east to west, in the same direction of the tectonic plate 'drifting' over the hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A characteristic of a “classic” hotspot, like the [[Hawaii hotspot]], results in islands located further from the hotspot being progressively older with newer and younger islands closest to the fixed hotspot, like the [[Loihi Seamount]], the only submarine volcano which has been studied in detail by scientists. The scientific research from Loihi has resulted in a 'Hawaii' model for hotspots primarily limited to the information gathered from the Hawaii islands.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;{{Cite journal

==Vailulu'u==
In 1975, geophysicist [[Rockne Johnson]] discovered the [[Vailulu'u|Vailulu'u Seamount]], 45&amp;nbsp;km east of Ta'u island in American Samoa which has since been studied by an international team of scientists. Within the summit crater of Vailulu'u is an active underwater [[volcanic cone]] called Nafanua,&lt;ref name=wh/&gt; named after a war goddess in [[Samoan mythology]].  The study of Vailulu'u provides scientists with another possible model for hotspots&lt;ref name=hart/&gt; as an alternative to the Hawaii hotspot model. 

An important difference between Vailulu'u and Loihi in Hawaii, is a total lack of [[tholeiitic basalt]] compositions at Vailulu'u&lt;ref name=hart/&gt; although both are located at the easternmost point of their respective island chains. 

The northern [[Tonga Islands]] ([[Vava'u]] and [[Niuatoputapu]]) are moving away from [[Fiji]] on the [[Australian plate]] at rates of about 130&amp;nbsp;mm/yr and 160&amp;nbsp;mm/yr, respectively, while [[Niue]] and [[Rarotonga]] on the Pacific plate are approaching the Australian plate at about 80&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. This implies that Pacific plate is tearing at the corner of the trench-[[transform boundary]] at a rate that is the sum of these two (160 + 80) 240&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite book

{{Main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Departments of Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso is divided into thirteen [[Regions of Burkina Faso|regions]], forty-five [[Provinces of Burkina Faso|provinces]], and 351 [[Departments of Burkina Faso|departments]].

Since 2012, every department includes now a single commune (municipality) covering all urbanized areas in the department and representing its population for local elections (by village, or by urban sector within cities and towns). Two very populated departments  ([[Ouagadougou Department|Ouagadougou]] and [[Bobo-Dioulasso Department|Bobo-Dioulasso]]) are also further subdivided into arrondissements, which split their capital city (and also cover all surrounding villages): their urban commune have a specific status.

The thirteen regions are:

*[[Boucle du Mouhoun Region|Boucle du Mouhoun]]
*[[Cascades Region|Cascades]]
*[[Centre Region (Burkina Faso)|Centre]]
*[[Centre-Est Region|Centre-Est]]
*[[Centre-Nord Region|Centre-Nord]]

[[Zimbabwe]] has a [[centralised government]] and is divided into eight [[Provinces of Zimbabwe|provinces]] and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital from where official business is usually carried out.&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travlang.com/factbook/print/zi.html |title=The World Factbook |accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of most of the provinces were generated from the [[Mashonaland]] and [[Matabeleland]] divide at the time of colonisation: [[Mashonaland]] was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and [[Matabeleland]] the territory conquered during the [[First Matabele War]]. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the [[Shona people]] and the [[Matabele people]], although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor, appointed by the [[President of Zimbabwe|President]].&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the Republic of Zimbabwe|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=2008-12-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221053703/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms%5CActs%5CTitle29_LOCAL_GOVERNMENT/PROVINCIAL_COUNCILS_AND_ADMINISTRATION_ACT_29_11.pdf |format=PDF|title=Provincial Councils and Administration Act (Chapter 29:11)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provinces are subdivided into 59 [[Districts of Zimbabwe|districts]] and 1,200 [[Wards of Zimbabwe|wards]] (sometimes referred to as municipalities). Each district is headed by a District Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a Chief Executive Officer. The Rural District Council comprises elected ward councillors, the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms%5CActs%5CTitle29_LOCAL_GOVERNMENT/RURAL_DISTRICT_COUNCILS_ACT_29_13.pdf |format=PDF|title=Rural District Councils Act (Chapter 29:13)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ward level there is a Ward Development Committee, comprising the elected ward councillor, the kraalheads (traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs) and representatives of Village Development Committees. Wards are subdivided into villages, each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman (traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms%5CActs%5CTitle29_LOCAL_GOVERNMENT/TRADITIONAL_LEADERS_ACT_29_17.pdf |format=PDF|title=Traditional Leaders Act (Chapter 29:17)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7721">'''Urban climatology''' refers to a specific branch of [[climatology]] that is concerned with interactions between [[urban area|urban]] areas and the [[atmosphere]], the effects they have on one another, and the varying spatial and temporal scales at which these processes (and responses) occur.

== History ==
[[Luke Howard]] is considered to have established urban climatology with his book ''The Climate of London'', which contained continuous daily observations from 1801 to 1841 of wind direction, atmospheric pressure, maximum temperature, and rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mills | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Luke Howard and The Climate of London | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.195/abstract | journal = Weather | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 153–157 | doi=10.1002/wea.195| bibcode = 2008Wthr...63..153M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban climatology came about as a methodology for studying the results of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. Constructing cities changes the physical environment and alters energy, moisture, and motion regimes near the surface. Most of these alterations can be traced to causal factors such as [[air pollution]]; anthropogenic sources of heat; surface [[waterproofing]]; thermal properties of the surface materials; and morphology of the surface and its specific three-dimensional geometry—building spacing, height, orientation, vegetative layering, and the overall dimensions and geography of these elements.&lt;ref&gt;Arnfield, A. John. "Two Decades of Urban Climate Research: A Review of Turbulence, Exchanges of Energy and Water, and the Urban Heat Island." International Journal of Climatology 23.1 (2003): 1-26. Web. [http://planning.cityenergy.org.za/Pdf_files/planning/city_energy_planning/Two%20Decades%20of%20Urban%20Climate%20Reseach.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors are relief, proximity to water bodies, size of the city, population density, and land-use distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oke | first1 = T.R. | year = 1988 | title = Street design and urban canopy layer climate | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378778888900266 | journal = Energy and Buildings | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 103–113 | doi=10.1016/0378-7788(88)90026-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential factors ==
Several factors influence the [[urban climate]], including city size, the morphology of the city, land-use configuration, and the geographic setting (such as relief, elevation, and [[regional climate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Oke, T.R. 1968: Toward a more rational understanding of the urban heat island. McGill Climate Bulletin. 20pp&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the differences between urban and rural climates include [[air quality]], wind patterns, and changes in rainfall patterns, but one of the most studied is the [[urban heat island]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;Grimmond, CSB. 2006: Prof Sue Grimmond answers questions on urban climatology [http://www.rgs.org/OurWork/Schools/Geography+in+the+News/Ask+the+experts/Urban+climatology.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature and Urban Heat Island Effect===
Urban environments are typically warmer than their surroundings, as documented over a century ago by Howard.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, G. 2009: LUKE HOWARD, TIM OKE AND THE STUDY OF URBAN CLIMATES IAUC newsletter&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas are islands or spots on the broader scale compared with more rural surrounding land. The spatial distribution of temperatures occurs in tandem with temporal changes, which are both causally related to anthropogenic sources.

The urban environment has two atmosphere layers, besides the planetary boundary layer outside and extending well above the city: (1) The urban boundary layer is due to the spatially integrated heat and moisture exchanges between the city and its overlying air. (2) The surface of the city corresponds to the level of the urban [[canopy layer]]. Fluxes across this plane comprise those from individual units, such as roofs, canyon tops, trees, lawns, and roads, integrated over larger land-use divisions (for example, [[suburb]]s). The [[Heat island|urban heat island effect]] has been a major focus of urban climatological studies, and in general the effect the urban environment has on local [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions.

=== Pollution ===
The field also includes the topics of [[air quality]], [[Earth's energy budget|Radiation Fluxes]], [[Micro-climate|Micro-Climates]] and even issues traditionally associated with architectural design and engineering, such as [[Wind Engineering]]. Causes and effects of pollution as understood through Urban Climatology are becoming more important for [[Urban Planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Romero | first1 = H | last2 = Ihl | first2 = M | last3 = Rivera | first3 = A | last4 = Zalazar | first4 = P | last5 = Azocar | first5 = P | year = 1999 | title = Rapid urban growth, land-use changes and air pollution in Santiago, Chile | doi = 10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00145-4 | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 33 | issue = 24–25| pages = 4039–4047 | bibcode = 1999AtmEn..33.4039R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precipitation ===
Changes in winds and convection patterns over and around cities impacts precipitation. Contributing factors are believed to be urban heat island, heightened surface roughness, and increased aerosol concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Han, J. et al. 2014: Urban impacts on precipitation; Asia-Pacific Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, Volume 50, Issue 1, pp 17-30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change ==
Urban climatology is strongly linked to research surrounding [[global warming]]. As centers for socio-economic activities, cities produce large amounts of greenhouse gases, most notably CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a consequence of human activities such as transport, development, waste related to heating and cooling requirements etc.

Globally, cities are expected to grow into the 21st century (and beyond) &lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (2014). ''World urbanization prospects, the 2014 revision: Highlights'' [http://www.who.int/gho/urban_health/situation_trends/urban_population_growth/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; - as they grow and develop the landscapes in which they inhabit will change so too will the atmosphere resting above them, increasing emissions of GHG's thus contributing to the global green house effect.

Finally, many cities are vulnerable to the projected consequences of climate change (sea level rise, changes in temperature, precipitation, storm frequency) as most develop on or near coast-lines, nearly all produce distinct urban heat islands and atmospheric pollution: as areas in which there is concentrated human habitation these effects potentially will have the largest and most dramatic impact (e.g. France's heat wave in 2003) and thus are a major focus for urban climatology.&lt;ref&gt;[5] Alexander, Mathews et. al [http://www.googleearthireland.com/page/Climate+Change+and+Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial planning and public health ==
Urban Climatology impacts decision-making for [[municipal planning]] and policy in regards to [[pollution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hebbert | first1 = M. | last2 = Mackillop | first2 = F. | year = 2013 | title = Urban Climatology Applied to Urban Planning: A Postwar Knowledge Circulation Failure | url = | journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1542–1558 | doi=10.1111/1468-2427.12046}}&lt;/ref&gt; extreme [[heat]] events, and [[stormwater]] modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Yen, Ben Chie.

In [[Taiwan]], all [[motor vehicle]]s are required to register and display its '''[[vehicle registration plate]]s'''. The plates are issued and managed by the [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Republic of China)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MoTC)]]. The vehicle registration numbers in [[Taiwan]] contains [[Latin alphabet]]s (A to Z), [[Arabic numerals]] (0 to 9) and [[dash]] (–); some special types also contain [[Chinese character]]s.

== Types of number plate ==
Taiwan's current number plate system uses Latin letters with Arabic numerals. There are many types of number plate used in Taiwan, they are:

* The plates of military vehicles and agricultural machines are not managed by the MoTC.
* Until 1 January 2007, plates were identified as having been issued under the jurisdiction of either [[Taiwan Province]], [[Taipei|Taipei City]], [[Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung City]], [[Kinmen County]] or [[Lienchiang County]]. Since that time, the legends identifying the place of issuance have been removed&amp;mdash;plates display only registration numbers&amp;mdash;but the plates are still issued separately by each jurisdiction.
* 1992-Series License Plate is similar to North American plates: The size (320 × 150&amp;nbsp;mm) and the format. However it used "Mexico Mode" rather than "US Mode": One national numbering system, such that serials are not duplicated in multiple Jurisdiction: Taipei City issued "AD-3608", the other four jurisdiction would not issue "AD-3608" anymore. There won't be the problem that two or more jurisdictions all have "AD-3608". So the legends identifying the place of issuance is not so important. And License Plate Scanning and Identifying Systems in Taiwan also ignore it.  Actually, there's a rule of numbering of different jurisdiction: such as "XY-****" can only be issued by Kaohsiung City, "WZ-****" can only be issued by Lienchiang County.

* On 17 December 2012, Taiwanese government started issuing new registration plates. The main changes are: add an additional digit and enhance the security features of the plate.

[[File:Zavojsko jezero3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Lake Zavoj]] in the Visok region]]

'''Visok''' ([[Cyrillic]]: Висок) is a region in eastern [[Serbia]] and westernmost [[Bulgaria]] that lies between the main ranges of the [[Balkan Mountains]] and [[Vidlič]] Mountain. It is located {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} from [[Pirot]], and about {{convert|350|km|abbr=on}} from [[Belgrade]].

== Geography ==

The Visok region is characterized by steep [[valley]]s with mostly short [[river]]s. It is of [[tectonic]] origin, but it was through intensive [[erosion]], mostly fluvial erosion, that it was shaped.

The [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]] of this region is well developed. The [[Visočica River]], with its tributaries, forms the densest drainage network in Serbia. Another very important hydrological feature of Visok is [[Lake Zavoj]].

== Climate ==

The southwestern slopes of the Old Mountain are characterized by a moderate/continental sub-mountain/mountain climate, which gets colder and more humid from lower to higher elevations. The coldest month is January, and the warmest is July.

== Population ==

The region is depopulating and sparsely populated. The massive seasonal leave in search for work (''pečalba'') has been recorded from the late 18th century. The seasonal workers mostly worked in the construction business. In the second half of the 19th century the workers mostly left for [[Romania]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Zagore]] region in Bulgaria. In Romania and Bulgaria they mostly worked in the villages, building houses made of ''čerpić'' (non-baked, Sun dried brick made of mud and straw), in the ''naboj'' style (compacted earth). They were spreading building influence so much, that the village architecture in the regions of Zagore and Visok is almost identical. From the late 19th century to the [[Balkan Wars]], economic emigration intensified and the conditions in the Visok were so bad that even women travelled as seasonal workers, waving cloth.&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{ cite news | author = Marija Đorđević, Gorica Ljubenović | title = Архитекте гладних села | trans-title = Architects from the hungry villages | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Kulturni dodatak | page = 06 | language = Serbian | date = 21 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agriculture is barely possible because of the harsh conditions, so famine developed occasionally. In 1909 there were even reports of the deaths caused by starvation. In the late 19th and early 20th century, workers travelled mostly to Bulgaria, in groups of 10-15 people, called ''tajve''. The working season was beginning around the [[Saint George's Day]] in early May, when the migrations would start, and was usually ending around [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius Day]] in early November. After 1918 and [[World War I]], as travelling in the foreign countries became problematic, population mostly migrated to [[Belgrade]] and the Serbian central region of [[Šumadija]], but stayed mainly in the construction business.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

== Settlements ==

The villages were divided in three groups, and not all has migrations of the seasonal workers. The groups were: "(very) hungry", "semi-fed" and "full fed" villages. First group ([[Dojkinci]], [[Brlog]], [[Jelovica, Pirot|Jelovica]], [[Šugrin]], [[Cerova (Pirot)|Cerova]]) gave the largest number of workers, then came the second group ([[Ragodeš]], [[Bazovik]]), while the inhabitants of the villages from the third group, like [[Gostuša]] and [[Topli Do, Pirot|Topli Do]] could sustain its population with the agricultural products so there was no need for people to leave during the year.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

According to the urban-morphological structures, the villages in the region belong to the compacted type. The architecture in them mostly originates from the 19th and the first half of the 20th century and the older objects especially were influenced by the Oriental style and the Bulgarian old urban architecture. The houses are built from the natural, available materials, like wood or stone. The study made by the architects and conservators on protecting and preserving the village of Gostuša was awarded by the European Commission in 2016.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

The typical household was enclosed with the stone wall (''duvar''). In the yard there were the central room (''iža''), bridal room, barn, grain basket, henhouses, pigsties, etc. Central room had a [[hearth]] and could be seated by up to 12 people. For such a desolate and arid region, the village houses show major diversity: some are plain but the others have façade level porches, protruded porches, arches, upper floors, balconies, verandas (''doksat''), foundations shaped like a Cyrillic "Г" letter, passages, [[bay windows]] (''erkeri''), etc. Larger estates included shepherd's huts (''bačija''), [[hayloft]]s, etc. But as the region is depopulating fast, the objects deteriorate. In 2018 [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] organized an exhibition on the subject. The most distinctive specimen include: House of Mila Cenkov ([[Smilovci]]; built in 1912, demolished in 2017); House of Mita Angelov ([[Visočki Odorovci]]; built in the early 1900s); House of Mira Mitić (Topli Do; built in 1933).&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5839">'''Édouard Dunglas''' (1891–1952) was a French physician, historian, geographer, and politician who spent a majority of his life in [[Dahomey]] (now Benin).

==Early life==
Born in Paris in 1891, Dunglas was educated as a medical doctor. He found a passion in politics, and quit medicine when he was appointed to administrate [[Togo]]. Later, he worked in [[Ketou]], Dahomey, and wrote a celebrated history of the town. He also found praise with his geographical studies and documents on traditions of the [[Fon people]].&lt;ref&gt;Ana Lucia Araujo Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic Page 202 "Édouard Dunglas, "Le Chacha F F de Souza", France-Dabomey, May June 1949."&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II,&lt;ref name=Decalo57&gt;{{Harvnb|Decalo|1976|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dunglas was named head of the multi-national research institution Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire (IFAN) in Dahomey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Decalo|1976|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1951 French National Assembly election==
In the legislative elections of June 17, 1951, Dahomey was allowed an additional representative in the [[French National Assembly]]. Veteran politician [[Sourou-Migan Apithy]] faced a new opponent: northern teacher [[Hubert Maga]].&lt;ref name=DR94&gt;{{Harvnb|Ronen|1975|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that two seats were allotted to Dahomey was only known in the last week of April.&lt;ref name=MSI296&gt;{{harvnb|Staniland|1973a|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per a May 1951 electoral law, each candidate had to give the names of another who would occupy the second seat in the event that the other party's first candidate came in third or below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ronen|1975|pp=92–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apithy chose [[Emile Derlin Zinsou]] as his running mate, with Apithy leading on the electoral list as of a meeting on April 29. However, Zinsou argued that he would be forced to vacate seat on the Assembly of the French Union and that someone from the north of Dahomey would be able to fill it. Therefore, on May 23 it was decided that Zinsou and Apithy would be listed in that order.&lt;ref name=DR93&gt;{{Harvnb|Ronen|1975|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Maga, meanwhile, chose northern merchant [[Paul Darboux]] and the latter was content as second on the list.&lt;ref name="DR94" /&gt;

Zinsou and Apithy, in stark contrast to their northern rivals, could not agree on who would headline the list. It reached a point, on May 27, that the two southern candidates decided to run individually: Zinsou campaigned with school teacher [[Gilbert Kpakpo]], while Apithy partnered with Dunglas under the newly formed Union Francaise.&lt;ref name="DR94" /&gt; Maga and Darboux capitalised on growing cynicism regarding southern Dahomey dominating the French colony's politics, allying themselves with the northern tribes.&lt;ref name=SD453&gt;{{Harvnb|Decalo|1973|p=453}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1951 law also enlarged the electorate from 61,958 to 333,693. Some dead people were even counted as electors due to the mishandling of election cards. The Cotonou newspaper ''L'Etoile du Dahomey'' noted the presence of a man who would give an unlimited number of cards as long as they promised to vote for Apithy.&lt;ref name=MSI296/&gt; Altogether, however, only 44% of the population voted on election day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1963|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apithy was reelected a deputy with 53,463 votes out of 147,350 cast.&lt;ref name=assemblee&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.assembleenationale.com/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/apithy-joseph-sourou-migan-marcellin-08041913.asp|title=Biographies des députés de la IVe République: Joseph Apithy|newspaper=[[National Assembly of France]]|accessdate=2009-02-05|language=fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Maga captured the second seat with 49,329, with Zinsou/Kpakpo receiving a mere 18,410 ballots. Several smaller parties hosted several other candidates, which received the rest of the votes.&lt;ref name="DR94" /&gt; Only 2.2 percent of Apithy and Dungalas's votes came from the northern region, while 64 percent came from the Porto Novo metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=DR95&gt;{{Harvnb|Ronen|1975|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
After the election Dunglas won a seat in Dahomey's territorial assembly. He died in 1952 in Porto Novo. His grave is located in a Porto Novian cemetery.&lt;ref name=Decalo57/&gt;
