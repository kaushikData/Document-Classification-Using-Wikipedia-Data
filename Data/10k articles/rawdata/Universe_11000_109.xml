The '''2010s oil glut ''' is a considerable surplus of [[Petroleum|crude oil]] that started in 2014–2015 and accelerated in 2016, with multiple causes. They include general oversupply as US and Canadian [[shale oil]] production reached critical volumes, [[geopolitical]] rivalries amongst oil-producing nations, falling demand across [[commodities market]]s due to the deceleration of the Chinese economy, and possible restraint of long-term demand as [[Environmental policy]] promotes [[fuel efficiency]] and steers an increasing share of energy consumption away from [[fossil fuel]]s.

The world [[price of oil]] was above [[United States dollar|US$]]125 per barrel in 2012, and remained relatively strong above $100 until September 2014, after which it entered a sharp downward spiral, falling below $30 by January 2016. [[OPEC]] production was poised to rise further with the lifting of international [[sanctions against Iran]], at a time when markets already appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |title=Iran Says Post-Sanctions Crude Output Boost Won't Hurt Prices |first1=Hashem |last1=Kalantari |first2=Mohammed |last2=Sergie |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' quoted a major oil broker stating: "The world is floating in oil. The numbers we are facing now are dreadful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1= Ambrose |last1=Evans-Pritchard |title= Goldman eyes $20 oil as glut overwhelms storage sites |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/oilprices/12006554/Goldman-eyes-20-oil-as-glut-overwhelms-storage-sites.html |accessdate=29 December 2015|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated: "The ongoing oil price slump has more or less morphed into a complete rout, with profound long-term implications for the industry as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1= Gaurav |last1=Sharma|title= Oil Market Rout: Winners, Losers And Cost Implications For 2016|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2015/12/11/oil-market-rout-winners-losers-and-cost-implications-for-2016/|accessdate=29 December 2015|journal=Forbes |date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 2016 continued, the price gradually rose back into the $40s, with the world waiting to see if and when and how the market would return to balance.&lt;ref name=basketprice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Brent prices had recovered to their pre-2015 levels, peaking &lt;ref name=OIL (BRENT) IN USD - HISTORICAL PRICES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/historical-prices/oil-price/usd/3.10.2018_3.10.2018?type=brent |title=Market Insider Daily Archives |work=Business Insider |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at $86.29 a barrel on October 3. However, prices began to tumble yet again following the assassination of  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Shane |last1=Harris|title= CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi’s assassination|url=https://https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.a063e62bfa21|accessdate=16 November 2018|journal=Washington Post |date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsustainable prices==
On April 6, 2014, writing in a [[Saudi Arabia]]n journal, [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] economist Nicolas J. Firzli warned that the escalating oversupply situation could have durably negative economic consequences for all [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] member states: 

{{quote|"the price of oil has stabilized at a relatively high level (around $100 a barrel) unlike all previous recessionary cycles since 1980 (start of [[Iran–Iraq War|First Persian Gulf War]]). But nothing guarantees such price levels in perpetuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/6702258/A_GCC_House_Divided_Country_Risk_Implications_of_the_Saudi-Qatari_Rift |work=Al-Hayat |location=London |title=A GCC House Divided: Country Risk Implications of the Saudi-Qatari Rift |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Causes==
===North American shale output===
Combined U.S. and Canadian oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels, due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] "[[fracking]]" technology in response to record oil prices. The steady rise in additional output, mostly from [[North Dakota]], [[West Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Alberta]], eventually led to a plunge in U.S. oil import requirements and a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage.&lt;ref name="NYT_2014"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China's slowed growth===
The [[2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence]] slowed the growth of the economy in [[China]], restraining its demand for oil and other industrial commodities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Geopolitical rivalries===
In spite of longstanding [[geopolitical]] rivalries – notably the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] bloc versus [[Iran]] and [[Venezuela]] – [[emerging markets]] oil producers within and outside [[OPEC]] maintained at least some output discipline until the fall of 2014, when [[Saudi Arabia]] advocated higher OPEC production and lower price levels to erode the profitability of high-cost shale oil production.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

It has been suggested that the Saudi Arabian-Iranian Proxy War was a powerful influence in the Saudi decision to launch the price war. 

Some [[geoeconomics]] experts have argued that the [[Saudi]] – [[Qatari]] rivalry has shattered the semblance of unity that may have existed amongst [[fossil fuel]] producers: 

: “What we’re witnessing here is a fight to the death between the world’s leading oil and natural gas producers at a time when fossil fuel prices are collapsing across the board.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/33925293/The_Qatar_Crisis_and_the_Eastern_Flank_of_the_Arab_World |title= The Qatar Crisis and the Eastern Flank of the Arab World|first=M.

===Combatting climate change===
In the quarters leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st UN Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, US and European policy makers, pension trustees and academic thought-leaders became active devising new ways of fostering private capital stewardship and “greener” investment: persuading and incentivizing institutional asset owners to embrace [[renewable energy]] and a low-carbon investment ethos, more propitious for long-term growth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Speaking at the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|5th annual World Pensions Forum]] held in Paris on the sidelines of the UN Conference, [[Earth Institute]] Director [[Jeffrey Sachs]] argued that [[institutional investor]]s would eventually have to divest from carbon-reliant [[oil industry]] firms if they could not react to political and regulatory efforts to halt climate change: "Every energy company in a [[pension fund]]'s portfolio needs to be scrutinized from purely a financial view about its future, 'Why is this [a company] we would want to hold over a five- to 20-year period?'... If we continue to hold major energy companies that don’t have an answer to a basic financial test, we are just gambling. We have to take a [[fiduciary]] responsibility – these are not good bets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Andrew |last1=Pearce|title= Jeffrey Sachs: Fund Managers Have a Duty to Dump Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2015-12-07/sachs222 |accessdate=30 December 2015|work=Financial News|date=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Obama]] insisted on America’s essential role in that regard: “We’ve led by example […] from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains [...] we’ve seen the longest streak of private job creation in our history. We’ve driven our economic output to all-time highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades.  And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divide between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long […] That was the foundation for success in Paris.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Barack |last1=Obama |title=President Obama’s Statement on Climate Change |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change |accessdate=30 December 2015 |work=White House Briefing Room |date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228111409/https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change |archive-date=28 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Venezuela===

Under [[Hugo Chávez]] and his Bolivarian government, PDVSA resources were used to fund social programmes, with Chávez treating it like a "piggybank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Pdvsa is the government's piggy-bank," a U.S. official says |url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2004/06/29/en_pol_art_29A471599 |accessdate=28 June 2014 |work=El Universal |date=29 June 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003555/http://www.eluniversal.com/2004/06/29/en_pol_art_29A471599 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His social policies resulted in overspending&lt;ref name=NPRdec2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Robert|title=For Venezuela, Drop In Global Oil Prices Could Be Catastrophic|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/25/373128433/for-venezuela-drop-in-global-oil-prices-could-be-catastrophic|accessdate=4 January 2015|agency=NPR|date=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ELPAISfeb2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scharfenberg|first1=Ewald|title=Volver a ser pobre en Venezuela|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/01/30/actualidad/1422646346_475356.html|accessdate=3 February 2015|agency=El Pais|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FPmarch2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corrales|first1=Javier|title=The House That Chavez Built|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/07/the-house-that-chavez-built/|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that caused [[shortages in Venezuela]] and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.&lt;ref name=FPcoupFATIGUE&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lansberg-Rodríguez|first1=Daniel|title=Coup Fatigue in Caracas|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/15/coup-fatigue-in-caracas-venezuela-maduro/|accessdate=10 July 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2092rank.html |title=Inflation rate (consumer prices) |work=[[CIA World Factbook]]|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/node/21526365 |accessdate=23 February 2014|title=Venezuela's economy: Medieval policies|work = [[The Economist]]|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";&lt;ref name=Cannon87&gt;Cannon, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 ... to 89% in 2006";&lt;ref name=Cannon87/&gt; and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".&lt;ref name=Cannon87/&gt; By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed".&lt;ref name=FPmarch2013/&gt; and in 2012, the [[World Bank]]  explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venezuela Overview |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/venezuela/overview |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When oil prices dropped in 2015, this worsened the crisis Venezuela was experiencing from the government's mismanagement.&lt;ref name="CNNmoney2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=Matt|title=Why Venezuela's oil production plunged to a 13-year low|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/12/investing/venezuela-crisis-oil-production-plunges/|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela has not yet, as of 2018, recovered from the oil production loss. Combined with OPEC/NOPEC production cuts, higher than average demand growth, US shale pipeline bottlenecks, and Iranian sanctions, the oil glut came to an end.

===Cuba===
Immediately after the [[death of Hugo Chavez]], Castro sought a new benefactor as the oil that was shipped from Venezuela to Cuba began to slow.&lt;ref name=ECONties&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the United States and Cuba are cosying up|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-37|accessdate=14 November 2015|agency=''[[The Economist]]''|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Cuba needing new support, relations between the United States and Cuba began to be reestablished in 2014 during [[United States–Cuban Thaw]].&lt;ref name=ECONties/&gt; 

However in 2016, Cuba still relied on Venezuela's oil and economic assistance. With Cuba's economy slowing as a result of Venezuela's own crisis, many Cubans feared that their nation would soon return to having similar experiences to that of the [[Special Period]], which occurred following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], which Cuba heavily relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=Victoria|title=Amid Grim Economic Forecasts, Cubans Fear a Return to Darker Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/americas/cuba-economy-venezuela-power-cuts.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 July 2016|agency=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type''', also known as '''ALOX12B''', '''12''R''-LOX''', and '''arachiconate lipoygenase 3''', is a [[lipoxygenase]]-type enzyme composed of 701 amino acids and encoded by the ''ALOX12B'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Entrez Gene: ALOX12B arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=242| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9618483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boeglin WE, Kim RB, Brash AR | title = A 12R-lipoxygenase in human skin: mechanistic evidence, molecular cloning, and expression | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6744–9 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618483 | pmc = 22619 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6744 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6744B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9837935"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun D, McDonnell M, Chen XS, Lakkis MM, Li H, Isaacs SN, Elsea SH, Patel PI, Funk CD | title = Human 12(R)-lipoxygenase and the mouse ortholog.

==Activity==
ALOX12B oxygenates [[arachidonic acid]] by adding molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the form of a [[hydroperoxyl]] (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) residue  to its 12th carbon  thereby forming 12(''R'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-icosatetraenoic acid (also termed 12(''R'')-HpETE or 12''R''-HpETE).&lt;ref name="pmid9618483"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9837935"/&gt;  When formed in cells, 12''R''-HpETE may be quickly reduced to its [[hydroxyl]] analog (OH), 12(''R'')-hydroxy-5'''Z'',8''Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (also termed 12(''R'')-HETE or 12''R''-HETE),  by ubiquitous [[peroxidase]]-type enzymes. These sequential metabolic reactions are:

&lt;center&gt;

The ''S'' [[stereoisomer]] of 9''R''-HODE, 9''S''-HODE, has a range of biological activities related to [[oxidative stress]] and pain perception (see [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]. It is known or likely that 9''R''-HODE possesses at least some of these activities.  For example, 9''R''-HODE, similar to 9''S''-HODE, mediates the perception of acute and chronic pain induced by heat, UV light, and inflammation in the skin of rodents (see [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid#9-HODEs as mediators of pain perception]]).

===Proposed principal activity of ALOX12B===
ALOX12B targets [[Linoleic acid]] (LA). LA is the most abundant fatty acid in the skin [[epidermis]], being present mainly [[esterified]] to the omega-[[hydroxyl]] residue of [[amide]]-linked omega-hydroxylated [[very long chain fatty acid]]s (VLCFAs) in a unique class of [[ceramide]]s termed esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-[[sphingosine]] (EOS). EOS is an intermediate component in a proposed multi-step metabolic pathway which delivers VLCFAs to the cornified lipid envelop in the skin's [[Stratum corneum]]; the presence of these [[wax]]-like, hydrophobic VLCFAs is needed to maintain the skin's integrity and functionality as a water barrier (see [[Lung microbiome#Role of the epithelial barrier]]).&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;  ALOX12B metabolizes the LA in EOS to its 9-hydroperoxy derivative; ALOXE3 then converts this derivative to three products: '''a)''' 9''R'',10''R''-trans-[[epoxide]],13''R''-hydroxy-10''E''-octadecenoic acid, '''b)''' 9-keto-10''E'',12''Z''-octadecadienoic acid, and '''c)''' 9''R'',10''R''-trans-epoxy-13-keto-11''E''-octadecenoic acid.&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zheng_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zheng Y, Yin H, Boeglin WE, Elias PM, Crumrine D, Beier DR, Brash AR | title = Lipoxygenases mediate the effect of essential fatty acid in skin barrier formation: a proposed role in releasing omega-hydroxyceramide for construction of the corneocyte lipid envelope | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 27 | pages = 24046–56 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21558561 | pmc = 3129186 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.251496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ALOX12B-oxidized products signal for the [[hydrolysis]] (i.e. removal) of the oxidized products from EOS; this allows the multi-step metabolic pathway to proceed in delivering the VLCFAs to the cornified lipid envelop in the skin's Stratum corneum.&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25316652"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn H, Banthiya S, van Leyen K | title = Mammalian lipoxygenases and their biological relevance | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 308–30 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25316652 | pmc = 4370320 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissue distribution==
ALOX12B protein has been detected in humans that in the same tissues the express ALOXE3 and ALOX15B viz., upper layers of the human skin and tongue and in tonsils.&lt;ref name="Schneider_2002"/&gt;  mRNA for it has been detected in additional tissues such as the lung, testis, adrenal gland, ovary, prostate, and skin with lower abundance levels detected in salivary and thyroid glands, pancreas, brain, and plasma blood leukocytes.&lt;ref name="Schneider_2002"/&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema===
Deletions of ''Alox12b'' or ''AloxE2'' genes in mice cause a congenital scaly skin disease which is characterized by a greatly reduced skin water barrier function and is similar in other ways to the [[autosomal recessive]] nonbullous [[Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma]] (ARCI) disease of humans.&lt;ref name="Zheng_2011"/&gt;  Mutations in many of the genes that encode proteins, including ALOX12B and ALOXE3, which conduct the steps that bring and then bind VLCFA to the stratums corneum are associated with ARCI.&lt;ref name="pmid11773004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jobard F, Lefèvre C, Karaduman A, Blanchet-Bardon C, Emre S, Weissenbach J, Ozgüc M, Lathrop M, Prud'homme JF, Fischer J | title = Lipoxygenase-3 (ALOXE3) and 12(R)-lipoxygenase (ALOX12B) are mutated in non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE) linked to chromosome 17p13.1 | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–13 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11773004 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/11.1.107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16116617"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eckl KM, Krieg P, Küster W, Traupe H, André F, Wittstruck N, Fürstenberger G, Hennies HC | title = Mutation spectrum and functional analysis of epidermis-type lipoxygenases in patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 351–61 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16116617 | doi = 10.1002/humu.20236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ARCI refers to nonsyndromic (i.e. not associated with other signs or symptoms) [[congenital]] [[Ichthyosis]] including [[Harlequin-type ichthyosis]], [[Lamellar ichthyosis]], and [[Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma]].&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krieg P, Fürstenberger G | title = The role of lipoxygenases in epidermis | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1841 | issue = 3 | pages = 390–400 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 23954555 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ARCI has an incidence of about 1/200,000 in European and North American populations; 40 different mutations in ''ALOX12B'' and 13 different mutations in ''ALOXE3'' genes account for a total of about 10% of ARCI case; these mutations uniformly cause a total loss of ALOX12B or ALOXE3 function (see [[mutations]]).&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;

===Proliferative skin diseases===
In [[psoriasis]] and other proliferative skin diseases such as the [[Erythroderma]]s underlying lung cancer, [[cutaneous T cell lymphoma]], and drug reactions, and in [[Discoid lupus]], [[Seborrheic dermatitis]], Subacute [[Cutaneous lupus erythematosus]], and [[Pemphigus foliaceus]], cutaneous levels of ALOX12B [[mRNA]] and 12''R''-HETE are greatly increased.&lt;ref name="Schneider_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7829882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baer AN, Klaus MV, Green FA | title = Epidermal fatty acid oxygenases are activated in non-psoriatic dermatoses | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–5 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7829882 | doi = 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12612793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if these increases contribute to the disease by, for example, 12''R''-HETE induction of inflammation, or are primarily a consequence of skin proliferation.&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;

===Embryogenesis===
The expression of Alox12b and Aloxe3 [[mRNA]] in mice parallels, and is proposed to be instrumental for, skin development in mice [[embryogenesis]]; the human [[ortholog]]s of these genes, i.e. ALOX12B and ALOXE3, may have a similar role in humans.&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;

===Essential fatty acid deficiency===
Severe dietary deficiency of polyunsaturated [[omega 6 fatty acid]]s leads to the [[essential fatty acid deficiency]] syndrome that is characterized by scaly skin and excessive water loss; in humans and animal models the syndrome is fully reversed by dietary omega 6 fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid.&lt;ref name="pmid25339684"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA, Kim HY | title = Discovery of essential fatty acids | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–21 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25339684 | pmc = 4274059 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R055095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is proposed that this deficiency disease resembles and has a similar basis to Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema; that is, it is at least in part due to a deficiency of linoleic acid and thereby in the EOS-based delivery of VLCFA to the stratum corneum.&lt;ref name = "Krieg_2014"/&gt;

The '''April''' or '''Spring Nor'easter of 2007''' was a [[nor'easter]] that affected mainly the eastern parts of [[North America]] during its four-day course, from April 14 to April 17, 2007. The combined effects of high winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides led to flooding, storm damages, power outages, and evacuations, and disrupted traffic and commerce. In the north, heavy wet snow caused the loss of power for several thousands of homes in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. The storm caused at least 18 fatalities.

==Meteorological synopsis==
The storm that would become the April 2007 Nor'easter started out in the [[Southwestern United States]], as an upper-level disturbance in the [[jet stream]], on April 13.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt; It brought high wind and fire danger to [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. The storm then moved out into the southern Plains States, bringing heavy snow to Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas. Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms, with hail, wind, and [[tornadoes]], affected parts of [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], and the [[Carolinas]]. The storm then moved across the Mid-Atlantic States, and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], following the East Coast. The storm then rapidly intensified into a major [[nor'easter]], with the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]]. The storm stalled just offshore from [[New York City]] and continued to strengthen. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 968&amp;nbsp;millibars (28.58&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Hg), equivalent to that of a moderate [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 2 hurricane]].&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

==Impact==

The [[National Weather Service]] reported 7.57&amp;nbsp;inches (192&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Central Park]] by midnight of April 15, the second heaviest rainfall in 24&amp;nbsp;hours on record, and indicated that this storm caused the worst flooding since [[Hurricane Floyd]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/nyregion/16storm.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin| title=East Coast Storm Breaks Rainfall Records| author=Robert McFadden | publisher = New York Times | date=2007-04-16 | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Major airports in the New York area resumed flights on April 16, after having had to cancel over 500 flights before. Local rail and transit  lines reported delays and cancellations affecting the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]], [[NJ Transit]], [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]], and [[Metro-North Railroad]]. Power failures affected several thousand people.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

On April 16, 2007, the storm caused sustained winds of nearly 100&amp;nbsp;mph (87&amp;nbsp;knots) on, and near New Hampshire's [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], with gusts topping out at 156&amp;nbsp;mph (136&amp;nbsp;knots).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountwashington.org/news/release.php?id=17 Patriot's Day Storm Packs a 156-mph Punch.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005900/http://www.mountwashington.org/news/release.php?id=17 |date=2007-10-11 }}  Mount Washington Observatory.

'''Artificial leather''' is a material intended to substitute for [[leather]] in fields such as [[upholstery]], clothing, footwear and [[fabrics]] and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost-prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is marketed under many names, including "leatherette", "faux leather", "vegan leather", "PU leather" and "pleather".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Shaeffer|title=Sew Any Fabric: A Quick Reference to Fabrics from A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTadZIhgtUoC&amp;pg=PA37|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Krause Publications Craft|isbn=1-4402-2033-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Synthetic PU leather HC1.jpg|thumb|Steps to make synthetic [[polyurethane]] leather:&lt;br&gt; 1) The base fabric&lt;br&gt; 2) A polyurethane coating is applied&lt;br&gt; 3)A color coat is added&lt;br&gt; 4) A textured finish is added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|title=PU Synthetic Leather||website=Gofar Synthetic Co., Ltd  |accessdate=11 May 2005  |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511001137/http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|archivedate=11 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.

One of the earliest was ''[[Presstoff]]''. Invented in 19th century Germany, it is made of specially layered and treated paper pulp. It gained its widest use in Germany during the Second World War in place of leather, which under wartime conditions was rationed. ''Presstoff'' could be used in almost every application normally filled by leather, excepting items like footwear that were repeatedly subjected to flex wear or moisture. Under these conditions ''Presstoff'' tends to delaminate and lose cohesion.

''Poromerics'' are made from a plastic coating (usually a [[polyurethane]]) on a fibrous base layer (typically a [[polyester]]). The term poromeric was coined by [[DuPont]] as a derivative of the terms ''porous'' and ''polymeric''. The first poromeric material was DuPont's Corfam, introduced in 1963 at the Chicago Shoe Show. Corfam was the centerpiece of the DuPont pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] in New York City. After spending millions of dollars marketing the product to shoe manufacturers, DuPont withdrew Corfam from the market in 1971 and sold the rights to a company in [[Poland]].

''Leatherette'' is also made by covering a fabric base with a plastic. The fabric can be made of natural or synthetic fiber which is then covered with a soft [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] layer. Leatherette is used in [[bookbinding]] and was common on the casings of 20th century cameras.

Cork leather is a natural-fiber alternative made from the bark of [[cork oak]] trees that has been compressed, similar to ''Presstoff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|title=Cork Leather – The Best Alternative to Animal Leather?|last=Oskar|first=Zieba|date=5 July 2017|work=Blackwood Blog|access-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803212739/https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fermentation method of making [[collagen]], the main chemical in real leather, is under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/modern-meadow-and-evonik-are-brewing-leather-in-a-lab.html|title=This leather is made in a lab, not from livestock|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=2018-03-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing and fabric uses==
[[File:HM Queen Paola, Princess of Belgium.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Paola of Belgium]] wearing artificial leather]]
Artificial leathers are often used in clothing fabrics, furniture upholstery, and automotive uses.&lt;ref name=faux&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitchellfauxleathers.com/Default/ViewPoint/Read/faux-leather-viewpoint/2014/04/07/what-is-faux-leather|title=What is Faux Leather?|first=Jim|last=Blesius|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One disadvantage of plastic-coated artificial leather is that it is not porous and does not allow air to pass through; thus, sweat can accumulate if it is used for clothing, car seat coverings, etc. One of its primary advantages, especially in cars, is that it requires little maintenance in comparison to leather, and does not crack or fade easily.&lt;ref name=faux/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20493">[[File:Almen A-4.jpg|thumb|right|Almen A-4 barrel engine]]
'''Axial engines''' (sometimes known as '''barrel''' or '''Z-crank engines''') are a type of [[reciprocating engine]] with pistons arranged around an output shaft with their axes parallel to the shaft. Barrel refers to the cylindrical shape of the cylinder group (result of the pistons being spaced evenly around the central crankshaft and aligned parallel to the crankshaft axis) whilst the Z-crank alludes to the shape of the crankshaft.

The key advantage of the axial design is that the cylinders are arranged in parallel around the output/crank shaft in contrast to radial and inline engines, both types having cylinders at right angles to the shaft. As a result, it is a very compact, cylindrical engine, allowing variation in [[compression ratio]] of the engine while running. In a swashplate engine the piston rods stay parallel with the shaft, and piston side-forces that cause excessive wear can be eliminated almost completely. The small-end bearing of a traditional connecting rod, one of the most problematic bearings in a traditional engine, is eliminated.

An alternate design, the Rand [[cam engine]], replaces the plate with one or more [[Sinusoidal|sinousoida]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l [[cam]] surfaces. Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical 'barrel' that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous cam, the segments formed by rotor, stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers. In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an axial engine, and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons. In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface, translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations. This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal pistons, ball joints and swash plate of a conventional 'barrel' engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces.[http://www.regtech.com/radmax_technology/]

In either form the axial or 'barrel' engine can be derived as a '''[[cam engine]]''' or '''[[Cam engine#Swashplate engine|swashplate]]''' or '''[[Cam engine#Wobble plate engine|wobble plate engine]]'''.

(A '''wobble-plate''' is similar to a [[Swashplate|swash plate]], in that the pistons press down on the plate in sequence, imparting a lateral moment that is translated into rotary motion. This motion can be simulated by placing a [[Compact Disc]] on a [[ball bearing]] at its centre and pressing down at progressive places around its circumference. The difference is that while a wobble plate [[wikt:nutate|nutates]]&lt;!-- it is actually something like [[precession]], but not a [[nutation]] in scientific parlance --&gt;, a swash-plate rotates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Self |first = Douglas |title = Axial Internal Combustion Engines |work= The Museum of Retro Technology

}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

While axial engines are challenging to make practicable at typical engine operating speeds some cam engines have been tested that offer extremely compact size (approximating to a six-inch (150mm) cube) yet producing approximately forty horsepower at c 7000 rpm, useful for light aerial applications. The attraction of lightweight and mechanically simple (far fewer major moving parts, in the form of a rotor plus twelve axial vanes forming twenty-four combustion chambers) engines, even with a finite working life, have obvious application for small unmanned aircraft. (Such a design having [http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Regi_Technologies:RadMax_rotary_engine allegedly been tested] at [[NAVAIR|NAVAIR PSEF]] in 2003.)

==History==

===Macomber===
[[File:Swashplate anim metal.gif|framed|right|Swashplate animation. Note that the swashplate is fastened to the shaft, so it rotates with it.]]

In 1911 the Macomber Rotary Engine Company of Los Angeles marketed one of the first axial internal-combustion engines, manufactured by the Avis Engine Company of [[Allston|Allston, Massachusetts]]. A four-stroke, air-cooled unit, it had seven cylinders and a variable compression ratio, altered by changing the wobble-plate angle and hence the length of piston stroke.&lt;ref name=pilotfriend&gt;{{cite web | title = Macomber aero engine | publisher = Pilotfriend | url = http://www.pilotfriend.com/aero_engines/aero_macomber.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called a "rotary engine", because the entire engine rotated apart from the end casings.

Ignition was supplied by a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[ignition magneto|magneto]] directly driven from the cam gears. The [[high voltage]] current was then taken to a fixed electrode on the front bearing case, from which the sparks would jump to the spark plugs in the cylinder heads as they passed within 1/16 inch (1.5&amp;nbsp;mm) from it. According to Macomber's literature, it was "guaranteed not to overheat".

The engine was claimed to be able to run at 150 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. At the normal speed of 1,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, it reportedly developed 50&amp;nbsp;hp. It weighed {{convert|230|lb|kg}} and it was {{convert|28|in|mm}} long by {{convert|19|in|mm}} in diameter.

Pioneer aviator [[Charles Francis Walsh]] flew an aircraft powered by a Macomber engine in May 1911, the "Walsh Silver Dart".&lt;ref name=walsh&gt;{{cite web | title = Charles F. Walsh | publisher = earlyaviators.com | url = http://www.earlyaviators.com/ewalsh4.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statax===
In 1913 Statax-Motor of [[Zürich]], Switzerland introduced a swashplate engine design. Only a single prototype was produced, which is currently held in the [[Science Museum, London]]. In 1914 the company moved to London to become the Statax Engine Company and planned on introducing a series of [[rotary engine]]s; a 3-cylinder of 10&amp;nbsp;hp, a 5-cylinder of 40&amp;nbsp;hp, a 7-cylinder of 80&amp;nbsp;hp, and a 10-cylinder of 100&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Angle | first = Glenn Dale | title = Airplane Engine Encyclopedia | publisher = Otterbein Press | year = 1921 | location = | url = | id = | isbn =| page = 468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears only the 40&amp;nbsp;hp design was ever produced, which was installed in a [[Caudron G.II]] for the British 1914 [[Aerial Derby]] but was withdrawn before the flight. Hansen introduced an all-aluminum version of this design in 1922, but it is not clear if they produced it in any quantity. Much improved versions were introduced by Statax's German division in 1929, producing 42&amp;nbsp;hp in a new [[sleeve valve]] version known as the ''29B''. Greenwood and Raymond of [[San Francisco]] acquired the patent rights for the US, Canada, and Japan, and planned a 5-cylinder of 100&amp;nbsp;hp and a 9-cylinder of 350&amp;nbsp;hp.

===Michell===
In 1917 [[Anthony Michell]] obtained patents for his swashplate engine design. Its unique feature was the means of transferring the load from the pistons to the swashplate, achieved using tilting slipper pads sliding on a film of oil. Another innovation by Michell was his mathematical analysis of the mechanical design, including the mass and motion of the components, so that his engines were in perfect dynamic balance at all speeds.

In 1920 Michell established the Crankless Engines Company in Fitzroy (Australia), and produced working prototypes of pumps, compressors, car engines and aero engines, all based on the same basic design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100480b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Engine designer  [[Phil Irving]] worked for the Crankless Engine Company before his time at [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD]].

A number of companies obtained a manufacturing licence for Michell’s design. The most successful of these was the British company Waller and Son, who produced gas boosters.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Michell crankless engine was the XB-4070, a diesel aircraft engine built for the United States Navy.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Consisting of 18 pistons, it was rated at 2000 horsepower and weighed 2150 pounds.

===John O. Almen===
Experimental barrel engines for aircraft use were built and tested by American John O. Almen of [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in the early 1920s, and by the mid-1920s the water-cooled ''Almen A-4'' (18 cylinders, two groups of nine each horizontally-opposed) had passed its [[United States Army Air Corps]] acceptance tests. However, it never entered production, reportedly due to limited funds and the Air Corps' growing emphasis on air-cooled [[radial engine]]s. The A-4 had much smaller frontal area than water-cooled engines of comparable power output, and thereby offered better streamlining possibilities. It was rated at 425 horsepower (317&amp;nbsp;kW), and weighed only 749 pounds (340&amp;nbsp;kg), thus giving a power/weight ratio of better than 1:2, a considerable design achievement at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fact Sheets &gt; Almen A-4 Barrel | publisher = [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] | url = http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=808 | accessdate = 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraclio Alfaro===
[[Heraclio Alfaro]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] aviator who was [[knight]]ed at the age of 18 by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] of Spain for designing, building, and flying Spain's first airplane. He developed a barrel engine for aircraft use which was later produced by the [[Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company]] as the ''Alfaro''. It was a perfect example of the "put in everything" design, as it included a [[sleeve valve]] system based on a rotating cylinder head, a design that never entered production on any engine. It was later developed further for use in the [[Doman LZ-5|Doman helicopter]] by Stephen duPont, son of the president of the Indian Motorcycle Company, who had been one of Alfaro's students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stephen | first = duPont | title = A 1911 Spanish Pilot and MIT Aeroengineer and his 1938 Aeroengine | publisher = TEBA Group | year = 2006 | location = | pages = | url = | id = | isbn = 0-9777134-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bristol===
The [[Bristol Axial Engine]] of the mid-1930s was designed by [[Charles Benjamin Redrup]] for the [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company]]; it was a 7-litre, 9-cylinder, wobble-plate type engine. It was originally conceived as a power unit for buses, possibly because its compact format would allow it to be installed beneath the vehicle's floor. The engine had a single rotary valve to control induction and exhaust. Several variants were used in Bristol buses during the late 1930s, the engine going through several versions from RR1 to RR4, which had a power output of 145&amp;nbsp;hp at 2900&amp;nbsp;rpm. Development was halted in 1936 following a change of management at the Bristol company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Setright | first = L.J.K. | authorlink =L. J. K.

===Wooler===
Perhaps the most refined of the designs was the British [[Wooler (motorcycles)|Wooler]] wobble-plate engine of 1947. This 6-cylinder engine was designed by John Wooler, better known as a motorcycle engine designer, for aircraft use. It was similar to the Bristol axial engine but had two wobble-plates, driven by 12 opposed pistons in 6 cylinders. The engine is often incorrectly referred to as a swashplate engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Herschel H. | title = Aircraft Piston Engines: From the Manly Baltzer to the Continental Tiara | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1981 | location = | pages = | url = | id = | isbn = 0-07-058472-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single example is preserved in the Aeroplane Gallery of the Science Museum, London.

===H.L.F. Trebert===
Some small barrel engines were produced by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120206032927/http://www.s363.com/HLFTEW/ H.L.F. Trebert Engine Works] of [[Rochester, New York]] for marine usage.

==Present day==

===Dyna-Cam===
The Dyna-Cam engine originally came from a design by the Blazer brothers, two [[Americans|American]] engineers in the [[brass era]]  automotive industry who worked for [[Studebaker]] in 1916. They sold the rights to Karl Herrmann, Studebaker's head of engineering, who developed the concept over many years, eventually taking out US patent 2237989 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Herrmann | first = Karl L. | title = US Patent number 2237989 | publisher = USPO | date = Apr 1941 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=oQ1oAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2237989 | accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 6 double-ended pistons working in 6 cylinders, and its 12 combustion chambers are fired every revolution of the drive shaft. The pistons drive a sine-shaped cam, as opposed to a swashplate or wobble-plate, hence its name.

In 1961, at the age of 80, Herrmann sold the rights to one of his employees, Edward Palmer, who set up the Dyna-Cam Engine Corp. along with son Dennis. Edward's son Dennis and daughter Pat then helped get the engine installed in a [[Piper PA-28 Cherokee|Piper Arrow]] airplane. The engine was flown for about 700 hours from 1987 through 1991. Their longest-life engine ran for nearly 4000 hours before overhaul. Dyna-Cam opened a research and development facility about 1993 and won many various awards from NASA, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, California Energy Commission, Air Quality Management District,{{Clarify | date=December 2015 | reason =Which one?  There are numerous AQMDs in California.  See [[List of California air districts]].}} and Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance for different variations of the same Dyna-Cam engine. About 40 prototype engines were built by the Herrmann Group and another 25 built by the Dyna-Cam Group since they acquired the engine and opened their shop. A new patent was granted to Dennis Palmer and Edward Palmer, first in 1985 and then several more around 2000 to Dennis Palmer. In 2003 the assets of the Dyna-Cam Engine Corporation were acquired by Aero-Marine Corporation, who changed their name to [[Axial Vector Engine Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axial Vector Engine Corporation Announces Resolution of Dyna-Cam Litigation |publisher=Axial Vector Engine Corporation |date=July 6, 2006 |url=http://www.axialvectorengine.com/press_release-30.html |accessdate=2008-07-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302143152/http://www.axialvectorengine.com/press_release-30.html |archivedate=2008-03-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Axial Vector then totally re-designed the cam engine. Axial Vector's new engine, like many of the others on this list, suffers from the "put in everything" problem, including [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] valves and ignition, ceramic cylinder liners with no piston rings, and a variety of other advanced features. It has little similarity to the original Herrmann and Dyna-Cam engines, since the Dyna-Cam engine used conventional valves, piston rings, accessories, had no unproven ceramic materials and actually flew in an aircraft and also powered a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} "Eliminator" ski boat for over four years.

===FairDiesel===
United Kingdom company FairDiesel Limited is designing two-stroke Diesel opposed piston barrel engines that use non-sinusoidal cams, for industrial applications and aviation use. Their engine designs range from a 2-cylinder, 80&amp;nbsp;mm bore to 32-cylinder, 160&amp;nbsp;mm bore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Two-Stroke Diesel Engines for Broad Application | publisher = FairDiesel Limited | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fairdiesel.co.uk/| accessdate = 2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duke Engines===
New Zealand company Duke Engines started in 1993 has created several different engines and installed one in a car in 1999. The engine runs a 5-cylinder, 3 litre, 4-stroke internal combustion engine platform with its unique axial arrangement, which is in its third generation.

===Cylindrical Energy Module===
The Cylindrical Energy Module is a sine-wave swashplate engine that can also be used as a standalone pump, powered by an external source. The rotating swashplate rotor assembly is moved back and forth with the help of piston drive pins, which follow a stationary [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] cam track that encircles the rotor assembly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Applications==
*The most well-known application is in [[torpedo]]es, where the cylindrical shape is desirable. The modern [[Mark 48 torpedo]] is powered by a 500&amp;nbsp;hp swashplate engine geared to a [[pump-jet]] propulsor. It is fueled by [[Otto fuel II]], a [[monopropellant]] that requires no oxygen supply and can propel the torpedo at up to {{convert|65|kn|km/h}} (74.56&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapons Systems, 1997-1998 | publisher = Naval Institute Press | year = 1997 | location = | url = | id = | isbn = 1-55750-268-4| page = 694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Backward wave oscillator.jpg|thumb|Miniature O-type backward-wave oscillator tube produced by Varian in 1956.  It could be voltage-tuned over an 8.2 - 12.4 GHz range and required a supply voltage of 600V.]]

[[File:Backward-wave Oszillator-Stockholm.jpg|thumb|Backward wave oscillator at Stockholm University operating in the terahertz range|alt=]]
A '''backward wave oscillator''' ('''BWO'''), also called '''carcinotron''' (a trade name for tubes manufactured by [[Thomson-CSF|CSF]], now [[Thales Group|Thales]]) or '''backward wave tube''', is a [[vacuum tube]] that is used to generate [[microwaves]] up to the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] range. It belongs to the [[traveling-wave tube]] family. It is an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] with a wide electronic tuning range.

An [[electron gun]] generates an [[electron beam]] that is interacting with a slow-wave structure. It sustains the [[oscillation]]s by propagating a traveling wave backwards against the beam. The generated [[electromagnetic wave]] power has its [[group velocity]] directed oppositely to the direction of motion of the electrons. The output power is coupled out near the electron gun.

It has two main subtypes, the '''M-type'''  ('''M-BWO'''), the most powerful,  and the '''O-type''' ('''O-BWO'''). The output [[Power (physics)|power]] of the O-type is typically in the range of 1 [[Watt|mW]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;GHz to 50&amp;nbsp;mW at 200 [[Hertz|GHz]]. Carcinotrons are used as powerful and stable microwave sources. Due to the good quality [[wavefront]] they produce (see below), they find use as illuminators in [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] imaging.

The backward wave oscillators were demonstrated in 1951, '''M-type''' by [[Bernard Epsztein]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{citeref patent|country=FR|number= 1035379 |inventor=Bernard Epsztein|pubdate=1959-03-31|title=Backward flow travelling wave devices|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and '''O-type''' by [[Rudolf Kompfner]]. The M-type BWO is a voltage-controlled non-resonant extrapolation of [[magnetron]] interaction. Both types are tunable over a wide range of frequencies by varying the accelerating [[voltage]]. They can be swept through the band fast enough to be appearing to radiate over all the band at once, which makes them suitable for effective [[radar jamming]], quickly tuning into the radar frequency. Carcinotrons allowed airborne radar jammers to be highly effective. However, [[frequency-agile]] [[radar]]s can hop frequencies fast enough to force the jammer to use [[barrage jamming]], diluting its output power over a wide band and significantly impairing its efficiency.

Carcinotrons are used in research, civilian and military applications. For example, the Czechoslovak air defense detection systems [[Kopac passive sensor]] and [[Ramona passive sensor]] employed carcinotrons in their receiver systems.

==Basic concept==
[[File:Backward Wave Oscillator.jpg|thumb|[Basic Concept Figure] The signals travel from the input to the output as described in text within the image.&lt;ref name="NEET" /&gt;]]
All travelling-wave tubes operate in the same general fashion, and differ primarily in details of their construction.

The concept is dependent on a  steady stream of [[electron]]s from an [[electron gun]] that travel down the center of the tube (see [Basic Concept Figure] on the left). Surrounding the electron beam is some sort of [[radio frequency]] source signal; in the case of the traditional [[klystron]] this is a resonant cavity fed with an external signal, whereas in more modern devices there are a series of these cavities or a helical metal wire fed with the same signal.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

As the electrons travel down the tube, they will interact with the RF signal (see [Basic Concept Figure] on the left). The electrons will be attracted to areas with maximum positive bias and repelled from negative areas. This causes the electrons to "bunch up" as they are repelled or attracted along the length of the tube, a process known as ''velocity modulation''. This process makes the electron beam take on the same general structure as the original signal; the density of the electrons in the beam matches the relative amplitude of the RF signal in the induction system. The result is a signal in the electron beam that is an amplified version of the original RF signal.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

As the electrons are moving, they will induce a magnetic field in any nearby conductor as illustrated in the Basic Concept Figure. This allows the now-amplified signal to be extracted. In systems like the magnetron or klystron, this is accomplished with another resonant cavity. In the helical designs, this process occurs along the entire length of the tube, reinforcing the original signal in the helical conductor. The "problem" with traditional designs is that they have relatively narrow bandwidths; designs based on resonators will work with signals within 10% or 20% of their design, as this is physically built into the resonator design, while the helix designs have a much wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], perhaps 100% on either side of the design peak.&lt;ref name="Gilmour"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BWO==
The BWO is built in a fashion similar to the helical TWT. However, instead of the RF signal propagating in the same (or similar) direction as the electron beam, the original signal travels at right angles to the beam. This is normally accomplished by drilling a hole through a rectangular waveguide and shooting the beam through the hole. The waveguide then goes through two right angle turns, forming a C-shape and crossing the beam again. This basic pattern is repeated along the length of the tube so the waveguide passes across the beam several times, forming a series of S-shapes.&lt;ref name=NEET&gt;{{cite book |url=http://electriciantraining.tpub.com/14183/css/The-Magnetron-103.htm |title=Microwave Principles |page=103 |publisher=US Navy |date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original RF signal enters from what would be the far end of the TWT, where the energy would be extracted. The effect of the signal on the passing beam causes the same velocity modulation effect, but because of the direction of the RF signal and specifics of the waveguide, this modulation travels backward along the beam, instead of forward. This propagation, the ''slow-wave'', reaches the next hole in the folded waveguide just as the same phase of the RF signal does. This causes amplification just like the traditional TWT.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

The difference in the two systems is that in the TWT the speed of propagation in the helix has to be similar to that of the electrons in the beam. This is not the case in the BWO. The waveguide places strict limits on the bandwidth of the signal and sets its propagation speed as a basic function of its construction, but the speed of the signal induced into the electron beam is relative to the speed of the electrons. That means the frequency of the output signal can be changed by changing the speed of the electrons, which is easily accomplished by changing the voltage of the electron gun.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

==Carcinotron==
[[File:Carcinotron jamming a pulse radar unit.png|thumb|This image shows the effect of four carcinotron-carrying aircraft on a typical 1950s pulse radar. The aircraft are located at roughly the 4 and 5:30 locations. The display is filled with noise any time the antenna's main lobe or sidelobes pass the jammer, rendering the aircraft invisible.]]

The device was originally given the name "carcinotron" because it was like [[cancer]] to existing [[radar]] systems. By simply changing the supply voltage, the device could produce any required frequency across a band that was much larger than any existing microwave amplifier could match - the [[cavity magnetron]] and [[klystron]] worked at a single frequency defined by the physical dimensions of their resonators, and could be tuned only within a small range of that design.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

Previously, jamming a radar was a complex and time-consuming operation. Operators had to listen for potential frequencies being used, set up one of a bank of amplifiers on that frequency, and then begin broadcasting. When the radar station realized what was happening, they would change their frequencies and the process would begin again.

In contrast, the carcinotron could sweep through all the possible frequencies so rapidly that it appeared to be a constant signal on all of the frequencies at once. Typical designs could generate hundreds or low thousands of watts, so at any one frequency, there might be a few watts of power. However, at long range the amount of energy from the original radar that reaches the aircraft is only a few watts anyway, so the carcinotron can overpower them.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

The system was so powerful that it was found that a carcinotron operating on an aircraft would begin to be effective even before it rose above the [[radar horizon]]. As it swept through the frequencies it would broadcast on the radar's own pulse frequency at what were effectively random times, filling the display with random dots any time the antenna was pointed near it, perhaps 3 degrees on either side of the target. There were so many dots that the display simply filled with white noise in that area. As it approached the station, the signal would also begin to appear in the antennas [[sidelobe]]s, creating further areas that were blanked out by noise. At close range, on the order of {{convert|100|miles}}, the entire [[radar display]] would be completely filled with noise, rendering it useless.&lt;ref name=NEET/&gt;

The concept was so powerful as a [[Radar jamming and deception|jammer]] that there were serious concerns that ground-based radars were obsolete. Airborne radars had the advantage that they could approach the aircraft carrying the jammer, and, eventually, the huge output from their transmitter would "burn through" the jamming. However, interceptors of the era relied on ground direction to get into range. This represented an enormous threat to air defense operations.&lt;ref name=CandR/&gt;

For ground radars, the threat was eventually solved in two ways. The first was that radars were upgraded to operate on many different frequencies and switch among them randomly from pulse to pulse, a concept now known as [[frequency agility]]. Some of these frequencies were never used in peacetime, and highly secret, with the hope that they would not be known to the jammer in wartime. The carcinotron could still sweep through the entire band, but then it would be broadcasting on the same frequency as the radar only at random times, reducing its effectiveness. The other solution was to add passive receivers that triangulated on the carcinotron broadcasts, allowing the ground stations to produce accurate tracking information on the location of the jammer and allowing them to be attacked.&lt;ref name=CandR&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

== The slow-wave structure ==
[[Image:Space-harmonics.svg|thumb|250px|(a) Forward fundamental space harmonic (n=0),
(b) Backward fundamental]]

The needed slow-wave structures must support a [[radio frequency]] (RF) electric field with a longitudinal component; the structures are periodic in the direction of the beam and behave like microwave filters with passbands and stopbands. Due to the periodicity of the geometry, the fields are identical from cell to cell except for a constant phase shift Φ.
This phase shift, a purely real number in a passband of a lossless structure, varies with frequency.
According to Floquet's theorem (see [[Floquet theory]]), the RF electric field E(z,t) can be described at an [[angular frequency]] ω, by a sum of an infinity of "spatial or space harmonics" E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E(z,t) =\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} {E_n}e^{j({\omega}t-{k_n}z)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[wavenumber|wave number]] or propagation constant k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of each harmonic is expressed as

:k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (Φ + 2nπ) / p   (-π &lt; Φ &lt; +π)

z being the direction of propagation, p the pitch of the circuit and n an integer.

Two examples of slow-wave circuit characteristics are shown, in the ω-k or [[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin]] diagram:

* on figure (a), the fundamental n=0 is a forward space harmonic (the [[phase velocity]] v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=ω/k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; has the same sign as the [[group velocity]] v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=dω/dk&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), synchronism condition for backward interaction is at point B, intersection of the line of slope v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - the beam velocity - with the first backward (n = -1) space harmonic,
* on figure (b) the fundamental (n=0) is backward

A periodic structure can support both forward and backward space harmonics, which are not modes of the field, and cannot exist independently, even if a beam can be coupled to only one of them.

As the magnitude of the space harmonics decreases rapidly when the value of n is large, the interaction can be significant only with the fundamental or the first space harmonic.

== M-type BWO ==
[[Image:M-bwo.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic of an M-BWO]]
The '''M-type carcinotron''', or '''M-type backward wave oscillator''', uses crossed static electric field E and [[magnetic field]] B, similar to the [[magnetron]], for focussing an electron sheet beam drifting perpendicularly to E and B, along a slow-wave circuit, with a velocity E/B. Strong interaction occurs when the [[phase velocity]] of one space harmonic of the wave is equal to the electron velocity. Both E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; components of the RF field are involved in the interaction (E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; parallel to the static E field). Electrons which are in a decelerating E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; electric field of the slow-wave, lose the [[potential energy]] they have in the static electric field E and reach the circuit. The sole electrode is more negative than the cathode, in order to avoid collecting those electrons having gained energy while interacting with the slow-wave space harmonic.

== O-type BWO ==
The '''O-type carcinotron''', or '''O-type backward wave oscillator''', uses an electron beam  longitudinally focused by a magnetic field, and a slow-wave circuit interacting with the beam. A collector collects the beam at the end of the tube.

===O-BWO spectral purity and noise ===
The BWO is a voltage tunable oscillator, whose voltage tuning rate is directly related to the propagation characteristics of the circuit. The oscillation starts at a frequency where the wave propagating on the circuit is synchronous with the slow space charge wave of the beam. Inherently the BWO is more sensitive than other oscillators to external fluctuations. Nevertheless, its ability to be phase- or frequency-locked has been demonstrated, leading to successful operation as a heterodyne local oscillator.

==== Frequency stability ====
The frequency–voltage sensitivity, is given by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;f/f = 1/2 [1/(1 + |v&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;|)] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)
The oscillation frequency is also sensitive to the beam current (called "frequency pushing"). The current fluctuations at low frequencies are mainly due to the anode voltage supply, and the sensitivity to the anode voltage is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;f/f = 3/4 [ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;/ω/(1 + |v&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;|)] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)

This sensitivity as compared to the cathode voltage sensitivity, is reduced by the ratio ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;/ω, where ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular plasma frequency; this ratio is of the order of a few times 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==== Noise ====
Measurements on submillimeter-wave BWO's (de Graauw et al., 1978) have shown that a signal-to-noise ratio of 120&amp;nbsp;dB per MHz could be expected in this wavelength range. In heterodyne detection using a BWO as a local oscillator, this figure corresponds to a [[noise temperature]] added by the oscillator of only 1000–3000&amp;nbsp;K.

The '''Bavaria Solarpark''' is a group of three [[photovoltaic power station]]s in different locations in Germany. 
Its total [[Nameplate capacity|capacity]] amounts to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) and consists of the following distinct solar farms south of [[Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz]], in [[Bavaria]]:
* The 6.3 MW '''Solarpark Mühlhausen''' 
* The 1.9 MW '''Solarpark Günching'''
* The 1.9 MW '''Solarpark Minihof'''

The Bavaria Solarpark was constructed and is operated by the American company [[SunPower]]. 
It consists of 57,600 [[solar panels]] (model ''PowerLight NT-5AE3D'' by Sharp) mounted on SunPower's [[solar tracker]]s and covers a total area of 40 hectares (99 acres).&lt;ref name="sun power"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunpowercorp.com/For-Power-Plants/~/media/Downloads/for_powerplants/SPWRBavaria_CS.ashx |title=The Bavaria Solarpark |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026154927/http://www.sunpowercorp.com/For-Power-Plants/~/media/Downloads/for_powerplants/SPWRBavaria_CS.ashx |archivedate=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Inaugurated on 30 June 2005, the solar farm was grid-connected six months later in December 2005. 
For a few months, the Solarpark Mühlhausen was the [[List of photovoltaic power stations#World's largest photovoltaic power stations|world's largest photovoltaic power station]].

'''Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron''' ({{IPA-fr|klapɛʁɔ̃|lang}}; 26 February 1799 – 28 January 1864) was a [[France|French]] [[engineer]] and [[physicist]], one of the founders of [[thermodynamics]].

==Life==
Born in [[Paris]], Clapeyron studied at the [[École polytechnique]], graduating in 1818.&lt;ref name=MK&gt;Milton Kerker (1960) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226506 Sadi Carnot and the Steam Engine Engineers], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] 51: 257–70 via [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at [[École des mines]]. In 1820 he and [[Gabriel Lamé]] went to [[Saint Petersburg]] to teach and work at the school of public works there. He returned to Paris only after the [[Revolution of July 1830]], supervising the construction of the first [[railway]] line connecting Paris to [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] and [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]].&lt;ref name=MK/&gt;
The half brothers [[Stéphane Mony]] and [[Eugène Flachat]] collaborated in this project, which was financed by Adolphe d'Eichthal&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Adolphe d'Eichthal|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;, [[James Mayer de Rothschild|Rothschild]], Auguste Thurneyssen, Sanson Davillier and the Péreire brothers (Émile&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Émile Pereire|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; and Isaac&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Isaac Pereire|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |language=fr |ref={{harvid |Christophe Stéphane Mony ... Annales}}

Clapeyron took his [[steam engine]] designs to England in 1836 to find a manufacturer and engaged [[Sharp, Roberts and Co.]].&lt;ref name=MK/&gt;

From 1844 to 1859 Clapyron was a professor at [[Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees]].&lt;ref name=MK/&gt;

Clapeyron married Mélanie Bazaine, daughter of [[Pierre-Dominique Bazaine]] (mathematician and [[ingénieur des ponts]]), and older sister of [[Pierre-Dominique (Adolphe) Bazaine]] (railway engineer) and [[Francois Achille Bazaine]] (Marshal of France).

==Work==
In 1834, he made his first contribution to the creation of modern thermodynamics by publishing a report entitled ''Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur'' (''Memoir on the Motive Power of Heat''), in which he developed the work of the physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], deceased two years before. Though Carnot had developed a compelling analysis of a generalised [[heat engine]], he had employed the clumsy and already unfashionable [[caloric theory]].

Clapeyron, in his memoire, presented Carnot's work in a more accessible and analytic graphical form, showing the [[Carnot cycle]] as a closed [[curve]] on an [[indicator diagram]], a [[chart]] of [[pressure]] against [[volume]] (named in his honor '''Clapeyron's graph'''). Clapeyron's analysis of Carnot was more broadly disseminated in 1843 when [[Johann Poggendorff]] translated it into German.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] 59: 446&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842 Clapeyron published his findings on the "optimal position for the piston at which the various [[piston valve (steam engine)|valves]] should be opened or closed."&lt;ref name=MK/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapeyron (1842) "Mémoir sur le règlement des tiroirs dans la machines à vapeur", [[Comptes Rendus]] 14: 632&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, Clapeyron further developed the idea of a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]], already suggested by Carnot and made a definitive statement of ''Carnot's principle'', what is now known as the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

These foundations enabled him to make substantive extensions of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius']] work, including the formula, now known as the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], which characterises the [[phase transition]] between two [[phase (matter)|phase]]s of [[matter]]. He further considered questions of phase transitions in what later became known as [[Stefan problem]]s.

Clapeyron also worked on the characterisation of [[perfect gas]]es, the [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of homogeneous [[solid]]s, and calculations of the [[statics]] of continuous [[Beam (structure)|beams]], notably the [[theorem of three moments]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Beams/Continuous_Beams.html Three Moments Theorem]&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Clapeyron's [[theorem]]''').

'''Brine rejection''' is a process that occurs when salty water freezes. The salts do not fit in the crystal structure of water [[ice]], so the salt is expelled.

Since the oceans are salty, this process is important in nature. Salt rejected by the forming [[sea ice]] drains into the surrounding [[seawater]], creating saltier, denser [[brine]]. The denser brine sinks, influencing [[ocean circulation]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ice Thickness vs. Average Salinity.gif|thumb|Average salinity of sea ice as a function of ice thickness for cold sea ice sampled during the growth season. The standard error of the estimate is 1.5‰ for thin ice and 0.6‰ for thick ice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=G. F. N.|last2=Weeks|first2=W. F.|date=1974-01-01|title=Salinity Variations in Sea Ice|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/salinity-variations-in-sea-ice/0976B42E5B21CAE25BE26A0DD811513F/core-reader|journal=Journal of Glaciology|volume=13|issue=67|pages=109–120|doi=10.1017/S0022143000023418|issn=0022-1430|bibcode=1974JGlac..13..109C}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As water reaches the temperature where it begins to crystallize and form ice, salt ions are rejected from the lattices within the ice and either forced out into the surrounding water, or trapped among the ice crystals in pockets called brine cells. Generally, sea ice has a salinity ranging from 0 psu at the surface to 4 psu at the base.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The faster that this [[freezing]] process occurs, the more brine cells are left in the ice. Once the ice reaches a critical thickness, roughly 15&amp;nbsp;cm, the concentration of salt [[ions]] in the liquid around the ice begins to increase, as leftover brine is rejected from the cells.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; This increase is associated with the appearance of strong convective plumes, which flow from channels and within the ice and carry a significant salt flux. The brine that drains from the newly formed ice is replaced by a weak flow of relatively fresh water, from the liquid region below it. The new water partially freezes within the pores of the ice, increasing the solidity of the ice.

As sea ice ages and thickens, the initial salinity of the ice decreases due to the rejection of brine over time [Fig. 2].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; While the sea ice ages, [[desalinization]] occurs to such a degree that some multiyear ice has a [[salinity]] of less than 1 [[Practical salinity unit|PSU]].&lt;ref name="descriptive_physical"&gt;Talley L.D., Pickard G.L., Emery W.J., Swift J.H., 2011. Descriptive Physical Oceanography: An Introduction (Sixth Edition), Elsevier, Boston, 560 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs in three different ways:
*'''solute diffusion''' - this depends on the fact that brine inclusions trapped in ice will begin to migrate toward the warmer end of the ice block. The ice block is warmest at the water-ice interface, thus pushing the brine out into the water surrounding the ice.&lt;ref name=salt_rejection&gt;Lake R.A., Lewis E.L. (1970), Salt rejection by sea ice during growth. J. Geophys. Res. 75, 583-597.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[gravity]] drainage''' - Gravity drainage involves the movement of brine due to differences in density between brine in the interior of the ice and brine in the seawater outside of the ice, which occurs due to the development of a buoyancy driven convection system.&lt;ref name="natural_convection"&gt;Wettlaufer J.S., Worster M.G., Huppert H.E. (1997). Natural convection during solidification of an alloy from above with application to evolution of sea ice. J. Fluid. Mech. 344 291-316.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''expulsion''' - the migration of brine due to cracking produced by thermal expansion of the ice, or pressure caused by the increased volume of the newly formed ice.&lt;ref name=salt_rejection/&gt;

==Role in deep water formation and the thermohaline circulation==
[[File:Climatology 81-10 min-max conc tmb.png|thumb|Arctic and Antarctic sea ice concentration climatology from 1981-2010, at the approximate seasonal maximum and minimum levels based on passive microwave satellite data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|title=Arctic vs. Antarctic {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|website=nsidc.org|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Brine rejection occurs in the sea [[ice pack]]s around at the north and south poles of the earth [Fig. 3]{{clarify|date=October 2017}}. The [[Arctic Ocean]] has historically ranged from roughly 14-16 million square kilometers in late winter to roughly 7 million square kilometers each September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/index.html|title=All About Sea Ice {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|website=nsidc.org|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual increase of ice plays a major role in the movement of ocean circulation and deep water formation. The density of the water below the newly formed ice increases due to the brine rejection. Saltier water can also become colder without freezing.

The dense waters that form in the Arctic are called [[North Atlantic Deep Water]]s (NADW), while the [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW) forms in the southern hemisphere. These two areas of brine rejection play an important role in the [[thermohaline circulation]] of all of earth's oceans.

==Brinicles==
As sea ice freezes, it rejects increasingly salty water, which drains through narrow brine channels that thread through the ice. The brine flowing through the brine channels and out of the bottom of the ice is very cold and salty, so it sinks in the warmer, fresher seawater under the ice, forming a [[plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]]. The plume is colder than the freezing point of sea water under the ice, so the seawater can freeze where it touches the plume. Ice freezing around the edges of the plume gradually builds a hollow icicle-like tube, called a [[brinicle]]. These frozen [[stalactite]]-like forms are fragile during early stages, but if brine drainage ceases, they may freeze solid. In calm waters, brinicles can reach the sea floor, freezing it fairly abruptly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/15835017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
The deep ocean basins are [[stratified flows|stably stratified]], so mixing of surface waters with the deep ocean waters occurs only very slowly. The dissolved [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the surface waters of the ocean is roughly in equilibrium with the [[partial pressure]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere. As atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels are rising, the [[ocean acidification|oceans are absorbing]] some CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. When surface waters sink, they carry considerable amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the deep oceans, away from the atmosphere. Because these waters are able to contain a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, they have helped slow the rise in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations]], thus slowing some aspects of [[climate change]].

Climate change could have different effects on ice melt and brine rejection. Previous studies have suggested that as [[ice cover]] thins, it will become a weaker insulator, resulting in larger ice production during the autumn and winter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Holland M.M., Bitz C.,Tremblay B. (2006), Future abrupt reductions in the summer Arctic sea ice. Geophys. Res. Letters. 33, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent increase in winter brine rejection will drive ocean ventilation, and strengthen the inflow of warm [[Atlantic]] waters. Studies of the last [[glacial maximum]] (LGM) have indicated that a drastic reduction in the production of sea ice and thus reduction of brine rejection, would result in the weakening of the stratification in the global deep oceans and in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release into the shallow oceans and the atmosphere, triggering global deglaciation.&lt;ref name="life_hung"&gt;Thatje S., Hillenbrand C.D., Mackensen A., Larter R. (2008) Life hung by a thread: endurance of Antarctic fauna in glacial periods. Ecology. Mar;89(3) 682-692. {{PMID|18459332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in channels and surrounding waters==
Life in sea ice is energetically demanding, and sets limits at any hierarchical organizational, and organismic level, ranging from [[molecules]] to everything that an organism does.{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="life_hung"/&gt; Despite this fact, the brine-containing interstices and pockets found in sea ice host a variety of organisms, including [[bacteria]], [[autotrophic]] and heterotrophic [[protists]], [[microalgae]], and [[metazoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Giannelli V., Thomas D. N., Haas C., Kattner G., Kennedy H., Dieckmann G.S. (2001), Behaviour of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients during experimental sea-ice formation, Ann.

'''Carambola''', or '''star fruit''', is the fruit of ''[[Averrhoa carambola]]'', a species of tree native to [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and throughout [[Malesia]].&lt;ref name="cabi"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Averrhoa carambola''  (carambola) |url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/8082 |publisher=CABI |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit is commonly consumed throughout [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], [[Micronesia]], and parts of [[East Asia]]. The tree is cultivated throughout non-indigenous tropical areas.

The fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually five but can sometimes vary); when cut in cross-section, it resembles a star, hence its name.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The entire fruit is edible and is usually eaten out of hand. They may also be used in cooking and can be made into [[relish]]es, preserves, and juice drinks.

==Origins and distribution==
{{Main article|Averrhoa carambola}}
[[File:Carambolas765pt.jpg|thumb|Sliced carambolas having 7, 6, and the usual 5 points]]
The original range of ''Averrhoa carambola'' is believed to be from [[Sri Lanka]] or [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; but has been cultivated in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]] for hundreds of years. They remain a local favorite in those areas but have also recently gained popularity in parts of [[East Asia]] and [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]; as well as in the Pacific Islands, particularly [[Tahiti]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Guam]]. They are cultivated commercially in [[India]], Southeast Asia, southern [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and the southern [[United States]]. They are also grown in [[Central America]], the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Florida]], and parts of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt; In other areas they are usually grown as ornamentals, rather than for consumption.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

==Description==
The fruit is about {{convert|2|to|6|in|cm|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} in length and is an oval shape. It usually has five prominent longitudinal ridges, but in rare instances it can have as few as four or as many as eight. In cross section, it resembles a star.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; The skin is thin, smooth, and waxy and turns a light to dark yellow when ripe. The flesh is translucent and light yellow to yellow in color. Each fruit can have 10 to 12 flat light brown seeds about {{convert|0.25|to|0.5|in|mm|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} in width and enclosed in gelatinous [[aril]]. Once removed from the fruit, they lose viability within a few days.&lt;ref name="crfg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crane"&gt;{{Cite book|author =Jonathan H.

Like the closely related [[bilimbi]], there are two main types of carambola: the small sour (or tart) type and the larger sweet type. The sour varieties have a higher [[oxalic acid]] content than the sweet type. A number of cultivars have been developed in recent years. The most common cultivars grown commercially include the sweet types "Arkin" ([[Florida]]), "Dah Pon" ([[Taiwan]]), "Ma fueng" ([[Thailand]]), "Maha" ([[Malaysia]]), and "Demak" ([[Indonesia]]) and the sour types "Golden Star", "Newcomb", "Star King", and "Thayer" (all from Florida). Some of the sour varieties like "Golden Star" can become sweet if allowed to ripen.&lt;ref name="jm"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Julia F. Morton|editor =Julia F.

The entire fruit is edible, including the slightly waxy skin. The flesh is crunchy, firm, and extremely juicy.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; It does not contain fibers and has a texture similar in consistency to that of [[grape]]s. Carambolas are best consumed shortly after they ripen, when they are yellow with a light shade of green or just after all traces of green have disappeared. They will also have brown ridges at the edges and feel firm. Fruits picked while still slightly green will turn yellow in storage at room temperature, but will not increase in sugar content. Overripe carambola will be yellow with brown spots and can become blander in taste and soggier in consistency.&lt;ref name="crane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/star-fruit-how-to-eat-star-fruit.html|title=How to Eat Star Fruit|publisher=Buzzle|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripe sweet type carambolas are sweet without being overwhelming as they rarely have more than 4% sugar content. They have a tart, sour undertone, and an oxalic acid odor. The taste is difficult to match, but it has been compared to a mix of [[apple]], [[pear]], [[grape]], and [[Rutaceae|citrus family]] fruits. Unripe star fruits are firmer and sour, and taste like green apples.&lt;ref name="crfg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fg"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://floridagardener.com/pom/Carambola.htm |title=Carambola or Star Fruit |publisher=FloridaGardener.com |accessdate=August 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727003227/http://www.floridagardener.com/pom/Carambola.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripe carambolas may also be used in cooking. In Southeast Asia, they are usually stewed in [[clove]]s and sugar, sometimes with [[apple]]s. In China, they are cooked with fish. In Australia, they may be cooked as a vegetable, pickled, or made into jams. In [[Jamaica]] they are sometimes dried.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

Unripe and sour type carambolas can be mixed with other chopped spices to make relishes in Australia.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt; In the Philippines, unripe carambolas are eaten dipped in [[rock salt]].&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/balimbing-carambola-star-fruit|title=Balimbing / Carambola / Star Fruit|publisher=Market Manila|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, they are cooked together with shrimp.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

The juice from carambolas is also used in iced drinks, particularly the juice of the sour varieties. In the Philippines they can be used as seasoning. In India, the juice is bottled for drinking.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

==Nutrition==
Raw carambola fruit is 91% water, 7% [[carbohydrate]]s, 1% [[protein]], and has negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, raw fruit supplies 31 [[calorie]]s and is mainly devoid of significant [[micronutrient]] content, except for [[vitamin C]] at 41% of the [[Daily Value]].

==Risks==
Carambolas contain [[caramboxin]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garcia-Cairasco | first1 = N. | last2 = Moyses-Neto | first2 = M. | last3 = Del Vecchio | first3 = F. | last4 = Oliveira | first4 = J.

===Drug interactions===
Like the [[grapefruit]], carambola is considered to be a potent inhibitor of seven [[cytochrome P450]] isoforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hktmc.com/ChineseMedia/Magazine/Medicine/ajdmpk/AJDMPK-2006-3/asian6-3(248-261)(DM).doc |title=Abstracts: Metabolism and metabolic enzymes studies for the 8th National Congress on Drug and Xenobiotic Metabolism in China |access-date=2007-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013636/http://www.hktmc.com/ChineseMedia/Magazine/Medicine/ajdmpk/AJDMPK-2006-3/asian6-3(248-261)(DM).doc |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/full/40/7/1472-a Potential Drug-Food Interactions with Pomegranate Juice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321221751/http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/full/40/7/1472-a |date=March 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are significant in the [[drug metabolism|first-pass elimination]] of many medications, and, thus, the consumption of carambola or its juice in combination with certain prescription medications can significantly increase their effective dosage within the body.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Carambola star fruit at organic food mela Bangalore Karnataka India.jpg|right|thumb|Unripe Indian carambola]]
The carambola is a tropical and subtropical fruit which can be grown at elevations up to {{convert|4,000|ft|order=flip|abbr=off}}. It prefers full sun exposure, but requires enough humidity and annual rainfall of at least {{convert|70|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}. It does not have a soil type preference, but requires good drainage.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Carambola trees are planted at least {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} from each other and typically are fertilized three times a year.  The tree grows rapidly and typically produces fruit at four or five years of age. The large amount of rain during spring actually reduces the amount of fruit, but, in ideal conditions, carambola can produce from {{convert|200|to|400|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=off|-1}} of fruit a year. The carambola tree flowers throughout the year, with main fruiting seasons from April to June and October to December in Malaysia,&lt;ref name="ippc"&gt;{{Cite book|author =Crop Protection &amp; Plant Quarantine Services Division|title =Technical Document for Market Access on Star Fruit (Carambola)|publisher =The Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, Malaysia|year =2004|url =https://www.ippc.int/file_uploaded/1115281083940_Technical_Document_Carambola.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, but fruiting also occurs at other times in some other locales, such as South Florida.&lt;ref name="crane"/&gt;

Growth and leaf responses of container-grown `Arkin' carambola (''Averrhoa carambola'' L.) trees to long-term exposure of 25%, 50%, or 100% sunlight showed that shading increased [[rachis]] length and leaflet area, decreased leaflet thickness, and produced more horizontal branch orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marler|first=Thomas E.|last2=Schaffer|first2=Bruce|last3=Crane|first3=Jonathan H.|date=1994-07-01|title=Developmental Light Level Affects Growth, Morphology, and Leaf Physiology of Young Carambola Trees|url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/119/4/711|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=711–718|issn=0003-1062}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Major pests are [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], fruit moths, ants, and birds.&lt;ref name="crfg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ippc"/&gt; Crops are also susceptible to frost.&lt;ref name="crfg"/&gt;

Top producers of carambola in the world market include Australia, [[Guyana]], India, [[Israel]], [[Malaysia]], the Philippines, Taiwan, and the United States.&lt;ref name="crane"/&gt; Malaysia is a global leader in star fruit production by volume and ships the product widely to Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name="ippc"/&gt; Due to concerns over pests and pathogens, however, whole star fruits cannot yet be imported to the US from Malaysia under current [[United States Department of Agriculture]] regulations. In the United States, carambolas are grown in tropical and semitropical areas, including Texas, South Carolina, Louisiana, California, Virginia, Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bilj"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bijlmakers.com/fruits/starfruit.htm|title=Star Fruit|author=Hein Bijlmakers|publisher=Tropical Fruits|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, commercial cultivation and broad consumer acceptance of the fruit only dates to the 1970s, attributable to [[Morris Arkin]], a backyard [[horticultural]]ist, in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. The 'Arkin' variety represented 98% of the acreage in South Florida in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Robert J. Knight|author2=Jonathan H. Crane|year=2002|title=The 'Arkin' Carambola in Florida|journal=Proc. Fla. State Hort. Soc.|volume=115|pages=92–93|url=http://www.fshs.org/Proceedings/Password%20Protected/2002%20Vol.%20115/92-93(Knight).pdf}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The trees are also grown as ornamentals for their abundant brightly colored and unusually shaped fruits, as well as for their attractive dark green leaves and their lavender to pink flowers.&lt;ref name="crane"/&gt;  

Like the [[bilimbi]], the juice of the more acidic sour types can be used to clean [[rust]]y or [[tarnish]]ed metal (especially [[brass]]) as well as bleach rust stains from cloth. They may also be used as a [[mordant]] in [[dye]]ing.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

==Etymology and vernacular names==
The Portuguese word ''carambola'', first known use 1598, was taken from Marathi ''karambal'' derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''karmaphala''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carambola|title=Carambola - Definition of carambola by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carambola is known under different names in different countries. It should not be confused with the closely related [[bilimbi]], with which it shares some common names. It is also called "star fruit" in English (including [[Jamaican English]] and [[Philippine English]]) and literally translates into ''Stjernefrugt'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''Sternfrucht'' in [[German language|German]], and ''Stjärnfrukt'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is known as ''carambola'', ''carambolo'', ''tamarindo chino'', ''tamarindo culí'', ''balimbín'' ([[Philippine Spanish]], from Tagalog ''balimbing'', plural is ''balimbines''), and ''fruta china'' ([[Ecuador]]). In [[maritime Southeast Asia]], it is known as ''belimbing'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] and ''balimbíng'' or ''saranate'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

'''Coated paper''' is [[paper]] which has been [[coating|coated]] by a mixture of materials or a [[polymer]] to impart certain qualities to the paper, including weight, surface gloss, smoothness or reduced ink absorbency. Various materials, including [[Kaolinite]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[Bentonite]], and [[talc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperonweb.com/grade.htm#c|title=Grades of Paper|website=paperonweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to coat paper for high quality printing used in [[packaging industry]] and in magazines. The [[chalk]] or [[china clay]] is bound to the paper with synthetic viscosifiers, such as [[styrene-butadiene]] [[latex]]es and natural organic binders such as [[starch]]. The coating formulation may also contain chemical additives as dispersants, [[resin]]s, or [[polyethylene]] to give water resistance and [[wet strength]] to the paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Cartons, crates and corrugated board: handbook of paper and wood packaging technology | author = Diana Twede and Susan E.

=== Machine-finished coated paper ===

''Machine-finished coated paper'' (MFC) has a [[Paper density|basis weight]] of 48–80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They have good surface properties, high print gloss and adequate sheet stiffness. MFC papers are made of 60–85% [[Pulp (paper)|groundwood]] or [[Thermo mechanical pulp|TMP]] and 15–40% chemical pulp with a total [[pigment]] content of 20–30%.

=== Coated fine paper ===

''Coated fine paper'' or ''woodfree coated paper'' (WFC) are primarily produced for [[offset printing]]:&lt;ref name=WFC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 38–39 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Standard coated fine papers: This paper quality is normally used for [[advertising material]]s, [[books]], [[annual reports]] and high quality catalogs. [[Paper density|Grammage]] ranges from 90–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Bleaching of wood pulp|ISO brightness]] between 80–96%. The fibre furnish consists of more than 90% [[Pulp (paper)|chemical pulp]]. Total [[pigment]] content are in the range 30–45%, where [[calcium carbonate]] and clay are the most common.
; Low coat weight papers: These paper grades have lower coat weights than the standard WFC (3–14&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/side) and the grammage and pigment content are also generally lower, 55–135&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 20–35% respectively.
; Art papers: Art papers are one of the highest quality printing papers and are used for illustrated books, calendars and brochures. The grammage varies from 100 to 230&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These papergrades are triple coated with 20–40&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/side and have [[Gloss (optics)|matte or glossy]] finish. Higher qualities often contain [[Cotton paper|cotton]].

=== Others ===

Other types of paper coatings include [[polyethylene]] or [[polyolefin]] [[extrusion coating]], [[silicone]], and [[wax paper|wax]] coating to make  [[paper cup]]s and [[photographic paper]]. [[Biopolymer]] coatings are available as more sustainable alternatives to common [[petrochemical]] coatings like [[LDPE]] (see [[plastic-coated paper]]) or [[mylar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Printed papers commonly have a top coat of a protective polymer to seal the print, provide scuff resistance, and sometimes gloss.   Some coatings are processed by  [[UV curing]] for stability.

A [[release liner]] is a paper (or film) sheet used to prevent a sticky surface from adhering. It is coated on one or both sides with a [[release agent]].

Heat printed papers such as receipts are often coated with estrogenic and carcinogenic poisons, such as [[Bisphenol A|BPA]]. It is possible to check whether a piece of paper is coated, as it will quickly turn deep black when the ember of a cigarette is applied. (see [[thermal paper]])

[[File:Boeing E-3A crosswind landing.jpg|thumb|In a crosswind landing, the fuselage of the plane may be skewed relative to the runway]]
A '''crosswind''' is any wind that has a perpendicular component to the line or direction of travel. This affects the aerodynamics of many forms of transport. Moving non-parallel to the wind's direction creates a crosswind component on the object and thus increasing the apparent wind on the object; such use of cross wind travel is used to advantage by sailing craft, kiteboarding craft, power kiting, etc. On the other side, crosswind moves the path of vehicles sideways and can be a hazard.

== Definition ==
When winds are not parallel to or directly with/against the line of travel, the wind is said to have a crosswind ''component''; that is, the force can be separated into two [[force vector|vector]] components: 
* the headwind or tailwind component in the direction of motion,
* the crosswind component perpendicular to the former.

A vehicle behaves as though it is directly experiencing a lateral effect of the magnitude of the crosswind component only. The crosswind component is computed by multiplying the wind speed by the [[sine]] of the angle between the wind and the direction of travel while the headwind component is computed in the same manner, using [[cosine]] instead of sine. For example, a 10 [[knot (unit)|knot]] wind coming at 45 degrees from either side will have a crosswind component of 10 knots × sin(45°) and a head/tailwind component of 10 knots × cos(45°), both equals to 7.07 knots.

To determine the crosswind component in aviation, aviators frequently refer to a [[nomograph]] chart on which the wind speed and angle are plotted, and the crosswind component is read from a reference line. Direction of travel relative to the wind may be left or right, up or down, or oblique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~highwind/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Loyd1980.pdf | title= Crosswind Kite Power | author= Miles L. Loyd | publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif.|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
[[File:BelgischerKreisel.gif|thumb|Skilled cyclists can ride in crosswinds using a ''Belgian tourniquet'' (Belgischer Kreisel)]] 
In [[aviation]], a crosswind is the component of wind that is blowing across the [[runway]], making landings and take-offs more difficult than if the wind were blowing straight down the runway.  If a crosswind is strong enough, it can damage an aircraft's [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] upon landing. Crosswinds, sometimes abbreviated as '''X/WIND''', are reported in knots, abbreviated '''kt''', and often use the plural form in expressions such as "with 40kt crosswinds". Smaller aircraft are often not limited by their ability to land in a crosswind, but may see their ability to taxi safely reduced.

Crosswinds can also cause difficulty with ground vehicles traveling on wet or slippery roads (snow, ice, standing water, etc.), especially when gusting conditions affect vehicles that have a large side area such as [[van]]s, [[SUV]]s, and [[tractor-trailer]]s. This can be dangerous for motorists because of the possible lift force created, causing the vehicle to lose traction or change direction of travel. The safest way for motorists to deal with crosswinds is by reducing their speed to reduce the effect of the lift force and to steer into the direction of the crosswind.{{elucidate|date=June 2014}}

[[Cycling|Cyclist]]s are also significantly affected by crosswinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howland|first1=Bob|title=The Physics of Riding in the Wind|url=http://www.roadbikerider.com/riding-skills/safety-skills/physics-riding-wind|publisher=Road Bike Rider|accessdate=30 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150804055823/http://www.roadbikerider.com/riding-skills/safety-skills/physics-riding-wind|archivedate=4 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echelon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banishki|first1=Nikola|title=Echelons and You: Riding Smart in the Crosswind|url=http://www.thetallcyclist.com/2013/02/echelons-and-you-riding-smart-in-the-crosswind/|publisher=The Tall Cyclist|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saving energy by avoiding riding in wind is a major part of the tactics of [[road bicycle racing]], and this particularly applies in crosswinds.

An '''equilibrant force''' is a [[force]] which brings a body into [[mechanical equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emsb.qc.ca/LaurenHill/physics/AnsPhysics%20Ex-14.pdf | title=Physics | accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Newton's second law]], a body has zero acceleration when the [[vector sum]] of all the forces acting upon it is zero. Therefore, an equilibrant force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the [[resultant force|resultant]] of all the other forces acting on a body. The term has been attested since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith Carhart |first1=Henry |last2=Nelson Chute |first2=Horatio |title=The Elements of Physics |year=1892 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EebkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Equilibrant Force Example.gif|thumbnail|right|Equilibrant force example]]

Suppose that two known forces are pushing an object and an unknown equilibrant force is acting to maintain that object in a fixed position. One force points to the west and has a magnitude of 10 [[Newton (unit)|N]], and the other points to the south and has a magnitude of 8.0 N. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the resultant of these two forces has a magnitude of approximately 12.8 N, which is also the magnitude of the equilibrant force. The angle of the equilibrant force can be found by [[trigonometry]] to be approximately 51 degrees north of east.

It intends to conserve and undertake scientific research in the biosphere of the Falkland Islands and publish the results of the research to inform the public in the field of nature conservation. They also intend to preserve the Falkland Islands heritage and carry out other charitable activities.&lt;ref&gt;FC Memorandum and Articles of Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of FC go back to 1979 when a group of naturalists, including [[Peter Scott]], established a UK registered charity, the Falkland Islands Foundation (FIF), to protect the wildlife of the Falklands and its historic shipwrecks.  In 1980 another body, the Falkland Islands Trust (FIT) was formed in the Islands.  In 1982, following the [[Falklands War]], FIF became a membership-based organisation.  With the merger of FIT and FIF in 1991, it was formally launched on 1 August by [[David Attenborough]] as Falklands Conservation.

Falklands Conservation has a partnership with [[BirdLife International]], representing the Falkland Islands, and a member of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

Some of the propellant is burned in a [[gas generator]] and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps. The gas is then exhausted. Because something is "thrown away" this type of engine is also known as '''open cycle'''.

There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|staged combustion cycle]]. The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber. This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.

The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower [[specific impulse]] than staged combustion cycles. However there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine. This is seen in the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] rocket engine used on the [[Saturn V]] booster stage. 

As in most [[cryogenic rocket engine]]s, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).

The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.

G. N. Lewis was born in 1875 in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. After receiving his PhD in [[chemistry]] from [[Harvard University]] and studying abroad in Germany and the [[Philippines]], Lewis moved to [[California]] to teach chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Several years later, he became the Dean of the college of Chemistry at Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his life. As a professor, he incorporated thermodynamic principles into the chemistry curriculum and reformed [[chemical thermodynamics]] in a mathematically rigorous manner accessible to ordinary chemists. He began measuring the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] values related to several chemical processes, both organic and inorganic.

In 1916, he also proposed his theory of bonding and added information about electrons in the [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element]]s. In 1933, he started his research on isotope separation. Lewis worked with hydrogen and managed to purify a sample of [[heavy water]]. He then came up with his theory of acids and bases, and did work in photochemistry during the last years of his life. In 1926, Lewis coined the term "[[photon]]" for the smallest unit of radiant energy. He was a brother in [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], the professional chemistry fraternity.

Though he was nominated 41 times,&lt;ref name="NobelPrize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Database  Gilbert N. Lewis|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=5441|website=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; G. N. Lewis never won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. On March 23, 1946, Lewis was found dead in his Berkeley laboratory where he had been working with [[hydrogen cyanide]]; many postulated that the cause of his death was suicide. After Lewis' death, his children followed their father's career in chemistry.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lewis was born in 1875 and raised in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where there exists a street named for him, G.N. Lewis Way, off Summer Street.  Additionally, the wing of the new Weymouth High School Chemistry department has been named in his honor. Lewis received his primary education at home from his parents, Frank Wesley Lewis, a lawyer of independent character, and Mary Burr White Lewis. He read at age three and was intellectually precocious. In 1884 his family moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], and in 1889 he received his first formal education at the university preparatory school.

In 1893, after two years at the [[University of Nebraska]], Lewis transferred to [[Harvard University]], where he obtained his [[B.S.]] in 1896. After a year of teaching at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], Lewis returned to Harvard to study with the physical chemist [[Theodore William Richards|T. W. Richards]] and obtained his Ph.D. in 1899 with a dissertation on [[electrochemical potential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Joel H. |title=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1958 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A. |volume= vol. 31 |pages=209–235 |chapter=Gilbert Newton Lewis |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/lewis-gilbert-n.pdf}}; see p. 210. Lewis's Ph.D. thesis was titled "Some electrochemical and thermochemical relations of zinc and cadmium amalgams". He published the results jointly with his supervisor T.W. Richards.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=Theodore William |last2=Lewis |first2=Gilbert Newton |title=Some electrochemical and thermochemical relations of zinc and cadmium amalgams |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |date=1898 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=87–99 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050586039;view=1up;seq=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of teaching at Harvard, Lewis took a traveling fellowship to Germany, the center of [[physical chemistry]], and studied with [[Walther Nernst]] at [[Göttingen]] and with [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] at [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; While working in Nernst's lab, Nernst and Lewis apparently developed a lifelong enmity. In the following years, Lewis started to criticize and denounce his former teacher on many occasions, calling Nernst's work on his heat theorem "''a regrettable episode in the history of chemistry''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://listverse.com/2015/04/07/10-fierce-but-productive-rivalries-between-dueling-scientists/ ''10 Fierce (But Productive) Rivalries Between Dueling Scientists''] Radu Alexander. Website of Listverse Ltd. April 7th 2015. Retrieved 2016-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Nernst's, [[:sv:Wilhelm Palmær|Wilhelm Palmær (Swedish)]], was a member of the Nobel Chemistry Committee. There is evidence that he used the Nobel nominating and reporting procedures to block a [[Nobel Prize]] for Lewis in [[thermodynamics]] by nominating Lewis for the prize three times, and then using his position as a committee member to write negative reports.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey (2008): 195-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard, Manila, and MIT===
After his stay in Nernst's lab, Lewis returned to Harvard in 1901 as an instructor for three more years. He was appointed instructor in [[thermodynamics]] and [[electrochemistry]]. In 1904 Lewis was granted a leave of absence and became Superintendent of Weights and Measures for the Bureau of Science in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. The next year he returned to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] when the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) appointed him to a faculty position, in which he had a chance to join a group of outstanding physical chemists under the direction of [[Arthur Amos Noyes]]. He became an assistant professor in 1907, associate professor in 1908, and full professor in 1911. He left MIT in 1912 to become a professor of physical chemistry and dean of the [[Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Lewis Hall at Berkeley, built in 1948, is named in his honor.

===Thermodynamics===
Most of Lewis’ lasting interests originated during his Harvard years. The most important was thermodynamics, a subject in which Richards was very active at that time. Although most of the important thermodynamic relations were known by 1895, they were seen as isolated equations, and had not yet been rationalized as a logical system, from which, given one relation, the rest could be derived. Moreover, these relations were inexact, applying only to ideal chemical systems. These were two outstanding problems of theoretical thermodynamics. In two long and ambitious theoretical papers in 1900 and 1901, Lewis tried to provide a solution. Lewis introduced the thermodynamic concept of [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] and coined the term "[[fugacity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert Newton |title=The law of physico-chemical change |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |date=June 1901 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=49–69 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050586062;view=1up;seq=57 }} ; the term "fugacity" is coined on p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert Newton |title=Outlines of a new system of thermodynamic chemistry |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |date=1907 |volume=43 |pages=259–293 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050586120;view=1up;seq=275}} ; the term "activity" is defined on p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitzer |first1=Kenneth S. |title=Gilbert N. Lewis and the thermodynamics of strong electrolytes |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |date=February 1984 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=104-107 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed061p104}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new idea of fugacity, or "escaping tendency",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert Newton |title=A new conception of thermal pressure and a theory of solutions |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |date=1900 |volume=36 |pages=145–168 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050586054;view=1up;seq=165}} The term "escaping tendency" is introduced on p. 148, where it is represented by the Greek letter ''ψ'' ; ''ψ'' is defined for ideal gases on p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; was a function with the dimensions of [[pressure]] which expressed the tendency of a substance to pass from one chemical phase to another. Lewis believed that fugacity was the fundamental principle from which a system of real thermodynamic relations could be derived. This hope was not realized, though fugacity did find a lasting place in the description of real gases.

Lewis’ early papers also reveal an unusually advanced awareness of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. W. Gibbs’s]] and [[Pierre Duhem|P. Duhem’s]] ideas of free energy and [[thermodynamic potential]]. These ideas were well known to physicists and mathematicians, but not to most practical chemists, who regarded them as abstruse and inapplicable to chemical systems. Most chemists relied on the familiar thermodynamics of heat (enthalpy) of [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]], and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Van’t Hoff]], and the [[calorimetry|calorimetric]] school. Heat of reaction is not, of course, a measure of the tendency of chemical changes to occur, and Lewis realized that only free energy and entropy could provide an exact chemical thermodynamics. He derived free energy from fugacity; he tried, without success, to obtain an exact expression for the [[entropy]] function, which in 1901 had not been defined at low temperatures. Richards too tried and failed, and not until Nernst succeeded in 1907 was it possible to calculate entropies unambiguously. Although Lewis’ fugacity-based system did not last, his early interest in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] and entropy proved most fruitful, and much of his career was devoted to making these useful concepts accessible to practical chemists.

At Harvard, Lewis also wrote a theoretical paper on the thermodynamics of [[blackbody radiation]] in which he postulated that light has a pressure. He later revealed that he had been discouraged from pursuing this idea by his older, more conservative colleagues, who were unaware that [[Wilhelm Wien]] and others were successfully pursuing the same line of thought. Lewis’ paper remained unpublished; but his interest in radiation and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], and (later) in [[theory of relativity|relativity]], sprang from this early, aborted effort. From the start of his career, Lewis regarded himself as both chemist and physicist.

===Valence theory===
[[Image:Lewis-cubic-notes.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Lewis' '''[[cubical atom]]s''' (as drawn in 1902)]]

About 1902 Lewis started to use unpublished drawings of [[cubical atom]]s in his lecture notes, in which the corners of the cube represented possible [[electron]] positions. Lewis later cited these notes in his classic 1916 paper on chemical bonding, as being the first expression of his ideas.

A third major interest that originated during Lewis’ Harvard years was his valence theory. In 1902, while trying to explain the laws of valence to his students, Lewis conceived the idea that atoms were built up of a concentric series of cubes with electrons at each corner. This “cubic atom” explained the cycle of eight elements in the periodic table and was in accord with the widely accepted belief that chemical bonds were formed by transfer of electrons to give each atom a complete set of eight. This electrochemical theory of valence found its most elaborate expression in the work of [[Richard Abegg]] in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abegg |first1=R. |title=Die Valenz und das periodische System. Versuch einer Theorie der Molekularverbindungen |journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie |date=1904 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=330–380 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3959087;view=1up;seq=344 |trans-title=Valency and the periodic table. Attempt at a theory of molecular compounds |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lewis’ version of this theory was the only one to be embodied in a concrete atomic model. Again Lewis’ theory did not interest his Harvard mentors, who, like most American chemists of that time, had no taste for such speculation. Lewis did not publish his theory of the cubic atom, but in 1916 it became an important part of his theory of the shared electron pair bond.

In 1916, he published his classic paper on chemical bonding "''The Atom and the Molecule''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert N. |title=The atom and the molecule |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=April 1916 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=762–785 |doi=10.1021/ja02261a002 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hs1t2w;view=1up;seq=772}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he formulated the idea of what would become known as the [[covalent bond]], consisting of a [[shared pair]] of electrons, and he defined the term odd molecule (the modern term is [[free radical]]) when an electron is not shared. He included what became known as [[Lewis structure|Lewis dot structure]]s as well as the [[cubical atom]] model. These ideas on [[chemical bond]]ing were expanded upon by [[Irving Langmuir]] and became the inspiration for the studies on the nature of the chemical bond by [[Linus Pauling]].

===Relativity===
In 1908 he published the first of several papers on [[theory of relativity|relativity]], in which he derived the [[mass]]-[[energy]] relationship in a different way from [[Albert Einstein]]'s derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He resigned in 1934, refusing to state the cause for his resignation; it has been speculated that it was due to a dispute over the internal politics of that institution or to the failure of those he had nominated to be elected. His decision to resign may have been sparked by resentment over the award of the 1934 Nobel Prize for chemistry to his student, [[Harold Urey]], for the discovery of [[deuterium]], a prize Lewis almost certainly felt he should have shared for his work on purification and characterization of [[heavy water]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffey (2008): 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acids and bases===
{{Main|Lewis acids and bases}}

In 1923, he formulated the electron-pair theory of [[acid–base reaction]]s. In this theory of [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, a "Lewis acid" is an ''electron-pair acceptor'' and a "Lewis base" is an ''electron-pair donor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert Newton |title=Valence and the Structure of Atoms and Molecules |date=1923 |publisher=Chemical Catalog Company |location=New York, New York, U.S.A. |page=142 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3219599;view=1up;seq=148}}  From p. 142:  "We are inclined to think of substances as possessing acid or basic properties, without having a particular solvent in mind.  It seems to me that with complete generality we may say that ''a basic substance is one which has a lone pair of electrons which may be used to complete the stable group of another atom'', and that ''an acid substance is one which can employ a lone pair from another molecule'' in completing the stable group of one of its own atoms.  In other words, the basic substance furnishes a pair of electrons for a chemical bond, the acid substance accepts such a pair."&lt;/ref&gt; This year he also published a monograph on his theories of the chemical bond.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, G. N. (1926) ''Valence and the Nature of the Chemical Bond''. Chemical Catalog Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on work by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]], it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] determined by the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the substances taking part. Lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances. In 1923 he and [[Merle Randall]] published the results of this study,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, G. N. and [[Merle Randall]] (1923) ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energies of Chemical Substances''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; which helped formalize modern [[chemical thermodynamics]].

===Heavy water===
Lewis was the first to produce a pure sample of deuterium oxide ([[heavy water]]) in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 341| year = 1933 | doi = 10.1063/1.1749300| last2 =  MacDonald| first1 = G.

T.| title = Concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Isotope| issue = 6|bibcode = 1933JChPh...1..341L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first to study survival and growth of life forms in heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The biochemistry of water containing hydrogen isotope| last1 = Lewis| first1 = G.

Lawrence's]] [[cyclotron]], he was able to study many of the properties of atomic nuclei.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the 1930s, he was mentor to [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], who was retained for post-doctoral work as Lewis' personal research assistant. Seaborg went on to win the 1951 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry and have the element [[seaborgium]] named in his honor while he was still alive.

===Other achievements===
In 1921, Lewis was the first to propose an empirical equation describing the failure of [[strong electrolyte]]s to obey the [[law of mass action]], a problem that had perplexed physical chemists for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gilbert N. |last2=Randall |first2=Merle |title=The activity coefficient of strong electrolytes |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=1921 |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=1112–1154 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015018181431;view=1up;seq=1144}} The term "ionic strength" is introduced on p. 1140.&lt;/ref&gt; His empirical equations for what he called [[ionic strength]] were later confirmed to be in accord with the [[Debye–Hückel equation]] for strong electrolytes, published in 1923.

In 1924, by studying the [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties of solutions of [[oxygen]] in [[liquid]] [[nitrogen]], he found that O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The magnetism of oxygen and the molecule O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01674a008|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 1924-09-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 2027–2032|volume = 46|issue = 9|doi = 10.1021/ja01674a008|first = Gilbert N.|last = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first evidence for [[tetraoxygen|tetratomic oxygen]].

In 1926, he coined the term "[[photon]]" for the smallest unit of radiant energy (light). Actually, the outcome of his letter  &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = Lewis, G.N. 
 | title = The conservation of photons
 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]
 | year = 1926 |url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/photon.htm
 | volume = 118 | pages = 874–875
 | doi = 10.1038/118874a0
|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..874L
 | issue=2981}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' was not what he had intended. In the letter, he proposed a photon being a structural element, not [[energy]]. He insisted on the need for a new variable, ''the number of photons''. Although his theory differed from the [[photon|quantum theory of light]] introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905, his name was adopted for what Einstein had called a '''light quantum''' (Lichtquant in German).

===Later years===
Over the course of his career, Lewis published on many other subjects besides those mentioned in this entry, ranging from the nature of [[light]] quanta to the [[economics]] of price stabilization. 
In the last years of his life, Lewis and graduate student [[Michael Kasha]], his last research associate, established that [[phosphorescence]] of [[organic chemistry|organic]] molecules involves emission of light from one electron in an excited [[triplet state]] (a state in which two electrons have their [[Spin (physics)|spin vector]]s oriented in the ''same'' direction, but in different orbitals) and measured the [[paramagnetism]] of this triplet state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01240a030 | volume=66 | issue=12 | title=Phosphorescence and the Triplet State | year=1944 | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=2100–2116 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Gilbert N. | last2 = Kasha | first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, a graduate student found Lewis's lifeless body under a laboratory workbench at Berkeley. Lewis had been working on an experiment with liquid [[hydrogen cyanide]], and deadly fumes from a broken line had leaked into the laboratory. The coroner ruled that the cause of death was [[coronary artery disease]], because of a lack of any signs of cyanosis,&lt;ref name="Coffey"&gt;Coffey (2008): 310-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  but some believe that it may have been a suicide. Berkeley Emeritus Professor William Jolly, who reported the various views on Lewis's death in his 1987 history of UC Berkeley’s College of Chemistry, ''From Retorts to Lasers'', wrote that a higher-up in the department believed that Lewis had committed suicide.

If Lewis's death was indeed a suicide, a possible explanation was depression brought on by a lunch with [[Irving Langmuir]]. Langmuir and Lewis had a long rivalry, dating back to Langmuir's extensions of Lewis's theory of the chemical bond. Langmuir had been awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on [[surface chemistry]], while Lewis had not received the Prize despite having been nominated 41 times.&lt;ref name="NobelPrize"/&gt; On the day of Lewis's death, Langmuir and Lewis had met for lunch at Berkeley, a meeting that Michael Kasha recalled only years later.&lt;ref name="Coffey" /&gt; Associates reported that Lewis came back from lunch in a dark mood, played a morose game of bridge with some colleagues, then went back to work in his lab. An hour later, he was found dead. Langmuir's papers at the [[Library of Congress]] confirm that he had been on the Berkeley campus that day to receive an honorary degree.

==Personal life==
On June 21, 1912, he married Mary Hinckley Sheldon, daughter of a Harvard professor of [[Romance languages]]. They had two sons, both of whom became chemistry professors, and a daughter.

{{Science with neutrons}}

'''ISIS Neutron and Muon Source''' is a pulsed [[neutron]] and [[muon]] source.  It is situated at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]], on the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]], United Kingdom. It uses the techniques of [[muon spin spectroscopy|muon spectroscopy]] and [[neutron scattering]] to probe the structure and dynamics of [[condensed matter]] on a microscopic scale ranging from the subatomic to the macromolecular.

Hundreds of experiments are performed every year the facility by researchers from around the world, in diverse science areas such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[materials engineering]], [[earth sciences]], [[biology]] and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS_AR_2017.pdf|title=ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Annual Review 2017|last=|first=|date=18 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Neutrons and muons==
Neutrons are uncharged constituents of [[atom]]s and penetrate materials well, deflecting only from the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of atoms. The statistical accumulation of deflected neutrons at different positions beyond the sample can be used to find the structure of a material, and the loss or gain of energy by neutrons can reveal the dynamic behaviour of parts of a sample, for example diffusive processes in solids. At ISIS the neutrons are created by accelerating 'bunches' of [[proton]]s in a [[synchrotron]], then colliding these with a heavy [[tungsten]] metal target, under a constant cooling load to dissipate the heat from the 160&amp;nbsp;kW proton beam. The impacts cause neutrons to [[spallation|spall]] off the tungsten atoms, and the neutrons are channelled through guides, or [[beamline]]s, to around 20 instruments, each individually optimised for the study of different types of interactions between the neutron beam and matter. The target station and most of the instruments are set in a large hall. Neutrons are a dangerous form of radiation, so the target and beamlines are heavily shielded with concrete.

ISIS Neutron and Muon Source produces [[muon]]s by colliding a fraction of the proton beam with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[pion]]s which decay rapidly into muons, delivered in a spin-polarised beam to sample stations.

==Science at ISIS Neutron and Muon Source==
ISIS Neutron and Muon Source is administered and operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (previously [[CCLRC]]). The Science and Technology Facilities council, or STFC, is part of [https://www.ukri.org/ UK Research and Innovation].  Experimental time is open to academic users from funding countries and is applied for through a twice-yearly 'call for proposals'. Research allocation, or 'beam-time', is allotted to applicants via a peer-review process. Users and their parent institutions do not pay for the running costs of the facility, which are as much as £11,000 per instrument per day. Their transport and living costs used to be refunded whilst carrying out the experiment, but aren't anymore. Most users stay in Ridgeway House, a hotel near the site, or at [[Cosener's House]], an STFC-run conference centre in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]. Over 600 experiments by 1600 users are completed every year.

A large number of support staff operate the facility, aid users, and carry out research, the control room is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Instrument scientists oversee the running of each instrument and liaise with users, and other divisions provide sample environment, data analysis and computing expertise, maintain the accelerator, and run education programmes. ISIS is also one of the few neutron facilities to have a significant detector group that researches and develops new techniques for collecting data.

Among the important and pioneering work carried out was the discovery of the structure of high-temperature [[superconductor]]s and the solid phase of buckminster-fullerene. Other recent developments can be found [https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Science-Highlights.aspx here].

Construction for a second target station (TS2) started in 2003, and the first neutrons were delivered to the target on December 14, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts-2.isis.rl.ac.uk/ ISIS Second Target Station Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921222750/http://ts-2.isis.rl.ac.uk/ |date=September 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TS2 uses low-energy neutrons to study [[condensed matter|soft condensed matter]], biological systems, advanced [[Composite material|composites]] and [[nanotechnology|nanomaterials]].

The [[International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment]] (MICE) runs parasitically off the ISIS proton beam.

==History and background of ISIS Neutron and Muon Source==
The source was approved in 1977 for the RAL site on the [[Harwell Laboratory|Harwell]] campus and recycled components from earlier UK science programmes including the accelerator hall which had previously been occupied by the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod]] accelerator. The first beam was produced in 1984, and the facility was formally opened by the then Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629065811/http://epubs.cclrc.ac.uk/bitstream/692/linacplahistory.pdf Linacs at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ISIS is not an acronym: it refers to the [[Isis|Ancient Egyptian goddess]] and the local name for the [[River Thames]]. The name was selected for the official opening of the facility in 1985, prior to this it was known as the SNS, or Spallation Neutron Source. The name was considered appropriate as Isis was a goddess who could restore life to the dead, and ISIS made use of equipment previously constructed for the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod]] and [[NINA (accelerator)|NINA]]  accelerators.

The second target station was given funding in 2003 by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]], then science minister, and was completed in 2009, on time and budget, with the opening of 7 instruments. In April 2010, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Science Minister]], [[David Willetts]] gave a £21 million investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase Two instruments|url=http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/about-isis/target-station-2/phase-two-instruments8150.html|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build 4 new instruments, which are now all in their commissioning phase or fully scheduled instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS_AR_2017.pdf|title=ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Annual Review 2017|last=|first=|date=18 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ISIS Neutron and Muon Source was originally expected to have an operational life of 20 years (1985 to 2005), but its continued success led to a process of refurbishment and further investment, intended to advance the facility and extend the life of ISIS through to 2030. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stfc.ukri.org/files/impact-publications/isis-neutron-and-muon-source-lifetime-impact-report/|title=ISIS Lifetime Impact Study, Volume 1 – Full Report|last=|first=|date=November 2016|website=stfc.ukri.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">'''Kirei(TM) Board''' is an engineered panel product of the company Kirei USA, constructed from the left-over, post-harvest stalks of the [[sorghum]] plant.

Its manufacture is more involved than that of [[particle board]], as the stalks are first woven tightly and then heat-pressed with an adhesive. Designed to be strong, lightweight, [[environmentally friendly]] and sustainable, Kirei Board is intended for [[Interior decoration|wall coverings]], cabinetry, furniture, flooring and other decorative and finished products.

The word ''kirei'' (JP 奇麗/きれい;IPA [ki 'rei]) is a Japanese adjective possessing a range of meanings: ''beautiful'', ''clean'', ''pure'' and ''truthful''. 

In some applications, Kirei Board is used as a decorative material in its own right (featuring its visually distinctive grain), while in others it is used as a building wood in cabinets and shelving, then covered with a [[Wood veneer|veneer]] of another wood. As it is a soft material, Kirei board is not indicated for flooring in high traffic areas. It is not rated as an outdoor structural panel material.

==Background==
Leonhard Seppala  was born in the village of [[Skibotn]] in [[Storfjord]] municipality, [[Troms]] county, [[Norway]]. He was the oldest-born child of father Isak Isaksson Seppälä (of Swedish descent) and Anne Henriksdatter (of Finnish Norwegian [[Kven people|Kven]] descent). His father's family name is of Finnish origin. When Seppala was two years old, his family moved within Troms county to nearby [[Skjervøy]] municipality on the island of [[Skjervøya]]. While in [[Skjervøy (village)|Skjervøy]], his father worked as a blacksmith and fisherman, building up a relatively large estate. Seppala initially followed in his father's footsteps as both a blacksmith and a fisherman. However, he emigrated to [[Alaska]] during the [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] gold rush of the 1900s. His friend [[Jafet Lindeberg]] had returned from [[Alaska]] and convinced Seppala to come to work for his mining company in Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seppalakennels.com/articles/leonhardseppala.htm|title=Leonhard Seppala|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first winter in Alaska, Seppala became a dogsled driver for Lindeberg's company. He enjoyed the task from his first run, which he recalled clearly for the rest of his life. He expressed pleasure in the rhythmic patter of the dogs' feet and the feeling of the sled gliding along the snow. While most drivers considered {{convert|30|mi|km}} a long run, Seppala travelled between {{convert|50|mi|km}} and {{convert|100|mi|km}} most days. This also meant he worked as long as 12 hours a day. He kept his dogs in form during the summer by having them pull a cart on wheels instead of a sled. It was unusual at that time to keep sled dogs working when the snow thawed, or to spend as much time with them as he did.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

==Racing career==
In 1913, Seppala inherited his first team of sled dogs by chance. Lindeberg, his friend and supervisor at Pioneer Mining Company, had brought the puppies from Siberia as a gift for the explorer [[Roald Amundsen]], whom he hoped would use them for his upcoming expedition to the [[North Pole]]. Seppala was assigned to train the dogs. "I literally fell in love with them from the start", he recalled; "I could hardly wait for sledding snow to start their training". When Amundsen cancelled his trip a few weeks after the puppies arrived in Nome, Lindeberg gave them to Seppala.{{r|The Cruelest Miles|p=68}}

Seppala made the decision to compete in his first race, the 1914 All Alaska Sweepstakes, at the last minute. Neither he nor his canine freight leader, Suggen, knew the dangerous trail, and when a blizzard suddenly descended on the area during the race, Seppala realized his young dogs had lost the trail and they were all at great risk of death due to the nearby drop-off to the Bering Sea. Indeed, when the whiteout conditions suddenly lifted, Seppala found that he and his team were at the bottom of a hill, racing towards the cliffs along the sea. Fortunately, he succeeded in stopping 20 feet from the drop-off, saving all their lives. However, many of his dogs' paw pads had been shredded and claws broken by the ice-encrusted snow as they clawed their way back to the top of the hill. A few also suffered frostbite. Seppala felt he had abused the dogs' loyalty by putting them in danger of death and injury, and withdrew from the race in shame. He would nurse them back to health for most the remainder of that year; they would not be ready to train again until Autumn.{{r|The Cruelest Miles|p=70–71}}

Seppala's racing career took off the following year, at the 1915 All Alaska Sweepstakes. After a close competition between him and experienced musher Scotty Allan, Seppala defeated him on the fourth day of the race and finished two hours ahead of Allan to win the Sweepstakes.{{r|The Cruelest Miles|p=72–75}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/cdmg2/id/653/rec/10 Photo: Winners of the Eighth All Alaska Sweepstakes from Alaska's Digital Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the race the following two years, as well, at which point the All Alaska Sweepstakes was suspended until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nome Kennel Club|title=2008 All Alaska Sweepstakes Media Guide|url=http://www.allalaskasweepstakes.org/PDF/2008%20AAS%20Media%20Guide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326160319/http://www.allalaskasweepstakes.org/PDF/2008%20AAS%20Media%20Guide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 March 2012|accessdate=13 October 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the "Serum Run" of 1925==
[[File:Seppala plaque.JPG|left|200px|Plaque on the Leonhard Seppala monument in his hometown of Skibotn, Norway]]
A [[diphtheria]] outbreak struck Seppala's town of [[Nome, Alaska]] in the winter of 1925. Previously unexposed children as well as adults were at risk of dying from the infection. Seppala's only child—an eight-year-old daughter named Sigrid—was also at risk. The only treatment available in 1925 was diphtheria antitoxin serum. However, the town's supply was not only insufficient but also of presumably low efficacy, being past its expiry date. The only practical way to deliver more serum to Nome in the middle of the coldest winter in 20 years was by dog sled. A relay of respected mushers was organized to expedite the delivery, and Seppala (with lead dog [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]) was chosen for the most forbidding part of the trail.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt; 
The serum would be taken by train to Nenana, and from there relay teams would set out from Nome and Nenana, and meet in the middle at Nulato. The whole trail was 674 miles from Nenana to Nome, and Seppala was initially selected to cover the more than 400 miles from Nome to Nulato and back.
Seppala's section of trail featured a dangerous shortcut across [[Norton Sound]], which could save the serum a day of travel. It was decided that he was the most qualified of the relay mushers to attempt this shortcut. The ice on Norton Sound was in constant motion due to currents from the sea and the incessant wind. It could range from rough hills of smashed-together ice, to slippery "glare ice" polished by the wind, where it was difficult for the dogs to get a foothold to pull the sled. Small cracks in the ice could also suddenly widen, and driver and team could be plunged into the freezing water. If the wind blew from the east, it could reach speeds as high as {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}, flipping over sleds, pushing dogs off-course, and causing a windchill as low as {{convert|-100|F|C}}. A sustained east wind could also push the ice out to sea, and a team suddenly caught on a drifting floe could find itself stranded on open water. Seppala had been forced to take the shortcut across the Sound several times in his career; a less-experienced musher was likelier to lose not only his life and the lives of his dogs, but also the urgently needed serum. Seppala would cross the sound each way in the race to deliver the serum.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

Seppala set out from Nome on January 28—several days before he was due to meet the relay coming to Nulato. He crossed Norton Sound without incident. Meanwhile, the number of diphtheria cases in Nome continued to climb. To hasten delivery of the serum, additional mushers were added to the relay. However, it was too late to inform Seppala that he would be meeting the relay closer to Nome than had originally been planned. After 3 days and {{convert|170|mi|km}}, he came in sight of another relay musher, Henry Ivanoff—but did not realise it. Seppala saw the musher stopped on the trail and having trouble with his dogs, but did not intend to stop and be delayed. Ivanoff had to run after Seppala as he raced past, shouting, "The serum! The serum! I have it here!".&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

When the serum passed to Seppala, night was falling and a powerful [[Pressure system|low-pressure system]] was moving towards the trail from the Gulf of Alaska. Seppala had to decide whether to risk Norton Sound in high winds in the dark, when he could not see or hear potential warning signs from the ice. However, as going around the ice meant slowing the delivery of the serum by a full day, he chose to go across. While he raced to the roadhouse at Isaac's Point on the opposite shore, [[gale|gale-force]] winds dropped the windchill to an estimated {{convert|-85|F|C}}. When he arrived there at 8 pm, his dogs were exhausted; they had run {{convert|84|mi|km}} that day, much of it against the wind and in brutal cold. However, they could only afford a short rest, and set out again at 2 am.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

The next day, the gale had intensified into a severe [[blizzard]], with blinding snow and winds of at least {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}}. Seppala continued the trail across Norton Sound. This meant avoiding rocky cliffs along the shore, but it also exposed him and his team to the dangers of the Sound. Conditions on the ice were perilous, with sudden soft spots in the ice underfoot, or outright open water only a few feet away. Only a few hours after they had crossed it, the ice had broken up altogether and drifted out to sea.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

With Norton Sound behind them, Seppala and his team now faced the final challenge of the trail—climbing an {{convert|8|mi|km}} [[ridge]] formation that led to the summit of Little McKinley. The trail here was exposed and the steep grade grueling for the dogs, who were sleep-deprived and had already raced {{convert|260|mi|km}} over the previous 4.5 days. However, at 3 P.M. that day, Seppala and his team arrived at Golovin and handed over the serum to the next musher. The serum was now only {{convert|78|mi|km}} from Nome. Indeed, it arrived there the next day, Monday, February 2, at approximately 5:30 A.M., and was thawed and ready for use by 11 am.&lt;ref name="The Cruelest Miles"/&gt;

[[1925 serum run to Nome|This emergency delivery]], also known as the "Great Race of Mercy", is commemorated annually with the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iditarod.com/learn/ ''The Last Great Race on Earth'' (Iditarod Trail Committee, Inc.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610041943/http://www.iditarod.com/learn/ |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Serum Run==
After the Serum Run, Seppala and some 40 of his dogs toured the "lower 48" with an [[Eskimo]] handler. His tour ended in January 1927 with the [[dogsled]] race at [[Poland Spring]], [[Maine]], where he accepted the challenge to race against [[Arthur Treadwell Walden|Arthur Walden]], founder of the [[New England Sled Dog Club]] and owner of the famous [[lead dog]] "Chinook." Despite a series of time-consuming mishaps on the trail, Seppala won the race against the bigger, slower dogs driven by Walden and his followers. The enthusiasm for sled dog racing in [[New England]] together with the Serum Run publicity and the victory over Walden made it possible for Seppala and partner Elizabeth Ricker to establish a Siberian kennel at [[Poland Spring, Maine]]. This was the start of the spread of the Siberian Husky breed in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.org/shcahp2d.htm|title=The Siberian Husky:  A Brief History of the Breed in America|publisher=Siberian Husky Club of America|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seppalawiki.pbworks.com/ElizabethMRicker|title=SeppalaWiki / ElizabethMRicker|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10seppalasleddogs.jpg|thumb|Seppala Siberian Sleddogs team in the Yukon]]
In 1928, Seppala  moved his permanent home to near [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. In 1931 the Seppala–Ricker partnership ended. [[Sled dog race at the 1932 Winter Olympics|Sled dog racing]] was a [[demonstration sport|demonstration event]] at the [[1932 Winter Olympics|Lake Placid Winter Olympic Games]] in 1932, where Seppala [[Sled dog race at the 1932 Winter Olympics|earned a silver]] in the event. In 1946, he and his wife Constance moved to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. In 1961 Seppala revisited Fairbanks and other places in Alaska at the invitation of American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], enjoying a warm reception from the Alaskan people. He and his wife lived in Seattle until his death at the age of eighty nine. His wife Constance died a few years later aged eighty-five, survived by their daughter, Sigrid Hanks. Both are buried in Nome, Alaska.

A street in Nome named Seppala Drive connects the town to its airport. Leonhard Seppolasvei  in [[Tromsø]] was also named for him. [[Alaska Airlines]] has established the Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award. In June 1999, a memorial was erected to him in [[Skibotn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/Newsroom/ASNews/ASstories/AS_20060222_100720.asp|title=Alaska Airlines Continues Long-Standing Support Of Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|date=22 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predominantly occurring in [[adipose tissue]], lipolysis is used to mobilize stored energy during fasting or exercise. Lipolysis is directly induced in [[adipocyte]]s by [[glucagon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=Robin E.|last2=Ahmadian|first2=Maryam|last3=Jaworski|first3=Kathy|last4=Sarkadi-Nagy|first4=Eszter|last5=Sul|first5=Hei Sook|title=Regulation of Lipolysis in Adipocytes|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=August 2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=79–101|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.27.061406.093734|pmc=2885771}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[growth hormone]], [[atrial natriuretic peptide]], [[brain natriuretic peptide]], and [[cortisol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=TS|last2=Jessen|first2=N|last3=Jørgensen|first3=JO|last4=Møller|first4=N|last5=Lund|first5=S|title=Dissecting adipose tissue lipolysis: molecular regulation and implications for metabolic disease.|journal=Journal of molecular endocrinology|date=June 2014|volume=52|issue=3|pages=R199-222|doi=10.1530/JME-13-0277|pmid=24577718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Lipolysis Mechanism.png|thumb|right|This image illustrates the three separate steps of hydrolysis involved in lipolysis. In the first step, [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] is hydrolyzed to make [[Diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] and this is catalyzed by [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] (ATGL). In the second step, diacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to make [[Monoglyceride|monoacylglycerol]] and this is catalyzed by [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] (HSL). In the last step, monoacylglycerol is hydrolyzed to make [[glycerol]] and this is catalyzed by [[monoacylglycerol lipase]] (MGL). ]]
In [[adipose tissue]], intracellular triglycerides are stored in cytoplasmic [[lipid droplet]]s. When [[lipase]]s are phosphorylated, they access lipid droplets and through multiple steps of hydrolysis, breakdown triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. Each step of hydrolysis leads to the removal of one fatty acid. The first step and the rate-limiting step of lipolysis is carried out by [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] (ATGL). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] to [[Diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Subsequently, [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to [[Monoglyceride|monoacylglycerol]] and [[monoacylglycerol lipase]] (MGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol to [[glycerol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frühbeck|first1=G|last2=Méndez-Giménez|first2=L|last3=Fernández-Formoso|first3=JA|last4=Fernández|first4=S|last5=Rodríguez|first5=A|title=Regulation of adipocyte lipolysis.|journal=Nutrition research reviews|date=June 2014|volume=27|issue=1|pages=63–93|doi=10.1017/S095442241400002X|pmid=24872083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perilipin 1A is a key protein regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue. This lipid droplet-associated protein, when deactivated, will prevent the interaction of lipases with triglycerides in the lipid droplet and grasp the ATGL co-activator, comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58) (a.k.a. [[ABHD5]]). When perilipin 1A is phosphorylated by PKA, it releases CGI-58 and it expedites the docking of phosphorylated lipases to the lipid droplet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itabe|first1=H|last2=Yamaguchi|first2=T|last3=Nimura|first3=S|last4=Sasabe|first4=N|title=Perilipins: a diversity of intracellular lipid droplet proteins.|journal=Lipids in health and disease|date=28 April 2017|volume=16|issue=1|pages=83|doi=10.1186/s12944-017-0473-y|pmid=28454542|pmc=5410086}}&lt;/ref&gt; CGI-58 can be further phosphorylated by PKA to assist in its dispersal to the cytoplasm.

== Regulation ==
[[File:Metabolism1.jpg|thumb|350px|Illustration of the activation of lipolysis in an [[adipocyte]]. induced by high [[epinephrine]] and low [[insulin]] levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|beta-adrenergic]] receptors on the cell membrane of the adipocyte, which causes [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to be generated inside the cell.&lt;br&gt; The cAMP activate [[protein kinase]]s, which phosphorylate and thus, activate [[hormone-sensitive lipase]]s in the [[adipocyte]]. &lt;br&gt;These lipases cleave free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the lipid droplet of the adipocyte.&lt;br&gt; The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood. &lt;br&gt; The activity of hormone sensitive lipase is regulated by the circulating hormones, [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[epinephrine]]. ]]
Lipolysis can be regulated through [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]'s binding and activation of [[protein kinase A]] (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate lipases, perilipin 1A, and CGI-58 to increase the rate of lipolysis. [[Catecholamine]]s bind to [[7TM receptor]]s (G protein-coupled receptors) on the adipocyte cell membrane, which activate [[adenylate cyclase]]. This results in increased production of cAMP, which activates PKA and leads to an increased rate of lipolysis. Insulin counter-regulates this increase in lipolysis when it binds to insulin receptors on the adipocyte cell membrane. Insulin receptors activate insulin-like receptor substrates. These substrates activate [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]]s (PI-3K) which then phosphorylate [[protein kinase B]] (PKB) (a.k.a. Akt). PKB subsequently phosphorylates [[Phosphodiesterase 3|phosphodiesterase 3B]] (PD3B) which converts cAMP, produced by adenylate cyclase, into 5'AMP. Due to the reduced levels of cAMP, insulin decreases the rate of lipolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jocken|first1=JW|last2=Blaak|first2=EE|title=Catecholamine-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in obesity.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=23 May 2008|volume=94|issue=2|pages=219–30|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.01.002|pmid=18262211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin has additional actions in the mediobasal hypothalamus.

==In blood ==
[[Triglycerides]] are transported through the blood to appropriate tissues ([[adipose]], [[muscle]], etc.) by [[lipoprotein]]s such as Very-Low-Density-Lipoproteins ([[VLDL]]). Triglycerides present on the VLDL undergo lipolysis by the cellular lipases of target tissues, which yields [[glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]]s.  Free fatty acids released into the blood are then available for cellular uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/fatty-acid-oxidation.html |title=Oxidation of Fatty Acids |accessdate=9 April 2012 |first=Michael W |last=King}}{{self-published inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Free fatty acids not immediately taken up by cells may bind to [[Serum albumin|albumin]] for transport to surrounding tissues that require energy. Serum albumin is the major carrier of free fatty acids in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Brody, ''Nutritional Biochemistry'', (Academic Press, 2nd edition 1999), 215-216. {{ISBN|0121348369}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The glycerol also enters the bloodstream and is absorbed by the [[liver]] or [[kidney]] where it is converted to [[glycerol 3-phosphate]] by the enzyme [[glycerol kinase]]. Hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate is converted mostly into [[dihydroxyacetonephosphate]] (DHAP) and then [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] (GA3P) to rejoin the [[glycolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

== Lipogenesis ==
While lipolysis is triglyceride [[hydrolysis]] (the process by which triglycerides are broken down), [[esterification]] is the process by which triglycerides are formed. Esterification and lipolysis are, in essence, reversals of one another.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-255642-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Baldwin, Kenneth David Sutherland |author2=Brooks, George H. |author3=Fahey, Thomas D. |title=Exercise physiology: human bioenergetics and its applications |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-07-255642-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">'''Metallate''' is the name given to any complex [[anion]] containing a [[metal]] ligated to several [[atom]]s or small groups. The spelling '''metalate''' is almost as common.
{{Wiktionary}}
Typically, the metal will be one of the [[transition element]]s and the [[ligand]] will be [[oxygen]] or another [[chalcogenide]] or a [[cyanide]] group (though others are known). The chalcogenide metallates are known as [[oxometallate]]s, [[thiometallate]]s, [[selenometallate]]s and [[tellurometallate]]s; the cyanide metallates are known as [[cyanometallate]]s.

'''Oxometallates''' include [[permanganate]] ({{chem|MnO|4|−}}), [[chromate]] ({{chem|CrO|4|2−}}) and [[vanadate]] ({{chem|VO|3|−}} or {{chem|VO|4|3−}}).

'''Thiometallates''' include [[tetrathiovanadate]] ({{chem|VS|4|3−}}), [[tetrathiomolybdate]] ({{chem|MoS|4|2−}}), [[tetrathiotungstate]] ({{chem|WS|4|2−}}) and similar ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=E. |last1=Diemann |first2=A. |last2=Müller |title=Schwefel- und selenverbindungen von übergangsmetallen mit d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-konfiguration |trans-title=Sulfur and selenium compounds of transition metals with d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; configurations |journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews |date=1973 |volume=10 |issue=1–2 |page=79–122 |doi=10.1016/S0010-8545(00)80232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyanometallates''' include [[ferricyanide]] and [[ferrocyanide]].

Metallate is also used as a verb by [[bioinorganic chemistry]] to describe the act of adding metal atoms or ions to a site (synthetic ligand or protein).

'''Mithqāl''' ({{lang-ar|{{big|مثقال}}}}) is a unit of mass equal to 4.5 grams which is mostly used for measuring precious metals, such as [[gold]], and other commodities, like [[saffron]].

The name was also applied as an alternative term for the [[gold dinar]], a coin that was used throughout much of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] from the 8th century onward and survived in parts of Africa until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Johnson|first=Marion|year=1968|title=The Nineteenth-Century Gold 'Mithqal' in West and North Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=9|number=4|pages=547–569|issn=0021-8537|jstor=180144|doi=10.1017/s0021853700009038}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of [[Mozambique]]'s currency since 1980, the ''[[metical]]'', is derived from ''mithqāl''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/lingua-portuguesa/metical "Metical"] in ''Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa com Acordo Ortográfico''. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003-2015. Accessed 1 April 2015. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''mithqāl'' ({{lang-ar|{{big|مثقال}}}}; “weight, unit of weight”) comes from the Arabic ''thaqala'' ({{big|ثقل}}), meaning “to weigh”. Other variants of the unit in English include ''miskal'' (from [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Urdu]] {{big|مثقال}}; ''misqāl''), ''mithkal, mitkal'' and ''mitqal.''

== Indian mithqaal ==
In [[India]], the measurement is known as ''mithqaal''. It contains 4 mashas and 3½ raties (rata'ii; مثقال).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfovAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=mithqal+mashas&amp;dq=mithqal+mashas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-tWY5uDTAhXLDcAKHWwLAFsQ6AEINjAD|title=Quarterly Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|last=|first=|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Pakistan Historical Society.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
Shortly after the clinical use of mupirocin began, strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' that were [[drug resistance|resistant]] to mupirocin emerged, with [[nares]] clearance rates of less than 30% success.&lt;ref name="pmid9511032"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cookson BD |title=The emergence of mupirocin resistance: a challenge to infection control and antibiotic prescribing practice |journal=J.

Other antibiotic agents, such as [[azelaic acid]], [[nitrofurazone]], [[silver sulfadiazine]], and [[ramoplanin]] have been shown to be effective against MuH strains.&lt;ref name="pmid9511032"/&gt;

Most strains of ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'', a causative agent in the skin disease [[acne vulgaris]], are naturally resistant to mupirocin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceofacne.com/antibiotic-susceptibility-of-propionibacterium-acnes/ |title=Antibiotic Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes. |publisher=ScienceOfAcne.com |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729063418/http://scienceofacne.com/antibiotic-susceptibility-of-propionibacterium-acnes/ |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of action of mupirocin differs from other clinical antibiotics, rendering [[cross-resistance]] to other antibiotics unlikely.&lt;ref name="pmid9511032"/&gt; However, the MupA gene may [[Cotransformation|co-transfer]] with other antibacterial resistance genes. This has been observed already with resistance genes for [[triclosan]], [[tetracycline]], and [[trimethoprim]].&lt;ref name="pmid9511032"/&gt;  It may also result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.

==Mechanism of action==
Mupirocin reversibly binds to the isoleucyl t-RNA synthetase in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''Streptococcus'', resulting in [[Protein synthesis inhibitor|inhibition of protein synthesis]]. [[DNA]] and [[cell wall]] formation are also negatively impacted to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name="pmid659331"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes J, Mellows G |title=On the mode of action of pseudomonic acid: inhibition of protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus |journal=J.

===Biosynthesis of pseudomonic acid A===
The 74 [[Kilobase|kb]] mupirocin [[gene cluster]] contains six [[protein domain|multi-domain]] [[enzymes]] and twenty-six other [[peptide]]s (Table 1).&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Sayed AK, Hothersall J, Cooper SM, Stephens E, Simpson TJ, Thomas CM |title=Characterization of the mupirocin biosynthesis gene cluster from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 |journal=Chem.

The mupirocin cluster exhibits an atypical [[acyltransferase]] (AT) organization, in that there are only two AT domains, and both are found on the same protein, MmpC. These AT domains are the only domains present on MmpC, while the other three type I PKS proteins contain no AT domains.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; The mupirocin pathway also contains several tandem [[acyl carrier protein]] doublets or triplets. This may be an adaptation to increase the throughput rate or to bind multiple substrates simultaneously.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt;

Pseudomonic acid A is the product of an [[esterification]] between the 17C polyketide monic acid and the 9C [[fatty acid]] 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid. The possibility that the entire molecule is assembled as a single polyketide with a [[Baeyer-Villiger]] [[oxidation]] inserting an [[oxygen]] into the carbon backbone has been ruled out because C1 of monic acid and C9' of 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid are both derived from C1 of acetate.&lt;ref name="pmid402372"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feline TC, Jones RB, Mellows G, Phillips L |title=Pseudomonic acid.

===Monic acid biosynthesis===
Biosynthesis of the 17C monic acid unit begins on MmpD (Figure 1).&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; One of the AT domains from MmpC may transfer an activated acetyl group from acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) to the first ACP domain. The chain is extended by malonyl-CoA, followed by a SAM-dependent [[methylation]] at C12 (see Figure 2 for PA-A numbering) and reduction of the B-keto group to an alcohol. The dehydration (DH) domain in module 1 is predicted to be non-functional due to a mutation in the [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] [[active site]] region. Module 2 adds another two carbons by the malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by ketoreduction (KR) and dehydration. Module three adds a malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by SAM-dependent methylation at C8, ketoreduction, and dehydration. Module 4 extends the molecule with a malonyl-CoA unit followed by ketoreduction.

Assembly of monic acid is continued by the transfer of the 12C product of MmpD to MmpA.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; Two more rounds of extension with malonyl-CoA units are achieved by module 5 and 6. Module 5 also contains a KR domain.

===Post-PKS tailoring===

The keto group at C3 is replaced with a methyl group in a multi-step reaction (Figure 3). MupG begins by [[Decarboxylation|decarboxylating]] a malonyl-ACP. The [[alpha carbon]] of the resulting acetyl-ACP is linked to C3 of the polyketide chain by MupH. This intermediate is dehydrated and decarboxylated by MupJ and MupK, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt;

The formation of the [[pyran]] ring requires many enzyme-mediated steps (Figure 4). The double bond between C8 and C9 is proposed to migrate to between C8 and C16.&lt;ref name="pmid16039529"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper SM |title=Shift to Pseudomonic acid B production in P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 by mutation of mupirocin tailoring genes mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE |journal=Chem. Biol. |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=825–33 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16039529 |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2005.05.015 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Laosripaiboon W |author3=Rahman AS |display-authors=3 |last4=Hothersall |first4=J |last5=Elsayed |first5=A |last6=Winfield |first6=C |last7=Crosby |first7=J |last8=Cox |first8=R |last9=Simpson |first9=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene knockout]] experiments of mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE have eliminated PA-A production.&lt;ref name="pmid16039529"/&gt; PA-B production is not removed by these knockouts, demonstrating that PA-B is not created by hydroxylating PA-A. A knockout of mupW eliminated the pyran ring, identifying MupW as being involved in ring formation.&lt;ref name="pmid16039529"/&gt; It is not known whether this occurs before or after the [[esterification]] of monic acid to 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid.

The [[epoxide]] of PA-A at C10-11 is believed to be inserted after pyran formation by a [[cytochrome P450]] such as MupO.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; A gene knockout of mupO abolished PA-A production but PA-B, which also conatins the C10-C11 epoxide, remained.&lt;ref name="pmid16039529"/&gt; This indicates that MupO is either not involved or is not essential for this epoxidation step.

===9-Hydroxy-nonanoic acid biosynthesis===

The nine-carbon [[fatty acid]] 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid (9-HN) is derived as a separate compound and later esterified to monic acid to form pseudomonic acid. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeled [[acetate]] feeding has shown that C1-C6 are constructed with acetate in the canonical fashion of [[fatty acid synthesis]]. C7' shows only C1 labeling of acetate, while C8' and C9' show a reversed pattern of 13C labeled acetate.&lt;ref name="pmid402372"/&gt; It is speculated that C7-C9 arises from a 3-hydroxypropionate starter unit, which is extended three times with malonyl-CoA and fully reduced to yield 9-HN. It has also been suggested that 9-HN is initiated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG). This latter theory was not supported by feeding of [3-&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C] or [3,6-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]-HMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Martin | first1 = FM| last2 = Simpson | first2 = TJ| doi = 10.1039/P19890000207| title = Biosynthetic studies on pseudomonic acid (mupirocin), a novel antibiotic metabolite of Pseudomonas fluorescens| journal = Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 1| pages = 207–209| year = 1989 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is proposed that MmpB to catalyzes the synthesis of 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; It does not contain an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction.&lt;ref name="pmid12770824"/&gt; It also remains possible that 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid is derived partially or entirely from outside of the mupirocin cluster.

}}''The Sustainable Development Unit (SDU)''  is a [[United Kingdom|British]] Government Agency with the purpose of embedding the principals of [[sustainable development]], social value and the wider determinants of health across the health and social care system in England. The SDU develops tools, policy and research to help people and organisations to promote sustainable development and adapt to climate change. The SDU is co-funded by NHS England and Public Health England and hosted within NHS England. It has a cross-system advisory group that includes the Department of Health, DEFRA and most of the major national health agencies. The SDU calculated the first comprehensive carbon footprint for the NHS in 2008 and in 2012 for the whole health and social care system. The NHS was the first major organisation to measure its Scope 3 Supply Chain Carbon Emissions in 2008 and recognise that it was impossible to achieve its carbon reduction targets without also working to achieve a significant reduction in supply chain emissions.  

SDU staff are based in Cambridge.

==History==

NHS SDU was set up in 2008 by the CEO of the NHS [[Sir David Nicholson]].

It was formed by the NHS in England under the auspices of the Office of the Strategic Health Authorities (OSHA) and originally hosted by NHS East of England and its Chief Executive, [[Sir Neil McKay]].

In 2013 the SDU dropped 'NHS' from its title when it took on responsibility for the whole health and care sector. It was at this point that it became co-funded by and accountable to both NHS England and Public Health England, and began reporting to a cross-system advisory board with representation from the Department of Health, DEFRA, DH Arm's Length Bodies (including NHS Improvement, NICE, Care Quality Commission, NHS Digital, Health Education England) and key national agencies such as NHS Property Services, The Kings Fund, The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers.

[[Image:Neon transformer.jpg|thumb|An iron cored neon-sign transformer, with a 9-volt battery for scale.]]

A '''neon-sign transformer''' (NST) is a [[transformer]] made for the purpose of powering a [[neon sign]]. They convert line voltage from the 120-347&amp;nbsp;V up to high voltages, in the range of 2 to 15 kV. These transformers supply between 18-30 mA; 60 mA on special order( &lt;ref&gt;Neon, Claude, 1905; Neon Signs, Miller &amp; Fink, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;)  A more general designation would be "luminous tube transformer", because many other gases are used in luminous [[gas discharge]] tubes. 

== Types ==
Older NSTs are simply iron-cored transformers, usually embedded in [[asphalt]] to reduce noise. The core either has a magnetic [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]], or a gap in the iron core, both of which serve to current-limit the output, allowing them to run indefinitely in [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] conditions. They can also run indefinitely with no load. Iron cored varieties are quite heavy, for example a 15 kV, 60 mA device may weigh up to 20&amp;nbsp;kg (44 lb).
Some newer manufactured iron cored NSTs include a large [[capacitor]] in parallel with the output for PFC ([[power factor correction]]). This serves to correct the shift in the phase of voltage and current caused by the large [[inductance]] of the transformer.

Since the 1990s, manufacturers have been producing [[switch mode power supply|switch mode power supplies]] to power neon signs. These generate the same voltage and current ranges as iron cored transformers, but in much smaller, lighter designs at high frequency (not the common 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz). They are gradually replacing iron cored transformers in neon signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.a1designs.co.uk/top-safety-accreditation-for-a1designs/|title=Top Safety Accreditation for neon signs|last=|first=|date=2016-06-20|work=|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All NSTs are designed to produce a high voltage starting pulse to a tube, then limit the current through the tube when it has started. This is opposite of most line transformers, which will produce full voltage to a load even if overloaded, unless the resistance of windings is too great to allow the excess current or until a winding burns out.

== Other uses ==
Besides the obvious purpose of powering neon signs, iron cored NST's are often used by hobbyists for:
* [[Tesla coil]] power supplies – used in small to medium-sized Tesla coils as the main source of high voltage.
* [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]] – a climbing arc device often pictured in older horror films.
* Charging [[Capacitors]] – an NST makes a useful high voltage power supply to charge high voltage [[capacitors]]. Although the output of an NST is [[Alternating current|AC]], it can be rectified by the proper [[diode]] or [[bridge rectifier]].
* [[Lichtenberg figure]]s can be created in wood with high voltage transformers, using water and salts  to make the wood more conductive.
* Because of the lower current, neon sign transformers are safer than microwave transformers which output 2100-2500 V 500 mA.

==Safety==
*[[electric shock|Electrocution]] – The shock from a neon sign transformer could be lethal. The high voltage allows a large current to flow, even with light contact against dry skin. The transformer is current-limited, but typically to a level well above the threshold for [[ventricular fibrillation]]. 
*UV Light – The [[ultraviolet light]] emitted from the high voltage electrical arc can be harmful to ones eyes.  It is recommended that the arc be viewed through the appropriate [[welding]] goggles or at the very least a high quality pair of [[sunglasses]].
* [[Ozone]] – the production of ozone can be noticeable when there are problems with a luminous tube transformer installation. Ozone usually indicates failed secondary wiring, loose connections, high [[capacitive coupling|capacitance coupling]], or a failing transformer.
* [[Fires]] – The arc length at 15 kV is in excess of  5 cm (2&amp;nbsp;in){{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.

[[File:Brussel Midi MS96.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], overhead wires suspended across multiple tracks.]]

An '''overhead line''' or '''overhead wire''' is used to transmit [[electrical energy]] to [[tram]]s, [[trolleybus|trolleybu]]ses or [[trains]]. It is known variously as:
* '''Overhead contact system''' ('''OCS''')
* '''Overhead line equipment''' ('''OLE''' or '''OHLE''')
* '''Overhead equipment''' ('''OHE''')
* '''Overhead wiring''' ('''OHW''') or '''overhead lines''' ('''OHL''')
* '''Catenary'''
* '''Trolley wire'''
* '''Traction wire'''

In this article, the generic term ''overhead line'' is used, as used by the [[International Union of Railways]].&lt;ref&gt;UIC English/French/German Thesaurus.&lt;/ref&gt;

An overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires (or [[Overhead line#Overhead conductor rails|rails]], particularly in tunnels) situated over [[rail tracks]], raised to a high electrical potential by connection to feeder stations at regular intervals. The feeder stations are usually fed from a [[High voltage|high-voltage]] [[Electricity distribution|electrical grid]].

== Overview ==
[[File:3rd rail to overhead wire transition zone on the Skokie Swift.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Third rail to overhead wire transition zone on Chicago's [[Yellow Line (CTA)|Yellow Line]] (the "Skokie Swift")]]
Electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], [[bow collector]] or [[trolley pole]]. It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire. Current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails. Non-electric [[locomotive]]s (such as [[Diesel locomotive|diesels]]) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line, although there may be difficulties with [[Structure gauge|overhead clearance]]. Alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include [[third rail]], [[ground-level power supply]], [[Electric vehicle battery|batteries]] and [[electromagnetic induction]].

== Construction ==
[[File:Pociąg sieciowy pod Łowiczem.jpeg|thumb|right|[[lineman (technician)|Linemen]] on a [[maintenance of way]] vehicle repairing overhead lines (Poland)]]
To achieve good high-speed current collection, it is necessary to keep the contact wire geometry within defined limits. This is usually achieved by supporting the contact wire from a second wire known as the ''{{visible anchor|messenger wire}}'' (in the US &amp; Canada) or ''catenary'' (in the UK). This wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points, a [[catenary]] curve, thus the use of "catenary" to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system. This wire is attached to the contact wire at regular intervals by vertical wires known as "droppers" or "drop wires". It is supported regularly at structures, by a [[pulley]], link or [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]]. The whole system is then subjected to mechanical [[Tension (physics)|tension]].

As the contact wire makes contact with the pantograph, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph is worn down. The "straight" wire between the supports cause the contact wire to cross over the whole surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve, causing uniform wear and avoiding any notches. On straight track, the contact wire is [[zigzag]]ged slightly to the left and right of the centre at each successive support so that the pantograph wears evenly. The movement of the contact wire across the head of the pantograph is called the "sweep".

The zigzagging of the overhead line is not required for trolley poles.

Depot areas tend to have only a single wire and are known as "simple equipment" or "trolley wire". When overhead line systems were first conceived, good current collection was possible only at low speeds, using a single wire. To enable higher speeds, two additional types of equipment were developed:

*Stitched equipment uses an additional wire at each support structure, terminated on either side of the messenger/catenary wire.
*Compound equipment uses a second support wire, known as the "auxiliary", between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire. Droppers support the auxiliary from the messenger wire, while additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary. The auxiliary wire can be of a more conductive but less wear-resistant metal, increasing transmission efficiency.

Dropper wires traditionally provide physical support of the contact wire without joining the catenary and contact wires electrically. Modern systems use current-carrying droppers, which eliminate the need for separate wires.

The present transmission system originated about 100 years ago. A simpler system was proposed in the 1970s by the Pirelli Construction Company, consisting of a single wire embedded at each support for {{convert|2.5|m}} of its length in a clipped, extruded aluminum beam with the wire contact face exposed. A somewhat higher tension than used before clipping the beam yielded a deflected profile for the wire that could be easily handled at {{convert|250|mph}} by a pneumatic servo pantograph with only 3&amp;nbsp;[[Gravity of Earth|g]] acceleration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

For [[tram]]ways, a contact wire without a messenger wire is used.

=== Parallel overhead lines ===
[[File:Catenaryswitch.jpg|thumb|A switch in parallel overhead lines]]
An electrical circuit requires at least two conductors. Trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit. For a [[trolleybus]], no rails are available for the return current, as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface. Trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return, and two trolley-poles, one contacting each overhead wire. The circuit is completed by using both wires. Parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with [[three-phase AC railway electrification]].

== Tensioning ==
[[File:Oberleitung Radspanner IMG10010.jpg|thumb|Line tensioning in Germany.]]
Catenary wires are kept in mechanical tension because the pantograph causes mechanical [[oscillation]]s in the wire and the [[wave]] must travel faster than the train to avoid producing [[standing wave]]s that would cause wire breakage. Tensioning the line makes waves travel faster.

For medium and high speeds, the wires are generally tensioned by weights or occasionally by hydraulic tensioners. Either method is known as "auto-tensioning" (AT) or "constant tension" and ensures that the tension is virtually independent of temperature. Tensions are typically between {{convert|9|and|20|kN|lbf|abbr=on|lk=on}} per wire. Where weights are used, they slide up and down on a rod or tube attached to the mast, to prevent them from swaying.

For low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant, fixed termination (FT) equipment may be used, with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line. The tension is generally about {{convert|10|kN|lbf|abbr=on}}. This type of equipment sags on hot days and is taut on cold days.

With AT the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the position of the weights with temperature as the overhead line expands and contracts. This movement is proportional to the tension length, the distance between anchors. Tension length has a maximum. For most [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV]] OHL equipment in the UK, the maximum tension length is 1970m.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

An additional issue with AT equipment is that, if balance weights are attached to both ends, the whole tension length is free to move along the track. To avoid this a midpoint anchor (MPA), close to the centre of the tension length, restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the MPA. MPAs are sometimes fixed to low bridges, otherwise anchored to vertical catenary poles or portal catenary supports. A tension length can be seen as a fixed centre point, with the two half tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature.

Most systems include a brake to stop the wires from unravelling completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a [[block and tackle]] arrangement.

== Breaks ==
Lines are divided into sections to limit the scope of an outage and to allow maintenance.

=== Section break ===
[[File:SectionInsulator.png|thumb|A section insulator at a section break in Amtrak's 12 kV catenary.]]
To allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system, the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as "sections". Sections often correspond with tension lengths. The transition from section to section is known as a "section break" and is set up so that the vehicle&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s pantograph is in continuous contact with the wire.

For bow collectors and pantographs, this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length of 3 or 4 wire supports. A new one drops down and the old one rises up, allowing the pantograph to smoothly transfer from one to the other. The two wires do not touch (although the bow collector/pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires). In normal service, the two sections are electrically connected (to different substations if at or near the halfway mark between them) but this can be interrupted for servicing.

On overhead wires designed for trolley poles this is done by having a neutral section between the wires, requiring an insulator. The driver of the [[tram]] or [[trolleybus]] must turn off the power when the trolley pole passes through, to prevent arc damage to the insulator.

Pantograph-equipped locomotives must not run through a section break when one side is de-energized. The locomotive would become trapped, but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines. If the opposite line is de-energized, this voltage transient may trip supply breakers. If the line is under maintenance, injury may occur as the catenary is suddenly energized. Even if the catenary is properly grounded, the [[Electric arc|arc]] generated across the pantograph can damage the pantograph, the catenary insulator or both.

=== Neutral section (phase break) ===
[[File:Neutral Gap Sign.svg|thumb|right|Neutral Section Indication Board used on railways in the [[UK]]]]
Sometimes on a larger electrified railway, tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids, without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases. (Sometimes the sections are powered with different voltages or frequencies.) The grids may be synchronised on a normal basis, but events may interrupt synchronisation. This is not a problem for [[Direct current|DC]] systems, but for [[Alternating current|AC]] systems it is highly undesirable to connect unsynchronised grids. A simple section break is insufficient to guard against this as the pantograph briefly connects both sections.

A neutral section or phase break is used, consisting of two section breaks back-to-back with a short section of line that belongs to neither grid. If the two grids are synchronised this stretch of line is energised (by either supply) and trains run through it normally. If the two supplies are not synchronised it is disconnected from the supplies, leaving it electrically dead, isolating the two grids.

In countries such as France, South Africa and the United Kingdom, a pair of permanent magnets beside the rails at either side of the neutral section operate a bogie-mounted [[transducer]] on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vortok.com/signalling/train-control-magnets/automatic-power-control-apc-magnet|title=Vortok Automatic Power Control Magnet|access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom [[Automatic Warning System|AWS]] equipment is used, but with reversed polarity.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Lineside signs on the approach to the neutral section warn the driver to shut off traction power and coast through the dead section.

On the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], phase breaks were indicated by a position light signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light. When the phase break was active (the catenary sections out of phase), all lights were lit. The position light signal aspect was originally devised by the Pennsylvania Railroad and was continued by [[Amtrak]] and adopted by [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro North]]. Metal signs were hung from the catenary supports with the letters "PB" created by a pattern of drilled holes.

=== Dead section ===
A special category of phase break was developed in America, primarily by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Since its traction power network was centrally supplied and only segmented by abnormal conditions, normal phase breaks were generally not active. Phase breaks that were always activated were known as "Dead Sections": they were often used to separate power systems (for example, the Hell's Gate Bridge boundary between Amtrak and [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro North]]'s electrifications) that would never be in-phase. Since a dead section is always dead, no special signal aspect was developed to warn drivers of its presence, and a metal sign with "DS" in drilled-hole letters was hung from the catenary supports.

=== Gaps ===
[[File:Spoorbrug Meppel - Buitenvaart, Jaagpad - 04.JPG|thumb|A [[swing bridge]] near [[Meppel]], the Netherlands. There is no overhead line on the bridge, the train coasts through with raised pantograph.]]
Occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges, as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails. Electric trains coast across the gaps. To prevent arcing, power must be switched off before reaching the gap. Usually the pantograph must be lowered too.

== Overhead conductor rails ==
[[File:B&amp;O electrification.jpg|thumb|left|300px|B&amp;O's overhead third-rail system at [[Guilford Avenue]] in Baltimore, 1901, part of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]]. The central position of the overhead conductors was dictated by the many tunnels on the line: the '''∩'''-shaped rails were located at the highest point in the roof to give the most clearance&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal |date=10 August 1895 |title=A ninety-six ton electric locomotive |journal=[[Scientific American]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Given limited [[Engineering tolerance#Clearance (civil engineering)|clearance]] such as in [[tunnel]]s, the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]], where a '''∏''' section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; When the overhead line was raised in the [[Simplon Tunnel#Piggyback transport|Simplon Tunnel]] to accommodate taller rolling stock, a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on [[moveable bridges]].

[[File:Shaw's Cove Railroad Bridge closing.webm|thumb|Operation of the overhead conductor rails at Shaw's Cove Railroad Bridge in Connecticut]]
In a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail, there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal (the last post before the movable bridge). For example, the power supply can be done through a catenary wire system near a [[swing bridge]]. The catenary wire typically comprises messenger wire (also called catenary wire) and a contact wire where it meets the pantograph. The messenger wire is terminated at the portal, while the contact wire runs into the overhead conductor rail profile at the transition end section before it is terminated at the portal. There is a gap between the overhead conductor rail at the transition end section and the overhead conductor rail that runs across the entire span of the swing bridge. The gap is required for the swing bridge to be opened and closed. To connect the conductor rails together when the bridge is closed, there is another conductor rail section called "rotary overlap" that is equipped with a motor. When the bridge is fully closed, the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position, connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen G. |last2=Nünlist |first2=Felix |last3=Marti |first3=Reto |title=Electrification of swing and bascule bridges with overhead conductor rails |date=25 September 2000 |publisher=Northend Electrification Project |pages=3-4 |url=http://www.bahnjournalisten.ch/files/anlaesse/referate/Furrer_Frey_Swingbridges_CT.pdf |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short overhead conductor rails are installed at [[tram stop]]s as for the [[Combino Supra#Doha|Combino Supra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2012/infrastructure-cities/rail-systems/icrl201207010.htm Siemens press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crossings ==
[[File:Tramtrol 029148ed.jpg|thumb|left|Tram overhead wire (diagonal) crossing trolleybus wires (horizontal), photographed in Bahnhofplatz, Bern, Switzerland]]
[[File:Tramtrol 029148an.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated version of the at left photo, highlighting components
{{legend|#0C21EE|tram conductor}}
{{legend|#089B0C|trolley bus wires}}
{{legend|#CAFF06|insulated trough}}]]

[[Tram]]s draw their power from a single overhead wire at about 500 to 750 [[volts|V]]. [[Trolleybus]]es draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage, and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires. This is usually done by the trolleybus wires running continuously through the crossing, with the tram [[electrical conductor|conductors]] a few centimetres lower. Close to the junction on each side, the tram wire turns into a solid bar running parallel to the trolleybus wires for about half a metre. Another bar similarly angled at its ends is hung between the trolleybus wires, electrically connected above to the tram wire. The tram's pantograph bridges the gap between the different conductors, providing it with a continuous pickup.

Where the tram wire crosses, the trolleybus wires are protected by an inverted trough of [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material extending {{convert|20|or|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} below.

Until 1946, a level crossing in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] connected the [[railway]] south of Stockholm Central Station and a tramway. The tramway operated on 600-700 V DC and the railway on [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15 kV AC]]. In the Swiss village of [[Oberentfelden]], the [[Wynental and Suhrental Railway|WSB tramway]] operating at 750 V DC crosses the [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB]] line at 15 kV AC; there used to be a similar crossing between the WSB and the SBB at [[Suhr,_Aargau|Suhr]], this has been replaced by an underpass in 2010. Some crossings between tramway/light rail and railways are extant in Germany. In [[Zürich]], Switzerland, [[Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich|VBZ]] [[trolleybus]] line 32 has a level crossing with the 1,200 V [[Direct current|DC]] [[Uetliberg railway line]]; at many places, trolleybus lines cross the tramway. In some cities, trolleybuses and trams shared a positive (feed) wire. In such cases, a normal trolleybus frog can be used.

Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead.

=== Australia ===
Many cities had trams and trolleybuses using trolley poles. They used insulated crossovers, which required tram drivers to put the controller into neutral and coast through. Trolleybus drivers had to either lift off the accelerator or switch to auxiliary power.

In [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], tram drivers put the controller into neutral and coast through section insulators, indicated by insulator markings between the rails.

Melbourne has three [[level crossing]]s between electrified suburban railways and tram lines. They have mechanical switching arrangements (changeover switch) to switch the 1,500V DC overhead of the railway and the 650V DC of the trams, called a Tram Square.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071208021201/http://www.tmsv.org.au/papers/lvlcross.htm TMSV: Tramway level crossings in Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals have been advanced to grade separate these crossings or divert the tram routes.

=== Greece ===
[[Athens]] has two crossings of [[Athens Tram|tram]] and trolleybus wires, at Vas. Amalias Avenue and Vas. Olgas Avenue, and at Ardittou Street and Athanasiou Diakou Street. They use the above-mentioned solution.

=== Italy ===
In [[Rome]], at the crossing between viale Regina Margherita and via Nomentana, tram and trolleybus lines cross: tram on viale Regina Margherita and trolleybus on via Nomentana. The crossing is orthogonal, therefore the typical arrangement was not available.

In [[Milan]], most [[Trams in Milan|tram lines]] cross [[Trolleybuses in Milan|its circular trolleybus line]] once or twice. Trolleybus and tram wires run parallel in streets such as viale Stelvio and viale Tibaldi.

== Multiple overhead lines ==
[[File:Overhead conductor rails.jpg|thumb|Two [[Overhead line#Overhead conductor rails|overhead conductor rails]] for the same track. Left, 1,200 V DC for the [[Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn|Uetliberg railway]] (the pantograph is mounted asymmetrically to collect current from this rail); right, 15&amp;nbsp;kV AC for the Sihltal railway]]

Some railways used two or three overhead lines, usually to carry [[three-phase]] current. This is used only on the [[Gornergrat Railway]] and [[Jungfrau Railway]] in Switzerland, the [[Petit train de la Rhune]] in France, and the [[Corcovado Rack Railway]] in Brazil. Until 1976, it was widely used in Italy. On these railways, the two conductors are used for two different phases of the three-phase AC, while the rail was used for the third phase. The neutral was not used.

Some three-phase AC railways used three overhead wires. These were an experimental railway line of Siemens in Berlin-Lichtenberg in 1898 (length 1.8 kilometres), the military railway between Marienfelde and Zossen between 1901 and 1904 (length 23.4 kilometres) and an 800-metre-long section of a coal railway near Cologne between 1940 and 1949.

On DC systems, bipolar overhead lines were sometimes used to avoid [[galvanic corrosion]] of metallic parts near the railway, such as on the [[Chemin de fer de la Mure]].

All systems with multiple overhead lines have high risk of short circuits at switches and therefore tend to be impractical in use, especially when high voltages are used or when trains run through the points at high speed.

The [[Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn]] has two lines with different electrification. To be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks, the [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal line]] has its overhead wire right above the train, whilst the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg line]] has its overhead wire off to one side.

==Overhead catenary==
[[File:Two images showing catenary and trolley wire systems.jpg|thumb|left|Catenary (upper photo) is suited to higher-speed rail vehicles. Trolley wire (lower photo) is suited to slower-speed trams (streetcars) and light rail vehicles.]]

[[File:Overhead rail P1220601.jpg|thumb|right|Overhead feeding rail on the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] [[RER C|Line C]] trenches and tunnels in central Paris]]

[[File:Overhead lines JR West 001.JPG|thumb|right|Compound catenary equipment of [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]]]]

[[File:60163 Tornado 7 March 2009 Berwick.jpg|thumb|right|An older rail bridge in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], retrofitted to include overhead catenary lines]]

A catenary is a system of overhead [[wire]]s used to supply [[electricity]] to a [[locomotive]], [[tram]] ([[streetcar]]), or [[light rail]] vehicle that is equipped with a [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]].

[[File:Overhead_catenary_bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Gantry with old and new suspended equipment at [[Grivita train station]]&lt;!-- Not to be confused with the [[Grivita metro station]] --&gt;, [[Bucharest]].]]

Unlike simple overhead wires, in which the uninsulated wire is attached by clamps to closely spaced crosswires supported by poles, catenary systems use at least two wires. The catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures, and a second wire is held in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] by the messenger wire, attached to it at frequent intervals by [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]]s and connecting wires known as ''droppers''. The second wire is straight and level, parallel to the [[rail track]], suspended over it as the roadway of a [[suspension bridge]] is over water.

Catenary systems are suited to high-speed operations whereas simple wire systems, which are less expensive to build and maintain, are common on light rail or tram (streetcar) lines, especially on city streets. Such vehicles can be fitted with either a pantograph or [[trolley pole]].

The [[Northeast Corridor]] in the [[United States]] has catenary over the {{convert|600|mi}} between [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] for [[Amtrak]]'s [[inter-city rail|inter-city]] trains. [[Commuter rail]] agencies including [[MARC Train|MARC]], [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]], [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]], and [[Metro-North Railroad]] utilize the catenary to provide local service.

In [[Cleveland, Ohio]] the [[Blue, Green, and Waterfront Lines (Cleveland)|interurban/light rail]] lines and the [[Red Line (Cleveland)|heavy rail]] line use the same overhead wires, due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through Cleveland between the east coast and Chicago. Trains switched from steam to electric locomotives at the Collinwood rail yards about {{Convert|10|mi|km}} east of Downtown and at [[Linndale]] on the west side. When Cleveland constructed its rapid transit (heavy rail) line between the airport, downtown, and beyond, it employed a similar catenary, using electrification equipment left over after railroads switched from steam to diesel. Light and heavy rail share trackage for about {{Convert|3|mi|km}} along the [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red (heavy rail) line]], [[Blue and Green Lines (Cleveland)|Blue and Green interurban/light rail lines]] between [[Cleveland Union Terminal]] and just past East 55th Street station, where the lines separate.

Part of the [[Boston, Massachusetts]] [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] through the northeast suburbs uses overhead lines, as does the Green Line.

=== Height ===
The height of overhead wiring can create hazards at [[level crossing]]s, where it may be struck by road vehicles. Warning signs are placed on the approaches, advising drivers of the maximum safe height.

The wiring in most countries is too low to allow [[Double-stack rail transport|double stack container]] trains. The [[Channel Tunnel]] has an extended height overhead line to accommodate double-height car and truck transporters. [[Railways in India|India]] is proposing a network of freight-only lines that would be electrified with extra height wiring and pantographs.

==Problems with overhead equipment==
Overhead line equipment can be adversely affected by strong winds causing wires to swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/kamerasystem-skal-advare-lokofoerere-mod-svingende-koereledninger-paa-storebaelt-163994|title=Kamerasystem skal advare lokoførere mod svingende køreledninger på Storebælt|date=5 November 2013|access-date=25 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power storms can knock the power out with [[lightning]] strikes on systems{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} with overhead wires, stopping trains following a [[Voltage spike|power surge]].

During cold or frosty weather, ice may coat overhead lines. This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Matt |last= Stewart |date= 21 May 2012 |title= Matangi trains 'more susceptible' to frost |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/6956618/Matangi-trains-more-susceptible-to-frost |newspaper= [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |location= Wellington |accessdate= 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overhead line equipment may require reconstruction of bridges to provide safe electrical clearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Overhead equipment, like most electrified systems, requires a greater [[capital expenditure]] when building the system than an equivalent non-electric system. While a conventional rail line requires only the grade, ballast, ties and rails, an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures, lines, insulators, power-control systems and power lines, all of which require maintenance. This makes non-electrical systems more attractive in the short term, although electrical systems can pay for themselves eventually. Also, the added construction and maintenance cost-per-mile makes overhead systems less attractive on long-distance railways, such as those found in North America, where the distances between cities are typically far greater than in Europe. Such long lines require enormous investment in overhead line equipment, and major difficulties confront energizing long portions of overhead wire on a permanent basis, especially in areas where energy demand already outstrips supply.

Many people consider overhead lines to be "visual pollution", due to the many support structures and complicated system of wires and cables that fill the air. Such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== History ==
The first tram with overhead lines was presented by [[Werner von Siemens]] at the International Electric Exposition in Paris 1881: the installation was removed after that event. In October 1883, the first permanent tram service with overhead lines was on the [[Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram]] in Austria. The trams had bipolar overhead lines, consisting of two U-pipes, in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles. In April to June 1882, Siemens had tested a similar system on his [[Electromote]], an early percursor of the [[trolleybus]].

Much simpler and more functional was an overhead wire in combination with a pantograph borne by the vehicle and pressed at the line from below. This system, for rail traffic with a unipolar line, was invented by [[Frank J. Sprague]] in 1888. From 1889 it was used at the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], pioneering electric traction.

PAMACC's aim is to support journalists to improve their reporting on [[climate change]] and has set up a [http://pamaccafrica.blogspot.co.uk/ website] to share their stories.

It has regional coordinators, who will encourage journalists to set up national bodies in each country. The coordinator for Southern Africa, Sellina Nkowani from [[Malawi]], has also stated that she wants the alliance to encourage more women journalists to report on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mwnation.com/npl-journo-elected-to-climate-change-regional-body NPL journo elected to climate change regional body.

The other regional coordinators are Elias Ngalame from Cameroon (for Central Africa), Atayi Babs Opaluwah from [[Nigeria]] (for West Africa) and Kizito Makoye from [[Tanzania]] (for East Africa). Isaiah Esipisu from Kenya will act as the continent-wide coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201306260525.html Ijayi, S. 2013.

In [[electrical engineering]], the '''power factor''' of an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical power system is defined as the [[ratio]] of the ''[[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real power]]'' absorbed by the [[electrical load|load]] to the ''apparent power'' flowing in the circuit, and is a [[dimensionless number]] in the [[closed interval]] of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one indicates the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the two. [[Power (physics)|Real power]] is the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the electricity for performing work. Apparent power is the product of average current and voltage. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power may be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source.

In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.

'''Power-factor correction''' increases the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with low power factor (such as [[induction motor]]s) can be corrected with a passive network of [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s. Non-linear loads, such as [[rectifier]]s, distort the current drawn from the system. In such cases, active or passive power factor correction may be used to counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central [[electrical substation|substation]], spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.

== Linear circuits ==

The blue line shows all the power is stored temporarily in the load during the first quarter cycle and returned to the grid during the second quarter cycle, so no real power is consumed.]]

[[File:Power factor 0.7.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Instantaneous and average power calculated from AC voltage and current with a lagging power factor (&lt;math&gt;\varphi=45^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos\varphi\approx0.71&lt;/math&gt;). The blue line shows some of the power is returned to the grid during the part of the cycle labeled &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In a purely resistive AC circuit, voltage and current waveforms are in step (or [[Phase (waves)|in phase]]), changing polarity at the same instant in each cycle. All the power entering the load is consumed (or dissipated).

Where [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] loads are present, such as with [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s, energy storage in the loads results in a phase difference between the current and voltage waveforms. During each cycle of the AC voltage, extra energy, in addition to any energy consumed in the load, is temporarily stored in the load in [[Electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s, and then returned to the power grid a fraction of the period later.

Because [[high voltage]] alternating current distribution systems are essentially quasi-linear circuit systems subject to continuous daily variation, there is a continuous "ebb and flow" of nonproductive power. Non productive power increases the current in the line, potentially to the point of failure.

Thus, a circuit with a low power factor will use higher currents to transfer a given quantity of real power than a circuit with a high power factor. A linear load does not change the shape of the waveform of the current, but may change the relative timing (phase) between voltage and current.

Electrical circuits containing dominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a power factor of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, [[solenoid]] valves, transformers, [[Electrical ballast|fluorescent lamp ballasts]], and others) can have a power factor well below 1.

=== Definition and calculation ===
[[AC power]] flow has two components:
* Real power or active power (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) (sometimes called average power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Circuit Analysis|last=Boylestad|first=Robert|publisher=|isbn=978-0-13-097417-4|edition=10th|location=|date=2002-03-04|pages=857}}&lt;/ref&gt;), expressed in [[watt]]s (W)
* Reactive power (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;), usually expressed in [[volt-ampere reactive|reactive volt-amperes]] (var)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SI Units – Electricity and Magnetism |publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission |url=http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm | place = [[Switzerland|CH]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211234311/http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm#si_epo |archivedate = 2007-12-11 |access-date= 14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are combined to the complex power (&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) expressed [[volt-amperes]] (VA). The magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power (&lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;), also expressed in volt-amperes (VA).

The VA and var are non-SI units mathematically identical to the watt, but are used in engineering practice instead of the watt to state what [[physical quantity|quantity]] is being expressed. The [[SI]] explicitly disallows using units for this purpose or as the only source of information about a physical quantity as used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International System of Units (SI) [SI brochure]|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|year=2006|publisher=[[BIPM]]|location=§&amp;nbsp;5.3.2 (p.&amp;nbsp;132, 40 in the [[PDF]] file)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. As power is transferred along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called apparent power. The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total apparent power flowing in the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | id = Std. 100 | title = Authoritative Dictionary of Standards Terms | edition = 7th | isbn = 978-0-7381-2601-2| year = 2000 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IEEE | id = Std. 1459–2000 | title = Trial-Use Standard Definitions for the Measurement of Electric Power Quantities Under Sinusoidal, Nonsinusoidal, Balanced, or Unbalanced Conditions | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7381-1963-2}}.  Note 1, section 3.1.1.1, when defining the quantities for power factor, asserts that real power only flows to the load and can never be negative. As of 2013, one of the authors acknowledged that this note was incorrect, and is being revised for the next edition. See http://powerstandards.com/Shymanski/draft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power triangle ====
[[File:Power triangle diagram.jpg|frameless|upright=1.68]]

One can relate the various components of AC power by using the power triangle in vector space. Real power extends horizontally in the î direction as it represents a purely real component of AC power. Reactive power extends in the direction of ĵ as it represents a purely imaginary component of AC power. Complex power (and its magnitude, Apparent power) represents a combination of both real and reactive power, and therefore can be calculated by using the vector sum of these two components. We can conclude that the mathematical relationship between these components is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                               S &amp;= P + jQ \\
                               |S|^2 &amp;= P^2 + Q^2 \\[3pt]
                               |S| &amp;= \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} \\
  \cos\theta\text{, power factor} &amp;= \frac{P\text{, real power}}{|S|\text{, apparent power}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Increasing the power factor ====
[[File:Increased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.8]]

As the power factor (i.e. cos ''θ'') increases, the ratio of real power to apparent power (which = cos ''θ''), increases and approaches unity (1), while the angle ''θ'' decreases and the reactive power decreases. [As cos ''θ'' → 1, its maximum possible value, ''θ'' → 0 and so Q → 0, as the load becomes less reactive and more purely resistive].

==== Decreasing the power factor ====
[[File:Decreased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.85]]

As the power factor decreases, the ratio of real power to apparent power also decreases, as the angle θ increases and reactive power increases.

==== Lagging and leading power factors ====
There is also a difference between a lagging and leading power factor. The terms refer to whether the phase of the current is leading or lagging the phase of the voltage. A lagging power factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will “consume” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is “consumed” by the inductive load. A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load “supplies” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.

[[File:Lagging-Leading.jpg|frameless|upright=2.66]]

If θ is the [[phase angle]] between the current and voltage, then the power factor is equal to the [[Trigonometric functions|cosine]] of the angle, &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;|P| = |S| \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Since the units are consistent, the power factor is by definition a [[dimensionless number]] between −1 and 1. When power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the load. Power factors are usually stated as "leading" or "lagging" to show the sign of the phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and inductive loads are lagging (current lags voltage).

If a purely resistive load is connected to a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source during the rest of the cycle.

For example, to get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power, if the power factor is unity, 1&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 1 = 1&amp;nbsp;kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs to be transferred to get the same real power. To get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 0.2 = 5&amp;nbsp;kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.

Electrical loads consuming [[AC power|alternating current power]] consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive power is the apparent power. The presence of reactive power causes the real power to be less than the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.

A negative power factor (0 to −1) can result from returning power to the source, such as in the case of a building fitted with solar panels when surplus power is fed back into the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = On the resistance and electromotive forces of the electric arc |first=W. | last = Duddell | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=203 |issue=359–371 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1904.0022  | pages = 512–15 | year = 1901 | quote = The fact that the solid arc has, at low frequencies, a negative power factor, indicates that the arc is supplying power to the alternator…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Analysis of some measurement issues in bushing power factor tests in the field |first=S. |last=Zhang |journal= IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=1350–56 |date=July 2006 |quote=…(the measurement) gives both negative power factor and negative resistive current (power loss) |doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2006.874616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Performance of Grid-Connected Induction Generator under Naturally Commutated AC Voltage Controller |first=A.

=== Power factor correction of linear loads ===
A high power factor is generally desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an [[electric power transmission]] utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.

Power factor correction brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act to cancel the inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power to meet the demand of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow all the way from the utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.

The reactive elements in power factor correction devices can create voltage fluctuations and harmonic noise when switched on or off. They will supply or sink reactive power regardless of whether there is a corresponding load operating nearby, increasing the system's no-load losses. In the worst case, reactive elements can interact with the system and with each other to create resonant conditions, resulting in system instability and severe [[overvoltage]] fluctuations. As such, reactive elements cannot simply be applied without engineering analysis.

[[File:Condensatorenbatterij.jpg|right|thumb|1. [[Reactive Power Control Relay]]; 2. Network connection points; 3. [[Fuse (electrical)|Slow-blow Fuses]]; 4. Inrush Limiting [[Contactor]]s; 5. [[Capacitor]]s (single-phase or three-phase units, delta-connection); 6. [[Transformer]] (for controls and ventilation fans) ]]

An '''automatic power factor correction unit''' consists of a number of [[capacitor]]s that are switched by means of [[contactor]]s. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures power factor in an electrical network. Depending on the load and power factor of the network, the power factor controller will switch the necessary blocks of capacitors in steps to make sure the power factor stays above a selected value.

Instead of using a set of switched [[capacitor]]s, an unloaded [[synchronous motor]] can supply reactive power. The [[reactive power]] drawn by the synchronous motor is a function of its field excitation. This is referred to as a '''[[synchronous condenser]]'''. It is started and connected to the [[electrical network]]. It operates at a leading power factor and puts [[volt-ampere reactive|vars]] onto the network as required to support a system's [[voltage]] or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.

The synchronous condenser's installation and operation are identical to large [[electric motor]]s. Its principal advantage is the ease with which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a variable capacitor. Unlike capacitors, the amount of reactive power supplied is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks.  Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as [[steel mill]]s.

For power factor correction of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic devices such as the [[Static VAR compensator]] or [[STATCOM]] are increasingly used. These systems are able to compensate sudden changes of power factor much more rapidly than contactor-switched capacitor banks, and being solid-state require less maintenance than synchronous condensers.

== Non-linear loads ==
Examples of non-linear loads on a power system are rectifiers (such as used in a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, electric [[welding]] machines, or [[arc furnace]]s. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. Distortion power factor is a measure of how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.
[[File:Power factor 75 2.png|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Sinusoidal voltage and non-sinusoidal current give a distortion power factor of 0.75 for this computer power supply load.]]

=== Non-sinusoidal components ===
In linear circuits having only sinusoidal currents and voltages of one frequency, the power factor arises only from the difference in phase between the current and voltage. This is "displacement power factor".&lt;ref name="FuchsMasoum2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewald Fuchs|author2=Mohammad A. S. Masoum|title=Power Quality in Power Systems and Electrical Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuGcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800988-8|pages=432–|quote=The DPF it the cosine of the angle between these two quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear loads change the shape of the current waveform from a [[sine wave]] to some other form. Non-linear loads create [[harmonic]] currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain [[non-linear]] loads such as [[rectifiers]], some forms of electric lighting, [[electric arc furnace]]s, welding equipment, [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]], variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.

To measure the real power or reactive power, a [[wattmeter]] designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.

=== Distortion power factor ===
The ''distortion power factor'' is the distortion component associated with the harmonic voltages and currents present in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{distortion power factor}
&amp; = \frac{ I_1}{I_{rms}} \\
&amp; = \frac{I_1} {\sqrt{I_1^2+I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} { \sqrt{1+ \frac{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}{I_1^2}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{THD}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total harmonic distortion]] of the load current. 
:&lt;math&gt;THD_i = \frac{\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{h=2}^\infty I_h^2}} {I_1}= \frac{\sqrt{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} {I_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental component of the current and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mbox{rms}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current – both are [[root mean square]]-values (distortion power factor can also be used to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |quote=...and voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result when multiplied with the displacement power factor (DPF) is the overall, true power factor or just power factor (PF):
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{PF} = \frac{\cos{\varphi}} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Distortion in three-phase networks ===
In practice, the local effects of distortion current on devices in a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase distribution network]] rely on the magnitude of certain order harmonics rather than the total harmonic distortion.

For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) have the property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a [[delta-wye transformer]], these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater [[Joule heating|resistive heating]]. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they will result in a non-zero current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral wire]]. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases
and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/harmonics.pdf | title = Power System Harmonics | publisher = Pacific Gas and Electric | chapter = Single-phase load harmonics vs. three-phase load harmonics | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://energylogix.ca/harmonics_and_ieee.pdf | title = Harmonics and IEEE 519 | publisher = EnergyLogix Solutions | chapter = Harmonic Effects | place = [[Canada|CA]] | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger [[eddy currents]] in the magnetic core of the transformer. Eddy current losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer's efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher = Electro-Test |section=Transformers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17th, etc.) combine 120 degrees out of phase, similarly to the fundamental harmonic but in a reversed sequence.  In generators and motors, these currents produce magnetic fields which oppose the rotation of the shaft and sometimes result in damaging mechanical vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |section=Motors |quote=The interaction between the positive and negative sequence magnetic fields and currents produces torsional oscillations of the motor shaft. These oscillations result in shaft vibrations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switched-mode power supplies ===
{{Main|switched-mode power supply#Power factor}}
A particularly important class of non-linear loads is the millions of personal computers that typically incorporate [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1&amp;nbsp;kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple full-wave rectifier that conducted only when the [[Mains electricity|mains]] instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors.  This leads to very high [[peak-to-average ratio|ratios of peak-to-average]] input current, which also lead to a low distortion power factor and potentially serious phase and neutral loading concerns.

A typical switched-mode power supply first converts the AC mains to a DC bus by means of a [[bridge rectifier]] or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the [[rectifier]] is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at [[harmonic]]s of the frequency of the voltage.

This presents a particular problem for the power companies, because they cannot compensate for the harmonic current by adding simple capacitors or inductors, as they could for the reactive power drawn by a linear load. Many jurisdictions are beginning to legally require power factor correction for all power supplies above a certain power level.

Regulatory agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all switched-mode power supplies with output power more than 75&amp;nbsp;W must include passive power factor correction, at least. [[80 Plus]] power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.80plus.org/ | publisher = 80 Plus | title = Certified Power Supplies and Manufacturers | section = What is an 80 PLUS certified power supply?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power factor correction (PFC) in non-linear loads ===

==== Passive PFC ====
The simplest way to control the [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] current is to use a [[electronic filter|filter]] that passes current only at [[utility frequency|line frequency]] (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device look more like a [[linear]] load. An example of passive PFC is a [[valley-fill circuit]].

A disadvantage of passive PFC is that it requires larger inductors or capacitors than an equivalent power active PFC circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |publisher=Nuvation |date=Fall 2006 |title=Power Supply Design Principles: Techniques and Solutions, Part 3 |newspaper=Newsletter |first=Ben |last=Schramm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309134617/http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |archivedate=2007-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Xplore | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1187344 | title = Quasi-active power factor correction with a variable inductive filter: theory, design and practice | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 248–255 | publisher = IEEE| doi = 10.1109/TPEL.2002.807135 | year = 2003 | last1 = Wolfle | first1 = W.H. | last2 = Hurley | first2 = W.G. }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Nuigalway |type=project |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/power_electronics/projects/quasi_active.html |place=[[Ireland|IE]] |title=Power electronics |contribution=Quasi-active Power Factor Correction: The Role of Variable Inductance |last1=Wölfle |first1=W.

==== Active PFC ====
[[File:Active pfc PSU packaging.png|right|thumb|Specifications taken from the packaging of a 610 W [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC power supply]] showing active PFC rating]]

Active PFC is the use of [[power electronics]] to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Fairchild Semiconductor | year = 2004 | type = application note | number = 42047 | title = Power Factor Correction (PFC) Basics | url = http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-42047.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of the active PFC are [[Buck converter|buck]], [[Boost converter|boost]], [[Buck-boost converter|buck-boost]] and [[synchronous condenser]].  Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.

In the case of a switched-mode power supply, a [[boost converter]] is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.

For a three-phase SMPS, the [[Vienna rectifier]] configuration may be used to substantially improve the power factor.

[[Switched-mode power supply|SMPSs]] with passive PFC can achieve power factor of about 0.7–0.75, SMPSs with active PFC, up to 0.99 power factor, while a SMPS without any power factor correction have a power factor of only about 0.55–0.65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Sugawara |first1=I. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Y. |last3=Takeuchi |first3=A. |last4=Teshima |first4=T. |contribution=Experimental studies on active and passive PFC circuits |title=INTELEC 97, 19th International Telecommunications Energy Conference |date=19–23 Oct 1997 |pages=571–78 |doi=10.1109/INTLEC.1997.646051|isbn=978-0-7803-3996-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their very wide input voltage range, many power supplies with active PFC can automatically adjust to operate on AC power from about 100&amp;nbsp;V (Japan) to 240&amp;nbsp;V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.

==== Dynamic PFC ====
Dynamic power factor correction (DPFC), sometimes referred to as "real-time power factor correction," is used for electrical stabilization in cases of rapid load changes (e.g. at large manufacturing sites). DPFC is useful when standard power factor correction would cause over or under correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chavez |first=C. |last2=Houdek |first2=J. A. |title=Dynamic Harmonic Mitigation and power factor correction |journal=IEE |date=9–11 Oct 2007|volume=Electrical Power Quality |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424144 |isbn=978-84-690-9441-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DPFC uses semiconductor switches, typically [[thyristor]]s, to quickly connect and disconnect capacitors or inductors to improve power factor.

== Importance of power factor in distribution systems ==
[[File:Condensor bank 150kV - 75MVAR.jpg|thumb|upright|75 Mvar capacitor bank in a 150 kV substation]]
Power factors below 1.0 require a utility to generate more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to the square of the current). Alternatively, all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current. When the power factor is close to unity, for the same KVA rating of the transformer more load can be connected&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electricalclassroom.com/power-factor/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Utilities typically charge additional costs to commercial customers who have a power factor below some limit, which is typically 0.9 to 0.95.  Engineers are often interested in the power factor of a load as one of the factors that affect the efficiency of power transmission.

With the rising cost of energy and concerns over the efficient delivery of power, active PFC has become more common in consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = ON Semiconductor | year = 2007 | title = Power Factor Correction Handbook | url = http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/HBD853-D.PDF | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Current [[Energy Star]] guidelines for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | place = US | url = http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/computer/Version5.0_Computer_Spec.pdf | publisher = Energy Star | title = Program Requirements for Computers | edition = Version 5.0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC's power supply]]. According to a white paper authored by Intel and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], PCs with internal power supplies will require the use of active power factor correction to meet the ENERGY STAR 5.0 Program Requirements for Computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bolioli |first1=T. |last2=Duggirala |first2=M. |last3=Haines |first3=E. |last4=Kolappan |first4=R. |last5=Wong |first5=H. |year=2009 |publisher=Energy Star |title=Version 5.0 System Implementation |type=white paper |format=PDF |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/program_reqs/Computers_Intel_Whitepaper_Spec5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[IEC EN 61000-3-2|EN 61000-3-2]] requires power factor correction be incorporated into consumer products.

Small customers, such as households, are not usually charged for reactive power and so power factor metering equipment for such customers will not be installed.

== Techniques for measuring the power factor ==

The power factor in a single-phase circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced poly phase circuit is not uniquely defined.

A direct reading power factor meter can be made with a [[moving coil meter]] of the electrodynamic type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the moving part of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load.  One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |author1-link=Donald G. Fink |first2=H. Wayne |last2=Beaty |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=11 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |place=New York |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-07-020974-9 |page=3‐29 paragraph 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another electromechanical instrument is the polarized-vane type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Manual of Electric Instruments Construction and Operating Principles |id=GET-1087A |publisher=General Electric, Meter and Instrument Department |place=Schenectady, New York |year=1949 |pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, just like a polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application.  A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument can be made to register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.

Digital instruments exist that directly measure the time lag between voltage and current waveforms. Low-cost instruments of this type measure the peak of the waveforms. More sophisticated versions measure the peak of the fundamental harmonic only, thus giving a more accurate reading for phase angle on distorted waveforms. Calculating power factor from voltage and current phases is only accurate if both waveforms are sinusoidal.&lt;ref name=ni_white_paper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4278/en/|title=The Fundamentals of FFT-Based Signal Analysis and Measurement in LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI|work=National Instruments Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mnemonics ==
English-language power engineering students are advised to remember:
"ELI the ICE man" or "ELI on ICE" – the voltage E leads the current I in an inductor L; the current leads the voltage in a capacitor C.

Another common mnemonic is CIVIL – in a capacitor (C) the current (I) leads voltage (V), voltage (V) leads current (I) in an inductor (L).

The dashed lines show the limiting value &lt;math&gt; \nu_\text{max} &lt;/math&gt; as Mach number tends to infinity.]]

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''Prandtl–Meyer function''' describes the angle through which a flow can turn [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropically]] for the given initial and final [[Mach number]]. It is the maximum angle through which a sonic ([[Mach number|''M'']] = 1) flow can be turned around a convex corner. For an [[ideal gas]], it is expressed as follows,

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \nu(M) 
&amp; = \int \frac{\sqrt{M^2-1}}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2}\frac{\,dM}{M} \\[4pt]
&amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma -1}} \cdot \arctan \sqrt{\frac{\gamma -1}{\gamma +1} (M^2 -1)} - \arctan \sqrt{M^2 -1}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu \,&lt;/math&gt; is the Prandtl–Meyer function, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the Mach number of the flow and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat capacity ratio|ratio of the specific heat capacities]].

By convention, the constant of integration is selected such that &lt;math&gt;\nu(1) = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

As Mach number varies from 1 to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\nu \,&lt;/math&gt; takes values from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{max} \,&lt;/math&gt;, where

: &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{max} = \frac{\pi}{2} \bigg( \sqrt{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}} -1 \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

{|
|-
|For isentropic expansion, 
|&lt;math&gt;\nu(M_2) = \nu(M_1) + \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|For isentropic compression, 
|&lt;math&gt;\nu(M_2) = \nu(M_1) - \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where, &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value of the angle through which the flow turns, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the flow Mach number and the suffixes "1" and "2" denote the initial and final conditions respectively.

{{distinguish-redirect|Spectral power|Spectral power density}}
In [[radiometry]], '''radiant flux''' or '''radiant power''' is the [[radiant energy]] emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time, and '''spectral flux''' or '''spectral power''' is the radiant flux per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiant flux is the [[watt]] (W), that is the [[joule]] per second ({{nobreak|J/s}}) in SI base units, while that of spectral flux in frequency is the watt per [[hertz]] ({{nobreak|W/Hz}}) and that of spectral flux in wavelength is the watt per metre ({{nobreak|W/m}})—commonly the watt per nanometre ({{nobreak|W/nm}}).

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiant flux===
'''Radiant flux''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name="ISO_9288-1989" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial Q_\mathrm{e}}{\partial t},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*''Q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*''t'' is the time.

===Spectral flux===
'''Spectral flux in frequency''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name="ISO_9288-1989" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral flux in wavelength''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name="ISO_9288-1989" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Relationship with the Poynting vector==
One can show that the radiant flux of a ''surface'' is the [[flux]] of the [[Poynting vector]] through this surface, hence the name "radiant flux":
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \oint_\Sigma \mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}\, \mathrm{d}A = \oint_\Sigma |\mathbf{S}| \cos \alpha\, \mathrm{d}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''Σ'' is the surface;
*'''S''' is the Poynting vector;
*'''n''' is a unit [[Normal (geometry)|normal vector]] to that surface;
*''A'' is the area of that surface;
*''α'' is the angle between '''n''' and '''S'''.
But the time-average of the norm of the Poynting vector is used instead, because in radiometry it is the only quantity that radiation detectors are able to measure:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \oint_\Sigma \langle|\mathbf{S}|\rangle \cos \alpha\, \mathrm{d}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt; • &gt; is the time-average.

'''Stellification''' is a theoretical process by which a [[brown dwarf]] star or [[Jovian planet|Jovian-class planet]] is turned into a star, or by which the luminosity of dim stars is greatly magnified.

==Methods==

===Luminosity magnification===
The fusion reaction of stars is strongly dependent upon temperature. For proton-proton reactions such as found in Earth's sun, the reaction rate scales with the fourth power of temperature (T&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). For other reactions such as the CNO cycle, the proportionality can be as high as T&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, increasing the temperature of the star even a small amount (for example by using reflective solar sails), would create a large increase in power output, resulting in a much higher equilibrium temperature, and therefore luminosity, of the star.&lt;ref&gt;Zubrin, Robert (1999), "Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization", [[Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc.|Jeremy P Tarcher Inc.]], New York, {{ISBN|1585420360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black hole seeding===
Brown dwarf stars and gas-giant planets do not achieve sustained fusion, as they contain insufficient mass to gravitationally compress the reactants to the degree required to initiate a reaction. If the density of the star or planet could be increased, fusion could be initiated. One such method is to "seed" the body with a [[black hole]]. Although the black hole would initially start swallowing the body, the huge output of radiation caused by this would resist the flow of further material. The rate of infall is bound by the [[Eddington limit]], which shows that the luminosity of the resultant star (in Watts) would be equal to approximately six times its mass (in kilograms).

It has been suggested that a black hole could be moved into position by placing an asteroid in orbit around the black hole, and using a [[mass driver]] to direct a stream of matter into it. This could be used to move the black hole either via simple conservation of momentum, or by harnassing the power generated as a result. Zubrin (1999) suggests that a luminosity 1/10,000th that of our own sun would be required to create Earth-like temperatures on planets in close orbit to a brown dwarf, thus requiring a black hole with a mass of 6.1 × 1021&amp;nbsp;kg (about 8% the mass of Earth's [[moon]]).

===Thermonuclear ignition===
It is well established that Jovian-class planets consist mostly of hydrogen and helium.&lt;ref name = Baraffe&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=bibcode&amp;Itemid=129&amp;bibcode=2008A%2526A...482..315BFUL | author1=Baraffe, G | author2=Chabrier, T | author3=Barman, G | year = 2008 | title = Structure and evolution of super-Earth to super-Jupiter exoplanets: I. heavy element enrichment in the interior | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 482 | pages = 315–332 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20079321 | bibcode=2008A&amp;A...482..315B|arxiv = 0802.1810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that concentrations of hydrogen and helium isotopes at certain depths of a gas-giant planet may be sufficient to support a fusion chain reaction, if sufficient energy can be delivered to ignite the reaction. Scientists have proposed{{Citation needed|reason={{december 2016}}|date=December 2016}} that a nuclear warhead, heavily shielded and able to withstand pressures of up to {{convert|1000|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} may be able to reach a depth of {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the atmosphere of Jupiter, potentially deep enough to reach high concentrations of isotopes and ignite a fusion reaction.

==Examples in fiction==
*In [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur C. Clarke's]] ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', an alien construct transforms the hydrogen of Jupiter's atmosphere directly into heavier elements, leading to a subsequent ignition of the planet.
*In ''[[The Saga of Seven Suns]]'' by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], humanity uses alien technology to ignite a gas giant, inadvertently wiping out a race of gaseous aliens who dwelt within and thus initiating an interstellar war.
*In ''[[Star Maker]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]], the eponymous "star maker" is depicted as a rational artist, akin to a god.

[[File:Wolfe Island Wind Project Submarine Power Cable.jpg|thumb|Cross section of the submarine power cable used in [[Wolfe Island Wind Farm]].]]
A '''submarine power cable''' is a [[Power cable|transmission cable]] for carrying [[electric power]] below the surface of the water.&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/business/energy-environment/17power.html Underwater Cable an Alternative to Electrical Towers], Matthew L. Wald, ''[[New York Times]]'', 2010-03-16, accessed 2010-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; These are called "submarine" because they usually carry electric power beneath [[Seawater|salt water]] (arms of the [[ocean]], [[sea]]s, [[strait]]s, etc.) but it is also possible to use submarine power cables beneath [[fresh water]] (large [[lake]]s and [[river]]s). Examples of the latter exist that connect the mainland with large islands in the [[St. Lawrence River]].

==Design technologies==
The purpose of submarine power cables is the transport of electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers.&lt;ref&gt;"Submarine Power Cables - Design, Installation, Repair, Environmental aspects", by T Worzyk, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Modern three-core cables (e.g. for the connection of offshore wind turbines) often carry optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement, in addition to the electrical conductors.

===Conductor===
The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. The conductor can be stranded from individual round wires, or can be a single solid wire. In some designs, profiled wires (keystone wires) are laid up to form a round conductor with very small interstices between the wires.

===Insulation===
Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.
Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420&amp;nbsp;kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30&amp;nbsp;mm. 36&amp;nbsp;kV class cables have only 5.5 – 8&amp;nbsp;mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation can also be used for DC.
Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire cable core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525&amp;nbsp;kV.
Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525&amp;nbsp;kV.
===Armoring===
Cables ≥ 52&amp;nbsp;kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50&amp;nbsp;km is possible). 
In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.
The armoring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass).

=== AC or DC===

Most electrical power transmission systems use [[Alternating current|alternating current (AC)]], because [[transformer]]s can easily change voltages as needed. Direct-current transmission requires a converter at each end of a direct current line to interface to an alternating current grid. A system using submarine power cables may be less costly overall if using [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission, especially on a long link where the capacitance of the cable would require too much additional charging current.  The inner and outer conductors of a cable form the plates of a [[capacitor]], and if the cable is long (on the order of tens of kilometres), the current that flows through this capacitance may be significant compared to the load current. This would require larger, therefore more costly, conductors for a given quantity of usable power to be transmitted.

==Operational submarine power cables==

===Alternating current cables===
[[Alternating current|Alternating-current]] (AC) submarine cable systems for transmitting lower amounts of [[three-phase electric power]] can be constructed with three-core cables in which all three insulated conductors are placed into a single underwater cable. Most offshore-to-shore wind-farm cables are constructed this way.

For larger amounts of transmitted power, the AC systems are composed of three separate single-core underwater cables, each containing just one insulated conductor and carrying one phase of the three phase electric current. A fourth identical cable is often added in parallel with the other three, simply as a spare in case one of the three primary cables is damaged and needs to be replaced. This damage can happen, for example, from a ship's [[anchor]] carelessly dropped onto it. The fourth cable can substitute for any one of the other three, given the proper [[electrical switch]]ing system.

'''Transactive energy''' refers to the economic and control techniques used to manage the flow or exchange of energy within an existing [[electric power system]] in regards to economic and market based standard values of energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/F67634A7-4613-4CB0-BB00-C668CED4CEC1/0/PPDTransactiveEnergy_30Oct14.pdf|title = Transactive Energy: A Surreal Vision or a Necessary and Feasible Solution to Grid Problems?|date = October 2014|accessdate = 2015-11-09|website = www.cpuc.ca.gov|publisher = |last = Atamturk|first = Nilgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept that is used in an effort to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power system, pointing towards a more intelligent and interactive future for the [[energy industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transactive energy: enabling a more intelligent, interactive grid|url = http://www.bpa.gov/news/newsroom/Pages/Transactive-energy-enabling-a-more-intelligent-interactive-grid.aspx|website = www.bpa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transactive energy promotes a network environment for distributed energy nodes as opposed to the traditional hierarchical grid structure. The network structure allows for communication such that all levels of energy generation and consumption are able to interact with one another, a concept that is also known as [[interoperability]]. In transactive energy, interoperability refers to the ability of involved systems to connect and exchange energy information while maintaining workflow and utility constraints.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The network is exponentially more complex than traditional control of generating sources because the demand side of the grid offers millions points of control in contrast with an average 10 to 20 power plant points of control on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delony|first1=Jennifer|title=A Transactive Energy Future:  The Inevitable Rise of Economic-based Grid Control|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-20/issue-5/features/solar-wind-storage-finance/a-transactive-energy-future-the-inevitable-rise-of-economic-based-grid-control.html|accessdate=15 September 2017|work=Renewable Energy World|date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S.-based Efforts==
===Pacific Northwest Demonstration Project===
The Pacific Northwest Demonstration Project is a 5-year [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) funded research and development project created for the purpose of exploring transactive energy concepts at the regional scale that was completed in June 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can One Project Redefine Power Delivery?|url = http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/can-one-demo-project-redefine-power-delivery|website = www.greentechmedia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project participants included 11 utilities, two universities, and multiple technology companies to span five Pacific Northwest states: [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The project evaluated 55 different technologies that could help reduce energy use and power bills, including smart meters, advanced energy storage, and voltage controls.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = PNNL: News - Smart stuff: IQ of Northwest power grid raised, energy saved|url = http://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=4210|website = www.pnnl.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also tested and determined the potential benefits of transactive controls within a regional power grid. Transactive control is a technology developed by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL) that entails "automatic, electronic transactions between energy providers and users about whether or not to sell or buy power."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to test this, transactive signals were used that would exchange information about predicted price and availability of power in real-time. This information was updated every 5 minutes. When peak power demand was predicted, the transactive control was designed to reduce power use. The project confirmed that transactive control technology works and can help improve energy efficiency and reliability, as well as reduce energy cost and encourage renewable energy usage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Public involvement was determined as a key parameter for [[smart grid]] deployment. Participants of the project emphasized the importance of [[customer engagement]] when new technologies are being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Platform for a Modern Grid: Engaging the Customer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBaV8Zu6Dr0&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the project defined the next steps for implementing and improving transactive energy technologies. Several of the project participants have decided to continue smart grid programs on their own, even though the demonstration project is now complete, and new projects have also arisen from the results of the demonstration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===GridAgents and Con Edison's 3G-System of the Future===
The GridAgents™ Platform was created by David A. Cohen at Infotility, was initially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, and implemented early Transactive Energy concepts to manage SmartGrid implementation such as the advanced demonstrations of the Infotility GridAgents software platform being deployed within Con Edison of New York's distribution system. The GridAgents software and applications were installed within Con Edison's 3G: System of the Future (3G/SOF) development efforts. The GridAgents™ software was used for large-scale integration of distributed energy and renewable energy resources into distribution systems with specific applications on SmartGrid based energy networks including Microgrid management, intelligent load control and smart charging applications, including photovoltaics &amp; storage, load control, and future assets such as plug-in hybrid cars. The GridAgents™ Platform is an advanced software foundation (based on multi-agent system technology) designed to work in concert with Service-oriented Architectures and was designed natively to have resource agents and broker agents to allow scalable aggregation of energy-based grid assets enabling them to buy and sell services as well as implement machine learning and AI methods at the system edge. The architecture enables the deployment of communities and eco-systems of intelligent grid resources which can adapt to changing run-time conditions collaborate to solve complex problems, and flexibly accommodate new behavior through the use of plug-in architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4596818/|title = GridAgents™: Intelligent agent applications for integration of distributed energy resources within distribution systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GridSMART Demonstration Project===

The gridSMART® Demonstration Project was implemented by [[AEP Ohio]] from 2009 to 2013. The project tested various new technologies for smart grid implementation on a local level including smart meters, distribution automation, volt-var optimization, consumer programs, plug-in electric vehicles, and smart appliances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aepohio.com/save/residential/demoproject/|title = Leading the Way to a Smarter Grid|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-13|website = www.aepohio.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; AEP utilized Grid Command, a tool that was developed in partnership with [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] in order to model much of the gridSMART circuit layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AEP Ohio’s $290M Plan Scales Up Meters and Distribution Automation|url = http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/AEP-Ohios-290M-Plan-Scales-Up-Meters-and-Distribution-Automation|website = www.greentechmedia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next steps for the next phase of gridSMART were identified to be upgrading current technologies in order to better manage supply, reduce costs, and minimize the number of customers affected by outages. This has been proposed through the installation of [[smart meter]] technology, distribution automation circuit reconfiguration (DACR), and volt var optimization (VVO).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Testing included SMART Shift, a time-of-day rate plan that helps customers save money by [[load shifting]] and SMART Cooling, an air-conditioning technology that helps reduce peak demand in the summer.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = AEP Ohio completes gridSMART Demonstration Project|url = http://aepretirees.com/2014/01/15/aep-ohio-completes-gridsmart-demonstration-project/|website = AEP Retirees &amp; Alumni|accessdate = 2015-11-16|first = Dave|last = Waitkus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the project, eView was developed to assist customers in monitoring their electric use and costs as well as estimating current month usage to measure against their energy budget.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; eView&lt; is an in-home device that communicates with the smart meter through wireless technology and informs the consumer of the price of electricity and how much was being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.smartgrid.gov/files/AEP_Ohio_DE-OE-0000193_Final_Technical_Report_06-23-2014.pdf|title = Final Technical Report AEP Ohio gridSMART Demonstration Project|date = June 2014|accessdate = 2015-11-16|website = www.smartgrid.gov|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project helped AEP Ohio in determining what methods and solutions would best help the company move forward in the growing industry. It was emphasized that customer experience and feedback is a very valuable and effective method of learning how to deliver electricity efficiently to customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===NIST Transactive Energy Challenge===
The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] Transactive Energy (TE) Challenge was designed to bring together researchers, companies, utilities and other grid stakeholders in order to explore the modeling and simulation platforms of TE, and the techniques that may be used to apply TE to real grid problems.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = TE Challenge|url = https://www.nist.gov/smartgrid/techallenge.cfm|website = www.nist.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-13|language = EN-US|first = US Department of Commerce,|last = NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenge is intended to encourage and promote the development of modeling and simulation tools for transactive energy, as well as the development of a transactive energy community in which organizations and individuals can work together to share data and knowledge in order to cooperatively advance transactive energy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It will demonstrate various transactive energy approaches and how it may improve the reliability and efficiency of the electric grid.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Various teams were formed to explore different pathways for TE:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TE Challenge|url = https://pages.nist.gov/TEChallenge/community/|website = pages.nist.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe-based Efforts==
===Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-Pi)===

The goal of the Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-Pi)
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EF-Pi|url = http://fpai-ci.sensorlab.tno.nl/builds/fpai-documentation/development/html/|accessdate = 2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach is to decouple
Smart Grid services from the customer appliances.

This opens up the markets and gives the customer freedom of choice in Smart Grid services.
The End user should be able to combine it with all the connected appliances he already
owns in his house, without losing control and ownership.

The EF-Pi is an [[open-source software]] platform that runs on low-power hardware located at a
convenient place in the building. The EF-Pi communicates directly with smart appliances
inside the building. The EF-Pi has an easy to use interface, which the end user can use to
configure and control his own appliances and get insight in how his appliances are
functioning.

The core of the EF-Pi is the Energy Flexibility Interface (EFI). The EFI is a generic interface
which appliance manufacturers can use to describe energy flexibility, and which Smart Grid
service developers can use to describe how they want to use this flexibility. The EFI
effectively provides a common language for both sides, facilitating interoperability between
all Smart Grid services and [[smart appliance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleh|first=M. S.|last2=Althaibani|first2=A.|last3=Esa|first3=Y.|last4=Mhandi|first4=Y.|last5=Mohamed|first5=A.

== Standards ==

There are no current global standards to facilitate transactive energy.  In the United States, the IEEE has a working group called P825 — Meshing Smart Grid Interoperability Standards to Enable Transactive Energy Networks to develop transactive energy guidelines.

'''''Virunga''''' is a 2014 British [[documentary film]] directed by [[Orlando von Einsiedel]]. It focuses on the conservation work of park rangers within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park]] during the rise of the violent [[M23 Rebellion]] in 2012 and investigates the activity of the British oil company [[Soco International]] within the UNESCO [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virunga National Park|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=[[World Heritage site|World Heritage List]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soco International ended up officially exploring oil opportunities in Virunga in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Oil firm Soco to begin seismic testing in Congo's Virunga park|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/23/congodemocratic-oil-idUKL6N0NF36A20140423|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|date=23 April 2014|author=Reuters Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on 17 April 2014. After airing on [[Netflix]], it was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].

==Synopsis==
The documentary tells the story of four characters fighting to protect [[Virunga National Park]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], home to the world's last [[mountain gorillas]], from war, poaching, and the threat of oil exploration. Following gorilla caregiver André Bauma, central sector warden [[Rodrigue Mugaruka Katembo]], chief warden [[Emmanuel de Merode]], and the French investigative journalist [[Mélanie Gouby]], the film focuses on the natural beauty and biodiversity of Virunga, as well as the complex political and economic issues surrounding oil exploration and armed conflict in the region.

==Production==
Production began in 2012, when von Einsiedel traveled to Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo with the intention of documenting the positive progress which had been made by the park authorities in encouraging tourism and development in the region. However, within three weeks of arriving in Virunga, conflict began with the [[M23 rebellion]] in April 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://virungamovie.com/#about|website=Virunga official website|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shifting the focus of the film to cover the emerging conflict.

Von Einsiedel collaborated with park officials and French journalist Mélanie Gouby to investigate the role of the British oil company Soco International, which had been undertaking activities in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fuchs|first1=Ellise|title='A Constantly Driving Feeling': Interview with Orlando von Einsiedel|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/183563-a-constantly-driving-feeling-interview-with-orlando-von-einsiedel-di/|website=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undercover filming appeared to show Soco representatives offering bribes to park rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Jon|title=Confronting Threats to Virunga, Africa's Oldest Park|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140429-virunga-gorillas-congo-conservation-oil-soco/|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soco International has strongly denied the allegations made in the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOCO comments on unfounded allegations in film and re-emphasises commitment to helping local communities|url=http://www.socointernational.com/soco-comments-on-unfounded-allegations-in-film-and|publisher=[[SOCO International]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Virunga'' had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York City on 17 April 2014. The premiere of the film came just two days after Virunga National Park's chief warden, Emmanuel de Merode, was shot by unidentified gunmen on the road from the city of Goma to the park's headquarters in Rumangabo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgian Emmanuel de Merode shot in DR Congo ambush|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-27049627|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Merode survived the attack, and with his encouragement, the premiere of ''Virunga'' went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Days after shooting, 'Virunga' debuts at Tribeca|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2607366/Days-shooting-Virunga-debuts-Tribeca.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been screened at multiple film festivals around the world, including Canadian festivals [[Hot Docs]] and DOXA; [[Docville]] in Leuven, Belgium; in the U.S. at [[Little Rock Film Festival]] in Arkansas, Mountainfilm in Colorado, [[AFI Docs]] in Washington DC, [[Traverse City Film Festival]] in Michigan.

==Impact==
The allegations brought against Soco International by the documentary, and supported by local NGOs and civil society organizations working in and around Virunga National park, put increased pressure on the company to put an end to its exploration for oil within the protected World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF calls on Soco to explain Virunga allegations in new film|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?219933/WWF-calls-on-Soco-to-explain-Virunga-allegations-in-new-film%22|date=18 April 2014|first=Kate|last=Holt|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]]|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2014, Soco International and the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] announced a joint statement in which the oil company committed "not to undertake or commission any exploratory or other drilling within Virunga National Park unless UNESCO and the DRC government agree that such activities are not incompatible with its World Heritage status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOCO and WWF agree way forward on future activity in Virunga National Park (DRC)|url=http://www.socointernational.com/soco-and-wwf-agree-way-forward-on-future-activity-|publisher=[[Soco International]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely cited as a victory for WWF, which had long been campaigning for Soco to leave the region, and credit was also given to the filmmakers. However, strong concerns about the credibility of this agreement were raised by the filmmakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soco International’s Latest Move in Virunga National Park Leaves More Questions than it Answers|url=http://virungamovie.com/blog/details/8001/soco-internationals-latest-move-in-virunga-national-park-leaves-more-questions-than-it-answers|date=11 June 2014|author=Producers of Virunga|website=Virunga official website|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other NGOs such as [[Global Witness]]ㄝ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British oil company’s back-tracking on World Heritage Site looks like a ruse|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/library/british-oil-company%E2%80%99s-back-tracking-world-heritage-site-looks-ruse|publisher=[[Global Witness]]|date=13 June 2014|first1=Daniel|last1=Balint-Kurti|first2=Nathaniel|last2=Dyer|accessdate=20 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001074144/http://www.globalwitness.org/library/british-oil-company%E2%80%99s-back-tracking-world-heritage-site-looks-ruse|archive-date=1 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sawyer|first1=Ida|title=Dispatches: Congo’s Virunga Park Rangers, Activists Still Need Justice|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/11/dispatches-congo-s-virunga-park-rangers-activists-still-need-justice|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congo Civil Society Express Concerns About SOCO’s Deal With WWF on Virunga Oil Exploration|url=http://www.africanconservation.org/in-focus/virunga/item/congo-civil-society-express-concerns-about-soco-s-deal-with-wwf-on-virunga-oil-exploration|publisher=[[African Conservation Foundation]]|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Wildlife Fund executives now acknowledge that the battle over Virunga is hardly over. Soco has yet to relinquish its operating permits or commit to an unconditional withdrawal. "They're leaving the door open," said Zach Abraham, director of the World Wildlife Fund's global campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/oil-dispute-takes-a-page-from-congos-bloody-past.html?_r=0|title= Oil Dispute Takes a Page From Congo’s Bloody Past|date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2015, BBC reported that the Democratic Republic of Congo says it could potentially redraw the boundaries of Virunga National Park, to allow for oil exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc.com/news/world-africa-31876577|title= DR Congo seeks Virunga park boundary change|date=13 March 2015 |accessdate=13 March 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2015, Soco said it no longer held a stake in the exploration licence for the DRC national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2015/11/04/SOCO-gives-up-oil-license-in-proteced-DRC-park/5081446639436|title= SOCO gives up oil license in proteced DRC park|date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=28 November 2015|first=Daniel J.|last=Graeber|publisher=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voltage Symmetrization System (VSS)''' was developed especially for [[electric power network]]s with great phase voltage [[phase unbalance|unbalance]]. It is a [[three-phase]] system which enables [[earth-fault current]] and charging current elimination. Until now, the operation with earth-fault current compensation has been very complicated for the networks with a great voltage unbalance. In the past, it was necessary to operate such networks with an isolated neutral, solid [[electrical ground|grounding]] or with a significantly untuned [[arc-suppression coil]]. VSS can also substitute for an arc-suppression coil or it can complement it parallelly. Moreover, it contributes to a better function of earth-fault protections for high-resistance earth faults by equalizing phase-to-earth capacity unbalance. The VSS was patented&lt;ref&gt;European Patent EP 1817829&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:Controlling the magnitude of zero sequence voltage by the VSS system.jpg|thumb|Phase-to-earth capacity unbalance influences zero sequence voltage in the network: the higher the phase-to-earth capacity unbalance, the higher the value of zero sequence voltage during arc-suppression coil tuning, and thus the higher the difference in phase voltage.]]
[[File:Arc-suppression coil tuning in an unbalanced network.jpg|thumb|Arc-suppression coil tuning in an unbalanced network with blocked function of automatic voltage symmetrization VSS (see left) and with unblocked function (see right).]]
The three-phase VSS has several basic functions:
* In a faultless condition:
# Symmetrization of phase voltage, i.e. elimination of phase voltage unbalance realized by controlling the phase-to-earth capacity unbalance in the network,
# Reduction of charging current value, i.e. elimination of charging current of phase-to-earth capacity which contributes to reduction of reactive capacity power flow in the network.
* During an [[earth fault]]:
# Elimination of earth-fault current (analogous to an arc-suppression coil,
# Controlling the residual active earth-fault current.


==faultless condition==

If VSS is used for phase voltage unbalance elimination only, it is possible to operate it with a relatively low power. The VSS can effectively eliminate and control the phase voltage unbalance, which is caused by phase-to-ground capacity unbalance. The system enables to automatically maintain phase-to-ground capacity unbalance of the network in the range of assigned parameters, and thus provides the network with symmetrical phase voltage in the assigned range as well. In particular cases, the VSS can be used for artificial increase in phase voltage unbalance of the network, mostly for a short-time period during earth-fault localization in the network.


===Reduction of charging current value in a faultless condition===

If VSS is used for line’s charging current elimination, it is not necessary to install shunt reactor. In single-phase cable lines, the VSS can eliminate the whole charging current because the operational capacity comprises phase-to-ground capacity only. In three-phase and overhead lines, the operational capacity comprises not only of phase-to-ground capacity but also of phase-to-phase capacity. VSS eliminates only charging currents of phase-to-ground capacity in these networks, which stands for 60% to 70% of line’s operational capacity value (VSS is not designated for elimination of phase-to-phase capacity charging current in the lines). VSS contributes to a significant reduction of charging reactive power flow.&lt;br&gt;


==Elimination of earth-fault current during an earth fault==

The advantage of the system is that it does not require a [[electrical neutral|neutral]] to eliminate the earth-fault current. Therefore, the VSS has been implemented especially in networks which were operated with isolated neutral. During an earth fault in the network, the system eliminates earth-fault current. The function is in principle similar to an arc-suppression coil. In comparison to the arc-suppression coil, VSS eliminates earth-fault current more efficiently, even in unbalanced or extremely unbalanced networks.


==Controlling the residual active earth-fault current during an earth fault==

VSS enables to control the magnitude of residual active earth-fault current. This can be applied to improve the function of directional ground protection or to decrease great active earth-fault current in the network. Such quality is used in networks with great active earth-fault current value, for instance in large cable lines.


==Note==

As VSS does not require neutral for its connection, it can be connected anywhere in the network. At the same time, it is possible to adjust its power to a certain part of the network only, which can be use in local distribution networks or in long feeders, in feeders with high value of charging current, or in feeders with high capacity unbalance. The part of the network in which VSS is installed does not increase the value of phase-to-earth capacity current in power supply network. Furthermore, the value of network’s charging current decreases by the set system power. The VSS is very beneficial in networks with island operation. In island operation, the source is not loaded by charging current of the line and the separated island area is operated with resonant grounding. Such qualities cannot be reached with a classic arc-suppression coil.


==Operational experience of VSS since 2005==

VSS systems have been installed in industrial 6 kV networks as well as in standard distribution networks up to 35 kV. Operational experience proved that VSS can eliminate even extremely high cross parameters unbalance in the network without negatively influencing the function of earth fault protection. Thanks to elimination of phase capacity unbalance, high reliability of directional ground protection can be reached even with high-resistance earth-faults. The possibility of operating the network with accurately compensated phase-to-earth capacity currents contributes to higher safety of the network operation.

The '''Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station''' ('''YNPS'''; {{zh|s=阳江核电站|p=Yángjiāng Hédiànzhàn}}) is a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Guangdong]] [[province (China)|province]], [[China]]. The site is Dongping [[Town (China)|Town]], [[Yangjiang]] [[Prefecture-level city|City]] in western Guangdong Province.&lt;ref name="cgnpc-n463628"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cgnpc.com.cn/n1093/n463576/n463628/index.html  | title= Construction of new projects 
 |date= |year= |month= | publisher= China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group (CGNPC) | accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The station will have six 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[CPR-1000]] [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs).&lt;ref name="wna-China"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html  | title= Nuclear Power in China  | date= 29 December 2012 | work= Country Briefings | publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA) | accessdate= 20 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plant began commercial operation in March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/850890.shtml |title= South China nuclear plant starts commercial operation |date= 26 March 2014 |publisher= [[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate= 28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2018 is the largest nuclear power station in China.

== Development ==
The CPR-1000 is a PWR design developed by China from the [[Areva]]-designed PWRs at the [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name="wnn-23706"&gt;{{cite web 
 | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=23706

 | date= 24 November 2008 | work= [[World Nuclear News]] | publisher= World Nuclear Association (WNA)
 | accessdate= 2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Yangjiang marks a step in the development of China's domestic nuclear industry. 
Shu Guogang, GM of China Guangdong Nuclear Power Project said, "We built 55&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant|Ling Ao]] Phase&amp;nbsp;2, 70&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant|Hongyanhe]], 80&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Ningde Nuclear Power Plant|Ningde]] and 90&amp;nbsp;percent of Yangjiang Station."&lt;ref name="cctv-101260"&gt;{{cite web

 | date= 2009-07-24 |work= | publisher= China Central Television 
 | accessdate= 2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site in Yangjiang was selected for nuclear development in 1988.&lt;ref name="wnn-1712081"&gt;

 | title=  Official start to the Yangjiang nuclear plant 
 | date= 17 December 2008 | work= World Nuclear News
 | accessdate= 2010-01-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was approved in 2004.&lt;ref name="cgnpc-n463628"/&gt; 
The plant was originally to be one of the first in China to host [[Generation III reactor]]s — specifically [[AP1000]] reactors. In 2007 however, plans were revised from the AP1000 design to [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] design. Later in 2007 these plans were again revised, with the EPR designs to be realized at [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant|Taishan]], and the established CPR-1000 reactor design (as already used at [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant|Daya Bay]]) selected for Yangjiang.&lt;ref name="wna-China"/&gt;
Ground was broken for the plant in February 2008; the first concrete for the first unit was poured on 16&amp;nbsp;December 2008.&lt;ref name="wnn-1712081"/&gt;
Construction of the fourth unit was to begin in March 2011, but was delayed by China's safety review in reaction to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|nuclear accident in Japan]]; the first concrete was poured in November 2012.

== ACPR-1000 reactor type ==
Yangjiang 5 is the first construction of an ACPR-1000 reactor, starting in September 2013.&lt;ref name="wnn-1909131"&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Fifth_reactor_under_construction_at_Yangjiang_1909131.html 
 |title= Fifth reactor under construction at Yangjiang 
 |date= 19 September 2013 |work= World Nuclear News 
 |accessdate= 20 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This design is an evolution to the [[Generation III reactor|Generation III]] level of the CPR-1000, and will include a [[core catcher]] and double containment as additional safety measures.&lt;ref name=nei-20130731&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurechina-the-next-few-years-are-crucial-for-nuclear-industry-growth/ |title=China: The next few years are crucial for nuclear industry growth |author=Yun Zhou |work=Ux Consulting |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
