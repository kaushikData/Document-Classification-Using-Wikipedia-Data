{{Kabbalah}}
'''Abraham ben Mordecai Azulai''' (c. 1570–1643) ({{lang-he-n|אברהם בן מרדכי אזולאי}}) was a [[Kabbalistic]] author and commentator born in [[Fes]], [[Morocco]]. In 1599 he moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and settled in [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;Dov Zlotnick, "The Commentary of Rabbi Abraham Azulai to the Mishnah", in: ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', Vol. 40, 1972, pp. 147-168&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
In [[Hebron]], Azulai wrote a commentary on the [[Zohar]] under the title ''Kiryat Arba'' (City of Arba (in Hebrew four); [[Book of Genesis|Gen]]. xxiii.2). The plague of 1619 drove him from his new home, and while in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], where he found refuge, he wrote his Kabalistic work ''Chesed le-Abraham'' (Mercy to Abraham; [[Book of Micah|Micah]] vii.20). It was published after the author's death by Meshullam Zalman ben Abraham Berak of Gorice, in Amsterdam, 1685. The work is a treatise with an introduction, {{Hebrew|אבן השתיה}} (''The Cornerstone''; see Talmud [[Yoma]] 53b), and is divided into seven "fountains" (see [[Book of Zechariah|Zecharia]] iii.9), each fountain being subdivided into a number of "streams." A specimen of the work Chesed Le-Avraham, taken from the fifth fountain, twenty-fourth stream, p.&amp;nbsp;57d, of the Amsterdam edition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the mystery of [[Gilgul]] (reincarnation) and its details: Know that God will not subject the soul of the wicked to more than three migrations; for it is written, "Lo, all these things doth God work twice, yea thrice, with a man" ([[Book of Job|Job]] xxxiii. 29). Which means, He makes him appear twice and thrice in a human incarnation; but the fourth time he is incarnated as a clean animal. And when a man offers a sacrifice, God will, by miraculous intervention, make him select an animal that is an incarnation of a human being. Then will the sacrifice be doubly profitable: to the one that offers it and to the soul imprisoned in the brute. For with the smoke of the sacrifice the soul ascends heavenward and attains its original purity. Thus is explained the mystery involved in the words, "O Lord, thou preservest man and beast" ([[Psalms]] xxxvi.7 [R. V. 6]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  A popular story about Rabbi Azulai is that of how he retrieved the sultan's sword. When the Turkish sultan visited Hebron, his precious sword fell into the [[Cave of the Patriarchs|Cave of Machpela]]. Anyone sent down to retrieve it disappeared. Only Rabbi Azulai was able to descend into the cave and retrieve the sword. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rabbi Abraham Azulai and The Sultan&amp;#039;s Sword|url = http://en.hebron.org.il/history/228|website = the Jewish Community of Hebron|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hebron Jews: Memory and Conflict in the Land of Israel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ooUqc8snyZUC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|date = 2009-07-16|isbn = 9780742566170|language = en|first = Jerold S.|last = Auerbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rabbi Avraham Azoulay|url = http://www.hevratpinto.org/tzadikim_eng/094_rabbi_avraham_azulay.html|website = www.hevratpinto.org|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rabbishimon.com/tzadikim/showz.php?p=azulai.htm|title = Rabbi Avraham Azulai  - RabbiShimon.com- Tzadikim list|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1321931/jewish/The-Fallen-Sword-of-the-Sultan.htm|title = The Fallen Sword of the Sultan - Chabad.org|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rabbi Abraham ben Mordecai Azulai's grave.jpg|left|thumb|Grave of Rabbi Abraham Azulai in the [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron]].]]
He died in [[Hebron]] on November 6, 1643 and is buried in the [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron|Old Jewish Cemetery in Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laitman, ''Gems of Wisdom: Words of the Great Kabbalists from All Generations'', Laitman Kabbalah Publishers, 2011, p. 413-414&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Odulele''' (born 5 January 1964) is a pastor, author, televangelist and convicted criminal. Odulele was born in London to Nigerian parents Abel Oyebajo and Patience Aotola. Odulele spent his formative years in [[Nigeria]] and emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dralbert.org |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415103706/http://dralbert.org/ |archivedate=15 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Odulele was convicted of two counts of sexual assault in 2011, against two males, one of whom was under 16 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pastor-jailed-for-fondling-boy-2258568.html |title=Pastor jailed for fondling boy |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the 53 year old Albert Odulele started a church in Nigeria. This raised a number of speculations in both the Nigerian and British press with regards to his persistent child molesting inclinations and the impact this could have on innocent children. A number of warnings were issued by many conventional and social media outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalnewsnig.com/beware-gay-pastor-rampage-nigeria/|title=Parents Beware: Gay Pastor Albert ODULELE on Rampage in Nigeria • Global News|date=2016-10-16|work=Global News|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to parents, as it is feared that this notorious convicted paedophile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/evangelical-pastor-odulele-sentenced-for-sex-offences|title=Evangelical pastor Odulele sentenced for sex offences|work=Channel 4 News|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; may seek to further abuse innocent children in Nigeria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Arbularyo''' ({{IPA-tl|ärbuˈlɐɾjo̞|[}}), also spelled as '''albularyo''', is a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term for a [[witch doctor]], folk healer or [[medicine men]].
== Names==
The word arbularyo derives from ''herbolario'', a [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] word meaning [[herbalism|herbalist]].

Alternative Filipino names include '''Hilot''' (/hee-lot/), which literally means ''massage'' in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and '''Manggagámot''' (trans. - "person who heals").

'''Manggagaway''' (/mang-gâ-gâ-wây/)(trans. - "person who makes")&amp;mdash;a term found in both the Tagalog and [[Bisaya]] languages—is also used, particularly in regions in the [[Visayas]] (although this term has other connotations not found in the word albularyo).

"Albularyo" is the common pronunciation and spelling used in Tagalog, and is usually translated to English as a "witch doctor".

==Role and Functions==
An Albularyo is a "witch doctor" commonly found in the more rural areas of the Philippines who heals people using herbs and traditional practices such as [[Hilot|hilot]] or ''massage''. Their patients are usually common folk who have trouble affording legitimate medical services, or those who are very traditional and/or superstitious. Many people trust them not only because of tradition, but because they usually have better bedside manners, or show more care and concern for their patients, than doctors in hospitals.

==History==
During the [[History of the Philippines (9001-1521)|pre-historic period]], the function of an arbularyo was fulfilled by the [[Babaylan]], a shamanic spiritual leader of the community.

At the beginning of the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish Era]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the suppression of the Babaylans and native Filipino animist beliefs gave rise to the albularyo. By exchanging the native pagan prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and prayers, the arbularyo was able to syncretise the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

As time progressed, the arbularyo became a more prominent figure in most rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the arbularyos to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the arbularyo's role was slowly shadowed with the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of  the arbularyos with the newer technologies offered by the medical field.

Still, arbularyos flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

==Toolkit==
Most arbularyos use herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, and other substances in their healing practices. In many cases, arbularyos will also employ various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes.

[[Image:O3m AryaSamaj.PNG|left|thumb|260px|&lt;center&gt;AUM or OM is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''Arya Samaj''' was founded in [[Nairobi]] on 5 July 1903, at a meeting at the home of Jai Gopal attended by forty-five people.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The small group of Arya Samajis immediately began plans for a centre for its members and on 11 September 1903, the foundation for the first [[Arya Samaj]] building in [[East Africa]] was laid. Today there is a seven-storey building on this site.

== Contribution to education ==
With the increase in the [[India]]n population in Nairobi, the need for educational facilities grew and the Arya Samaj started the first school for girls in Nairobi in 1910. Later three more schools were established by the Arya Samaj in Nairobi. Admission to these schools was open to students of all races and students were mostly exempt from paying fees. The Arya Samaj also helped maintain a [[crematorium]], held evening classes for adults, starting in 1924 and free of tuition fees, provided a public library service and provided relief during natural disasters. The Arya Samaj donated a hall for use by a prominent high school in Nairobi.

== Arya Stri Samaj ==
Arya Stri Samaj (Women's Arya Samaj) was established in Nairobi in 1919. It started with only a few members and has grown to over two hundred. It holds regular meetings and arranges lectures on religious and social matters. It owns a building and runs a nursery established in 1949. It also organises sewing and music classes for women.

== Visiting preachers ==
The Arya Samaj organised for a number of distinguished preachers to visit East Africa. These preachers became a source of inspiration to the local Hindus. They taught [[Vedic]] religion to the [[Africa]]n people, visited small towns in East Africa and established a number of centres where [[Hindi]] was taught in addition to Vedic religion.

== Social and cultural contribution ==
An Aryan Club was established in Nairobi, open to people of all races, and members of the club distinguished themselves in sporting activities. A free [[public dispensary]] is run by the Arya Samaj in Nairobi.

== Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of East Africa ==
An Arya Samaj was formed in [[Mombasa]], the second largest city in Kenya, in 1904. Its activities mirrored those of the Samaj in Nairobi as it built a temple, established a Youth Wing, held weekly services, built a nursery and a school and formed an Aryan Club. In 1922, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Eastern Africa was formed to coordinate the activities of all the Arya Samajs in East Africa and at present there are nineteen affiliated Arya Samajs.

== The future of Arya Samaj in East Africa ==
Arya Samaj were initially established during [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial rule when there was a large influx of Indian migrants into East Africa, but had to adapt with changing conditions. There were mass migration of Indians out of East Africa following independence but the Samaj has maintained its presence in East Africa.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the vineyards of the western [[Nile Delta]]&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; and thus was viewed as a benign [[deity]]. [[Flinders Petrie]] in his 1923 expedition to the Saqqara (also spelt Sakkara) found several references to Ash in [[Old Kingdom]] wine jar seals: "I am refreshed by this Ash" was a common inscription.

In particular, he was identified by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as the god of the [[Libu]] and Tinhu [[tribe]]s,&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; known as the "people of the oasis". Consequently Ash was known as the "lord of Libya", the western border areas occupied by the Libu and Tinhu tribes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Francoise Dunand]], Christiane Zivie-Coche, ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', Cornell University Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-8853-2}}, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; corresponds roughly with the area of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt;

In Egyptian mythology, as god of the oases, Ash was associated with [[Set (mythology)|Set]], who was originally a god of the desert. The first known reference to Ash dates to the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|Protodynastic Period]], and he continued to be mentioned as late as the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]].

Ash was usually depicted as a [[human]],&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; whose head was one of the desert creatures, variously being shown as a [[lion]], [[vulture]], [[hawk]],&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; [[snake]], or the unidentified [[Seth animal|Set-animal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunand, Zivie, ''op.cit.'', p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Some depictions of Ash show him as having multiple heads, unlike other Egyptian deities, although some compound depictions were occasionally shown connecting gods to [[Min (god)|Min]]. In an article in the [[academic journal|journal]] ''Ancient Egypt'' (in 1923), and again in an appendix to her book, ''The Splendor that was Egypt'', [[Margaret Murray]] expands on such depictions, and draws a parallel to a [[Scythia]]n deity, who is referenced in [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''Cosmographia universalis''.

The idea of Ash as an import god is contested, as he may have been the god of the city of Nebut, now known as [[Naqada]], before [[Set (mythology)|Set's]] introduction there. One of his titles is "Nebuty" or "He of Nebut", indicating this position.&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt;

Ash is sometimes seen as another name for Set.

'''Ayla''' is the main character of [[Jean Auel]]'s [[Earth's Children]] novels. She is a [[Cro-Magnon]] woman who was raised by [[Neanderthal]]s. Ayla was played by [[Daryl Hannah]] in the 1986 movie ''[[The Clan of the Cave Bear (film)|The Clan of the Cave Bear]]''. Ayla's character has been described as an example of the "rebellious primordial" that conquers adversity with wit and will.&lt;ref name="Gjerløff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/674/article/16/|title=Stone Age woman comes into her own|last=Gjerløff|first=Anne Katrine|date=June 2001|others=Annette Nielsen, translator|work=[[KVINFO]]|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ayla is orphaned as a young [[Cro-Magnon]] child when an earthquake opens a fissure in the ground into which the camp of her mother falls and is destroyed. It was mentioned a few times that the location of the camp was odd and not near known Cro-Magnon settlements. The facts that no father or other family members were mentioned and the odd location of the mother’s camp suggest that the mother either chose or was forced not to live with her clan. Ayla is [[Human swimming|swimming]] [[nudity|nude]] in the river beside the campsite when the earthquake starts and watches the tragedy in horror. Wandering aimlessly, alone, frightened, hungry and helpless, Ayla eventually encounters a [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]] which chases her into a narrow crack in a rock wall. Attempting to pull Ayla out, the lion gashes open Ayla's leg, leaving four deep parallel wounds on her thigh. After a day spent hiding in terror and driven by thirst, Ayla, emerges from her hiding place to drink at the nearby stream and then collapses, delirious from fever and starvation.  There she is found by a group of [[Neanderthals]], a "Clan" led by Brun, and is adopted by Iza, that Clan's [[Medicine man|medicinewoman]] or healer. Though neither Iza, Ayla's adoptive mother, nor Creb, the "Mog-ur" (a [[Shaman]]-like character) her adoptive father, know Ayla's age for certain, author Jean Auel places Ayla at the age of five years in the book's second paragraph, and her foster family eventually guesses her age accurately.

''See [[The Clan of the Cave Bear]], [[The Valley of Horses]], [[The Mammoth Hunters]], [[The Plains of Passage]], [[The Shelters of Stone]] and [[The Land of Painted Caves]] for a detailed synopsis of Ayla's life.''

==Characteristics==
Ayla is described as tall, with blonde hair, gray-blue eyes, a well-toned body, and a strangely accented voice (actually a speech mannerism). She has been raised with Clan customs, sign language instead of speech, not to laugh or smile, and not to cry. Almost every male Cro-Magnon character in the series finds Ayla exceptionally beautiful, though Ayla describes herself as "big and ugly" because she was regarded by the Clan as ugly. Another word frequently used to describe her is 'exotic', indicating that she seems a bit foreign to everyone who meets her, and that her own people live somewhere else.

One of Ayla's most important insights is the concept that men have something to do with the conception of children. Clan people believe that pregnancy and birth are a matter of spirit totems competing; when a woman menstruates, it means her totem has fought off another and has won, but if a woman gets pregnant it means her totem has been overcome. Ayla suspects that this all has something to do with sex, or the "relieving of a man's needs" with a woman. She comes to think of this as a combination of male and female "essence."

Ayla has a longstanding problem with Broud, the son of the leader's mate while she lives with the Clan, who is jealous of the attention she receives. His envy causes him to behave in a disgraceful manner; while women expect to be ordered around, Broud also beats and rapes her, impregnating her at the age of eleven. These actions cause his mother's mate to question whether Broud is fit to be leader. Upon becoming leader after the former tribal head believes he is ready, Broud orders a death curse on Ayla and forces her to leave the Clan forever, leaving her son Durc behind.

Throughout the series, there are many references to Ayla's having great spiritual and intellectual powers, many of which actually may be simple reasoning and common sense. She does have a knack for inventing things, and is credited with many innovations actually made over thousands of years of human history.

===[[The Clan of the Cave Bear]]===
Ayla earns her name during her first waking meeting with the Clan members; they cannot pronounce her birth name, and their approximation, "Ayla," becomes her given name.  Auel uses the term "polysyllabic" to describe Ayla's birth name, implying it is more than two syllables long.  This is may be further supported by Creb's first try at pronouncing her name,  "Aay-rr," which could be an attempt to say "Aela."  However, Auel does not explicitly state the name of Ayla's birth.

As a child among the Clan, she is described as lucky, favored by the spirits. Iza later surmises that Ayla was born to a medicine woman of the Others (Cro-Magnons), though Ayla has very little memory of her birth mother and knows nothing of the tribe of the Others to whom she was born. This passage may be a hint by the author of the reason for Ayla’s mother’s camp to be in such an odd location, with no other mentioned people around. Although Ayla lacks the Clan's ability to access ancestral memories, Iza succeeds in training her as a medicine healer. In her childhood and young adulthood she invents several things previously unknown, as well as innovations to existing tools and their uses (see below.) It is here that we see her winning combination of the Clan's detailed factual knowledge, and the Others' innovative and flexible thinking.

When Ayla acts as the medicine woman at the Clan Gathering and prepares the sacred herb for the Mog-urs' ceremony, she ingests some of the juice from the root and is strongly affected by its [[psychotropic]] properties. Creb makes telepathic contact with her, and she follows him through his psychic exploration of the Clan "memories." She then follows the path of the Others' divergence from the Clan, and among other things sees a glimpse of the future: "Boxlike structures...long ribbons of stone...strange animals crawling at great speeds...huge birds that flew without flapping their wings." Apparently Auel intended to describe Ayla seeing a glimpse of the modern era, and even beyond to the next stage of human evolution. Creb has seen all these things with her, and telepathically orders her out of the cave when she returns to her own mind, knowing in his heart that only the Others will continue to evolve and that the Clan will die out.

===[[The Valley of Horses]]===
Alone in a secluded valley where she has fled after being expelled from the Clan, Ayla adopts and raises a cave lion cub she calls Baby and a [[horse]] she calls Whinney. She originally stops in the valley to stay for the winter, but stays to take care of the animal friends. She learns that to survive on her own, she must break many Clan traditions she had previously been raised under. She meets Jondalar when he is attacked and mauled by Baby and tends his wounds. He begins teaching her his language. Some weeks or months later she dreams of her own mother speaking to her and of an earthquake (which betoken tragedy and upheaval to Ayla). After this dream, Ayla suddenly speaks Jondalar's language fluently even to the idioms, where before she had spoken only in broken sentences. Auel may have meant this event as a partial recovery of repressed memories, but Ayla still does not remember her own or her mother's name, her language, or anything of her past before her adoption. Jondalar recovers and takes Ayla, Racer (Whinney's offspring), and Whinney with him while he completes the pilgrimage he is on, intending to bring her home to meet his family.

===[[The Mammoth Hunters]]===
Ayla continues to have psychic and prophetic experiences linked to the rituals used by the Mamutoi people. She dreams that she has two sons, Durc and an unknown son who appears to have no Clan lineage at all; they are on the verge of open conflict, and Ayla struggles to reach them in time to prevent the destruction of one son by the other. It is suggested that the meaning of the dream has less to do with her 'children' than the evolution of the Others and decline of the Clan. she becomes promised to Ranec who comes to believe that she is an incarnation of what he calls the "Spirit Woman," the perfect spirit model of a woman in whose image all are made, and that she may even be the Earth Mother incarnate. Shaman Mamut indicates to Jondalar, Ranec, and Vincavec, another Mamutoi shaman who wants to marry Ayla, that Ayla has some great purpose. Vincavec attempts to hypnotize Ayla, but she is able to resist him, as well as the spiritual influences of others. Though Ayla contends that her ability to tame and win the loyalty of animals is only a matter of time, patience and proper handling, her gift for making friends of numerous animals is considered a sign of her supernatural gifts.

===[[The Plains of Passage]]===
On the journey back to the Zelandonii territory, Jondalar's home, many of the tribes Ayla encounters mistake Ayla's extreme creative intelligence and even her common-sense reasoning for supernatural powers. Jondalar and Ayla both insist that she has no such gifts, but they do not stay in one place long enough to convince anyone otherwise. Ayla continues to have prophetic dreams.

===[[The Shelters of Stone]]===
Upon arriving at the Ninth Cave, Jondalar's dwelling, Ayla realizes that this cave is identical to one she's been seeing in her dreams. Her dreams and waking psychic visions become more frequent and more powerful, and the female shaman Zelandoni can sense them. However, Ayla rejects Zelandoni's offers to train her as a priestess, saying she merely wishes to live a normal life. Zelandoni finally convinces Ayla to join the spiritual devotees, known as "Those Who Serve the Mother."

===[[The Land of Painted Caves]]===
Published March 29, 2011. The last book In the ''Earth's Children's Series'', Ayla is now about 25 years old and training to become a spiritual leader of the Zelandonii. Her training includes a series of harrowing journeys and gives her problems when trying to balance her work and her family life.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Auel expands, celebrates her 'Clan of the Cave Bear'. USA Today, Sep 13 2010 https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-09-13-auel13_ST_N.htm | Accessed Sep 16 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention and skills==
* Phenomenal Memory: Because she doesn't have inherent Clan memories which allow recall after a few reminders, Ayla is at first seen by the Clan as dimwitted because she must be told or shown repeatedly how to do things. As a defense, she works to develop her memory skills so she needs to be shown or told only once. This knack comes in handy when she encounters new languages.
* Two-Stone Technique: After almost being harmed by a [[lynx]] when she missed with her sling, Ayla develops a technique to reload her sling after a cast during the downfall, for immediate use. In reality, Ayla's method of rapid-slinging two stones is not possible.
* [[Diagnosis]]: As reasoned by Iza, although Ayla could not memorize all Clan medicinal lore, she has the ability to reason intuitively, recognize the causes of illnesses and treat them appropriately.
* [[Fatherhood]]: On her own, Ayla eventually develops some understanding of the relationship between a male having sex with a female and subsequent pregnancy. Clan belief is that pregnancy is due to spirits and they do not have a biological concept of fatherhood. For that matter, many Cro-Magnon groups which Ayla later encounters have not made this discovery either - though a few other Cro Magnons she encounters have also (independently of each other) come to realize that there is a link between sex and pregnancy. Arguably this has a greater and more widespread impact than any of Ayla's other inventions, because at the end of the series she becomes a shamaness and helps propagate this knowledge - drastically altering the social development of the Cro Magnons, who until then did not live in monogamous couples in the series.
* [[Bra]]ssiere: Ayla is the only Clan woman permitted to hunt (small game only, using a sling). As she matures, she finds that her breasts impede her mobility. "She noticed that men wore a leather [[loincloth]] to protect their exposed and delicate organs, and fashioned a band to hold her bosom in place, tied around her back." (The Clan of the Cave Bear, chapter 26.)
* [[Atlatl]]: Works with her partner Jondalar to develop a "spear-thrower."
* [[Tame animal|Taming animals]]: out of loneliness in her valley, Ayla has raised a horse Whinney her foal Racer, a [[Panthera leo spelaea|Cave Lion]] cub she calls Baby, later with the mammoth hunters she gets a [[gray wolf|wolf]] she simply calls Wolf.
* Horse Equipment: Inspired by the idea that she can ride Whinney, Ayla invents drag poles, carrying packs, and notably the [[travois]].
* [[Firelighting#Percussion|Percussion Fire Starting]]: After a mistake in making flint weapons, Ayla recognizes that sparks from striking a 'firestone' of [[iron pyrite]] with a piece of flint can start a fire
* [[Sewing needle|Sewing Needle]]:  Ayla tried and failed to learn the Mamutoi sewing techniques, and instead came up with a sharp bone with a hole, which she calls a "thread-puller," to draw sinew through leather—instead of just punching holes and pushing the thread in with another tool.
* [[Surgical suture|Surgical Stitches]]: When Ayla first encounters Jondalar his leg has been torn open by a Cave Lion, to the point where the muscle is hanging off the bone. Ayla determines that in order to heal properly, his leg would have to be physically held closed. She notices how his clothing (in the typical style of his people, but unfamiliar to her) is formed of panels of cloth tied together with thongs, and has the idea to literally tie his leg back together by boring holes in his flesh and muscle, then threading cord through the holes and tying them off.  Much later (in ''The Shelters of Stone'') Wolf is mauled almost to death by another wild wolf; Ayla uses her "thread puller" sewing needle to stitch his wounds. Needless to say, both patients made full recoveries.

==Children==

===Durc===
Born to Ayla while she still lived among the Clan, Durc is considered half-caste: part “other,” part Clan. His father is Broud, the brutish son of the Clan leader who repeatedly raped Ayla as a form of punishment. He displays physical characteristics of both Clan (Neanderthal) and the Others (Cro-Magnon); like Ayla he can vocalize. Although the concept of interbreeding between Neanderthal and other early humans is debated by scientists to this day, remains at several sites indicate that it happened. Durc’s fate is bound up in the Clan; when Ayla is cursed with death (outcast) for the second time when she defies Broud who has been named the new leader, she leaves the Clan and her son behind. Readers around the world express their desire to learn what fate has in store for Durc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characters|url=http://www.jeanauel.com/characters.php|publisher=RandomHouse|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonayla===
Ayla's infant daughter, in the ''Shelters of Stone'' fathered by [[Jondalar]]. She grows into a beautiful and beloved child, close to both parents, and enjoys time with her own horse, Grey, born to Ayla's horse Whinney.

{{Campaignbox Second Anglo-Sikh War}}

The '''Battle of Chillianwala''' was fought in January 1849 during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in the [[Chillianwala]] region of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]&lt;ref name="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; ([[Mandi Bahauddin]]), now part of modern-day [[Pakistan]]. The battle was one of the bloodiest fought by the [[British East India Company]]. Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and both sides claimed victory.&lt;ref name=Heath42&gt;Heath, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was a strategic check to immediate British ambitions in India and a shock to British military prestige.&lt;ref name="AHAmin"&gt;[http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html Major A. H. Amin (retd.) Orbat.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007165716/http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html |date=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
The Second Anglo-Sikh war broke out in the Punjab, which had recently lost much of its independence to the [[British East India Company]] following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], in April 1848, when the city of [[Multan]] rebelled under [[Dewan Mulraj]]. The East India Company's Commissioner for the Punjab, [[Sir Frederick Currie, 1st Baronet|Frederick Currie]], sent several forces of locally raised troops to help quell the revolt. One of these forces consisted largely of Sikhs, formerly from the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], under [[Sher Singh Attariwalla]]. Some junior British Political Officers viewed this development with alarm as Sher Singh's father, [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]], was known to be plotting sedition in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], north of the Punjab.

On 14 September, Sher Singh's army also rebelled. Other than opposition to the British, Mulraj and Sher Singh had no aims in common. Sher Singh decided to move his army north, to join that of Chattar Singh, who had also rebelled. However, some British officers had taken steps to secure vital fortresses. For the time being, Chattar Singh was unable to leave Hazara, as the British held [[Attock]] on the [[Indus River]], and the passes over the [[Margalla Hills]] separating Hazara from the Punjab. Instead, Sher Singh moved a few miles north and fortified the crossings over the [[Chenab River]], while awaiting events.

The East India Company responded by announcing their intention to depose the young Maharaja, [[Duleep Singh]], annexe the Punjab and confiscate the lands of any landholders who joined the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, p.583&lt;/ref&gt; While an army under Major General Whish resumed the [[Siege of Multan]], the company ordered the formation of an Army of the Punjab under the veteran Commander in Chief, Sir [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Hugh Gough]]. However, both Gough and the Governor General, the 37-year-old [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], delayed operations until after the end of the [[monsoon]] season, allowing Sher Singh to gather reinforcements and establish strong positions.

Gough took charge of the Army on 21 November. The next day, he attacked Sher Singh's bridgehead on the left bank of the Chenab at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]] but was repulsed, raising Sikh morale. On 1 December, a cavalry division under Major General [[Joseph Thackwell]] crossed the Chenab upstream from Ramnagar. Sher Singh advanced against him, resulting in a day-long artillery duel at Sadullapur. Gough meanwhile bombarded the empty Sikh positions at Ramnagar, and postponed a general attack until the next day. During the night, Sher Singh withdrew to the north.

Gough then halted, awaiting further instructions from Dalhousie. Early in January 1849, news came that the British had recaptured the city of Multan (although Mulraj still defended the citadel), but also that the Muslim garrison of Attock had defected to Amir [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] of Afghanistan, who was half-heartedly supporting Chattar Singh. The fall of Attock nevertheless allowed Chattar Singh's army to leave Hazara and move south. Dalhousie ordered Gough to seek out and destroy Sher Singh's main army before the Sikh armies could combine, without waiting for reinforcements from the army at Multan.

==First contact==
On 13 January, Gough's army was marching towards the reported Sikh position at [[Rasul, Punjab|Rasul]], on the left bank of the [[Jhelum River]], about {{convert|85|mi|km}} north-west of [[Lahore]]. At noon, they drove a Sikh outpost out of the village of [[Chillianwala]]. At this point, Gough intended to march round to the north of the Sikh position and attack its left flank on the following day, but from the vantage point of a mound near Chillianwala, it was apparent that the Sikhs had advanced from their original positions along ridges close to the Jhelum. Sher Singh's army had originally occupied a position six miles long, too extended for their numbers and vulnerable to a flank attack such as Gough proposed. By advancing, Sher Singh made a British flank march too risky and forced the British to make a frontal attack.&lt;ref name=defencejournal&gt;[http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/july/chillianwala.htm A.

It was estimated by [[Frederick Mackeson]], Gough's attached political officer, that Sher Singh's army numbered 23,000 (although most later British historians put it at 30,000 or more), including 5,000 irregular cavalry, with some 60 guns. However after the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], the Khalsa was reduced to 12,000 infantry and 60 guns in total, so some historians have stated the Sikh army could not have been more than 10,000 on the day.&lt;ref name="AHAmin"&gt;[http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html Major A. H. Amin (retd.) Orbat.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007165716/http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html |date=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh army consisted of three main bodies of troops.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, pp.53–54&lt;/ref&gt; On the left under Sher Singh himself were one cavalry regiment, nine infantry battalions, some irregulars and 20 guns, occupying some low hills and ridges. In the centre under Lal Singh were two cavalry regiments, ten infantry battalions and 17 guns, mostly concealed in or behind belts of scrub and jungle. On the right was a brigade which formerly had garrisoned [[Bannu]], consisting of one cavalry regiment, four infantry battalions and eleven guns, anchored on two villages. Other irregulars extended Sher Singh's left flank.&lt;ref name=defencejournal/&gt;

Gough intended to delay the attack until the following day, but as his army prepared to pitch camp, hitherto concealed Sikh artillery opened fire from positions much closer than had been anticipated. Gough later wrote that he feared the Sikhs might bombard his encampments overnight, though some of his officers believed he had merely been stung into hasty action.&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, p.594&lt;/ref&gt;

Gough's army was composed of two infantry divisions, each of two brigades, each in turn of one British and two Bengal Native infantry battalions, with a total of 66 guns from the [[Bengal Artillery]] and [[Bengal Horse Artillery]]. The 3rd Division under Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]], with two field artillery batteries and three horse artillery troops, was deployed on the left, while the 2nd Division commanded by Major General [[Sir Walter Gilbert]] was deployed on the right with a field artillery battery and three horse artillery troops. Gough also had a cavalry division under Major General Joseph Thackwell, but this was split, with one brigade on each flank; Brigadier White's on the left, Brigadier Pope's on the right. Gough deployed two heavy artillery batteries with eight 18-pounder guns and four 8-inch howitzers in the centre. A brigade of Bengal Native troops under Brigadier Penney was in reserve.&lt;ref name=defencejournal/&gt;

==The battle==
[[File:Battle of Chillianwalla.jpg|thumb|Map of the battle]]
Gough ordered the advance to commence at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm. From the outset, the right-hand brigade of Campbell's division, commanded by Brigadier [[John Pennycuick (brigadier)|Pennycuick]], was in difficulties. Because the jungle made it difficult for Campbell to coordinate his two brigades, he assumed personal command of the left hand brigade under Brigadier Hoggan, while ordering Pennycuick to attack with the bayonet. The British regiment of Pennycuick's brigade was the [[The South Wales Borderers|24th Foot]], which had only recently arrived in India. They advanced very rapidly, but lost cohesion and also lost touch with the rest of the brigade in the thick scrub. Trying to attack Sikh guns head-on, they suffered heavily from [[grapeshot]]. When they reached the main Sikh positions, Sikh resistance was desperate and the 24th were driven back. The Queen's colours were lost,&lt;ref&gt;Hernon, p.596&lt;/ref&gt; although the Sikhs never claimed to have captured them and they were either destroyed or conceivably buried with the officer who had carried them. Pennycuick's brigade eventually became completely disorganised and had to make its way back to the start line in small parties. Pennycuick himself was killed.
[[File:Plaque erected in the memory of Brigadier John Pennycuick and his son Alexender of 24th Regiment, both of whom died in Battle of Chillianwala on 18 January 1849 by Sarah Pennycuick, widow and mother of deceased.jpg|thumb|Picture of the plaque erected in St James Church Sialkot Cantonment by Sarah Pennycuick, widow of Brigadier John Pennycuick and mother of Alexender of 24th Regiment, both of whom died in Battle of Chillianwala on 13 January 1849. ]]
Campbell's left hand brigade (under Brigadier Hoggan and Campbell himself) had greater success. The [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot|61st Foot]] captured several guns and even an elephant, and Brigadier White's cavalry followed up with an effective charge. Hoggan's troops eventually met the left-hand brigade of Gilbert's division, commanded by Brigadier Mountain, behind the Sikhs' centre positions.

On Gough's right however, his troops had met with disaster. While Gilbert's two brigades had at first successfully driven the Sikhs before them, capturing or spiking several guns, on their right flank, Brigadier Pope (who was almost an invalid) first ordered an ineffective cavalry charge through thorn scrub which threw his brigade into confusion, and then panicked and ordered a retreat. One of his British cavalry regiments, the [[14th King's Hussars|14th Light Dragoons]], routed. The Sikhs followed up the fleeing cavalry and captured four guns. They then attacked Gilbert's right-hand infantry brigade, commanded by Brigadier Godby, from the rear, forcing him to withdraw under heavy pressure until Penney's reserve brigade came to his aid.

By now, darkness was approaching. The Sikhs had been driven from many of their positions with heavy casualties, but were still fighting strongly. With some of his formations rendered ineffective, or having to fight their way out of encirclement, Gough ordered a withdrawal to the start line. Although his units brought back as many wounded as they could, many of them could not be found in the scrub. Many of the abandoned wounded were killed during the night by roving Sikh irregulars. Gough's retreat also allowed the Sikhs to recapture all but twelve of the guns the British had taken earlier in the day.

==Casualties==
The final losses to Gough's army were 757 killed, 1,651 wounded and 104 missing&lt;ref name=Hernon599&gt;Hernon, p.599&lt;/ref&gt; for a total of 2,512.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; A comparatively high proportion of the casualties (almost 1,000) were British rather than Indian. This was mainly a result of the disaster which befell the 24th Foot, which suffered 590 casualties, over 50 percent.

Sikh casualties were 4,000 dead and wounded.&lt;ref name="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

An [[obelisk]] later erected at Chillianwalla by the British government preserves the names of those who fell in the battle.

==Result==
[[File:Monument of the Battle of Chillianwala 3.jpg|200px|thumb|A monument was erected in memory of the losses sustained by both armies]]

Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and Sher Singh withdrew to the north. Both sides claimed a victory.&lt;ref name="AHAmin"&gt;[http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html Major A. H. Amin (retd.) Orbat.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007165716/http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/uk/chillianwala1849.html |date=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs claimed that they forced the British to retreat but the British forces actually withdrew three days after the battle ended; however, this was due to the rains which separated the two armies for that duration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99mar06/saturday/head2.htm Rain separated the foes for three days and on the fourth day the British withdrew].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sikhs disengaged first, the British claimed the victory,&lt;ref name="AHAmin"/&gt; although they admitted that the Sikhs missed an opportunity to gain a victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishbattles.com/second-sikh-war/chillianwallah.html BritishBattles.com]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the repulse of the British, together with the loss of several guns and the colours of the 24th and two other regiments, and the rout of the 14th Light Dragoons, dealt a blow to British morale and is testament to the tenacity and martial skill of the Sikh army.

A testimony left by a British observer says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sikhs fought like devils, fierce and untamed... Such a mass of men I never set eyes on and a plucky as lions: they ran right on the bayonets and struck their assailants when they were transfixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020113/edit.htm When fate &amp; destiny conspired against Sikhs’ victory – The Tribune, Chandigarh, India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two later editorials by the military historian Major A.H. Amin stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At Chillianwala a British Army which had a high European troop component large number Sepoy (regiments), sufficient artillery, two heavy cavalry brigades to ensure that no one could surprise the British army, excellent logistics, little campaign exhaustion having fought no major battle since assumption of hostilities...failed to defeat the Sikhs.&lt;ref name=defencejournal/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Battle of Chillianwala fought on 13 January 1849 is, however, one odd exception and stands out as a battle in which the British failed to defeat their opponents despite having the advantages of weight of numbers ([[sic]]), ideal weather and terrain, superior logistics etc&lt;ref name=defencejournal/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gough was criticised for his handling of the battle, and was relieved of command and was superseded by General [[Charles James Napier]]. Before Napier could arrive from England to take over command, Gough had fought the decisive [[Battle of Gujrat|Battle of Goojerat]] (or Gujrat, Gujerat).

The loss of British prestige at Chillianwala was one of the factors which contributed to the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] some nine years later. However the Sikh soldiers serving in the British army remained loyal to Britain and helped crush the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationforum.co.uk/KS3_2/mut.htm The Indian Mutiny – Education forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sikhs and the Sikh Wars ''General Sir Charles Gough''&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the British Army, such was the consternation over the events at Chillianwala that, after the disastrous [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], when [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] remarked ''"This is a most serious matter"'', [[Richard Airey, 1st Baron Airey|General Airey]] replied, ''"These sort of things will happen in war. It is nothing to Chillianwala."''&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Early Mughal-Sikh Wars}}

The '''Battle of Kartarpur''' was a 1635 siege of [[Kartarpur, India|Kartarpur]] by the [[Mughal Empire]] and was the last major battle of the [[Mughal-Sikh Wars]] of Guru Hargobind's period of Guruship.&lt;ref name="Jaques 513"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaques|first=Tony.|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbMFCZyAcnQC|accessdate=31 July 2010|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33536-5|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a campaign against the "Sikhs of [[Guru Hargobind]]", the sixth [[Sikh Guru]], a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army led by [[Painde Khan]] laid siege to  Kartarpur. Kartarpur was defended by [[Bhai Bidhi Chand]] with [[Guru Hargobind]] and his son [[Baba Gurdita]] supporting him. The siege was failed by the Sikhs.

'''Buddhist music''' is music created for or inspired by [[Buddhism]] and part of [[Buddhist art]].

==Honkyoku==
[[Honkyoku]] (本曲) are the pieces of [[shakuhachi]] or [[hocchiku]] music played by wandering Japanese Zen monks called [[Komuso]]. Komuso temples were abolished in 1871, but their music, honkyoku, is one of the most popular contemporary music styles in Japan. Komuso played honkyoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century. In the 18th century, a Komuso named [[Kinko Kurosawa]] of the Fuke sect of [[Zen Buddhism]] was commissioned to travel throughout Japan and collect these musical pieces. The results of several years of travel and compilation were thirty-six pieces known as the [[Honkyoku#Kinko_Ryū|Kinko-Ryu Honkyoku]].

==Chanting==
The [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] of mantras used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures:
   
*[[repetition (music)|Repetition]] of the name of [[Amitabha]] in [[Pure Land Buddhism]].   
*Repetitious [[chanting]] of [[Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]] and excerpts of the [[Lotus Sutra]] within [[Nichiren Buddhism]] 
*Shomyo in Japanese [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] Buddhism.    
*[[Overtone singing|Throat singing]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] chants  
    
===Tibetan styles===
Tibetan Buddhism is the most widespread religion in Tibet. Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Individual schools such as the Gelug, Nyingma, Sakya and Kagyu, and even individual monasteries, maintain their own chant traditions.

===Shomyo===
[[Shomyo]] (声明) is a style of Japanese [[Buddhist chant]]; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

[[File:Al-Buraf Hafifa.jpg|thumb|Buraq on a reproduction of a 17th-century [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]]]
 
'''Al-Burāq''' ({{lang-ar|البُراق}} ''al-Burāq'' or {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|ɔː|r|æ|k|}} "lightning") is a steed in [[Islamic mythology]], a creature from the heavens that transported the [[prophet]]s. Most notably Buraq carried the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Jerusalem in Islam|Jerusalem]] and back during the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] or "Night Journey",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oJmTOQQDxiQC&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |page=48 |title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns |first=Brooke Olson |last=Vuckovic |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135885243 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as recounted in [[hadith]] literature.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', referring to [[Al-Damiri]]'s writings, considers Buraq to be a derivative of {{lang-ar|برق}} ''barq'' "lightning".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Christane J., “al-Burāq”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Consulted online on 14 April 2018 &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_24366&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', "Boraq" is the Arabized form of "[[Middle Persian]] *''barāg'' or *''bārag'', 'a riding beast, mount' ([[Persian language|New Pers.]] ''bāra'')".&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|hadith-v|Hadith v. as Influenced by Iranian Ideas and Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Near East]] and [[Persian art]] almost always portrays Buraq with a human face, a portrayal that found its way into Indian and Persian Islamic art. Yet no hadiths or early Islamic references allude to it having a humanoid face. This may have been originated from a misrepresentation or translation from Arabic to Persian of texts and stories describing the winged steed as a "beautiful faced creature".

An excerpt from a translation of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] describes Buraq:
{{quote|Then a white animal which was smaller than a [[mule]] and bigger than a [[donkey]] was brought to me ... The animal's step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal's sight.|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|Sahih al-Bukhari&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|5|58|227}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another describes the Buraq in greater detail:
{{quote|Then he [Gabriel] brought the Buraq, handsome-faced and bridled, a tall, white beast, bigger than the donkey but smaller than the mule. He could place his hooves at the farthest boundary of his gaze. He had long ears. Whenever he faced a mountain his hind legs would extend, and whenever he went downhill his front legs would extend. He had two wings on his thighs which lent strength to his legs.

He bucked when Muhammad came to mount him. The [[angel]] [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibril]] ([[Gabriel]]) put his hand on his mane and said: "Are you not ashamed, O Buraq? By [[Allah]], no-one has ridden you in all creation more dear to Allah than he is." Hearing this he was so ashamed that he sweated until he became soaked, and he stood still so that the Prophet mounted him.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad al-Alawi al-Maliki, ''al-Anwar al Bahiyya min Isra wa l-Mi'raj Khayr al-Bariyyah''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the earlier descriptions there is no agreement as to the sex of the Buraq. It is typically male, yet [[Ibn Sa'd]] has Gabriel address the creature as a female, and it was often rendered by painters with a woman's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Arnold-1965-Painting/Arnold-1965-Painting-105-119.pdf|title=Painting in Islam|author=T.W. Arnold|year=1965|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that "al-Buraq" is a mare is also noted in the book The Dome of the Rock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grabar|first1=Oleg|title=The Dome of the Rock|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=978-0674023130|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the chapter "The Open Court", and in the title-page vignette of [[Georg Ebers]]'s ''[[Palestine in Picture and Word]]''.

== Journey to the Seventh Heaven ==
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad ascends to heaven ([[mi'raj]]) in a [[Persian miniature]]]]
{{Main article|Isra and Mi'raj}}
According to [[Islam]], the Night Journey took place ten years after Muhammad became a prophet, during the 7th century. Muhammad had been in his home city of Mecca, at his cousin's home (the house of [[Fakhitah bint Abi Talib]]). Afterwards, Muhammad went to the [[Great Mosque of Mecca]]. While he was resting at the [[Kaaba]], the angel Jibril appeared to him, followed by Buraq. Muhammad mounted Buraq, and in the company of Jibril, they traveled to the "farthest mosque".

The location of this [[mosque]] was not explicitly stated but is generally accepted to mean [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] at the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem. At this location, he dismounted from Buraq, prayed, and mounted Buraq, who took him to the [[Jannah|various heavens]], to meet first the earlier prophets and then [[God in Islam|God]]. God instructed Muhammad to tell his followers that they were to offer prayers fifty times a day. At the urging of [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] (Moses), Muhammad returns to God and eventually reduces it to ten times, and then five times a day as this was the destiny of Muhammad and his people. Buraq then transported Muhammad back to Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem: The Three Religions of the Temple Mount|author=Sullivan, Leah|url=http://water.stanford.edu/nur/GP50/leah.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2018|publisher=stanford.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712095834/http://water.stanford.edu/nur/GP50/leah.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abraham==
According to [[ibn Ishaq]], Buraq transported [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham) when he visited his wife, [[Hagar]], and son, [[Ismail]] (Ishmael). That tradition states that Abraham lived with one wife, Sarah, in [[Syria]], but Buraq would transport him in the morning to [[Mecca]] to see his family there and take him back in the evening to his wife in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journeys in Holy Lands: The Evolution of the Abraham-Ishmael Legends in Islamic Exegesis |last=Firestone |first=Reuven |publisher=SUNY Press |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-7914-0331-0 |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O69zjVnjL10C&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western Wall==
[[File:Buraq sculpture from Mindanao Philippines.jpg|thumb|A unique Buraq {{reference_needed|date=April 2018}} sculpture of [[Mindanao|Mindanaon]] [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslims]] in the Philippines.]]
Various scholars and writers, such as [[ibn al-Faqih]], [[ibn Abd Rabbih]], and [[Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi]], have suggested places where Buraq was supposedly tethered in stories, mostly locations near the southwest corner of the Haram.&lt;ref name=Elad/&gt; However, for several centuries the preferred location has been the [[al-Buraq Mosque]], just inside the wall at the south end of the [[Western Wall]] plaza.&lt;ref name=Elad/&gt; The mosque sits above an ancient passageway that once came out through the long-sealed [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Barclay's Gate|Barclay's Gate]] whose huge lintel remains visible below the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Moroccans' Gate|Maghrebi gate]].&lt;ref name=Elad&gt;{{cite book|last=Elad|first=Amikam|authorlink=Amikam Elad|title=Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship: Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDz_yctbQVgC&amp;pg=PA101|year=1995|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-10010-5|page=101-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the proximity to the Western Wall, the area next to the wall has been associated with Buraq at least since the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:
{{quote|It is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al-Sharif and also the spot where the Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of [[Abu Madyan]], may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite book | author = F. E.

Tibawi | title = The Islamic Pious Foundations in Jerusalem | publisher = The Islamic Cultural Centre | place = London | at = Appendix III | year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carl Sandreczki, charged with compiling a list of place names for [[Charles William Wilson]]'s Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the ''Hosh'' (court/enclosure) of ''al Burâk'', "not ''Obrâk'', nor ''Obrat''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Carl Sandrecki | year = 1865 | title = Account of a Survey of the City of Jerusalem made in order to ascertain the names of streets etc.|at=Day IV}} reproduced in {{cite book | author = Captain Charles W. Wilson R.E. | edition = Facsimile | year = 1865 | publication-date =1980 |publisher=Ariel Publishing House | title = Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem | at = Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the Prussian Consul and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Georg Rosen (1821–1891)|Georg Rosen]] wrote: "The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = G. Rosen | title = Das Haram von Jerusalem und der Tempelplatz des Moria | publisher = Gotha | year = 1866 |pp=9–10 | quote = Die ganze Mauerstrecke am Klageplatz der Juden bis südlich an die Wohnung des Abu Su'ud und nördlich an die Substructionen der Mechkemeh wird von den Arabern Obrâk genannt, nicht, wie früher behauptet worden, eine Corruption des Wortes Ibri (Hebräer), sondern einfach die neu-arabische Aussprache von Bōrâk, [dem Namen des geflügelten Wunderrosses,] welches [den Muhammed vor seiner Auffahrt durch die sieben Himmel nach Jerusalem trug] und von ihm während seines Gebetes am heiligen Felsen im Innern der angegebenen Mauerstelle angebunden worden sein soll. |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson's 1865 survey, its revised editions in 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Captain Charles W.

R. Ashby | title = Jerusalem 1920-1922 | year= 1924 | publisher = John Murray | place = London | page = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the Western Wall area with Buraq has played an important role in disputes over the holy places since the British mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/wallname.html| title = "Western Wall" or "Wailing Wall"?| accessdate = 5 October 2008| author=Halkin, Hillel| date = 12 January 2001| publisher = [[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Ravana went travelling in his chariot, he came across [[Mount Kailash]]. He became furious as his chariot could not cross over this mountain, so in a state of fury he ordered the mountain to give way to him. The mountain refused as it was the residing place of Lord Shiva and [[Goddess Parvati]]. Ravana stepped down the chariot and lifted the mountain to remove it from his path. Lord Shiva placed his toe on the mountain to put it back into place. This caused Ravana's little finger to crush under the mountain. Ravana realised his mistake and to impress Lord Shiva sang the [[Shiva Tandava Stotram]] for the first time.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Lord Shiva, impressed by his offering, gifted him the Chandrahasa sword which is indestructible.

The '''Chitrapur Guru Parampara''' ([[Devanagari script|Devanagari]] चित्रापुर गुरु परंपरा,''{{IAST|Gu.ru Pa.ram.pa.ra}}'') or ''Guru Heritage'' of the [[Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmins|Chitrāpur Sāraswat Brahmins]] is the lineage of spiritual teachers ([[guru]]s), also known as ''Mathadhipatis ({{IAST|Ma.thā.dhi.pa.ti}})'' (head of the [[Chitrapur Math|Chitrāpur Math]], ''{{IAST|Chi.trā.pur Ma.th}}'') who have led the community throughout its history.

These teachers are viewed as the torch-bearers of the rich culture and heritage that the community has passed down from generation to generation. Starting with [[Parijnanashram I|Param Poojya Parijnanāshram I Swamiji]] in 1708, the [[Parampara]] (lineage) continues through to the present ''Mathādhipati'' of the Chitrāpur Math [[Sadyojat Shankarashram|Param Poojya Sadyojāt Shankarāshram Swamiji]]. He is currently the 11th ''Mathādhipati'' of the Shri Chitrapur Math.

''Saraswat ({{IAST|Sā.ra.swat}})'' is the generic term for the [[Brahmins]] or learned people who inhabited the fertile basin between the ancient rivers of Saraswati and Drishadawati in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi|pages=23|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But usually Saraswat refers to the Saraswat Brahmins who come under the ''[[Chitrapur Math|Chitrāpur Matha]]'' at [[Shirali|Shirāli]] and are hence called Chitrāpur Sāraswat Brahmins (Bhānaps or Smārtha Sāraswats). Due to drought and famine, they migrated southwards towards Goa and Maharashtra. But Portuguese invasion of Goa forced the Sāraswats established neat Gomantak region to migrate further south towards Karnataka and settled down in the [[Kanara]] regions of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=27|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their superior intelligence and administrative experience helped them attain several important posts in the regions in which they migrated to.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 29"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=29|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhanap people are a very small community that is scattered in all parts of the globe. The common thread that binds all these people is the ''Guru Parampara'' and the ''Chitrapur Math''

==The origin of the Guruparampara==
During the reign of the Hindu chiefs of Nagar or Keldi (1560–1768)&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=Shrimat Parijananashram Swamiji -I (Gokarn)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Kanara regions of Karnataka, the Smartha Saraswats held esteemed positions in the government. These were a variety of administrative and accountancy positions. Since they were established in villages of the region, they adopted the names of the villages as their surnames.

Their superior intelligence and high efficiency of work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=28|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; created envy among the local people there. Their jealousy went to such an extent that they wanted to remove the Saraswats from their highly respective posts. For this they went and complained to the King of Nagar that the Saraswats did not have a [[Guru]] and hence did not have a spiritual existence of their own.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 29"/&gt;

The King heeded the words of these envious people and issued an official decree whereby "If the Saraswats did not show him their ''Guru'', a heavy penalty would be imposed upon them". It so happened that the Guru of the [[Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin#Shenvis|Shenvis]] had left for [[Benaras]].&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath.net"/&gt; The representative of the Saraswat community made this point to the King but he was not satisfied with it.

The Saraswat Brahmins were aghast. All the elders of the community held a ''dharan'' (community prayer) at the Temple of Lord Mahābaleshwar (''Bhavānishankar'') at [[Gokarna, India#Religious attractions|Gokarna]]. The intensity of prayer is as quoted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Saraswats gathered together,&lt;br&gt;And prayed in all humility,&lt;br&gt;Giving up hunger,thirst and sleep...''&lt;br&gt;
''Such was the intensity''

''The devotees with prayers in their hearts,&lt;br&gt;Unceasingly for long nights and days,&lt;br&gt;Surrendered unto Lord Mahabaleshwar,&lt;br&gt;At Gokarn,that sacred place.''&lt;ref name="anugraha"&gt;{{cite book| last =Divgi| first =Jyothi| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Anugraha-A saga of cascading grace| publisher =Shri Chitrapur Math| date =September 2002| location =| pages =31| url =http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| doi =| id =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071017152230/http://chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| archivedate =2007-10-17| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Bhavānishankar is said to have answered their prayers. In a dream he appears and assures his devotees that a [[Sanyasi]] would arrive at the banks of the ''Kotiteerth''the next day and that he would guide the community as their Guru.

As the dream had proclaimed, a ''sanyasi'' clad in saffron robes and carrying the ''vigraha'' (idol) of Lord Bhavānishankara in his cloth pouch arrived at the banks of the ''Kotiteerth ({{IAST|Ko.ti.tī.rth}})'', the village tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=35|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sacred ash smeared on the forehead,&lt;br&gt;The Guru arrived,the Benevolent One,&lt;br&gt;Clad in flaming saffron robes,&lt;br&gt;Resplendent like the Sun!
A 'Danda' adorned in one hand,&lt;br&gt;A 'Kamandalu' in another,&lt;br&gt;The brilliance of Shankara on his face,&lt;br&gt;The gentle smile of a mother!
A 'rudraksha mala' adorned his nech,&lt;br&gt;A 'Jholi' by His side,&lt;br&gt;Carried the 'Vigraha' of Lord Bhavanishankara,&lt;br&gt;Our Gurudev had come down to guide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Divgi| first =Jyothi| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Anugraha-A saga of cascading grace| publisher =Shri Chitrapur Math| date =September 2002| location =| pages =35| url =http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| doi =| id =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071017152230/http://chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| archivedate =2007-10-17| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This great one was [[Parijnanashram I|Parijñānāshram I]], the first Guru, who established in 1708, the glorious ''Guru parampara'' in which the present [[guru]] [[Sadyojat Shankarashram|Sadyojāt Shankarāshram]] is the eleventh in succession

==Sāraswats under the Swamis==
The Sāraswats have lived a glorious period of over 300 years under the ''Guru Parampara''. Each swamiji has contributed in his own way to the development of the community. The divine powers possessed by the greats and their deeds towards humanity are stuff of legends.

===Under Parijñānāshram I (1708–1720)===
{{main|Parijnanashram I|l1=Swami Parijñānāshram I}}

The Saraswat installed Swami Parijñānāshram I at the ''Sri Vishveshwar Vithal'' Temple and brought him to Nāgar and before the king. But the king refused to accept him as their [[guru]] until and unless the ''[[Shankaracharya|Shankarāchārya]]'' of the [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]] gave his consent.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 29"/&gt;

''Parijñānāshram Swamiji'' travelled from Gokarna to Shringeri. At first he was denied entry into the temple by the priests there. In the night "Jagadguru" had a dream where he saw that idol of Sharada Devi had lost its lustre as she was upset as her son was denied entry into the temple. In the morning the ''Jagadguru'' realised this when he saw the idol and immediately called for Parijnanashram Swamiji and gave his consent to the new Swamiji. He was also awestruck by Parinanashram swamiji's piety, yogic abilities and his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=39–40|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King wholeheartedly welcome the new ''Mathādhipati'' of the Sāraswats. Thus the Guru parampara was established.

The Swamiji consented to stay on at the ''Sri Vishweshwar Vithal'' Temple on the banks of the Kotiteerth in [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]] which became the first ''Math'' or monastery (The [[Parijnanashram I#Adi-matha|''Adi Matha'']]) of the Sāraswats. He led the community till 1720 when [[Shankarashram I|Shankārashram I Swami]] became the ''Mathādhipati'' (head of the ''matha'': generic name for head of the community). He attained ''Mahāsamādhi''(death) on the ''Krishna Chaturdashi'' day of the month of ''[[Chaitra]]'' in 1720.&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi|pages=47|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''samādhi'' is located at [[Shirali|the Adi Matha, Gokarna]]

===Under Shankarāshram I (1720–1757)===
{{Main|Shankarashram I|l1=Swami Shankarāshram I}}

Swami Shankarāshram was the ''mathādhipati'' from 1720 until his ''Mahāsamadhi'' in 1757. Under his leadership, the [[Chitrapur Math|Chitrāpur Math]] at [[Shirali|Shirāli]] became the head ''math'' (monastery) of the Sāraswats. His divinity has many popular folklore attached to it. Many devotees in grief and sorrow attained happiness due to his divine grace (see [[Shankarashram I#Miracles|Swamiji's Miracles]]). Swamiji suddenly suffered from an untimely illness and succumbed to it and attained ''Mahāsamādhi'' in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=57|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''samādhi'' is located at [[Shirali]]. He had not adopted a ''shishya'' (disciple) to continue the lineage or ''parampara''.

===Under Parijnānāshram II (1757–1770)===
{{Main|Parijnanashram II|l1=Swami Parijñānāshram II}}

With ''Shankarāshram I Swamiji'' attaining ''samādhi'' without ordaining a new successor, the community was again put into a state of peril. The King had again seized the assets of the math with the condition that a new ''mathadhipati'' had to be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=59–60|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm |title=H. H. Shrimat Parijananashram Swamiji -II (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elders of the community gathered together and sought to resolve the impending peril. They went to a saintly person, who practised [[yoga]], from the ''Pandit'' family in [[Kollur, Udupi district|Kollur]] and asked him if he would take up the reins of the ''Mathādhipati''. He graciously accepted and thus was ordained as Parijñānāshram II Swamiji.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 61"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=61|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being the type who liked to wield power,&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 61"/&gt; Swamiji accepted a ''shisya'' (disciple) very soon and spent most of his time practising yoga at Kollur. He attained ''Mahāsamādhi'' in 1770&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; leaving behind his successor ''Shankarāshram II''. His ''samādhi'' is located at [[Shirali]]

===Under Shankarāshram II (1770–1785)===
{{Main|Shankarashram II|l1=Shankarāshram II Swamiji}}

Swami Shakarāshram II was considered as the ''avatār''(incarnation) of ''[[Dattareya|Lord Dattātreya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Very many miracles have been attributed to him (''see [[Shankarashram II#Mircales|Miracles]]'').

In 1781, swamiji accepted a ''shishya'' (disciple) and christened him ''Keshavāshram''.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm |title=H.

Shrimat Shankarashram Swamiji -II Mallapur)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785 swamiji attained ''Mahāsamādhi'' and ''Swami Keshavāshram'' became the fifth ''mathādhipati'' of the Sāraswat Brahmins. The ''samādhi'' of His Holiness Shankarāshram Swamiji is located at the small hamlet of Mallāpur in Karnataka at the Mallāpur Math.

===Under Keshavāshram (1785–1823)===
{{Main|Keshavashram|l1=Keshavāshram Swamiji}}

Keshavāshram Swamiji took charge of the math in 1785. He was a very learned person and a scholar in the Sanskrit scriptures. Knowing that education was the key to success, Keshavāshram Swamiji encouraged the Sāraswats to have English education during British rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guruparampara Charita Saramrita(Devanagari)|publisher=Shri Chitrapur Math Publication|pages=25–27|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when the other communities ostracized the English language, the Saraswats got well-educated in English and thus could hold positions of high esteem even under the British.

He is attributed with very many miracles (see [[Keshavashram#Miracles|Miracles]]) and the popularity of the ''matha'' got a tremendous boost under his ''Ādhipatya'' (governance). He accepted a ''shishya'' in 1804 and ordained him '''Vāmanāshram'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=85|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H.

In the year 1823, Keshavāshram Swamiji attained ''Mahā-samadhi''. His ''samādhi'' is located at [[Shirali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi |pages=87|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H.

===Under Vāmanāshram (1823–1839)===
{{Main|Vamanashram|l1=Vāmanāshram Swamiji}}

Vāmansāshram Swamiji became the ''mathadhipati'' in 1823. Vāmanāshram Swamiji had the distinction of serving as the ''shishya'' of Keshavāshram Swamiji for 19 years. He was a person who was more involved in spiritual pursuits than in administration. To reduce the burdens of administration, he accepted a ''shishya''.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 91"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=91|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shishya was ordained as ''Krishnāshram'' in the year 1836.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm |title=H. H. Shrimat Vamanashram Swami (Mangalore)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After accepting a ''shishya'' Vamanāshram Swamiji gave up the administrative responsibilities and took the path of ''[[Tyāga]]'' (sacrifice)&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 91"/&gt; in 1836.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Stories of his divine powers and intensity of prayer are legends among the Sāraswats (see [[Vamanashram#Miracles|Miracles]]). Swamiji attained ''Mahā-samādhi'' in 1839. His ''samādhi'' stands at [[Mangalore]] within the premises of the Mangalore Math.&lt;ref name="Divgi 2002 91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Under Krishnāshram (1839–1863)===
{{Main|Krishnashram|l1=Krishnāshram Swamiji}}

Param Poojya Krishnāshram Swamiji gained control over the ''matha'' in 1839. He was a dynamic and able administrator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Krishnashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to architecture and infrastructure still stand today. He ordered the construction of temples and ''mathas'', set right existing ones and gradually got over many people from their [[Vaishnava]] practises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Swamiji accepted a ''shishya'' in 1857 and ordained him as ''Pāndurangāshram''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi|pages=104|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the dynamism of youth in Pādurangāshram swami, Swami Krishnāshram could introduce many reforms for the benefit of the community.

Swami Krishnāshram attained ''Maha-samadhi'' in 1863. His ''samadhi''(shrine) is located at Shirali.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=117|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Pāndurangāshram (1863–1915)===
{{Main|Pandurangashram|l1=Pāndurangāshram Swamiji}}

Param Poojya Pāndurangāshram took charge of the ''math'' in 1863. He is the longest serving ''Mathādhipati'' till date (52 years). He is considered one of the most brilliant of all the swamis and his mastery over [[Sanskrit]] and [[Logic]] was unquestionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=118–119|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after taking charge of the ''matha'', he continued to learn the [[Vedanta]] and the [[Upanishads]]. He stressed on the need for education in the community. Under his guidance, a school was established and he brought about the development of general infrastructure of Shirāli.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Pandurangashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swamiji stressed [[Dharma]] (the right way to live) and encouraged a sense of patriotism in his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi |pages=121 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came under criticism for imposing a ban on foreign travel. Anyone who went abroad or anyone who associated with a person who went abroad were excommunicated. Overall, the period under the leadership of Swami ''Pāndurangāshram'' is called the "Glorious Age" of the Saraswats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Math| first =Chitrapur| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Guruparampara Charita Saramrita| publisher =Chitrapur Math Publications| date =| location =| pages =| url =http://www.chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| doi =| id =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071017152230/http://chitrapurmath.net/books/BOOKS.HTM| archivedate =2007-10-17| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miracles have been attributed to swamiji. Swamiji was reluctant in adopting a ''shishya'' because of the lack of discipline within the community. Eventually when swamiji was very sick, he relented to the pressure of the people and accepted a ''shishya''. The new ''shishya'', who was just 8 years old, was ordained as ''Ānandāshram''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=135–137|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a sacred link in the ''Guru Parampara'' could be established. Pāndurangāshram Swamiji attained ''Mahā-samādhi'' in 1915. His ''samādhi'' is at Shirāli.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=141|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Ānandāshram (1915–1966)===
{{Main|Anandashram Swami|l1=Ānandāshram Swamiji}}

Ānandāshram Swamiji had served as ''mathādhipati'' for a glorious period of 51 years. Those were the years when India went through turbulent times of the [[Indian Independence Struggle|Independence struggle]]. Under Ānandāshram Swamiji the Sāraswat community developed at a rapid rate. The financial development was given top priority as the community was facing a financial crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm |title=H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the early parts of his reign. He brought about many social reforms like permission to go abroad and taking back the people from the community who had been ostracized for foreign visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=165|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H.

Shrimat Anandashram Swami (Shirali)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community underwent tremendous progress economically and morally under his regime.

Swami Anandashram accepted a ''shishya'' in 1959 and ordained him as Parijñānāshram. Swamiji attained ''Mahā-samādhi'' in 1966. His ''samadhi'' is in Shirali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=167–174|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath2007"/&gt;

===Under Parijñānāshram III(1966 - 1991)===
{{Main|Parijnanashram III|l1=Parijñānāshram III Swamiji}}

Parijñānāshram Swamiji took charge of the ''matha'' after the glorious years under Swami Ānandāshram. He was very intelligent, had a progressive outlook and a keen thirst for knowledge — Vedic as well as technical. His dynamic approach to matters regarding the ''matha'' brought back the financial stability it needed. His scientific temper resulted in the establishment of a printing press, Observatory and other technical advancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=179–183|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H. H. Shrimat Parijnanashram Swamiji-III (Karla)|accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was responsible for the starting of cottage and small-scale industries like printing press, handlooms and powerlooms, agro-industries in the regions around the ''math''. With the financial stability regained, the ''[[Chitrapur Math#Rathotsav|Rathōtsav]]'' (Car Festival) was restarted; it had been stopped under Swami Ānandāshram due to acute financial strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=179–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath1"/&gt;

His far-sighted and monumental development ideas did not go well with the "orthodox" members of the community. This resulted in a rift in the community. It also led to an open display of disrespect toward this Swamiji by certain lobbies. ''Swamiji'' true to his divine grace made the ultimate ''Tyāga'' (sacrifice) by giving up the administration of the ''matha'' in 1981. This was reminiscent of Swami Vāmanāshram who had done the same in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace|last=Divgi|first=Jyothi|pages=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Parijñānāshram III attained ''Mahā-samādhi'' in 1991. His ''samādhi'' is at [[Karli, India|Karla]] in Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="Divgi 189"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anugraha-A Saga of cascading grace |last=Divgi |first=Jyothi |pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath1"/&gt;

After the Samadhi of Parampoojya Parijnanashram Swamiji, the Karla Math continues to be managed by the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin community, under guidance from His successor, H H Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji, the 11th Guru in the Chitrapur Saraswat Guruparampara and spiritual head of the institutions running the Karla Math.

===Under Sadyojāt Shankarāshram (1997–present)===
{{Main|Sadyojat Shankarashram|l1=Sadyojāt Shankarāshram Swamiji}}

After a 6-year search for a Guru, (1991–1997) the Sāraswat community was blessed with a Mathādhipati and Guru - H H Param Poojya Sadyojāt Shankarāshram Swamiji. In Him the community found an erudite Vedic Scholar, an exponent of the advaitic Philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya,Teacher, reformist leader. and much more. Ordained into Sanyas by HH Swami Ishwarānanda Giriji Maharaj as Sadyojāt Samvat Giri[59][60]., He took up the reins of Shri Chitrapur Math in February 1997 as Sadyojat Shankarashram Swami at a well attended, elaborate Ceremony graced and blessed by H H Shankaracharya of Shringeri Shardamba Peetham.&lt;ref name="Divgi 189"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm|title=H.

Under Swami Sadyojāt Shankarāshram's guidance, the Shrivali Trust was established which has provided high quality medical care and drinking water to the people. Free value-based education is provided at the Shrivali School . Temples have been reconstructed from the state of ruin and general infrastructure developed. The Shri Chitrapur Math Charitable Trust today works for the empowerment of the villagers providing livelihood to the underprivileged. Swamiji has stressed the development of the youth as a force and has resulted in the conducting of very many ''[[Chitrapur Math#Shibhirs|Shibhirs]]'' (youth camps) for the physical, mental and spiritual development of the youth in the community.&lt;ref name="chitrapurmath3"/&gt;

==Conclusion==
The "Guru Parampara" of the Sāraswat Brahmins is something that they cherish and will always remain as the vital link that connects this small community of people, living in different parts of the globe, together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Guru Parampara| url =http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030418/http://www.chitrapurmath.net/parampara/guru_parampara.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number are also found in the port city of [[Karachi]] in [[Pakistan]]. There are now two communities of Chunara, one [[Hindu]] and the other [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="people_of_india"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part One edited by R.B. Lal, P.B.S.V. Padmanabham, G. Krishnan and M. Azeez Mohideen pages 298-299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word chunara in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] literally means someone who manufactures chuna (lime). According to their traditions, they were originally [[Rajput]]s who migrated from [[Rajasthan]] to [[Gujarat]] and joined the army of [[Gaekwar]]s of Baroda. After having a fall out with their employer, the [[Maratha]] ruler of [[Baroda]], they took to manufacturing lime. A section of the Chunara then converted to [[Islam]], and there are now distinct communities, one [[Hindu]] and the other [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="people_of_india"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d8yFaNRcYcsC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=CHUNARA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VXv7TJnbJo2GrAfuyrHKCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=CHUNARA&amp;f=false Chunara Community] Gujarat, Part 1 By Kumar Suresh Singh, Rajendra Behari Lal, Anthropological Survey of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw9uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=CHUNARA&amp;dq=CHUNARA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VXv7TJnbJo2GrAfuyrHKCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ Chunara] India's communities, Volume 1 by Kumar Suresh Singh, Anthropological Survey of India.&lt;/ref&gt;The Kadias and Bricklayers are also called Chunaras or lime-men whose main profession is brick laying, though a few among them work as masons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}(BY DEPARTMENT OF CENSUS, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA)

==Present circumstances==
Some members communities still own lime kilns employing other Chunaras. Other than selling lime, some Chunara are now also petty businessmen. The Chunara are endogamous, with the [[Hindu]] section practising clan exogamy. The [[Muslim]] Chunara marry close kin, and practice both cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages. For the [[Hindu]] community, the goddess Hinglaj Mata is a tribal deity. The [[Muslim]]s belong to the [[Sunni]] sect.&lt;ref name="people_of_india"/&gt;

A '''church building''' or '''church house''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for [[Christian]] religious activities, particularly for [[worship]] services. The term is often used by [[Christian]]s to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used (by analogy) to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism "The Manichaean Church"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional [[Christian architecture]], the church is often arranged in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the longest part of a cross is represented by the [[aisle]] and the junction of the cross is located at the [[altar]] area.

Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and conversely many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

The earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] ([[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].

==Etymology==
In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κυριακόν|κυριακόν]]}}) means "belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''" ("Lord"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence "''Kyriakós oíkos''" ({{lang|grc|Kυριακός οίκος}}) ("house of the Lord", church), "''Kyriakē''" ({{lang|grc|Κυριακή}}) ("[the day] of the Lord", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or "''Kyriakē proseukhē''" ({{lang-el|Κυριακή προσευχή}}) (the "[[Lord's Prayer]]").&lt;ref name="OEtymDChurch"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|"Cyrican" was an Old English word for churches and church property]]
In standard Greek usage, the older word "ecclesia" ({{lang-el|ἐκκλησία}}, ''ekklesía'', literally "assembly", "congregation", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a "[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the "'''C'''hurch"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').&lt;ref name="OEtymDChurch" /&gt;

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof. In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as "cirice", then [[Middle English]] "churche", and eventually "church" in its current pronunciation. German ''Kirche'', Scots ''kirk'', Russian {{lang|ru|церковь}} (''tserkov''), etc., are all similarly derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aggressivechristianity.net/articles/ecclesia.htm|title=THE CORRECT MEANING OF "CHURCH" AND "ECCLESIA"|website=www.aggressivechristianity.net|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Antiquity===
According to the [[New Testament]], the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:5 Acts 17:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A20&amp;version=NIV 20:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 16:19]) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or [[synagogue]]s ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A46&amp;version=NIV Acts 2:46], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+19%3A8&amp;version=NIV 19:8]). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a [[house church]] (''domus ecclesiae''), the [[Dura-Europos church]], founded between 233 and 256.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worship (''aula ecclesiae'') began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor [[Constantine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hartog |editor1-first=Paul |date= |title=The Contemporary Church and the Early Church: Case Studies in Ressourcement |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hlqUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;dq=early+church+buildings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipkrWVip3VAhUMD8AKHdfuD5AQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=early%20church%20buildings&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Pickwick Publications |page= |isbn= 978-1606088999 }} (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
[[File:Frauenkirche München abends.jpg|thumb|The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Munich]] is a largely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], medieval church.]]
From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller parish churches occurred across [[Western Europe]]. In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or the parish church was used by the community in other ways. It could serve as a meeting place for [[guilds]] or a hall for [[banquet]]s. [[Mystery plays]] were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for [[fair]]s. The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Romanesque architecture ====
Between 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the name of the romanesque era refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], it was actually a West- and Central European trend. Romanesque buildings appear rather bulky and compact. Typical features are [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on the pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] was more popular. The rooms became wider and the motivs of [[sculpture]]s became more epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&amp;dq=romanesque+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic architecture ====
The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[Île-de-France]] and spread through all of Europe. The gothic buildings were less compact than they had been in the romanesque era and often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegoric]] features. For the first time, [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es were used, with the result that massive walls were not longer needed to stabilise the building. Due to that advantage, the area of the windows became bigger, which resulted in a brighter and more friendly atmosphere inside the church. The [[nave]] became higher and so did the pillars and the church steeple. The amibition to test out the limits of the architectural possibilities resulted in the collapse of several towers. In [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], but also in [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] has the same height.

Cathedrals were built in a very lavish way, as in the romanesque era. Examples for that are the [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and the [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, but also the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d’Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and the [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[Lavenham]], [[England]].

Many gothic churches contain features from the romanesque era. Some of the most well-known gothic churches stayed unfinished for hundreds of years, after the gothic style was not popular anymore. About half of the [[Cologne Cathedral]] was for example build in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gothic+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=renaissance+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20architecture&amp;f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].

=== Baroque architecture ===
The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence.The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baroque+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%20architecture&amp;f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=Jörg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].

==Architecture==
{{main article|Church architecture}}
[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J. Burns|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the "west" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

Another common feature of many Christian churches is the [[Orientation of churches|eastwards orientation]] of the front [[altar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/sacred_places_the_significance_of_the_church_building/|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture {{!}} Articles {{!}} Sacred Places: The Significance of the Church Building|website=www.sacredarchitecture.org|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Often, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise. This tradition originated in Byzantium in the 4th century, and becomes prevalent in the West in the 8th to 9th century. 
The old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas of northern Europe under Frankish rule, as seen in [[Petershausen (Constance)]], [[Bamberg Cathedral]], [[Augsburg Cathedral]], [[Regensburg Cathedral]], and [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sX8w667tblMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22XI+Jahrh+fortgedauert%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir9NbtjObLAhWHDg8KHUFVA8kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22XI%20Jahrh%20fortgedauert%22&amp;f=false Heinrich Otte, ''Handbuch der kirchlichen Kunst-Archäologie des deutschen Mittelalters'' (Leipzig 1868), p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Basilica===
{{main article|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]'') was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.&lt;ref name="OXFORD1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Te2dAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture''] (2013 {{ISBN|978-0-19968027-6}}), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/the_eschatological_dimension_of_church_architecture|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture - Articles- The Eschatological Dimension of Church Architecture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.[[File:St. Peter and St. Paul's Church 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[nave]] of [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Vilnius]], Lithuania looking north-east towards the altar. An example of a [[Baroque]] church interior.]]

===Cathedral===

{{see|Duomo}}
[[File:Sant Vasily cathedral in Moscow.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]], Russia (today a museum) is a famous and characteristic example of a [[Russian Orthodox Church]] building.]]
A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In {{lang-la|ecclesia cathedralis}}). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building.

===Pilgrimage church===
{{main|Pilgrimage church}}
A pilgrimage church is a church to which [[pilgrimage]]s are regularly made, or a church along a pilgrimage route, often located at the tomb of a [[saint]]s, or holding icons or [[relic]]s to which miraculous properties are ascribed, the site of [[Marian apparition]]s, etc.

===Conventual church===
{{see|Priory|Katholikon}}
{{commonscat|Monastery church}}
A conventual church (or monastery church, [[Minster (church)|minster]], ''[[katholikon]]'') is the main church building in a Christian [[monastery]] or [[abbey]].

===Collegiate church===
{{main|Collegiate church}}
A collegiate church is a church where the [[daily office]] of worship is maintained by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]], which may be presided over by a [[Dean (religion)|dean]] or [[Provost (religion)|provost]].
Collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church, or by [[tithe]] income from [[impropriation|appropriated]] [[benefices]]. They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community.

===Alternative buildings===

'''Dharmaraja''' is the title of a Buddha, often mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures. For example, in the "Simile and Parable" (third) chapter of the [[Lotus Sutra]], [[Shakyamuni]] says, "I am the Dharma King, free to do as I will with the [[Dharma]]. To bring peace and safety to living beings—that is the reason I appear in the world."&lt;ref name="Lotus Sutra, chapter 3"&gt;http://www.buddhistdoor.com/oldweb/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to [[Mahayana Buddhism]], each Buddha presides over his [[Pure Land]], and hence this could explain the possible origin of the name Dharmaraja.

({{Hebrew|דור דעה}}; Hebrew: "generation of knowledge", an allusion to the Israelites who witnessed [[the Exodus]].)  That movement took its name in 1912&lt;ref&gt;Shalom 'Uzayri, ''Galei-Or'', Tel-Aviv 1974, p. 15 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Yemen]] under Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]], and had its own network of synagogues and schools,&lt;ref&gt;Louis Jacobs ''The Jewish religion: a companion'' (1995) p 226; "... known that the Haskalah literature in Hebrew had an influence on the far-flung Jewish community of the Yemen. ... The Dardaim rejected the predominance of the Kabbalah and encouraged secular studies, even establishing a modern ..."&lt;/ref&gt; although, in actuality, the movement existed long before that name had been coined for it. According to [[ethnographer]] and historian, [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], author and historiographer [[Hayyim Habshush]] had been a member of this movement before it had been given the name ''Dor Deah'', writing, “...He (i.e. Hayyim Habshush) and his friends, partly under European influence, but driven mainly by developments among the Yemenite Jews themselves, formed a group who ardently opposed all those forces of mysticism, superstition and fatalism which were then so prevalent in the country and strove for exact knowledge and independent thought, and the application of both to life.”&lt;ref&gt;''Travels in Yemen'' ({{Hebrew|חזיון תימן, רויא אלימן}}), Hayyim Habshush (ed. Shelomo Dov Goitein), Jerusalem 1941, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was only some years later, when Rabbi Yihya Qafih became the headmaster of the new Jewish school in [[Sana'a]] built by the Ottoman Turks and where he wanted to introduce a new curriculum in the school whereby boys would also learn arithmetic and the rudiments of the Arabic and Turkish languages that Rabbi [[Yihya Yitzhak Halevi]] gave to Rabbi Qafih's movement the name ''Daradʻah'', a word which is an Arabic broken plural made-up of the Hebrew words ''Dör Deʻoh'', and which means "Generation of Knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Shalom 'Uzayri, ''Galei-Or'' - ''Historical Chapters'', Tel-Aviv 1974, p. 15 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Its objects were:
#to combat the influence of the [[Zohar]] and subsequent developments in modern [[Kabbalah]], which were then pervasive in Yemenite Jewish life, and which the Dor Daim believed to be irrational and idolatrous;
# to restore what they believed to be a rational approach to Judaism rooted in authentic sources, including the [[Talmud]], [[Saadia Gaon]] and especially [[Maimonides]];
#to safeguard the older (''[[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]]'') tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance, which they believed to be based on this approach.

Today there is no official Dor Dai movement, but the term is used for individuals and synagogues within the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] community (mostly in Israel) who share the original movement's perspectives.  There are also some groups, both within and outside the Yemenite community, holding a somewhat similar stance, who describe themselves as ''talmide ha-Rambam'' (disciples of Maimonides) rather than ''Dor Daim''.

==History==

===Background: ''Baladi'' and ''Shami'' rituals===

Since the early Middle Ages the [[Yemenite Jew]]ish community followed the teachings of [[Maimonides]] on almost all legal issues, and their prayer book was substantially identical to the text set out in his "Sefer Ahavah". This is attested by the writings of several well known Rabbis such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Obadiah ben Abraham|Obadiah of Bertinoro]] and the [[Yihhyah Salahh|Maharitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chayas.com/tamirfolder/ramtemenglish.htm|title=The Rambam and the Jews of Yemen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yemenite tradition is therefore separate from both the [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardi]] and the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] streams in Judaism.

In the 16th and 17th centuries the teachings of the [[Kabbalah]], especially in the form advocated by [[Isaac Luria]] and his school, became increasingly popular in Yemen as in other countries. This did not always mean a change in the liturgy; Luria himself held that it was essential to keep to the form of prayers inherited from one's ancestors, so that one's prayers reached the gate in Heaven appropriate to one's tribe. However, many individuals and communities around the world (principally [[Mizrahi Jews]] but also [[Hasidic Judaism|Ḥasidim]]) discarded their ancestral rites in favor of the modified [[Sephardic Judaism#Lurianic Kabbalah|Sephardic rite]] used by Luria and his immediate circle, on the reasoning that this form of prayer reached a "thirteenth gate" for those who did not know their tribe.

This division would be reflected among the [[Yemenite Jews]]. The Shami sub-group adopted a Sephardic-influenced rite, in no small part due to its essentially being forced upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Shalom ben Aharon Ha-Kohen Iraqi would go to a different Yemenite synagogue each Shabbath with printed Sefardic siddurim, requesting that they pray נוסח ספרד and forcing it upon them if necessary (Rabbi Yosef Kapach, Passover Aggadta, p. 11). See also, [[Baladi-rite Prayer]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others retained the Yemenite ancestral liturgy, whether or not they accepted the Zoharic/Lurianic Kabbalah theologically. In the 18th century, to ensure the continued use of the Yemenite's original text, Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (known as the Maharitz) promoted compromise and introduced a new edition of the Yemenite Jewish prayer book which he created. It substantially followed the traditional Yemenite (Maimonidean) ritual, but made some concessions to the Kabbalists, for example by incorporating the hymn [[Lekhah Dodi|Lechah Dodi]]. This new standard became known as ''[[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]]'' (meaning "of the country", i.e. Yemen), in contrast to the adopted Lurianic-Sephardic ritual which was known as ''Shami'' (literally "northern", meaning Palestinian or [[Damascus|Damascene]]). The distinction also affected questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], with the Baladi community continuing to follow Maimonides almost exclusively while the Shami community also accepted the [[Shulchan Aruch]].

Over time more and more Kabbalistic practices became popular among the [[Yemenite Jews]] to the point that the ''Baladi'' community became localized as a significant population only around the area of [[Yemen]]'s capital city, [[Sana'a]]. Today, with the majority of [[Yemenite Jew]]ry being outside of [[Yemen]] and in closer contact with [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] Jews, it could be perceived that the proportion with which the Dor Daim perspective is spreading (though in a different form than the original) is not much different from the rate at which [[Yemenite Jews]] as a whole are giving up their unique traditions and assimilating into mainstream [[Judaism]].

===Formation of movement===
{{main article|Yemenite Jews#Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute}}
''Dor Daim'' emerged as a recognizable force in the later part of the 19th century.  The Dor Daim movement was formed by individuals who were displeased by the influence of Kabbalah which had been introduced to [[Yemen]] in the 17th century. They believed that the core beliefs of [[Judaism]] were rapidly diminishing in favor of the mysticism of the Kabbalah. Displeased by the direction that education and the social development of Yemen was taking, they opened their own educational system in Yemen (see [[Yemenite Jews#Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute|Dor Daim and Iqshim]]). They were also unhappy with the influence that Kabbalists (mystics) were having on various customs and rituals (e.g. the text of the prayer book), in addition to a strong superstitious influence which they saw as contrary to Maimonides. For example, Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih|Yosef Qafeh]] relates one of many Yemenite customs for "חינוך הבית" whereby they would bake plain bread without salt and prepare "the table of appeasement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Judeo-Yemeni Arabic|Yemenite-Arabic]]: מַידַת אַלנִיִיֵה. (Hebrew: שולחן הריצוי.) Compare [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15996/jewish/Chapter-65.htm#showrashi=true Isaiah 65]:11.&lt;/ref&gt; Inviting more than 10 children aged seven or eight who waited outside, they set the table, scattering thin-ash upon it; crumbled the plain bread into bits, placing them upon the table holding the ashes; and exited the kitchen stating, to the [[demon]]s (Hebrew: שדים), "this is your portion."&lt;ref&gt;[[Judeo-Yemeni Arabic|Yemenite-Arabic]]: הַדֵ'א קַסמַכֻם. (Hebrew: זה חלקכם.)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter they would abruptly open its doors, whereupon the children burst in, grabbing the saltless pieces and eating them. Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ|Yiḥyah Qafeh]] sharply opposed these ''[[minhag]]im'' being of the opinion that, in addition to the stupidity of the matter,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew original: שלדעתו נוסף לטיפשות שבדבר&lt;/ref&gt; they are [[Bible#Hebrew Bible|Biblically]] forbidden because of ''darchei haEmori''.&lt;ref&gt;Halikhoth Teiman (1963), p. 202. See also Guide for the Perplexed, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/more/c15-2.htm Part III, Chapter 46], footnote 22 in [[Yosef Qafih|Rabbi Kapach]]'s edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dor Daim considered the Kabbalists to be irrational in attitude and felt that they were thereby contributing to a decline in the social and economic status of the [[Yemenite Jews]]. The above-mentioned issues led Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]] to spearhead the Dor Daim movement. Among its goals was the revival and protection of what it saw as the original form of Judaism as codified by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the 1st through 3rd centuries.

The movement was not well received by some scholars in Yemen and [[Israel]]. Especially controversial were the views of the Dor Daim on the most popularized book of Kabbalah known as the [[Zohar]]. These views are put forth in a book called ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem#Milhamoth ha-Shem of Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ, 1931|Milhamoth HaShem]]'' (Wars of the Lord).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yahadut.org.il/zohar/milhamot-hashem.pdf yahadut.org.il] which was written by Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of Jerusalem rabbis published an attack on Rabbi Qafiḥ under the title of ''Emunat Hashem'' (Faith of the Lord), taking measures to ostracize members of the movement;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43777&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=9 עמל ורעות רוח וחרמות ותשובתם] by Rabbi Yiḥyeh Qafeh.&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding, not even the Yemenite rabbis who opposed the dardaim heeded this ostracism. Instead, they intermarried, sat together in ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]'', and continued to sit with Rabbi Yiḥyeh Qafeh in ''[[beth din]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa of Rabbi Ratzon Arusi (Hebrew): [https://web.archive.org/web/20141230042117/http://net-sah.org/faq/22879 דרדעים]&lt;/ref&gt;

From this time Yemenite Jews may be classified as Shami, mainstream [[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]] and Dor Dai or "Rambamist".  A term frequently used by Dor Daim for Yemenites who accept the Zohar is ''Iqq'shim'' (Hebrew: עִקְּשִׁים), i.e., "obscurantists".

An important later Yemenite authority was Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ's grandson, Rabbi [[Yosef Qafiḥ]], who edited many important works by [[Maimonides]] and [[Saadia Gaon]] (see his [[Yosef Qafih#Published works|published works]]) as well as issuing two new editions of the [[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]] prayer book.&lt;ref&gt;''Shivat Tziyon'' (1950s, 3 vols.); ''Siah Yerushalayim'' (1993, 4 vols.).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his grandfather he avoided expressing any opinion on the [[Zohar]], beyond saying that it was preferable to draw one's spiritual sustenance from the works of [[Maimonides]]. There is therefore some doubt about whether Rabbi Qafiḥ junior should be regarded as a Dor Dai or as a mainstream Baladi. His intention was probably to reconcile the two groups, in the same way as the Maharitz tried to reconcile traditionalists and Kabbalists.

===Dor Daim today===
There is no official Dor Dai organization thus they are hard to identify. Many individuals are reluctant to identify themselves by that name for fear of persecution. Some of the original Dor Dai synagogues in Israel survive, but have moved nearer to the mainstream Baladi tradition in the same way as Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ. Similarly, there is no universally recognized leader for the movement. The successor of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ as leader of the Yemenite community as a whole is generally considered to be Rabbi Ratzon Arusi of [[Qiryat Ono]].

Today's adherents have great respect for the Yemenite tradition in general however, they are not exclusively Yemenite in origin and may describe themselves as "''talmide ha-Rambam''" (disciples of Maimonides) rather than as "Dor Daim."  In 2005, there was a widely publicized gathering of hilltop [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] of Yemenite descent describing themselves as "Dor Daim",{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} but it is unclear how far these represent the historic Dor Dai movement.

==Beliefs==

===Theology===
Dor Daim place particular importance on the Jewish doctrine of the absolute unity of God, which they believe has been compromised by the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today. In support of this, they appeal to the [[Jewish philosophy|philosophical]] writings of various [[Geonim]] and [[Rishonim]] such as [[Saadia Gaon]], Rabbenu [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], Rabbi [[Judah Halevi|Yehuda Halevi]] and [[Maimonides]]. The following points concerning the Almighty's Unity are in particular emphasized both by Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'':

Note: None of these are controversial - mainstream Judaism has substantially the same beliefs.

* He is Incomparable to any created thing
* He is neither male nor female, but due to the limitations of human speech we must use certain terms allegorically and metaphorically to some extent in order to convey the fact that He ''does'' exist
* His existence is qualitatively different from all other existences, and all other existences depend upon Him and are sustained by Him, while He remains infinitely and unfathomably distinct and independent from all creation
* He is ''one'' unity unlike any unity in creation; His Oneness is not a unity which can be divided or which is composed of parts, both of which could only be the case with a unity that is subject to time/space; Nor is His Oneness a one in the sense of a species or type.
* No quality of creation applies to Him: not space, not time, not change, no concept of a body, form, or image, no concept of filling a body, form, or any location, nor any other factor of creation - for He is Perfect and Sufficient in Himself and has no need for any of these.  He is not a force or a power which possess or fills something else, nor is there any aspect of multiplicity in Him - as would be the case were the world literally to be within Him.  Any Biblical or Talmudic phrases which seem to imply that any quality of creation applies to Him must be understood as having some meaning other than its literal meaning, for He transcends all aspects of creation.  None of them are applicable to Him.
* The Splendor of the Reality of His Being is so great that no mind can grasp even the smallest part of it, for He has no parts, as it says, "..and to His Greatness there is no investigating." (Psalms 145:3)  Therefore, one must always be aware that the sublime Truth of His Being transcends anything we can ever express, but that all references to Him are either by speaking of what He is not or by way of literary tools such as metaphor.

===Attitude to Kabbalah===

In the book ''[[Milhamoth HaShem#Milhamoth ha-Shem of Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ, 1931|Milhamoth HaShem]]'', one finds that possibly the most fundamental issue the Dor Daim had (and have) with the popularly accepted understanding of [[Kabbalah]] concerns the absolute transcendent Singularity/Oneness of the Creator and the laws against ''avodah zarah'' (forbidden forms of devotion/idolatry). The Dor Daim believe that the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today are contrary to the absolute and incomparable Unity of the Creator and violate various laws against idolatry and polytheism, in particular the prohibition against ''Ribbuy Reshuyoth'' (worshipping or conceiving of a multiplicity of reigns) referred to by Maimonides in his [[Mishneh Torah]].

The issue is not the existence of Kabbalah as such. The ''word'' "Kabbalah" is used in older Jewish sources and by [[Maimonides]] to simply mean "tradition" and need not refer to mysticism of any kind. Furthermore, Dor Daim accept that in Talmudic times there was a secret mystical tradition in Judaism, known as ''Maaseh Bereshith'' (the work of creation) and ''Maaseh Merkavah'' (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these as respectively referring to something similar to [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of [[Torah]]. They simply reject the notion that this tradition is represented by the ideas popularly referred to as Kabbalah in our days.

Neither Dor Daim nor ''talmide ha-Rambam'' are against mysticism per se. Rabbi [[Yosef Qafiḥ]], for example, published the ancient mystical text ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' together with his translation of [[Saadia Gaon]]'s commentary. Likewise, [[Bahya ibn Paquda]] and [[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham son of Maimonides]] (sometimes described as "Jewish [[Sufi]]s") are especially respected among Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam''.

In particular a Dor Dai is not bound to reject the theory of the ten [[Sefirot]], as set out in the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]''. In the ''Sefer Yetzirah'', unlike in later Kabbalah, there is no question of the Sefirot being Divine entities or even attributes: they are simply the numerals, considered as the dimensional parameters used in the creation of the world.

What they view as the problem comes in with the [[Bahir|Sefer ha-Bahir]] and the [[Zohar]], where the Sefirot have become hypostatized as Divine attributes or emanations, and it seems that religious devotions can never be addressed directly to the ''En Sof'' (the Absolute) but only through one or other of the Sefirot; and in modern ''[[Nusach#Sephardi and Mizrachi nuschaot|Edot ha-Mizrach]]'' prayer books each occurrence of the [[Tetragrammaton|Divine Name]] is vocalized differently in a kind of code to show which Sefirah one should have in mind. This problem is compounded in the teachings of [[Isaac Luria]] as found in the writings of [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Ḥayim Vital]], where it is held that as a result of some catastrophe in Heaven, the Sefirot vessels have fractured and their channels re-formed into a variously stated number of inter-relating [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|personalised aspects]] within God's Manifestation known as [[Partzufim]] (from Greek προσωπα, faces), teaching that the purpose of each religious observance is to assist their unification. This is felt as being uncomfortably close to polytheism.

The original Dor Daim, such as [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]], condemned the [[Zohar]] as an outright forgery and as filled with idolatry. Some of today's Dor Daim take a somewhat more moderate stance, allowing that the [[Zohar]] may contain elements of authentic [[Midrash]] together with a great deal of later interpolation, while considering the Zohar in its present form to be an unsafe guide, both to theology and to practice. Other segments of [[Orthodox Judaism]] which share this perspective of the Dor Daim, while not necessarily rejecting the Zohar itself, include most ''talmide ha-Rambam'' (disciples of [[Maimonides]]), as well as portions of the [[Modern Orthodox]] community and others. Those among these groups who do not reject the Zohar assert that the Kabbalah as popularly taught today represents a distortion of the Zohar's intended teachings. However, the specific issues identified by the Dor Daim remain in all current and older editions of the Zohar.

===Heresy===
A figure spoken of frequently in the esoteric works on [[Kabbalah]], particularly in the [[Zohar]], is what has come to be known as the "lesser countenance" (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), or the [[Demiurge]], which term and its usage is believed to have been of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] church origin, although in later years was seen by the kabbalists as one of the angels in heaven associated with the emotive faculties of the soul and with the concept of "finite power." The same figure is also known in Latin writings as ''[[Zeir Anpin|Microprosopus]]'', derived from the Greek ''mikros'' small + ''prosopon'' face, and is said to have a father. Certain kabbalists allege that our prayers and our worship go unto the "lesser countenance", and that the world was created by him.&lt;ref&gt;''Shevuth Teiman'', Yisrael Yeshayahu &amp; Aharon Tzadok, Tel-Aviv 1945, p. 216 (Hebrew), who brings down this teaching in the name of Shemuel b. Yosef Adeni, author of ''Naḥalath Yosef'', who brings down the teaching in the name of ''Sefer HaBrit''. The concept is further explained in Rabbi Qafih's seminal work, Milhamot Hashem, [http://www.yahadut.org.il/zohar/milhamot-hashem.pdf#page=37 ''chapter 30''] (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; To Rabbi Yehiya al-Qafih, such statements amounted to heresy, since there was none other but God who created the universe and unto whom, alone, we are to pray.

In a letter addressed to Rabbi [[Avraham Isaac Kook]], the chief Rabbi of [[Mandate Palestine]], Rabbi Yihya Qafih argues effectually that such beliefs stand in contradiction to the Law bequeathed to us by Moses. He levels harsh criticism against the Zohar for its endorsement of heretical teachings, such as that of the "lesser countenance" (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), as well as against the new kabbalists who claim that "lesser countenance" is our God and we are his people, such as described by ''Sefer HaBrit'' (Article 20, item # 15) and by ''Yosher Levav'' (page 4),  and who allege wrongly that it was he who brought us out of the land of Egypt, and that his wife (who is ''Malkhut'') was she who smote the Egyptians in Egypt and at the sea, while it was he who revealed himself unto Israel at Mount Sinai and gave to us his Divine Law &lt;ref&gt;''Shevuth Teiman'', Yisrael Yeshayahu &amp; Aharon Tzadok, Tel-Aviv 1945, p. 216 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; All these things, Rabbi Qafih alleged, should be expunged from our religion, since the import of the Torah is clear that only God, and God alone, had done all these things for Israel.

===Reincarnation and Invocation of Saints===

Another matter of dispute between Dor Daim and the Kabbalists concerns the Dor Daim's rejection of [[reincarnation]]. They support their rejection with writings of [[Saadia Gaon]] (892-942) who dismissed reincarnation as an unauthentic Jewish belief. This perspective is shared not only by non-Dor Dai disciples of [[Rambam]] ([[Maimonides]]) but also by many in mainstream [[Orthodox Judaism]].

Dor Daim also disapprove of requesting from any unseen force other than the Almighty.  They are against soliciting angels or Jewish leaders who have died.  They disapprove of such practices regardless of one's location, and even if the individual desires that the angel or saint intercede with God. Dor Daim, indeed all ''Meqoriim'', consider such practices absolutely antithetical to the most essential principles of what they believe to be historical Judaism:  to serve the One Incomparable Creator without joining partners or mediators together with Him in our prayers and worship. This is based on their understanding of the books mentioned above, and specifically on the laws concerning mediator (''sarsur'') or an advocate (''melitz'') mentioned in the [[Mishneh Torah]] and the fifth of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]].  Prayer, in Judaism, is a form of worship: as the ancient sages of Israel are well known to have stated, "What is the service of the heart?  This is prayer."

In addition to the issue of invoking forces other than the Almighty, Dor Daim and ''[[#Gaonists|Meqoriim]]'' in general disapprove of the common practice of visiting the graves, shrines, or monuments of saints, even if an individual does not request from a force other than the Almighty.  Basing themselves on [[Talmud]]ic sources codified in the [[Mishneh Torah]], they believe this to be a prohibition instituted by the Sages of the Great Court established under Moses - the [[Sanhedrin]].  They generally consider this prohibition to have been instituted as a means to distance the people of Israel from the possibility of transgressing what ''Meqoriim'' consider to be the Biblical-prohibitions of establishing a "monument" (prohibited even without any connection to idolatry) and from invoking any force other than the Almighty.  This, they point out, is the very same reason Jewish tradition explains why [[Moses]]' burial place was left unknown according to the Biblical record.

===Jewish law===

Dor Daim disapprove of what they believe to be an abandonment of a number of Talmudic practices on the part of a large portion of the Jewish world in favor of newer customs and innovations, some of which, in their opinion, are even contrary to Talmudic law.  In particular this disapproval is aimed at customs derived from the Kabbalah, but it is not confined to them.  In their view, and still more in the view of the ''talmide ha-Rambam'', there is simply no constitutional authority in Jewish law to institute new rules or practices, whether in the direction of leniency or of severity, since the demise of the [[Sanhedrin]] in 425 CE, or at the latest the closure of the [[Talmud]], and the role of later rabbis is confined to teaching and codification of the law as it stood at that date.  They do not claim that this position is ideal, and would gladly see a revived Sanhedrin sort out the problems in Jewish law, provided that it was itself established in strict conformity to law.

In their view, the [[Mishneh Torah]] of [[Maimonides]] is the most accurate and therefore most authoritative statement of Talmudic law, and is in itself a sufficient reference without resort to any other source.  [[Maimonides]] writes that if the [[Mishneh Torah]] was intended to be explained by the Talmud he wouldn't have written the [[Mishneh Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;"אלו היתה מטרתנו לפרש את החבור על ידי התלמוד לא היינו כותבים את החבור" (page קלו in [[Yosef Qafih|Rabbi Kapach]]'s edition of אגרות הרמב"ם).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the current text of the Talmud is fairly corrupt with numerous textual variants; from this, coupled with [[Maimonides]]' indications that he had far more accurate and complete Talmudic texts available to him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/4111.htm Hilkhot Ishut 11]:13; [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/d315.htm Hilkhot Malveh v'Loveh 15]:2.&lt;/ref&gt; they conclude that the Mishneh Torah provides the best access to what the Talmud must originally have intended.

Unlike many of the later ''talmide ha-Rambam'', the original Dor Daim were not committed to the view that all local [[Minhag|custom]], whether [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardi]] or [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] or from any other source, is totally illegitimate to the extent that it differs from normative Jewish law (as best stated, in their view, by Maimonides), so they preserved certain non-Maimonidean Yemenite peculiarities in minor matters.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.chayas.com/kapachintrocomment.doc excerpt from R. Qafiḥ's introduction to Mishneh Torah].&lt;/ref&gt;  However they did believe, in reliance on old authorities such as [[Yosef Karo|Joseph Caro]]&lt;ref&gt;Responsa ''Avqat Rochel'' para 32: "Now the Rambam, is the greatest of all the legal authorities, and all the communities of Erets Yisrael and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [i.e. North Africa] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon themselves as their Chief Rabbi; why pressure them to budge from him?"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David ibn abi Zimra]], that the views of Maimonides ought to be authoritative not only in Yemen but also in Eretz Yisrael, Egypt and the Near East generally.

There is a link between the Dor Daim's stance on Jewish law and on the other issues, as one argument for accepting the Mishneh Torah as the best restatement of Jewish law is that most of the later codifiers, including [[Joseph Caro]], were believers in Kabbalah and should therefore not be accepted as authorities. As against this, many (e.g. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]]) argue that Caro and the others were operating within the rigorous rules of [[Halakha|halachic]] reasoning and that their conclusions were in no way affected or invalidated by their personal theological views (just as, from the opposite perspective, Maimonides' status as a halachic authority is not affected by his acceptance of Greek philosophy). The Dor Daim reply to this is that Caro specifically allows the Zohar as a (limited and subordinate) source of rulings in Jewish law, so that his code includes practices found in Kabbalistic texts without basis in Talmudic texts.

==Practices==

Those aspects of Jewish/Talmudic law which Dor Daim may emphasize, be particularly passionate about, and/or consider to have been cast aside by large portions of the Jewish world include:

* laws on 'avodah zarah' (forbidden forms of worship/idolatry) which they hold prohibits any use of intermediaries or mediators between oneself and the One Creator, prohibits praying or making requests to unseen forces such as past Rabbis or Sefirot, or supplicating to any unseen being other than the One Absolute Being - Y/H/W/H, and not doing any specific acts of religious devotion to any thing other than He;
* laws of legislation relating to the function and necessity of the Great Court (the [[Sanhedrin]])
* laws concerning the settlement of the Land of Israel by the People of Israel as elaborated upon in Hilkhoth Melakhim u'Milhamotheham in the [[Mishneh Torah]];
* certain laws concerning [[kashrut]]h, such as Halita - immersing meat into boiling water before cooking;
* preservation of proper and exact pronunciation of all the [[Hebrew]] letters and Hebrew grammar (although there are minute differences even amongst the Dor Daim);
* emphasizing memorization of the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Ḥumash]] (the [[Torah]]/Law of Moses); for example, each of the 7 individuals called up to read from a [[Sefer Torah]] (Torah scroll) reads out loud the particular section of that week's parasha (section) upon which he said a blessing, as opposed to other customs in which there is a single, set reader. (This custom arose from there existing some people who did not know the cantillations by heart, and would be embarrassed to read in public);
* that unmarried females should also wear a head-covering, and not only married women.
* that one should strive to wear a [[Tallit]] Gadol and or [[Tefillin]] as much as permitted by Talmudic law whenever possible. In various areas of Israel, including Jerusalem, one may see individuals wearing the [[Tallit]] Gadol during 'Erev Shabbat' (Friday night) hanging over or wrapped over their shoulders in a manner distinct from the majority custom, when almost no other Jews would be wearing a [[Tallit]] Gadol.  Even children under 13 can be seen wearing a [[Tallit]] Gadol among them.

Dor Daim usually use [[Yosef Qafiḥ]]'s edition of the [[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]] [[Siddur#Yemenite Jews (Teimanim)|prayer book]].  This is on the lines of the prayer book of the Maharitz, and therefore contains some Kabbalistic insertions, enabling the book to be used by mainstream Baladi Jews.  However, these insertions are clearly marked by footnotes as being later additions.  Dor Daim can therefore use this prayer book and simply omit these additions.

==Similarities and differences with other groups==

===Mainstream [[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]] Jews===

As previously explained, the Baladi/Shami distinction does not always coincide with the Dor Daim/Iqshim distinction.  That is, while a Dor Dai is necessarily a [[Baladi-rite Prayer|Baladi]], and a Shami is necessarily an Iqshi (Kabbalist), most Baladim occupy an intermediate point on the spectrum and may or may not accord some validity to Kabbalah.

The distinguishing mark of a Baladi individual or community is the use of the traditional liturgy, regardless of the underlying theological or intellectual orientation.  Some Baladim may sympathize to a greater or lesser extent with the Dor Dai distrust of Zoharic and Lurianic Kabbalah.  Others may accept the Lurianic version of Kabbalah but retain the ancestral liturgy on the ground that, even according to Luria, this is the Kabbalistically correct thing to do.  Others again may have no particular views one way or the other.  However, Baladim of all shades uniformly accept the Mishneh Torah rather than the Shulchan Aruch as their authority on Jewish law.

Outwardly the practices of Baladi Jews and Dor Daim are almost identical, apart from some Kabbalistic insertions to be found in the Baladi prayer book.  However most Baladim, while holding that the Mishneh Torah is the best interpretation of Jewish law, are content to preserve it as the particular custom of their group and do not seek to delegitimize the customs of other Jewish communities. (How far the Dor Daim seek to do this is a matter of debate.)

Several of the [[#Practices|above-listed]] distinctions between Dor Daim and the majority of world Jewry are shared by all traditional Baladi [[Yemenite Jews]], and not just by Dor Daim.  On matters of law and practice as opposed to theology, the only difference between Dor Daim and the rest of Baladi [[Yemenite Jews]] appears to be the level of zeal in preserving the above listed practices, although exceptions do exist.

===''Talmide ha-Rambam''===

Dor Daim are regarded as part of a wider trend within Judaism known as ''talmide ha-Rambam'' (pupils of Maimonides), not necessarily confined to the Yemenite community.  It is important to note that although Dor Daim always identify with the [[Rambam]]'s legal and theological perspectives on Judaism (''hashkafa''), Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'' are not necessarily one and the same.  That is, a disciple of the Rambam may or may not be a Dor Dai; however, a Dor Dai will always be (in a broader sense) a disciple of the Rambam.

Today's ''talmide ha-Rambam'' differ from the original Dor Daim in two ways.

*''Talmide ha-Rambam'' do not necessarily reject the [[Zohar]].  However, their interpretation may differ more or less drastically from the [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic]] school or the currents of thought popularly referred to as "Kabbalah" today.
*''Talmide ha-Rambam'' tend to hold that the [[Mishneh Torah]] is the best restatement of [[Talmud]]ic law, and that every custom that diverges from it is logically inferior if not actually illegitimate.  On points not explicitly covered by Maimonides, such as the exact mode of prostration during prayers, there is considerable competition to unearth the most authentic mode from among the various Yemenite practices found in recorded history.  Dor Daim, by contrast, do retain some current Yemenite practices, even when (according to the ''talmide ha-Rambam'') these diverge from the views of Maimonides (see under [[#Jewish law|Jewish law]] above).  For example, they do not follow Maimonides' recommendation{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} to eliminate all prayers prior to the Kaddish and Shema in order to avoid 'unnecessarily burdening the congregation'.

In short, ''talmide ha-Rambam'' are less extreme than Dor Daim about the Zohar and more extreme about "Maimonides-only" jurisprudence.  Nevertheless, the similarities between the two groups, as expressed in the list of beliefs and practices above, overwhelmingly outnumber the differences.

Many members of the small and slowly growing Dor Dai community claim a fear of persecution and therefore maintain an almost secret existence.  It is very likely that the entire movement of Dor Daim, together with some of their well-known leaders, has helped, and continues to help, fuel the rapidly growing community of ''talmide ha-Rambam''.  It is undeniable that, while there are sometimes differences between Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'' as a whole—over certain details of practical Jewish law and the issue of the Zohar—the two communities continue to have strong links.

As stated, ''talmide ha-Rambam'' differ from Dor Daim in that they are not confined to the Yemenite community and need not be committed to specifically Yemenite customs.  Nonetheless Yemenite scholarship and practice are still a major resource for them.  Two good examples of this are seen in the works of Rabbi [[Yosef Qafiḥ]] and of Mechon-Mamre.org.  
*Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ has made various contributions to Dor Daim, ''talmide ha-Rambam'' and the Jewish world as a whole.  Examples of his contributions include his encyclopedic commentary to the entire [[Mishneh Torah]] set to the renowned Yemenite text of the [[Mishneh Torah]], his translation of all of [[Maimonides]]' Commentary on the [[Mishnah]] from Arabic into modern Hebrew, as well as translations of the [[Guide for the Perplexed]], [[Duties of the Heart]], Sefer [[Kuzari]], and a number of other works.
*Mechon-Mamre.org has produced [[Torah databases|software]] for learning the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Ḥumash]], [[Tanakh]], [[Mishnah]], the [[Talmud]]ic texts, as well as the [[Mishneh Torah]] according to Rabbi Qafiḥ and its own accurate and scholarly text, intended to be beneficial to all.  The Mechon-mamre.org website's "About" section  states that most participants in the work of Mechon-Mamre are Baladi [[Yemenite Jews]], although some of the more impacting individuals of Mechon-Mamre.org are not Yemenite or Dor Daim at all, but merely promote observance of [[Talmud]]ic law as codified in the [[Mishneh Torah]].

Dor Daim and "Rambamists" are most easily recognized by the manner in which their [[Tzitzit]] are tied (according to the Rambam, despite slight variations in understanding). Temani/Rambam Tzitzit can be distinguished from those of the many 'knitted kippa' youths who have adopted the same style, but have added [[Tzitzit#Tekhelet|Tekhelet]]. Rambamists and Baladim are also noticeable by the fact that they wear their [[Tallit]] in a different manner from non-Yemenite Jews, and even wear it on Friday nights/Erev Shabbath, which is almost unheard of in non-Yemenite synagogues (apart from a handful of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] in Jerusalem, referred to as ''Yerushalmis'', who wear it very discreetly so as to not look arrogant).

===Gaonists===

Dor Daim as well as non-Yemenite or non-Dor Dai students of the [[Rambam]] all find a certain level of commonality with individuals who sometimes call themselves ''Gaonists''. ''Gaonists'' aim at applying Jewish law in everyday life according to the writings of the [[Geonim]] as a whole without singling out any one particular Gaon or codification of Jewish law over another.  The commonality between all of these groups is sourced in their shared pursuit of living according to the original understanding of Talmudic law as much as possible with as little influence from the effects of almost 2,000 years of exile as possible.  These groups together are sometimes referred to as ''Meqoriim'' (originalists/followers of the originals).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Mitnaggedim and followers of the Vilna Gaon===

The dispute between Dor Daim and ''Aqashim'' has some similarities to that between [[Misnagdim|Mitnaggedim]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], with the [[Vilna Gaon]] and his heirs standing for Talmudic intellectualism and a Halachic worldview like Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ. However, mainstream [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvish Jews]] venerate the Zohar and Luria, and like the Hasidim their elite write Kabbalistic commentaries.&lt;ref name=Dan&gt;[[Joseph Dan]], ''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2007. Chapters 8-Modern and Contemporary Hasidism and 9-Some Aspects of Contemporary Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Dan]] writes that there is no truth to the popular notion that the Mitnaggedim were more [[Jewish philosophy|rationalist]] than the Hasidim; [[Lurianic]] notions dominate in the theologies of both camps.&lt;ref name=Dan/&gt; Their dispute can be seen as a battle within two conceptions of Lurianic kabbalah; the Mitnaggedim being faithful to received Kabbalah, while the Hasidim introduced new conceptions into theirs, particularly new conceptions of mystical [[Tzadik|leadership]].&lt;ref name=Dan/&gt; On the whole, Mitnagdic-Litvish Judaism accepted Kabbalah, but had a distinctive "intellectualist" understanding of it.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, Norman, ''Torah Lishmah: Torah for Torah's Sake in the Works of Rabbi Hayyim of Volozhin and his Contemporaries'': New York 1989, hardback {{ISBN|0-88125-117-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88125-117-3}}, paperback {{ISBN|0-88125-133-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88125-133-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different interpretations of Luria arose among his followers regarding whether [[tzimtzum]] (withdrawal of Divinity from Creation) should be taken literally or metaphorically. Hasidism read it metaphorically and [[Divine immanence|immanently]], leading to [[Panentheism]]. Mitnaggedism read it [[Divine transcendence|transcendentally]] in relation to Man, leading to [[Theism]], though allowing validity to Panentheism solely from the Divine perspective.&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;[[Norman Lamm]], ''Faith &amp; Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought'', Ktav, reissued 2007. Chapter "Monism for Moderns" summarises Mitnaggedic-Hasidic theological difference based on his ''Torah Lishmah'' book doctoral thesis. Hayyim Volozhin and Schneur Zalman of Liadi are seen as the main theorists of each camp. Both systemised their ideologies, while attenuating their schism; Schneur Zalman seeking Talmudic learning and Hayyim Volozhin granting legitimacy to Panentheism solely from the Divine perspective of elite prayer, but not in Halacha or popular spirituality&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] accused the Vilna Gaon of taking tzimtzum literally and not following Luria fully, though Mitnaggedic Kabbalists rejected this. It seems that the Vilna Gaon, who wrote extensive Kabbalistic works, followed the Lurianic system, but diverged from Luria when he felt the Zohar lent itself to another approach. The issue is the subject of forewords to the main texts of Lithuanian Kabbalah: the introduction, by  Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin|Ḥayyim of Volozhin]], to the Vilna Gaon's commentary to the ''Sifra di-Tsniuta'' and Rabbi Yitzchak Eizik Chaver's ''Pitchei Shearim''.

In his ''Nefesh HaHayyim'', Hayyim Volozhin, founder of the Litvish [[Yeshiva]] movement and main theorist of Mitnaggedism, responds to the theology of Schneur Zalman's ''[[Tanya]]'' based on different interpretation of the same Kabbalistic sources. Their difference revolves around alternate identifications between Divine Immanence/Transcendence and Divine Monism/Pluralism. For Hayyim Volozhin and Mitnaggedic-Litvish Judaism:&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt; Man relates to transcendent Theism intellectually through Talmud and Halacha, rather than to immanent Panentheism through Hasidic [[devekut]]. Kabbalah is reserved for the elite, rather than popularised in Hasidism. Elite Mitnaggedic prayer uses Kabbalistic worldview to relate to the ultimate non-existence of Creation from the Divine perspective. For the mainstream, spirituality is through Talmudic study and Halachic worldview for its own sake.

Regarding [[Halacha|Jewish Law]], those of the Vilna Gaon's successors who were associated with the [[Volozhin yeshiva]], such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisker]] group and in particular Rabbi [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], had a very high regard for the [[Mishneh Torah]] and held it as the best tool for the theoretical understanding of the [[Talmud]] and of Jewish law generally.  When however it came to practical [[Posek|legal rulings]], an activity of which they steered clear when possible, they adhered to the normative [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] version of Halakha, as set out in the [[Shulchan Aruch]] and the glosses of [[Moses Isserles]].

There are various groups in Israel today which claim to follow the Vilna Gaon. These may be found in places as diverse as the [[Neturei Karta]] and the fringes of [[Religious Zionism]], the latter group being represented by the [[Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu|Aderet Eliyahu yeshiva]]. Their intellectualist orientation has some similarities to that of the Dor Daim, though also venerating Kabbalah.

Some thinkers of a ''mitnagged'' cast of thought, however, such as [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]], reject Zoharic Kabbalah and praise the work of Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radicaltorahthought.com/idol%20worship%20is%20still%20within%20us.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish and Portuguese Jews===

Dor Daim and other Yemenite ''talmide ha-Rambam'' like to compare themselves to the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], and think of them as "the other Rambam Jews".  This is largely because of their shared scepticism about the Zohar.  The resemblance has however been exaggerated.

Spanish and Portuguese Jews preserve an early form of the Sephardic liturgy from before the expulsion from Spain, which reflected some, but only very limited, influence from the Kabbalah and the Zohar.  In the 16th and early 17th centuries they adopted a certain number of Lurianic observances in a piecemeal fashion, for example the [[Tu Bishvat#The Tu Bishvat Seder|Tu Bishvat seder]].  After the [[Sabbatai Zevi]] debacle these observances were largely dropped, because it was felt that Lurianic Kabbalah had contributed to the disaster.  The arguments against the authenticity of the Zohar advanced by [[Jacob Emden]] and [[Leon of Modena|Leone di Modena]] were also influential.  At the present day the general Spanish and Portuguese attitude to the Kabbalah is one of indifference rather than hostility. As Spanish and Portuguese communities act as hosts for [[Sephardi Jews]] of many other backgrounds, there would be no bar on individuals regarding Kabbalah more positively.  In particular, the Lurianic Kabbalah had a following in the [[Jewish community of Livorno]], which falls within the Spanish and Portuguese group but was the main point of contact between it and the Levantine Sephardim.  The Spanish and Portuguese group's closest resemblance would therefore be not to Dor Daim but to mainstream Baladi Yemenites.

Spanish and Portuguese Jews admire [[Maimonides]] and identify with the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].  However, they cannot be classified as "Rambamists" in the sense required, as their religious law is based squarely on the ''Bet Yosef'' of [[Joseph Caro]], subject to certain liturgical customs peculiar to themselves.  It could even be argued that they follow Caro more closely than any other group, as many other Sephardim, especially the eastern communities influenced by the [[Ben Ish Chai]], regard [[Isaac Luria]] as having equal or even greater authority than Caro.

The above describes the attitude of traditional communities such as London and Amsterdam.  In some newer communities, in particular among the followers of [[José Faur]] and Yaakov Oliveira,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judaismo-iberico.org/an00.htm O que é a qabalah?] (in Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt; a more purist and principled attitude has evolved, which does place considerable emphasis on the [[Mishneh Torah]]; however they also utilize the [[Shulchan Aruch]] in their lectures in order to help promote the study of practical Jewish law amongst the greater Jewish community.

==Criticisms==

1. There are those who would claim that Dor Daim and even all students of the [[Rambam]] are heretics by reason of their non-acceptance of Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Chaim Kanievsky]], ''Derech Emunah'' p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;  This claim depends on the assumption that the [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic]] [[Kabbalah]] is a dogma of Judaism binding upon all Jews.  Not only the Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'', but many other Orthodox groups, such as the followers of the [[Vilna Gaon]] along with many of the non-[[Hasidic]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], would disagree with this assumption, regardless of whether or not they personally accept the Lurianic Kabbalah. Such a view, according to Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]], does not make the Dor Daim  heretics.&lt;ref name="hydepark.hevre.co.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydepark.hevre.co.il/topic.asp?topic_id=2503514&amp;whichpage=4&amp;forum_id=20067#R_3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029162124/http://hydepark.hevre.co.il/topic.asp?topic_id=2503514&amp;whichpage=4&amp;forum_id=20067#R_3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-29|title=הייד פארק - מרכז פורומים ישראלי - דרדעים כופרים|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rabbis [[Eliyahu Dessler]] and [[Gedaliah Nadel]] maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]] and that it had a late authorship.&lt;ref name="Chareidi, 2005; Shapiro, 2011"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140830135654/http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/ZoharEnglish.pdf#page=39#page=39 An Analysis of the Authenticity of the Zohar] (2005), p. 39, with "Rav E" and "Rav G" later identified by the author as Rabbi [[Eliyahu Dessler]] and Rabbi [[Gedaliah Nadel]], respectively (Rabbi Dr. [[Marc Shapiro]] in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416154417/http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,1861/ Milin Havivin Volume 5] [2011], Is there an obligation to believe that Rebbe Shimon bar Yochai wrote the ''Zohar''?, p. יב [PDF page 133]):

I would just add that not only is nikud mentioned, but only the Tiberian Nikkud - the norm in Europe of the middle ages - is mentioned and not the Yerushalmi nikud or the Babylonian one — which was used then in the Middle East, and is still used by Yemenites today. Also the Taamay Hamikrah - the trop - are referred to in the Zohar - only by their Sefardi Names.

This portion (along with the remainder) was later published, from manuscript, by Dr. Maoz Kahana and Michael K. Silber in ''[https://www.academia.edu/18006793/_Deists_Sabbatians_and_Kabbalists_in_Prague_A_Censored_Sermon_of_R._Ezekiel_Landau_1770_in_Hebrew_Kabbalah_21_2010_349-384 Deists, Sabbatians and Kabbalists in Prague: A Censored Sermon of R. Ezekiel Landau, 1770]'', Kabbalah 21 (2010), p. 355 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dor Dai response is that whether a person or school is heretical is a question of law, to be decided according to authoritative works of [[halakha]]: one is not a heretic simply for disagreeing with a widely held [[Aggadah|aggadic]] interpretation, unless the ''halakha'' specifically says so.  The [[Mishneh Torah]] is comprehensive in scope and is, at the very least, ''one'' of the authoritative sources of ''halakha'', so to follow it must be an acceptable way of doing Judaism.  Accordingly, since the Dor Daim assert nothing that is not found within the four corners of the [[Mishneh Torah]], and the Mishneh Torah cannot be interpreted as actually requiring belief in anything approaching Zoharic or Lurianic Kabbalah, they cannot be heretics - unless the Mishneh Torah itself is heretical, which is not held by any mainstream Jewish group.''

2. Others believe that the main problem is not that Dor Daim do not follow Kabbalah for themselves, but that they delegitimize those who do follow it.  Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]], for instance, held that one must not use parchments written by, or eat meat slaughtered by, believers in Kabbalah because these are dedicated to ''Zeir Anpin'' (one of the ''partzufim'' of the 10 [[sephirot]]), a concept apparently distinct from the Unfathomable Almighty Creator.

Few Dor Daim take such an extreme view today, as most consider that the above reasoning makes Jewish law too uncertain in practice.  Those who do take such a view would argue that it is not at all uncommon in Judaism for one group to treat as invalid the ritual acts or objects of another for technical or doctrinal reasons.  That does not amount to an attempt to exclude the other group from Judaism.

3. A third criticism is that Dor Daim take works of Kabbalah too literally: it is intended to be myth and metaphor, and to subject it to rigorous analysis as the Dor Daim do is like trying to construe a work of poetry as if it were a statute.  Works of Kabbalah themselves contain warnings that the teachings should not be exposed to common view or read too realistically, and that to do so is indeed to incur the danger of falling into heresy or idolatry.

The Dor Dai response to this is that, however this may be in theory, these warnings have not been observed.  Kabbalah, in its most literal and "realistic" sense, has in fact been extensively popularised, with the result that many otherwise pious Jewish groups are now permeated with superstition, so that the whole enterprise is now more trouble than it is worth.  Further, the claim that these works, on their true interpretation, are harmless metaphorical imagery fully compatible with monotheism is disingenuous: the origins of most Kabbalistic concepts in pagan systems such as [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]] are too glaringly obvious to be ignored. (Dor Daim do not claim that Kabbalists are in fact polytheists: only that they are inconsistent.)

4. A fourth criticism is that it is a stultification of Jewish law to regard any authority, even one as eminent as Maimonides, as final.  The essence of Oral Law is that it is case law rather than code law, and needs to be interpreted in each generation: otherwise the Mishneh Torah could simply have been handed down as part of the written Torah.  For this reason, it is a principle of Jewish law that "Jephthah in his generation is as Samuel in his generation": one is bound by the current authorities, rather than by previous authorities however objectively superior.

The Dor Dai response to this is that the acceptance of Maimonides in the Yemenite community has always been regarded as a legitimate version of Jewish law, and that they are no more stultified by the authority of Maimonides than other Jewish communities are by the authority of the Shulchan Aruch. From the practical point of view Jewish law as codified by Maimonides is as compatible with modern conditions as any later code: if anything more so, as later Jewish law has become enmeshed in many unnecessary intellectual tangles.  If there are practical problems caused by this "static" view of Jewish law, that is part of the price of exile: the question is not whether a given reform would be desirable, but whether there is constitutional authority to make it, and in their view there is not.

5. A final criticism is that the Dor Dai version of Judaism is disquietingly reminiscent of militant Islamic trends such as [[Salafism]].  Both started out as modernising movements designed to remove some of the cobwebs and allow the religion to compete in the modern world, and both have ended up as fundamentalist groups lending themselves to alliances with political extremism. Both disapprove of mysticism (Kabbalah or [[Sufism]]) and praying at tombs; both tend to dismiss more moderate coreligionists as unbelievers (see [[Takfir]]); both cut out centuries of sophisticated legal scholarship in favour of an every-man-for-himself "back to the sources" approach.

The Dor Daim answer to this is:
#Political militancy is no more characteristic of Dor Daim than of many Kabbalistically-inspired branches of [[Religious Zionism]] (e.g. the followers of [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]).  In fact the conditions for political or military action, as laid down in the [[Mishneh Torah]], are extremely strict and limited.
#Neither Dor Daim nor ''talmide ha-Rambam'' are against mysticism per se: see [[#Attitude to Kabbalah|Attitude to Kabbalah]] above. The attitude to Kabbalah is based on much more specific factors: if there is an analogue to their opposition among other religions, it is essentially an opposition to the espousal of concepts such as [[incarnation]], [[pantheism]], and [[panentheism]] - apart from the opposition to [[idolatry]] in general, as understood in the context of the [[Mishneh Torah]].
#The antagonism shared by Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'' against praying at tombs etc. is distinct from the Salafi view in a number of ways.  First, in contrast to the Salafi view, the Dor Dai / ''talmide ha-Rambam'' view is that this prohibition is Rabbinic, meaning that it is not a direct command from the Almighty, but rather it is a "fence" to distance a Jew from the possibility of transgressing a more severe prohibition.  They do not consider praying at or visiting a tomb to be idolatry, nor do they believe that this is prohibited to all people (i.e. non-Israelites), whereas the Salafi view is that this is forbidden to everyone as a very severe prohibition in itself.
#It is wrong to accuse Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'' of being extremists, or of dismissing more moderate coreligionists as unbelievers: see reply to 2 above.  On the contrary, they often find more in common theologically with sectors of [[Modern Orthodoxy]] than they do with much of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Ḥasidic]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Ḥaredi]] communities.
#The method of learning and religious observance aimed at by them is firmly rooted in Jewish rabbinic authority (see [[#Jewish law|Jewish law]] above), and is about as far from  an "every-man-for-himself" approach as it is possible to get.  How far a similar accusation may be true of [[Salafism]] (which is itself an umbrella description for a great many trends) is an independent question, on which Dor Daim are not required to express a view.
#Salafis typically reject [[Islamic philosophy]] of the kind propounded by [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]]. Dor Daim, by contrast, find strong inspiration in the closely related [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|Jewish philosophies]] of [[Bahya ibn Pakuda]] and [[Maimonides]].
#Many Dor Daim and ''talmide ha-Rambam'' desire that the Jewish people as a nation will return to upholding the Almighty's Torah with the establishment of a central religious authority - a Great Court ([[Sanhedrin]]) reestablished according to Jewish law as only fully codified in the [[Mishneh Torah]].  That is one form of the Messianic aspiration implicit in any form of Orthodox Judaism.  It cannot be compared to the desire of some Islamists to reestablish a [[Khilafah]] by violent means if necessary.

'''''Espiritismo''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Spiritism") is a term used in Latin America and the Caribbean to refer to the [[folk religions|popular belief]] that [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] [[spirit]]s can affect health, luck and other aspects of human life.&lt;ref name = "KUMC"&gt;[http://wichita.kumc.edu/fcm/interp/h_manage_health.html Helping Elderly Hispanics Manage Health Problems], The University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Espiritismo and Spiritualism==

Espiritismo shares many of its fundamental concepts with 19th century [[Spiritualism]] as was practiced in the United States and Europe.  During this period, several books on [[Medium (spirituality)|mediumship]] and spiritual practices became available in the Caribbean and Latin America.  As many [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s and people of African descent had long standing traditions of [[ancestor worship]] and [[Altered state of consciousness|trance possession]], Spiritualism was readily absorbed into and adapted to these pre-existing [[belief system]]s.&lt;ref name = "NewOrleansMistic"&gt;[http://www.neworleansmistic.com/spells/primer/espiritismo.htm Espiritismo &amp; Spiritualism].[http://www.cinemanafloresta.com.br/ Espiritismo &amp; Espírita]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ''[[Portuguese language|espíritas]]'' or ''[[Spanish language|espiritistas]]'' (Espiritismo practitioners) communicate with spirits in a gathering of like-minded believers known as a ''misa'' (mass, in Spanish). Most practitioners will have an altar called a ''mesa'' (table, in Portuguese) ou ''mesas brancas'' (white table, in Portuguese). These sessions are somewhat akin to the [[séance]]s of American-style Spiritualism of the 19th to the present.  Many Espiritistas' practices, however, have elements of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic ritual]] which are not traditionally found in mainstream Spiritualist denomimations,&lt;ref name = "NewOrleansMistic" /&gt; but are often found in Spiritualist denominations associated with the [[spiritual church movement]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A tenet of Espiritismo is a belief in a supreme [[God]] who is the omnipotent creator of the [[universe]].  There is also a belief in a [[Spirit|spirit world]] inhabited by [[Wiktionary:discarnate|discarnate]] entities that can gradually evolve [[intellect]]ually and [[morality|morally]]. Espiritistas believe these beings can influence the [[Wiktionary:corporeal|corporeal]] world in various ways and that the espiritistas, in turn, can also influence the actions of the spirits.&lt;ref name = "NewOrleansMistic" /&gt;

Espiritismo has never had a single leader nor center of practice, and as such its practice varies greatly between individuals and groups.  In all cases, Espiritismo has absorbed various practices from other religious and spiritual practices endemic to Latin America and the Caribbean, such as [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Curanderismo]], Afro-Brazilian [[Macumba]], [[Santería]], [[West African Vodun|Vodou]], [[Shinto]], and [[Neo-Pagan]] cults like [[Antinous]].

An example of this [[syncretism]] is a magical spell that involves asking Saint [[Martha]] to exert one's will over that of another person by burning a specially prepared candle, saying certain [[prayer]]s, and wearing an [[amulet]] tied with a red ribbon around one's waist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitemagic.ca/spell/Martha-Dominadora-Lamp.html Martha Dominadora Lamp].&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the goals and methods of the Espiritista are less obviously in the realm of magic and might be considered a form of [[folk medicine]] or [[alternative medicine]].  Whatever the desired effect, the equipment and materials used for Espiritismo may often be purchased at a [[botánica]] within the practitioners' community.&lt;ref name="Uic"&gt;[http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/agomez/Botanica/actual%20article.pdf "The Botánica as a Culturally Appropriate Health Care Option for Latinos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316231456/http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/agomez/Botanica/actual%20article.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }} by Alfredo Gomez-Beloz Ph.D., M.P.H.,1 and Noel Chavez Ph.D., R.D., L.D.2, ''The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' Vol. 7, No. 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Espiritismo differs from the Spiritism as the first consist of the syncretic religious practices described above while the second is the established religion-doutrine itself, directly based coding Allan Kardec's and other mediums' books, such as those from Francisco Xavier and Divaldo Franco.

== In Cuba ==

During [[Cuba]]'s first war of independence (1868–1878), certain Cubans began to prefer the Espiritismo to the conservative style of Catholicism. Those who suffered the greatest in the war, particularly those living in the east, abandoned their belief system and turned to Espiritismo.   {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} As a result, Cuban Catholicism was criticized and discarded by ma Cubans.  The straightforward rituals and the possibility of a connection with the spirits of the deceased appealed to many Cubans during this period of hardships and social discontent. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

== Scientific/Table Espiritismo ==

This form of Espiritismo was largely contained to the urban areas of Cuba.  Its followers would study the writings and concepts of Kardec.&lt;ref name=Olmos179&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 179&lt;/ref&gt; During the rituals, its members are seated around a white linen covered table in an attempt to connect with spirits within a séance.  The spirit usually enters the body of the medium that is present at the table.  At this time, those individuals seated around the table have the ability to ask questions to spirits who have entered the world through the mediums.&lt;ref name=Olmos179/&gt;  Furthermore, the spirit(s) is seen as a source to possible solutions to problems that are plaguing people.  In addition, the spirit will manifest itself in a variety of ways dependent on the level of intensity of the spirit.

Those participating in the rituals have certain duties they must fulfill prior to and during the ritual.  They must remain in a mediated position and will most likely use prayers, hymns and music from Kardec's works.&lt;ref name=Olmos179/&gt;  Many times, these rituals involve a small group of people, but private rituals do exist.&lt;ref name=Olmos179/&gt;

== Espiritismo de Cordon ==

The origin of this branch of Espiritismo is derived from its ritual.&lt;ref name=Olmos179/&gt; The ritual associated with Espiritismo de Cordon is physically, mentally and emotionally difficult.  Those participating in the ritual stand in a circle holding hands while walking in a counterclockwise fashion.&lt;ref name=Olmos179/&gt;  At the same time, they are chanting and beating the floor with their feet and swinging their arms forcefully until they fall into a trance.&lt;ref&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 179, 181&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy breathing and stamping serve one specific purpose.&lt;ref name=Olmos182&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 182&lt;/ref&gt; The noises that are made create a hypnotic noise that leads the medium into a trance.  Upon reaching this particular state of mind, the medium can contact the spirits for solutions to problems or aliments.&lt;ref&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 183&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus for this particular branch of Espiritismo is healing.  The ranking of the mediums that are required in the rituals is rather simple.  Their achievements to solve problems and heal people will allow them to have a higher ranking.&lt;ref name=Olmos181&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 181&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no clergy found within Espiritismo de Cordon.  The Head Medium is generally in charge of the ritual space, but does not always participate in the ritual chain itself.&lt;ref name=Olmos181/&gt;  Instead, the Head Medium acts as the guide during the actual ritual.  The altar, which is used in Espiritismo de Cordon, takes up a rather large area.  The space is usually purified to drive out any evil spirits and welcome good spirits.  The entrance is protected by a large bowl of water and all who enter must wash their hands to prevent the spread of evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Olmos182/&gt;  Espiritismo de Cordon is different from other religions in the sense that it does not have a set doctrine of beliefs.  The religion is open to everyone and does not require new participants to partake in an initiation process.&lt;ref name=Olmos181/&gt;

Some have said that Espiritismo de Cordon has three influences on its practices and doctrines: folk Catholicism, Kardecian Spiritism and African creeds, but the most recent investigations have determined that what was thought to be African roots are in fact the remaining of [[Taíno]] religious rituals and dances called "areítos".&lt;ref name="Huellas"&gt;García Molina, José Antonio; Garrido Mazorra, Mercedes; Fariñas Gutierrez, Mercedes. ''Huellas vivas del indocubano'', Ciencias Sociales, La Habana, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Puerto Rico ==

Puerto Rican Espiritismo shares many similarities in its origins to Cuban Espiritismo.  The religious movement encountered many setbacks in its early years in Puerto Rico.  Those who were caught practicing it were punished by the government and ostracized by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Olmos186&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 186&lt;/ref&gt;  Allan Kardec's books made their way into the country and were received well by the educated class.&lt;ref name=Olmos186/&gt; The movement did not despite all the roadblocks, which had been set up to prevent its spread in the country.  There were two divisions within Puerto Rican Espiritismo.  The first division was a middle class movement, which utilized the Kardecian methods in an attempt to enhance the development of the country.&lt;ref name=Olmos186/&gt;  The other division applied towards to lower classes in both the rural and urban settings.  This division is known as "Indigenous Espiritismo" and is synonymous to Puerto Rico and is the most popular in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 186-187&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Rican White Table Espiritismo follows the same ritual practices as found in Cuba.  The attempt to achieve spiritual communication through a medium was widely practiced all over the island.http://www.dictionary.com/browse/spiritual

== Santerismo ==

This religious practice is a result of the merging of both Espiritismo and Santería. There are distinct African influences found within this religion though the orishas that are used to communicate to the spirit world.  During the rituals, the mediums have the ability to communicate with spirits but are possessed by the dead who are messengers of the orishas.&lt;ref name="Olmos194"&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 194&lt;/ref&gt; Who many mistake to be the orishas themself.

In Santerismo, the leader is known as the Godfather (padrino) or Godmother (madrina) as seen in the Santería religious practices.&lt;ref name=Olmos194/&gt;  The leader prays at the [[altar]] before taking his or her place beside the medium at the table.  The leader is present when the possession takes place while religious music or Afro-Cuban chants are played to praise the orishas.&lt;ref name=Olmos194/&gt;  Before to the ceremony, there is a religious cleansing of the area to remove any evil spirits. A prayer is said to Elegua to protect the entranceways from any unwelcome or evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Olmos and Paravisini-Gerbert:{{Which|date=May 2011}} 195&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, prayers are recited to attract good spirits for the ritual.  The ritual may end with an exorcism which can be acquired a number of ways.  One way to achieve purification is through a sahumerio.  A sahumerio requires the burning of charcoal, garlic, incense and herbs to extract evil spirits from the place as well as a washing with holy water.&lt;ref name=Olmos194/&gt;

'''Øystein Aarseth''' ({{IPA-no|ˈœʏstæɪn ˈɔʂət|lang}}; 22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i838.photobucket.com/albums/zz310/chagrynn/Euronymous_passport_1.jpg|title=Euronymous' passport|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his stage name '''Euronymous''', was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[guitarist]]. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and was the only constant member from the band's formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal [[record label]] [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] and record shop Helvete.

Euronymous professed to be a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] and was known for making extreme [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] statements. He presented himself as leading a militant [[cult]]-like group known as the "Black Metal Inner Circle." 

In August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician [[Varg Vikernes]].

==Biography==

===1984–1991===
[[File:Øystein Aarseth (Euronymous).jpg|thumb|Euronymous in 1987]]
Aarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud]] and drummer [[Kjetil Manheim]]. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous,&lt;ref name=diaries39&gt;{{cite book |title=Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries |last=Kristiansen |first=Jon |year=2011 |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |location= |isbn= |page=39 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the demon [[Eurynomos]] which had inspired the [[Hellhammer]] song of the same name.

In summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and [[Metalion|Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen]] visited the German [[thrash metal]] band [[Assassin (band)|Assassin]] and recorded the ''Metalion in the Park'' demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song "Metalion in the Park."&lt;ref name=checkerpatrol&gt;Kristiansen, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] became Mayhem's vocalist and [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg]] became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near [[Kråkstad]], which was used as a place for the band to rehearse.&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot" and "weren't really friends at the end."&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun.&lt;ref name=LoC52&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varg Vikernes]] claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 1991, Dead was found dead by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's death was considered [[suicide]]. Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC49&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath&gt;[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm ''Sounds of Death'' magazine (1998): Hellhammer interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823184150/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:&lt;blockquote&gt;Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, "Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a [[stew]] with bits of Dead's brain and had made [[necklace]]s with bits of his skull.&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite video|people=Michael Dome (director) |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |url=http://www.rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183138/http://rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |people=Sam Dunn (director) |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like [[Faust (musician)|Bård "Faust" Eithun]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and Metalion.&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Necrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |people=Martin Ledang (director), Pål Aasdal (director) |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; He claimed that Euronymous "went into a fantasy world."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Faust of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] believes that Dead's suicide "marked the point at which, under Euronymous' direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous "tried to be as extreme as he had talked about."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. [[Stian Johannsen|Stian "Occultus" Johannsen]] was recruited as Mayhem's new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===1991–1993===
[[File:Helvete Oslo - black metal graffiti.jpg|thumb|The basement of Euronymous' former record shop, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]
During May–June 1991,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous opened a record shop named ''Helvete''&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview&gt;{{cite web |title=Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth |date=June 1992 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |accessdate=10 October 2009 |quote=''Well, the original idea was to make a specialist shop for metal in general, but that's a long time ago. Normal metal isn't very popular any more, all the children are listening to 'death' metal now. I'd rather be selling Judas Priest than Napalm Death, but at least now we can be specialized within 'death' metal and make a shop where all the trend people know that they will find all the trend music. This will help us earning money so that we can order more EVIL records to the evil people. But no matter how shitty music we have to sell, we'll make a BLACK METAL look on the shop, we've had a couple of 'actions' in churches lately, and the shop is going to look like a black church in the future. We've also thought about having total darkness inside, so that people would have to carry torches to be able to see the records.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909160330/http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "[[hell]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=helvete&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j|title=Norwegian dictionary entry for "Helvete"|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Schweigaards gate 56 in [[Oslo]]. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop's basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], Varg "Count Grishnackh" Vikernes of [[Burzum]], and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]]. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands [[Merciless]] and [[Abruptum]]. Euronymous, Varg,&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emperor guitarist [[Samoth|Tomas 'Samoth' Haugen]]&lt;ref name=hist2&gt;{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc |year=2003 |location=New York, New York |isbn= |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and [[picture disc]]s, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

According to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented "was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well." Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene."&lt;ref name=LoC39&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Within just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, [[Thou Shalt Suffer]] turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, [[Old Funeral]]'s guitar player [[Varg Vikernes | Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes]] had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second printing. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013. p.156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that "if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted" by the Helvete scene.&lt;ref name=loc65/&gt; Euronymous "took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lifedeathprizes.com/real-life-crime/oystein-aarseth-murdered-by-varg-vikernes-64542|title=What drove this black-metal star to stab his bandmate 23 times?|date=2017-09-02|work=Life Death Prizes|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: "It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

[[File:Holmenkollen kapell 0003.jpg|thumb|left|Euronymous took part in the [[Holmenkollen Chapel#Fire and reconstruction|burning of Holmenkollen Chapel]] (pictured)]]
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]] in [[Bergen]] was destroyed by [[arson]]. Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted.&lt;ref name=LoC78&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene.&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview/&gt;&lt;ref name=grude&gt;{{cite video |people=Grude, Torstein (director) |year=1998 |title=Satan rir Media |medium=motion picture |location=Norway |publisher=Grude, Torstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous was present at the burning of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] together with Vikernes and Faust,&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he "felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. Euronymous' death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it's not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God's house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.&lt;ref name=radioint&gt;Interview with Euronymous of Mayhem on a Swedish radio show, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Murder of Magne Andreassen|killed a man in Lillehammer]].&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete.&lt;ref name=countregret&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml "Count" Regrets Nothing]. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; That month, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of "Satanic terrorists." Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he was caught the organization would fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp.99-101&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of ''Lords of Chaos'' claim that Euronymous' parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.&lt;ref name=LoC120&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene as a whole.&lt;ref name=LoC117&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;

It has been speculated{{by whom|date=February 2017}} that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "outdoing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130209232033/http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|deadurl=yes|title=Mayhem Biography - Yahoo! Music|date=9 February 2013|archivedate=9 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up, and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]]. Vikernes explains: "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous "panicked" and kicked him in the chest.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and other members of the scene.

According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, "I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a "defense […] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt;

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.&lt;ref name=LoC120/&gt; Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1994,&lt;ref name=countregret/&gt; Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".&lt;ref name=LoC141&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.&lt;ref name=LoC141/&gt;

At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' album.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.

A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous&lt;ref name=nordicmetal&gt;Various Artists: ''Nordic Metal - A Tribute to Euronymous''. [[Necropolis Records]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't doubt this, but we should use a better source.--&gt; and turning his back on [[Satanism]] in favor of nationalism and [[Odinism]],&lt;ref name=loc139&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers "have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death."&lt;ref name=loc138&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after the murder, [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said, "There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop."&lt;ref name=loc65&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a "cult developed around the memory of Euronymous," and he was hailed by some as "the King"&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; or "Godfather of Black Metal."&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; 

A new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy.&lt;ref name="loc138" /&gt; However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates "speak of the killing with a tone of indifference." ''Lords of Chaos'' remarks: "what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Hellhammer,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Ihsahn&lt;ref name="LoC120" /&gt; and Samoth&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. [[Anders Odden]] (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: "It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences." He added: "I think many people felt relief once he was gone." Writer and musician [[Erlend Erichsen]] agreed, saying, "Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone."&lt;ref name="onceuponatime" /&gt;

==Beliefs and personality==
The book ''Lords of Chaos'' says of Euronymous:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against [[individualism]], compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; In a 1992 interview, he said "The [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he told ''Kill Yourself'' zine, "There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted" and claimed "I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985&lt;ref name=diaries39/&gt; and considered him his best friend)&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; said Euronymous "was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme".&lt;ref name="LoC39"/&gt; Euronymous' shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.&lt;ref name="cult155"&gt;''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult'', p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some who knew Euronymous claim that "the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that — a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"/&gt; They include [[Necrobutcher]],&lt;ref name="cult155"/&gt; [[Kjetil Manheim]],&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;&lt;!--the documentary makes clear that Manheim remained friends with Euronymous long after leaving the band--&gt; Vikernes&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; and Blackthorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Faust said that with Euronymous, "there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: "I think that was very much to create fear among people."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the scene "wanted to be in opposition to society" and "tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 218f.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous' friend from 1983 until his death) described him as "health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy," but said that when his older friends weren't around, "he could play out his role." Manheim claimed that Euronymous became "extreme" towards the end of his life: "He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' … I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a [[megalomaniac]]."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In the documentary ''Pure Fucking Mayhem'', he said "Øystein's daily life was a total theater" that was based on the black metal "[[archetype]]" of Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===Religion===
In interviews, Euronymous said he was a [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanist]].&lt;ref name=religious&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: {{cite web |url=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |title=''Northern Black Metal Legends'' |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smnnews.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=32213|title=Rare Euronymous interview - SMNnews Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the SLAVES of religion.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of [[Roman Catholic]] dogma&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt;, and he claimed "We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian."&lt;ref name=beat&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ Interview with Euronymous from ''Beat'', Issue 2 (1993)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125005627/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ |date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[relationship between religion and science]], he said: "Scientists can't disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain the universe. You can't leave out a religious belief."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

He opposed the Satanic and [[occultism|occultist]] teachings of [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Aleister Crowley]], for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as "peace" and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to [[dogma]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt; He said he would "never accept any band which preaches [[Church of Satan]] ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving [[Atheism|atheists]], and they stand exactly the opposite of me."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When asked what he thought of Crowley's code of "[[Thelema|do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law]]", he answered, "People shall do what WE want them to do. We're against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

As noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his "extreme Satanic image" was an act. While [[Mortiis]] said that Euronymous "was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it,"&lt;ref&gt;Ian Christe: ''Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal''. New York, NY: HarperCollins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in the black metal documentary ''Until the Light Takes Us'', Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: "To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn't want to ''be'' extreme and he wasn't ''really'' extreme."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists," he made no such statements about Euronymous.{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=261f}} Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that "back then, in 1991, things&lt;!--Do we know what 'things' he's talking about here?--&gt; mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93".&lt;ref&gt;''MLO''. ''Misantropiska Lucifer Orden''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow [[Paganism]]. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—"obsessed with this 'Satanist' thing"—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 "Updated: Burzum Leader Fails to Return After Short Leave from Prison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201200958/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 |date=1 December 2008 }}. ''[[Blabbermouth.net]]''. [[Roadrunner Records]]. 26 October 2003. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]]'s first album, ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'', on Deathlike Silence Productions.

===Black metal and death metal===
Euronymous said that the term "black metal" can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is "Satanic" and "heavy".&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He said, "If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it's black metal,"&lt;ref name=orcustus&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ Interview with Euronymous by Faust in ''Orcustus'' zine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717031130/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ |date=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What's important is that it's Satanic; that's what makes it black metal."&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He rejected bands like [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] being called black metal, "as they are not Satanists," but supported the band nonetheless.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; As noted earlier, bands who had [[LaVeyan Satanism|LaVeyan beliefs]] were also rejected.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When it was pointed out that [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (the band that coined the term "black metal") only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle "choose to believe otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Euronymous said that the term [[death metal]] can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band "cultivates and worships death."&lt;ref name=orcustus/&gt; Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said "Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to," and "Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it's not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school".&lt;ref name=slayer8&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ Interview with Euronymous and Dead in ''Slayer'', Issue 8 (1991)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716160423/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ |date=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay [[Underground music|underground]]. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from [[hardcore punk]], and said, "Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves." He added: "I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being. […] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us".&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;

===Politics===
Euronymous was interested in [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[communist state]]s such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Soviet Union under Stalin]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref name=communism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrealdocuments.blogspot.com/2008/04/euronymous-as-kafka.html|title=Documents: Euronymous as Kafka|first=|last=Valter|date=29 April 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected [[Eastern Bloc]] memorabilia&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt;, and in the '80s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group [[Red Youth (Norway)|Rød Ungdom]], which was [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coogan: [http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/files/how+black+is+black+metal1/ ''How Black Is Black Metal'']. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC74&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were "just a bunch of humanists."&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt; He said "as I HATE people I don't want them to have a good time, I'd like to see them rot under communist [[dictatorship]]."&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; He had a fascination with the idea of [[mass surveillance]], [[secret police]] and [[forced disappearance]].&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; Mayhem's [[Attila Csihar]] said Euronymous was not a communist "in the political sense" but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/687 Interview with Mayhem]. Lords of Metal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter written in the early '90s, Euronymous claimed that "almost all" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were "more or less Nazis," including Mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/01/05/editorial-regarding-euronymous-claim-that-almost-all-norwegian-bands-are-more-or-less-nazis/ Editorial: Regarding Euronymous’ Claim that “Almost ALL Norwegian Bands are More or Less Nazis”]. [[MetalSucks]]. 5 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.&lt;ref name=communism/&gt;

==Instruments==
Euronymous played a Standard sunburst [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar, which can be seen in many pictures of him playing. He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem's main influences were [[Venom (band)|Venom]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Hellhammer]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], whilst he also liked [[Iron Maiden]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead tube amp and used an Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal, as well as an Arion Metal Master distortion pedal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Legacy==
Euronymous was ranked No. 51 out of ''The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time'' by ''[[Guitar World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |title=Guitar World's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time |date=23 January 2004 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |accessdate=11 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902145402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, low-cost carrier [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft's tail fin. Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign after his family's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20120402/black-metal-stars-family-says-no-to-norwegian-tailfin-honour|title=Black metal star's family says no to Norwegian tailfin honour|date=2 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/bummer-alert/mayhems-euronymous-wont-be-the-face-of-norwegian-air|title=MAYHEM's Euronymous Won't Be The Face Of Norwegian Air|date=5 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fornication''' is generally consensual [[sexual intercourse]] between two people not married to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fornication|url=http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;va=fornication|work=Student Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225430/http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;va=fornication|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionaries on fornication"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fornication|accessdate = 25 November 2013|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|url =http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fornication}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the partners to consensual sexual intercourse is a married person, it may be described as [[adultery]].

For many people, the term carries an overtone of moral or religious disapproval, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with a more [[Value judgment|judgment]]-neutral term like ''[[extramarital sex]]''.

== Etymology and usage ==
In the original [[Greek language|Greek]] version of the New Testament, the Greek term ''porneia'' (πορνεία) (or its variants) is used 25 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4202.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4202. πορνεία (porneia) – 25 Occurrences|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712030625/http://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4202.htm|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porneia'' meant prostitution, a usage still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=30 April 2017|title=Πορνεία|url=https://el.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%CE%A0%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1&amp;oldid=6378124|journal=Βικιπαίδεια|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 4th century, the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate]], a Latin translation of the Greek texts, translated the term as fornicati, fornicatus, fornicata, and fornicatae. The 1611 [[King James Version]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Matthew 5:32]] for usage of the word in English Bibles.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term fornication. Other translations have used terms such as ''whoredom'', ''[[sexual immorality]]'' (e.g., {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:9|ESV}}) or simply ''immorality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/591-the-english-standard-version |title=The English Standard Version |publisher=Christian Courier |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204075220/https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/591-the-english-standard-version |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/porneia.html |title=The Greek Lexicon |publisher=BibleStudyTools.com |accessdate=4 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223716/http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/porneia.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Latin, the term ''fornix'' means arch or [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]. [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|In Ancient Rome, prostitutes]] waited for their customers out of the rain under vaulted ceilings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Gorman|first=James F.|title=ABC of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzc6vh680FMC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=15 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=U of Pennsylvania P|isbn=978-0-8122-1631-8|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fornix'' became a euphemism for brothels, and the Latin verb ''fornicare'' referred to a man visiting a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Rome in So Many Words|author=Christopher Francese|page=146|publisher=Hippocrene Books|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl5T47CvuDsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC|title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories|year=1991|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornix, n. |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use in English is in the ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'', c. 1300; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) records a figurative use as well: "The forsaking of God for idols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornication, n.1 |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fornicated'' as an adjective is still used in botany, meaning "arched" or "bending over" (as in a leaf). [[John Milton]] plays on the double meaning of the word in ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]'' (1642): "[She] gives up her body to a mercenary whordome under those ''fornicated [ar]ches'' which she cals Gods house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornicated, adj. |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalities ===
The [[Pauline epistles]] contain multiple condemnations of various forms of extramarital sex. The [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] states "Flee from sexual immorality" and lists adulterers and "those who are sexually immoral"/practicing-fornicators in a list of "wrongdoers who... will not inherit the kingdom of God". {{Bibleref2c|1Cor|6:9|NIV|1 Corinthians 6:9}}{{Bibleref2c|1Co|6:18|NIV|1 Cor 6:18}} First Corinthians and the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] also address ''fornication''.{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|5:19}}{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|7:2|NIV|1 Corinthians 7:2}} The ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] also includes a prohibition of ''fornication''.

Throughout history, most theologians have argued that any and all forms of premarital sex are immoral. An historical example is the medieval English monastic, [[John Baconthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Premarital Sex: the Theological Argument from Peter Lombard to Durand |author=John F. Dedek |journal=[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |date=December 1980 |pages=643–667 |url=http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/41/41.4/41.4.1.pdf |doi=10.1177/004056398004100401 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204221155/http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/41/41.4/41.4.1.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more contemporary example is the modern-day theologian Lee Gatiss who argues that premarital sex is immoral based on scripture. He states that, from a Biblical perspective, "physical union should not take place outside a "one flesh" (i.e. marriage) union... In [1 Corinthians] chapter 7 Paul addresses the situation of two unmarried Christians who are burning with passion (7:8–9) who should either exercise self-control or be permitted to marry (cf. verses 36–38). The underlying assumptions are the same as those in Deuteronomy 22."&lt;ref name="theologian.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Issue of Pre-Marital Sex |author=Lee Gatiss |publisher=The Theologian |year=2005 |url=http://www.theologian.org.uk/pastoralia/premartialsex.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324021344/http://www.theologian.org.uk/pastoralia/premartialsex.html |archivedate=24 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a minority of theologians have argued in more recent times that premarital sex may not be immoral in some limited circumstances. An example is John Witte, who argues that the Bible itself is silent on the issue of consensual, premarital sex between an engaged couple.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IlWH2jHaj1YC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416&amp;dq=calvin+premarital+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=calvin%20premarital%20sex&amp;f=false|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|isbn=978-0-8028-4803-1|author1=Witte|first1=John|year=2005 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Witte claims that the Bible excludes premarital sex from its list of unlawful sexual relations (Leviticus 18) though Leviticus 18 is not the only such list, nor does Leviticus 18 claim to be exhaustive being devoted largely to forms of incest.

Some of the debate arises from the question of which theological approach is being applied. A [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view of sex interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of whether the couple are married or non-married. What makes sex moral or immoral is the context of marriage. By contrast, a [[Teleology|teleological]] view interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of the quality of the relationship (how well it reflects God's glory and Christian notions of a committed, virtuous relationship.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.campbell.edu/faculty/vandergriffk/ethics_sexuality.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150311120239/http://web.campbell.edu/faculty/vandergriffk/ethics_sexuality.html |archivedate=11 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also turns on the definition of the two Greek words ''moicheia'' (μοιχεία, adultery) and ''porneia'' ([[:el:πορνεία]], with meaning of prostitution, from which the word pornography is derived). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity, although many scholars hold that the [[Septuagint]] uses "porneia" to refer specifically to male [[temple prostitution]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Elsewhere in First Corinthians, [[incest]], homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations)&lt;ref&gt;''arsenokoitēs'' (masc. noun of fem. 1st declension), literally a man who shares a bed with other men (see [[LSJ]] and [[BDAG]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name.

Paul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions laid out in [[Leviticus]] in the context of achieving holiness. One theory therefore suggests that it is these behaviours, and only these, that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koltun-Fromm|first=Naomi|title=Hermeneutics of Holiness: Syriac- Christian and Rabbinic Notions of Holy Community and Sexuality|url=http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc|accessdate=3 August 2013|format=.doc|date=April 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525215607/http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc|archivedate=25 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most mainstream Christian sources believe that porneia encompasses all forms of premarital sex. For instance, in defining ''porneia''/fornication, Kittel and Friedrich's 1977 ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'' states that "The NT is characterized by an unconditional repudiation of all extra-marital and unnatural intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, G (ed): ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', Volume VI, pages 579–95&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Friberg's ''Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament'' defines ''porneia'' as being "generally, every kind of extramarital, unlawful or unnatural sexual intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Friberg, T: ''Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

Lee Gatiss also argues that ''porneia'' encompasses all forms of premarital sex. He states that "the word 'fornication' has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for porneia, which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage ... This has been contested ... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. "Flee sexual immorality (porneia) and pursue self-control" (cf. 1 Thess 4:1–8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world."&lt;ref name="theologian.org.uk" /&gt;

=== Jesus and the early Church ===
Attitudes towards marriage and sexuality at the time of Jesus stemmed from a blend of Roman and Jewish ideas. For instance, during the lifetime of Jesus, there was a strong social disapproval among Romans of [[polygamy]]. This made its way into Judaism and early Christianity, despite the Old Testament portraying examples of this behaviour among patriarchs and kings.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Church in Wales and Same-Sex Partnerships |date=March 2014 |publisher=The Standing Doctrinal Commission of the Church in Wales |url=http://cinw.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SameSexPartnership_DocComm-English.doc |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080935/http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SameSexPartnership_DocComm-English.doc |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish marriage in the time of Jesus was a two-stage process. First, there was a betrothal in which the man claimed the woman to be his only bride. Secondly, there was the marriage contract that specified what the bride and groom's families would give the couple and what the bride would obtain if she divorced. "At the time of Jesus, and in rural areas like Galilee, a young couple might well cohabit before the contract was signed 'in order to get acquainted'. The betrothal was held to be enough of a marriage that a divorce would be needed if the couple split up between betrothal and contract."&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;


The early Church's statements on marital affairs mainly concerned acceptable reasons for divorce and remarriage. Whilst Paul, in his epistles to early believers, emphasised that both celibacy and marriage were good forms of life, after his life the Church felt that celibacy was more virtuous and liberating. This focus came about because the early church was very ascetic, possibly due to the influence of Greek philosophical thought. The focus on celibacy meant that other issues relating to sexual morality for the non-celibate remained under-developed.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]]'s views strongly influenced how later Christians thought about sex. Before becoming a Christian, he had taken a concubine in defiance of his (Christian) mother's anxious warning to him "not to commit fornication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/7/1/2.html|title=The Second Book.

Hence, pure love was perverted by its misdirection toward lust whereas a Godly relationship should focus on a loving, rational partnership instead.&lt;ref name="sparknotes.com"/&gt;

In his later writings, Augustine was "deeply suspicious of sexual passion" and this has influenced the outlook of all the major Christian denominations down to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Church told to rethink bar on sex before marriage |author=[[Ruth Gledhill]] |date=31 March 2003 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1908115.ece}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine considered fornication to have two definitions: the first was "cleaving to a prostitute" and the second, broader and more precise one was "what men who do not have wives do with women who do not have husbands".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=augustine%20fornication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j7vsL4YEfB&amp;sig=OaiBx9wwHZbO3niy6msNsnwNpt8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8tqqzyKvPAhVBQJQKHWasDeQQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20fornication&amp;f=false|title=Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia|first1=Allan|last1=Fitzgerald|first2=John C.|last2=Cavadini|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Wm.

==== Lutheranism ====
According to Susan C. Karant-Nunn and Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks in their book, ''Luther on Women'', [[Martin Luther]] felt that "The sex act was of course sinful outside of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Luther on Women|url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=BE8yAl6K0tQC&amp;dq=luther+and+women&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RHyuSr4gh7ow48rZ8g0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=sex&amp;f=false|author=Susan C.

{{cquote|In naming uncleanness in addition to fornication, the reference is to all sensual affections in distinction from wedded love. They are too unsavory for him [Paul] to mention by name, though in Romans 1, 24 he finds it expedient to speak of them without disguise.

Originally published in 1909 in English by Lutherans in All Lands Press (Minneapolis, MN), as ''The Precious and Sacred Writings of Martin Luther'', vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On another occasion, Luther wrote, "I... pass over the good or evil which experience offers, and confine myself to such good as Scripture and truth ascribe to marriage. It is no slight boon that in wedlock fornication and unchastity are checked and eliminated. This in itself is so great a good that it alone should be enough to induce men to marry forthwith, and for many reasons... The first reason is that fornication destroys not only the soul but also body, property, honor, and family as well. For we see how a licentious and wicked life not only brings great disgrace but is also a spendthrift life, more costly than wedlock, and that illicit partners necessarily occasion greater suffering for one another than do married folk. Beyond that it consumes the body, corrupts flesh and blood, nature, and physical constitution. Through such a variety of evil consequences God takes a rigid position, as though he would actually drive people away from fornication and into marriage. However, few are thereby convinced or converted."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works volume 45:43&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring this matter in more depth when writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5, Luther advises, "All young people should avoid casual sex and preserve their purity. They should resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word... If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying! If you feel that you can't stand it any longer, pray that God will give you a devout spouse with whom you can live in harmony and true love... I have known many people who, because of their crude and shameful fantasies, indulged their passion with unrestrained lust. Because of their insatiable desires, they abandoned self control, and lapsed into terrible immorality. In the end, they had to endure dreadful punishment. Blinded to the realities of married life, some of them took unsuitable mates and ended up in incompatible relationships. They got what they deserved. You must pray diligently and strive to resist the desires of your corrupt nature. Ask God to give you a Rebekah or Isaac instead of a Delilah or Samson-or someone even worse. Finding a devoted, loyal wife or husband isn’t a matter of good luck. It’s not the result of good judgment, as unbelievers think. Rather, a devout spouse is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wpwHNEQ-O44C&amp;pg=PT106&amp;lpg=PT106&amp;dq=luther%20crude%20and%20shameful%20fantasies%20indulged&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1lY96K6n5b&amp;sig=KIUYVFdTyq-xiqLJ3JmWYanMbqY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7xsXBis3PAhXENpQKHaz-CTEQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=luther%20crude%20and%20shameful%20fantasies%20indulged&amp;f=false|title=Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional|first=Martin|last=Luther|date=26 May 2009|publisher=Zondervan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther however, in contrast to his Roman Catholic opponents, believed that it was not the Church's business to define marriage law. He understood marriage to be a legal agreement rather than a sacrament.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt; He stated that marriage was instituted by God but its regulation was the business of the State, not the Church. Luther defined marriage as "the God-appointed and legitimate union of man and woman in the hope of having children or at least for the purpose of avoiding fornication and sin and living to the glory of God. The ultimate purpose is to obey God, to find aid and counsel against sin; to call upon God; to seek, love, and educate children for the glory of God; to live with one's wife in the fear of God and to bear the cross..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luther, Marriage, Church &amp; State |author=Rev.

[[Martin Bucer]] argued that sexual intimacy belonged in marriage and that, in marriage, the man becomes "the head and saviour of the wife and forms one flesh with her in order to avoid fornication and that the wife is the body and help of her husband, again to avoid fornication". Marriage for him, though, not only meant the avoidance of sin and procreation of children but social and emotional bonding resulting in a fellowship.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marriage and Divorce in the Thought of Martin Bucer |author=H.

Marriage... [is] the context in which sexual intimacy should have its place... Marriage is, after all, the only framework within which sexual desires can be legitimately satisfied."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au" /&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]], who was raised as a [[Pietist]], considered sex before marriage to be immoral. He argued that sexual desire objectifies the person you crave and, since no [[categorical imperative|logically consistent ethical rule]] allows you to use a person as an object, it is immoral to have sex (outside marriage). Marriage makes the difference because, in marriage, the two people give all of themselves to create a union and, thus, now have rights over each other as each now belongs to the other. As Kant himself puts it, "The sole condition on which we are free to make use of our sexual desires depends upon the right to dispose over the person as a whole – over the welfare and happiness and generally over all the circumstances of that person… each of them...

Today, the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]] asserts that premarital sex is sinful. It believes that sexual activity belongs within the marriage relationship only and that the practice of pre-marital sex is in "violation of the will of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attitude to Birth Control|url=https://lca.box.net/shared/static/ltyczvrxb3ovdrsk2p8s.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2013|pages=1–2|format=PDF|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, pastors of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod undertook a survey on premarital sex among their congregations in 2010. "These Lutheran pastors reported that over 57 percent of the couples they now marry are living together prior to the wedding, and that the rate of cohabitation in their congregations is increasing." Despite this trend, the Synod believes that "Regardless of the reasons given for living together, cohabitation is simply wrong for Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergmann|first=Rev.

The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) takes the view that "Any use of the gift of sex aside from the marriage bond is adultery, whether this is premarital or extramarital ... To engage in premarital or extramarital sex, before or outside of marriage, is to sin in God's sight. That is precisely the point of Hebrews 13:4, a verse often referred to in this kind of discussion. "Marriage" and the marriage bed ... go together and are to be kept pure. Using the "bed" aside from "marriage" is sin that God will judge... The counsel given in 1 Corinthians 7:9 makes the same point. If a person has sexual urges and the sex drive (a good gift from God in itself) expresses itself within a person, that person has a God-pleasing remedy identified: to be married and thus obtain the right to be sexually active. Before or outside of marriage, sinful lust is sinful lust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wels.net/faq/bible-and-premarital-sex/|title=Bible and Premarital sex|author=|date=|work=wels.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020213657/http://wels.net/faq/bible-and-premarital-sex/|archivedate=20 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere on its official site, WELS states that "Even though our unbelieving society embraces living together outside marriage as an acceptable lifestyle, it is still a sinful arrangement. A pastor or congregation will deal patiently with cohabitating people who are seeking spiritual guidance... [and a]... Christian life of sanctification. This is done by firmly yet gently confronting them with their sin... and then guiding them to change their behavior to show their love for Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wels.net/faq/living-together-versus-marriage/|title=Living together versus marriage|author=|date=|work=wels.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020212149/http://wels.net/faq/living-together-versus-marriage/|archivedate=20 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) delivered a detailed document, entitled ''A Social Statement on Human Sexuality'', in 2009. With regard to sex before marriage, the document, declares that "Because this church urges couples to seek the highest social and legal support for their relationships, it does not favor cohabitation arrangements outside marriage. It has a special concern when such arrangements are entered into as an end in themselves. It does, however, acknowledge the social forces at work that encourage such practices. This church also recognizes the pastoral and familial issues that accompany these contemporary social patterns. In cases where a decision is made for cohabitation, regardless of the reasons, this church expects its pastors and members to be clear with the couple regarding the reasons for the position of this church and to support the couple in recognizing their obligation to be open and candid with each other about their plans, expectations, and levels of mutual commitment. Some cohabitation arrangements can be constructed in ways that are neither casual nor intrinsically unstable... This church believes, however, that the deepest human longings for a sense of personal worth, long-term companionship, and profound security, especially given the human propensity to sin, are best served through binding commitment, legal protections, and the public accountability of marriage, especially where the couple is surrounded by the prayers of the congregational community and the promises of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Social Statement on Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust |date=19 August 2009 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |url=http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/SexualitySS.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127040806/http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/SexualitySS.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]'s stance on the issue is ambiguous.

==== Calvinism ====
Calvinism has traditionally always asserted that engaging in premarital sex is a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helm|first=Paul|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva, Volume 1: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|url=http://www.reformation21.org/shelf-life/sex-marriage-and-family-in-john-calvins-geneva-volume-1-courtship-engagement-and.php|publisher=Reformation21|accessdate=3 August 2013|date=July 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901073828/http://www.reformation21.org/shelf-life/sex-marriage-and-family-in-john-calvins-geneva-volume-1-courtship-engagement-and.php|archivedate=1 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin|Calvin]] himself said little on why he thought engaged couples should not have sex and [[John Witte, Jr.|Witte]] believes his rationale for the prohibition was vague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helm|first=Paul|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva, Volume 1: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlWH2jHaj1YC&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=john+calvin+cohabitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PCD86PPN49&amp;sig=ukCbeDu0Lxc0m-roXFlAh_EC86c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LC0uVPrUH4ad8QWL-oD4CQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20calvin%20cohabitation&amp;f=false|publisher=Reformation21|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did seek to reduce the length of engagements among couples in Geneva to less than six weeks, to reduce the temptation of premarital sex.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; He agreed, though, with Luther that marriage was a legal matter for the state, not a sacramental matter for the church.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

[[John Witte, Jr.]] has written a study on John Calvin and marriage and family life. In it, he notes that, "For Calvin, the Commandment against adultery was equally binding on the unmarried, and equally applicable to both illicit sexual activities per se, and various acts leading to the same. Calvin condemned fornication sternly—sexual intercourse or other illicit acts of sexual touching, seduction, or enticement by non-married parties, including those who were engaged to each other or to others. He decried at length the widespread practice of casual sex, prostitution, concubinage, pre-marital sex, nonmarital cohabitation and other forms of bed hopping that he encountered in modern day Geneva as well as in ancient Bible stories. All these actions openly defied God's commandment against adultery and should be punished by spiritual and criminal sanctions. Calvin preached against fornication constantly... He often led the Consistory in rooting out fornicators and subjecting them to admonition and the ban, and to fines and short imprisonment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Witte Jr. |editor=Herman J.

Raymond A. Mentzer notes that, "Wherever Calvinism took root – Geneva and France, the Low Countries and Rhine Valley, Scotland, England and New England – an element of moral rigor... accompanied it. Churches fashioned in the Calvinist tradition have typically set extremely high standard of behavior and, more particularly, sought to compel a strict morality within the community..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2540632|title=Disciplina nervus ecclesiae: The Calvinist Reform of Morals at Nimes|first=Raymond A.|last=Mentzer|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=18|issue=1|pages=89–116|doi=10.2307/2540632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin, including sexual sin, was not simply considered a private failing; it affected the whole congregation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n_ipwgt-dtMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=calvinism%20fornication&amp;ots=TxWVTvoKNR&amp;sig=0-vqYgRgnw1Op8w0_fGhVQ1DkAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fornication&amp;f=false|title=Sin and the Calvinists: Morals Control and the Consistory in the Reformed Tradition|first=Raymond A.|last=Mentzer|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Truman State Univ Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; E. William Monter asserts that, "The supposedly repressive dimension of Calvinist morality affected women's lives in ways which were often beneficial... Each year the [Genevan] Consistory judged a half-dozen cases of fornication by engaged couples and as many accusations of illicit sex between masters and servants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3173922|title=Women in Calvinist Geneva (1550–1800)|first=E.

The town soon had a Protestant majority but it still faced an enormous task in cleaning up morals as one of the first Protestant-controlled societies in France. According to Mentzer, one third of excommunications in Nîmes between the 1560s and the 1580s were due to improper sexual behaviour. At this time, proper conduct was considered as much a public matter as a private matter. The struggle against worldly dissoluteness, and the enforcement of respect for the family and the pacification of society were setting Nîmes "on the path towards social reform and, by extension, modernity itself."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

As a result of this new moral rigour, there were remarkably low rates of premarital conceptions and illegitimate births among [[Huguenots]] by the seventeenth century in France compared to the rates among their Roman Catholic opponents, from whom the Reformed sought to distinguish themselves by their moral holiness.{{sfn|Manetsch|2013|p=211}} The low illegitimate birth rate indicates that the Calvinists had internalised the values that condemned premarital sex as immoral.&lt;ref name="Benedict1991"&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Benedict|title=The Huguenot Population of France, 1600–1685: The Demographic Fate and Customs of a Religious Minority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=py0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101|date=1 January 1991|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-815-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0sLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA98|year=1966|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=98|chapter=The Huguenot Population of France|issn=0065-9746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting case is that of Pierre Palma Cayet, who scandalously wrote a book in which he provided a scriptural defence of brothels, prostitution and fornication, which led to him being deposed as a Huguenot pastor. Shortly afterwards, in 1595, he re-converted to Roman Catholicism. He was readily accepted back into that church as a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZH9Rkw4Yl8EC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;lpg=PA375&amp;dq=castellion%20fornication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4lfGKi_s_Z&amp;sig=DNxJ3wbuKThyHquuxeVxuSnMXsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd6Zbepc_PAhVEjpQKHQZQDvAQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20fornication&amp;f=false|title=Theodore Beza and the Quest for Peace in France: 1572 – 1598|first=Scott M.|last=Manetsch|date=1 January 2000|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Nicholas Must, "Marriage was, in the equations of Huguenot ministers... a means to avoid promiscuity and lechery. As a result of this, many sermons that dealt with marriage were also an opportunity to announce the dangers of illicit sex while, at the same time, offering a relatively positive appraisal of conjugal sex. For instance, Jean Mestrezat declares simply that marriage is the recommended solution for illicit sexuality, since God hates all impurities, especially paillardise [sexual immorality]... In another sermon, [Pastor Jean] Daillé provides a close hermeneutical reading of paillardise in a sermon on 1 Corinthians 10:8 when he states that it includes "all the species of this sin, that is to say all the faults of this nature, which are committed by any person, whether married or not, simple fornication as well as adultery"."&lt;ref name="macsphere.mcmaster.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13992/1/fulltext.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010125748/https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13992/1/fulltext.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the Huguenot, “simple fornication” is a "grave sin".&lt;ref name="macsphere.mcmaster.ca"/&gt;

Throughout the centuries, French Huguenots have remained strictly opposed to fornication in all circumstances. An example is the famous French Protestant pastor, [[André Trocmé]], (active in the 1940s), who is on record as having been against all premarital and extramarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XY2iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title=A Portrait of Pacifists: Le Chambon, the Holocaust, and the Lives of André and Magda Trocmé|first=Richard P.|last=Unsworth|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Syracuse University Press|accessdate=17 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[United Protestant Church of France|French Calvinists]] maintain very high ethical standards and feel themselves to be different from their French Roman Catholic neighbours, in terms of their attitudes and higher standards of behaviour, including sexual behaviour. Indeed, French Reformed Christians "are widely regarded as having particularly high standards of honesty and integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping the Huguenot tradition alive |author=Mary Dejevsky |date=1 September 1996 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/keeping-the-huguenot-tradition-alive-1361451.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815181255/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/keeping-the-huguenot-tradition-alive-1361451.html |archivedate=15 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even one of France's most liberal Reformed Calvinist churches,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]] in Paris, today still condemns premarital sex, including casual sex and sex with prostitutes in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/sexualite-et-foi.php|title=Sexuality and faith|author=Marc Pernot, pasteur|publisher=[[L'Oratoire du Louvre]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920143847/https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/sexualite-et-foi.php|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/j-ai-du-mal-a-trouver-la-paix-apres-une-aventure-avec-un-homme-qui-ne-m-aimait-pas.php|title=Have I done wrong to find peace after an adventure with a man who doesn't love me?|author=Marc Pernot, pasteur|publisher=[[L'Oratoire du Louvre]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920144451/https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/j-ai-du-mal-a-trouver-la-paix-apres-une-aventure-avec-un-homme-qui-ne-m-aimait-pas.php|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Swiss Huguenot theologian, [[Karl Barth]], discussed sexual morality in his magnum opus, ''[[Church Dogmatics]]''. He stated that "Coitus without coexistence is demonic"&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics"&gt;Barth, K: ''Church Dogmatics''&lt;/ref&gt; ("demonic", in Christianity, simply meaning any sphere that does not submit to God.) Barth goes on to state that "the physical sexuality of man should form an integral part of his total humanity as male or female, and that the completion of the sexual relation should be integrated into the total encounter of man and woman. All right or wrong and therefore salvation or perdition in this matter depends on whether it is viewed in isolation and abstraction or within this whole... If it is not, if physical sexuality and sex relations have their own right and authority in which man and woman and their encounter may be controlled and fulfilled, then it is a demonic business. Naturally, the command of God will always resist any such idea of sovereign physical sexuality."&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics" /&gt; For Barth, to engage in sex outside marriage is not only rebellious but dehumanising as it puts humans on the level of animals, driven by passion and a search for self-gratification.

Furthermore, for Barth, "A wedding is only the regulative confirmation and legitimation of a marriage before and by society. It does not constitute a marriage."&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics" /&gt; Sex within marriage can be sinful as well unless it affirms the coexistence of the couple. This opens the door to a more holistic understanding of sex.

However, a few modern Swiss Reformed theologians, such as Michel Cornuz, take the teleological view that premarital sex is permissible if the sexual activities take a form which respects the partner and helps the relationship grow in intimacy. These theologians hold that it is when a relationship is exploitive that it is sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=2846&amp;Itemid= |title=La sexualité avant le mariage, est-ce un péché?|publisher=Questiondieu.com|language=fr|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1914&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Sexualité, relations avant ou après mariage ... qu'en dit la Bible?|language=fr|date=12 September 2004|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Hence, engaging in sex with prostitutes is always sinful as it is an exploitive relationship and does not allow the participants to grow in dignity.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=4354&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Est-ce que coucher avec une prostituée est un péché?|language=French|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702012915/http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=4354&amp;Itemid=|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change has come about within the last two generations in Switzerland. Prior to that, the cultural norm was that the couple would not engage in sex before marriage. Hence, the modern Reformed theologians have endeavoured to meet the challenge of applying Christian teaching to this massive cultural change in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="questiondieu.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1945&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Est-ce important de rester vierge jusqu'au mariage?|language=fr|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, Cornuz and his colleagues feel that one should always be true to one's individual conscience, so if the person feels sex before marriage is sinful, that person should listen to his or her conscience and abstain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vierge pour le mariage?|url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1302&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|accessdate=3 August 2013|language=fr|date=12 July 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130730044756/http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1302&amp;Itemid=|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key thing is that it is up to the couple themselves to decide if engaging in premarital sex or remaining virgins is the best way for them to reflect the love of God in their relationship.&lt;ref

According to Mentzer, during the first fifty years of the Scottish Reformation, "more than two-thirds of the cases brought before the Consistory involved illicit sex... everything else paled before the apparent obsession of Scots Calvinists with sex".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This contrasted strikingly with the data from Germany, the Netherlands and France. For the parish of Saint Andrews, fornication accounted for 47.4% of all cases heard between 1573 and 1600. 986 were charged with fornication (sexual intercourse between two single persons) and 813 with "fornication antenuptial" (sexual intercourse between two people who were engaged to each other but not yet married).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Between 1595 and 1597, the fornication levels in Saint Andrews plummeted. "The only... explanation for the relative absence of sexual offences, improbably though it may seem, is that a... genuine "reformation of manners" took place in the burgh."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Mentzer and Graham argue that this focus on sex may actually be due to the Kirk's early weakness. "Since there is strong sentiment in Western societies today that governments should stay out of the private lives of citizens, the church courts today seem nosy or even voyeuristic to our modern eyes. But this was no all-powerful Big Brother peering into bedroom windows. Rather the Kirk's obsession with sex was more a sign of its weakness than its strength... The need to discourage illicit sexuality was accepted by nearly all powers... even when they could agree on little else."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Only when ministers and presbyters gradually gained a stronger position were they able to gradually turn their focus to other disciplinary breaches surrounding the Sabbath, superstitious practices, neighborly disputes and so forth.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Scottish Calvinists today remain deeply opposed to any kind of sex outside marriage. In 2008, the Scottish health minister, [[Shona Robison]] noted, "There are deeply-held views on moral issues and cultural and lifestyle issues... The Highlands in general ... have a strong Calvinistic streak, a prudish thing that sees sex as something that happens behind closed doors and drawn curtains. As a consequence of this and because of lack of a scene for gay people, both straight and gay people are being driven out into these isolated areas to have [casual] sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 October 2008 |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/calvinist-attitudes-blamed-for-surge-in-outdoor-sex-1.826614 |title=Calvinist attitudes blamed for surge in outdoor sex |work=Herald Scotland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709013718/http://www.heraldscotland.com/calvinist-attitudes-blamed-for-surge-in-outdoor-sex-1.826614 |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Presbyterian Church, "like other Christian bodies, has viewed marriage as a prerequisite to sexual intercourse and considered sex outside marriage a sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1991-04-22/news/2802948_1_church-of-john-calvin-view-sexual-relations-human-sexuality |title=Presbyterian Sex Report Attacks Church's Attitudes |date=April 1991 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140204160440/http://articles.mcall.com/1991-04-22/news/2802948_1_church-of-john-calvin-view-sexual-relations-human-sexuality |archivedate=4 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent conservative American Calvinist theologian, [[R. C. Sproul]], opposes premarital sex on the grounds that the marriage covenant is an essential legal safeguard, protecting both members of the couple from each other's sinfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=22 September 2014 |url=http://www.ligonier.org/blog/marriage-just-piece-paper/ |title=Is Marriage "Just a Piece of Paper"? |work=Ligonier Ministries |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922120245/http://www.ligonier.org/blog/marriage-just-piece-paper/ |archivedate=22 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Excerpted from {{cite book |author= R.

==== Methodism ====
The American Methodist theologian and pastor, [[Ben Witherington III]], believes that "virginity in a woman was highly valued before marriage [in Biblical cultures]... In early Jewish law if you had sex with a woman you were considered married to her or you had shamed her. See the story of Mary and Joseph. Porneia can refer to all sorts of sexual sin including deflowering a virgin... there was no dating or physical intimacy prior to an arranged marriage in the vast majority of cases. The notion of dating doesn't exist in Jesus and Paul's world. Second, honor and shame cultures placed a high value on sexual purity. Notice how prostitutes were stigmatized. Women were mainly blamed for sexual immorality. Finally Jesus gave his disciples two choices in Mt. 19—fidelity in heterosexual marriage or being a eunuch! This means no sex outside marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Premarital Sex a Sin?

The position of the [[United Methodist Church]] in the United States on the issue is as follows: "Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the marriage bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does The United Methodist Church believe that premarital sex is OK?|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1322|publisher=United Methodist Church|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140811222306/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1322|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uniting Church in Australia]] is still formulating its views on the subject. It recognises the changes in marriage practice and lifestyle that have resonated throughout society and that the UCA is perceived by the public of being more accepting of the realities of humanity than many other denominations.&lt;ref name="Bos 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bos |first=Robert |title=Views of marriage in the UCA: Report on a consultation process (PDF) |url=http://assembly.uca.org.au/marriage/item/download/659_c2660aea3da95ad27c2d0d7af966ccec |accessdate=1 August 2014 |date=2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706051911/http://assembly.uca.org.au/marriage/item/download/659_c2660aea3da95ad27c2d0d7af966ccec |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Heather|title=Sex, Marriage and All That Stuff)|url=http://unitingchurchwa.org.au/blog/2012/02/sex-marriage-and-all-that-stuff/|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811005706/http://unitingchurchwa.org.au/blog/2012/02/sex-marriage-and-all-that-stuff/|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report noted that scripture is not really about marriage as understood in contemporary western societies and, in fact, has very little to say about it. In the report, the church also acknowledged that many unmarried people had sex but neither condemned nor endorsed it, instead noting that there were many different views within the church.&lt;ref name="Bos 2013" /&gt;

[[Stanley Hauerwas]] argues that questions about sex before marriage need to be reframed in terms of the narrative of the church. He asks individuals to consider if it is a pure or licentious lifestyle that will best prepare the Christian to live out and serve in the narrative of the church. Doctor Hauerwas goes on to conclude, "For the issue is not whether X or Y form of sexual activity is right or wrong, as if such activity could be separated from a whole way of life... The issue is not whether someone is chaste in the sense of not engaging in genital activity, but whether we have lived in a manner that allows us to bring a history with us that contributes to the common history we may be called upon to develop with one another. Chastity, we forget, is not a state but a form of the virtue of faithfulness that is necessary for a role in the community... what the young properly demand is an account of life and the initiation into a community that makes intelligible why their interest in sex should be subordinated to other interests. What they, and we, demand is the lure of an adventure that captures the imagination sufficiently that conquest means more than the sexual possession of another. I have tried to suggest that marriage and singleness for Christians should represent just such an adventure, and if it does not, no amount of ethics or rules will be sufficient to correct the situation."&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, S: ''A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Mennonites ===
[[Mennonites]] believe that sex outside marriage is sinful. The Mennonite ''Confession of Faith'' states "According to Scripture, right sexual union takes place only within the marriage relationship. Scripture places sexual intimacy within God's good created order. Sexual union is reserved for the marriage bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Church|first1=published by arrangement with the General Board of the General Conference Mennonite|last2=Board|first2=the Mennonite Church General|title=Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective.|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, Pa.|isbn=0-8361-9043-2|url=http://www.mennolink.org/doc/cof/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003102107/http://www.mennolink.org/doc/cof/|archivedate=3 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quakers ===
[[Quakers]] are essentially non-judgemental about sex and relationships outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/quakers_1.shtml BBC – Religions – Christianity: Quakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306204617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/quakers_1.shtml |date=6 March 2018 }}. 3 July 2009.

=== Anglicanism ===
The official resolutions of the Anglican Church are produced by the bishops in attendance at the Lambeth Conferences, which are held every ten years. The 1988 [[Lambeth Conference]] made this declaration in its ''Resolution on Marriage and Family'': "Noting the gap between traditional Christian teaching on pre-marital sex, and the life-styles being adopted by many people today, both within and outside the Church: (a) calls on provinces and dioceses to adopt a caring and pastoral attitude to such people; (b) reaffirms the traditional biblical teaching that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship; (c) in response to the International Conference of Young Anglicans in Belfast, urges provinces and dioceses to plan with young people programmes to explore issues such as pre-marital sex in the light of traditional Christian values" (Resolution 34).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-34.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference Archives – 1988 – Resolution 34|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308224155/http://lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-34.cfm|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent resolution was made at the 1998 Lambeth Conference. This sitting of the Conference resolved, "In view of the teaching of Scripture, [the Anglican Church] upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage" (Resolution I.10). This Resolution also commended a report on human sexuality entitled ''Called to Full Humanity'' which stated that, "The Holy Scriptures and Christian tradition teach that human sexuality is intended by God to find its rightful and full expression between a man and a woman in the covenant of marriage, established by God in creation, and affirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Holy Matrimony is, by intention and divine purpose, to be a lifelong, monogamous and unconditional commitment between a woman and a man. The Lambeth Conference 1978 and 1998 both affirmed 'marriage to be sacred, instituted by God and blessed by our Lord Jesus Christ'. The New Testament and Christian history identify singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like ways of living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1998/1998-1-10.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference Archives – 1998 – Resolution I.10|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713215909/http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1998/1998-1-10.cfm|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Episcopal Church only approves "of sex between men and women who are married. In 1979, the U.S. church's governing body voted down a resolution to approve other sexual activity."&lt;ref name=articles.latimes.com&gt;{{cite news|title=Episcopal Unit Supports Non-Marital Sex|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-30/news/mn-1666_1_episcopal-church|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 January 1987|agency=Associated Press|location=Newark, New Jersey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130803150215/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-30/news/mn-1666_1_episcopal-church|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the English reformers had taken a stern view of adultery and fornication, which Homily 11 of the First Book of Homilies (1547) defined to include "all unlawfull use of those parts, which bee ordeyned for generation".&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

Prior to the ''[[Marriage Act 1753]]'' (commonly known as the Hardwicke Act), British couples could live together and have sex after their [[betrothal]] or "the spousals". Theologian Adrian Thatcher claims that, before the Act was introduced, in the United Kingdom the betrothal was a formal, preliminary stage of marriage involving vows. During this stage, the marriage would become permanent and indissoluble if sexual intercourse occurred or when final vows were taken, whichever came first. Either of these would render "the conditional promise unconditional".&lt;ref name="pravmir.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_750.html|title=Living Together before Marriage – the Theological and Pastoral Opportunities|author=|date=|work=pravmir.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930031012/http://www.pravmir.com/article_750.html|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, having sex would automatically turn the betrothal into a finalized, indissoluble marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adrianthatcher.org/data/resources/living%20together%20ct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Betrothal vows were given in the future tense, hence sexual intercourse "activated" them, signalling the beginning of the binding marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/hardwickes-marriage-act-1754/|title=Hardwicke's Marriage Act 1754 and Clandestine Marriages|author=|date=4 June 2015|work=intriguing-history.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816055317/http://www.intriguing-history.com/hardwickes-marriage-act-1754/|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Trent in the Roman Catholic Church and the above-mentioned Marriage Act in the United Kingdom eliminated the tradition of the betrothal stage of marriage. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, betrothal still exists but it has been combined into the wedding ceremony, rather than remaining as its own separate stage of the marriage process.

Thatcher notes that, today, "Non-nuptial cohabitation is unlikely ever to be thought consistent with Christian faith if only because God wills only what is best for us, and there [are] good reasons for thinking that these arrangements are not the best for us." He outlines some of the damage he believes is caused by cohabitation outside marriage in his paper, supported by empirical data.&lt;ref name="pravmir.com"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, whilst the State defined who was married, it was the Anglican Church that was given the responsibility to police this law for the State.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt; Today, Britain remains abnormal among European nations in having Church weddings whereas most other nations on that continent insist on civil registrations leaving it up to the couple if they choose to have a religious ceremony as well.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

The 1984 English Anglican booklet ''Forward to Marriage'' showed a tolerance of premarital sex but strongly endorsed marriage as "a necessary commitment for a long-term relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anglican church tolerant on premarital sex issue|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19840114&amp;id=xfxNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6595,1598815|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=14 January 1984|agency=Associated Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the American Bishop John Shelby Spong's Newark Diocese had commissioned a report that concluded that the "Episcopal Church should recognize and bless committed non-marital sexual relationships between homosexuals, young adults, the divorced and widowed..." The report aimed "to ignite a new debate on sexual ethics among leaders of the nation's 3 million Episcopalians in the hope that they will amend church doctrine to embrace all believers... Spong, an advocate of the recommendations... said his views are a minority position in the church."&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Also in 1987, the General Synod of the Church of England asserted "(1) that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship, (2) that fornication and adultery are sins against this ideal, and are to be met by a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Sarmiento |title=What Rowan Williams wrote about homosexuality in 1988 |date=6 August 2011 |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/005115.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714221347/http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/005115.html |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 [[National Church Life Survey]] in Australia found that Australian Anglicans were more liberal about premarital sex than churchgoers from other denominations but more conservative than the general [non-church going] population. The survey noted a divide between Anglicans who wanted to support sexually active unmarried couples in their churches and others who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anglicans in Australia|author=Thomas R. Frame|publisher=UNSW Press|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhCh7ZgMOhAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey found that Anglicans (along with Baptists, Roman Catholics and Uniting Church members) had become a little more accepting of premarital sex compared to a 1993 survey, whereas Pentecostal Christians had become markedly more conservative. 54% of Australian church attenders felt pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong, whereas only 3% of non-church attenders thought it was always or usually wrong. Among those who attended church on a weekly basis, the percentage of those who thought pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong rose to 67%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Hughes |author2=Lachlan Fraser |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0y9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|title=Life, Ethics and Faith in Australian Society: Facts and Figures |publisher=Christian Research Association |year=2014 |page=89 |isbn=978-1-875223-77-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 survey by the ''[[Church Times]]'' in England found that less than half of the 5,000 readers questioned said it was wrong for men and women to have sex before they married. Over 25% also said it was acceptable for a couple to live together without ever intending to marry.&lt;ref name="rethink"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1908115.ece|title=Church told to rethink bar on sex before marriage|author=Ruth Gledhill|date=31 March 2003|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 report, ''Cohabitation: A Christian Reflection'', produced by the Diocese of Southwark, found that the Church's traditional teaching that sex before marriage is wrong has been inherited from a different form of society than that which exists today. However, the report then cited research that illustrates the problems that accompany cohabitation, particularly with regard to raising children. It concluded that marriage is "a much more satisfactory social convention than cohabitation", but says that the Church has failed to present marriage in a way that captures the imagination of young people and that the Church needed to rise to the challenge and rediscover its confidence in marriage.&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt; The report noted that Paul gave a "cautious welcome" to marriage, but that there was also a "militant apostolic view" that favoured celibacy, which "was seen as more noble than marriage" by many early Christians. The report also noted that "the strict sexual codes of the earliest Christian communities helped to give them a separate identity distinct from the sexual hedonism of the pagan world."&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt;

The report ultimately rejected the possibility that cohabitation with no intention to marry is acceptable for members of the Christian Church.&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt;

In a 2004 interview, the [[Anglican Primate of Australia]], Archbishop [[Peter Carnley]], noted that heterosexual de facto relationships and a disinclination to commit were more serious worries for him than the same-sex marriage movement. When asked if he thought sexual morality was subjective, he disagreed, stating "I think it's possible to say, for example, that it is objectively quite clear that promiscuity is a bad thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 February 2004 |title=Archbishop Peter Carnley suggests 'lifelong friendships' over gay marriage |publisher=ABC Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1053387.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731062100/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1053387.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[N. T. Wright]] noted that, in popular discourse, there has been a "supposed modern and scientific discovery of a personal 'identity' characterised by sexual preference, which then generates a set of 'rights'... Without entering into discussion of the scientific evidence, it must be said that the Christian notion of personal identity has never before been supposed to be rooted in desires of whatever sort. Indeed, desires are routinely brought under the constraints of 'being in Christ'. This quite new notion of an 'identity' found not only within oneself but within one's emotional and physical desires needs to be articulated on the basis of scripture and tradition, and this to my mind has not been done... The church has never acknowledged that powerful sexual instincts, which almost all human beings have, generate a prima facie 'right' that these instincts receive physical expression. All are called to chastity and, within that, some are called to celibacy; but a call to celibacy is not the same thing as discovering that one has a weak or negligible sexual drive. The call to the self-control of chastity is for all: for the heterosexually inclined who, whether married or not, are regularly and powerfully attracted to many different potential partners, just as much as for those with different instincts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunioninstitute.com/2009/07/rowan%E2%80%99s-reflections-unpacking-the-archbishop%E2%80%99s-statement/|title=Rowan's Reflections: Unpacking the Archbishop's Statement|author=|date=|work=The Anglican Communion Institute, Inc.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010113146/http://www.anglicancommunioninstitute.com/2009/07/rowan%E2%80%99s-reflections-unpacking-the-archbishop%E2%80%99s-statement/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion, Wright stated, "We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive. All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator's best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means that his creational standards don't really matter after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preachingtoday.com/illustrations/2015/february/7022315.html|title=N.T.

I always find it difficult to condense sexual ethics into a soundbite... All I can say is where the Church stands – it's not a question of what Rowan Williams's view is... the biblical view of sexual relations is consistently within the pattern of absolute mutual commitment, reflecting God's commitment to his people. And the assumption of the Bible is that that commitment is heterosexual. That is the framework we work in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/georgepitcher/4843667/Rowan_Williams_and_sex_a_clarification/|title=Rowan Williams and sex: a clarification|author=George Pitcher|date=7 August 2008|work=Telegraph Blogs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160422164308/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/georgepitcher/4843667/Rowan_Williams_and_sex_a_clarification/|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his earlier 1997 essay, "Forbidden Fruit: New Testament Sexual Ethics", Dr Williams had noted, "I can't see that the New Testament easily allows any straightforwardly positive evaluation of sexual intimacy outside a relationship that is publicly committed [in marriage]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intimate Affairs: Sexuality and Spirituality in Perspective |author=Martyn Percy (ed.) |date=1997 |location=London |work=Darton, Longman and Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kinsey Institute comments that "Prior to the 1950s, the religious influences forming sexual constructs [in Britain] came almost exclusively from "the official church" of England, and "unofficially" from the other Christian denominations. In recent decades, the picture has become more complex. Since midcentury, the Church of England's approach to social morality and sexuality has fluctuated between two poles, the traditionalists and the modernists, or the "permission givers" and the "orthodox moral directors". With the national religious scene resembling the circular approach of the politicians to sexual knowledge and attitudes, the sociosexual control and influence appears to bounce back and forth between church and state according to a mutually cooperative formula... This doctrinal "pendulum" is confusing for the majority of the population who are not experts at moral and theological niceties and subtleties. The people themselves are part of the system of confusion: While expecting clear and definite moral messages from both establishment and Church, they reserve the right to judge the validity of those messages, even when they are biblically based."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuum Complete International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/uk.php|publisher=Kinsey Institute|accessdate=6 June 2014|date=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223110445/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/uk.php|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey found that members of the Church of England have become more accepting of pre-marital sex over the past 30 years. In 1983, 31% of British Anglicans surveyed thought that pre-marital sex was "always" or "mostly" wrong whereas, in 2012, only 10% thought this was the case. Likewise, in 1989, 78% of Anglicans surveyed thought that people should marry before having children. In 2012, this had declined to 54%.&lt;ref name="churchtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Thornton |date=13 September 2013 |url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/13-september/news/uk/christians-more-liberal,-survey-finds |title=Christians more liberal, survey finds |newspaper=Church Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402200654/http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/13-september/news/uk/christians-more-liberal,-survey-finds |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
[[Catholicism]] equates premarital sex with fornication and ties it with breaking the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] ("[[Thou shalt not commit adultery]]") in its [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is corruption of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – The sixth commandment |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 October 1951 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813092321/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |archivedate=13 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book, [[James F. Keenan]] reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are "simply not true". After examining seven medieval text about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, "far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible". He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church "incoherent". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that [[Sacred tradition|tradition]] itself is "not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching." Keenan, however, says that studies of "manualists" such as [[John T. Noonan Jr.]] has demonstrated that, "despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition." Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at "areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James F. Keenan|title=A History of Catholic Moral Theology in the Twentieth Century: From Confessing Sins to Liberating Consciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWbtc5XPMw0C&amp;pg=PA45|date=17 January 2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2929-2|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church did not pro-actively condemn men for pre-marital sex until the twelfth century. The Third [[Council of Aachen]] had previously noted that it was almost unheard of for a man to remain a virgin until his wedding but males remained largely immune to punishment whereas females were heavily penalized for sexual misdemeanours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SiGe-Zf0nTIC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=third%20council%20aachen%20sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3dUT_JNV8&amp;sig=b-VsUhEKhLhZkDFfwhXnmdl9dIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZxuXO2avPAhWGF5QKHRTaCV4Q6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20council%20aachen%20sex&amp;f=false|title=Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|first=James A.|last=Brundage|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Church's disapproval of nonmarital sex, fornication continued to be commonplace in the early medieval period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the twelfth century, the Paris-based "Reform Church" movement was a Catholic faction that attempted to refocus society's moral compass with a particular emphasis on sex and marriage. The movement sent priests to Wales where it was, up until that time, the norm for Christians to live together prior to marriage.&lt;ref name="walesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gerald-wales-patriotic-welshman-arrogant-1848276 |title=Gerald of Wales: Patriotic Welshman or arrogant agent of English imperialism? |work=Wales Online |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=14 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051317/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gerald-wales-patriotic-welshman-arrogant-1848276 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until this period, marriage was considered a private contract between two people. They would make a pledge to each other and, from that moment on, they were considered married. This pledge could take place anywhere; it did not have to occur in a church and neither the church nor the state were involved. It was during the twelfth century that the Catholic Church took control of the process of marriage. From that point on, to be legally recognised, a marriage had to take place in a church with a formal service conducted by a priest. Hence all marriage and sexual activity now came under the control of the Church.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

At the time of the Reformation, the Catholic Church "officially advocated celibacy for the religious, and prohibited marriage, but allowed fornication and concubinage".&lt;ref name="Manschreck2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clyde L. Manschreck|title=Melanchthon: The Quiet Reformer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-pLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|date=8 January 2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60608-283-6|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 1527 all but 10 out of 200 Catholic clergymen in Thuringia were living with women outside marriage.&lt;ref name="Manschreck2009" /&gt;

The [[Council of Trent]] (which began in 1545 in reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]]) formally ratified the Catholic view that marriage was a sacrament and set strict guidelines around what constituted a legitimate marriage in Catholic eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15030c.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |article=Council of Trent |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811181949/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15030c.htm |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1930 encyclical, ''[[Casti connubii]]'', [[Pope Pius XI]] strongly condemned premarital sex and all forms of "experimental" marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19301231_casti-connubii.html|title=''Casti connubii''|author=Pius XI|date=31 December 1930|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904063929/http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19301231_casti-connubii.html|archivedate=4 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic belief that premarital sex is sinful was reasserted in [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1993 encyclical, [[Veritatis Splendor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pope John Paul II |title=Veritatis Splendor |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323060907/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html |archivedate=23 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}

The 2012 British Social Attitudes survey showed that only one in ten British Catholics and Anglicans thought that pre-marital sex was wrong (however, of those who attended Church on a weekly basis, only 23% thought it was permissible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2013/british-social-attitudes-survey-2012/|title=British Social Attitudes Survey, 2012|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095044/http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2013/british-social-attitudes-survey-2012/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 study of French Catholics showed that 83% preferred to listen to their consciences rather than to the official position of the Catholic Church when making major decisions in their lives, leading to 75% of Catholics, by 2003, to say that cohabitation outside marriage is a personal matter and 13% to say whether it is right or not depends on circumstances.&lt;ref name="HargreavesKelsay2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alec G.

A 2004 survey showed vastly different attitudes among Catholics in different nations. For instance, in Germany, 76% of Catholics agreed or strongly agreed that cohabitation before marriage was acceptable. In Spain, that number was 72%, in the Czech Republic it was 66% and in France it was 62%. At the other end of the spectrum, only 32% of Australian Catholics thought it was acceptable, followed by 39% in the Philippines and 43% in the United States.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt;

The same survey sought to show the number of Catholics who believed that premarital sex is "not wrong at all" or "wrong only sometimes". In the Czech Republic, 84% of Catholics believed this, in France it was 83% and in Germany it was 80%. At the other end of the scale, in the Philippines it was 21%, in Ireland it was 51% and in Australia and the United States it was 64%.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt; The survey also claimed that 40% of Catholic women in the United States have cohabited outside marriage.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt;

The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey showed that Catholics have become even more accepting than Anglicans of having children outside wedlock: in 1989, 73% of British Catholics thought people should marry before having children; whereas, by 2012, just 43% thought so.&lt;ref name="churchtimes.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Evangelicalism ===
In his book ''Forbidden Fruit: Sex &amp; Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers'', sociologist [[Mark Regnerus]] notes that "Evangelical Christian teens are more likely to have lost their virginity earlier than mainline Protestants. They start having sex on average at age 16.3 and are more likely than other religious groups to have had three or more sexual partners by age 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilmour|first=Maggie|title=Let's face it, sex happens|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/05/07/f-vp-gilmour.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey found 56% of unmarried evangelical Christians between the ages of 18 and 29 were never sexually active. Unlike previous studies, this survey did not rely on respondents simply identifying themselves as "evangelical" but also had to attend a Protestant church at least once a month, believe that they will go to heaven when they die because they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior, strongly agree that the Bible is the written word of God and is accurate in all that it teaches, that their personal commitment to Jesus Christ is still important to their lives today, that eternal salvation is possible only through Jesus Christ, and that they personally have a responsibility to tell others about their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nae.net/most-unmarried-evangelical-millennials-have-never-had-sex/|title=Most Unmarried Evangelical Millennials Have Never Had Sex – National Association of Evangelicals|date=2012-11-29|work=National Association of Evangelicals|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017041846/https://www.nae.net/most-unmarried-evangelical-millennials-have-never-had-sex/|archivedate=17 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey also found higher religiosity, as measured by frequency of Bible reading, was correlated with a lower rate of non-marital sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nae.net/more-frequent-bible-readers-less-likely-to-have-sex-outside-marriage/|title=More Frequent Bible Readers Less Likely to Have Sex Outside Marriage – National Association of Evangelicals|date=2012-12-06|work=National Association of Evangelicals|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017042010/https://www.nae.net/more-frequent-bible-readers-less-likely-to-have-sex-outside-marriage/|archivedate=17 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Hindu texts present a range of views on sex. The hymn 4.5.5 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' calls adultery as ''pāpa'' (evil, sin).&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=7 with footnote 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, the Vedic texts, including the ''Rigveda'', the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and the [[Upanishads]], also acknowledge the existence of male lovers and female lovers as a basic fact of human life, followed by the recommendation that one should avoid such extra marital sex during certain ritual occasions ([[yajna]]).&lt;ref name="Harlan161"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Lindsey Harlan and Paul B.

It recommends a new married couple to remain sexually faithful to each other for life. It also accepts that adulterous relationships happen, children are born from such relationships and then proceeds to reason that the child belongs to the legal husband of the pregnant woman, and not to the biological father.&lt;ref name="Harlan163"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Lindsey Harlan and Paul B.

According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathryn S.

For example, states Ariel Glucklich, the sexual liaison is taught as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into a sexual relationship outside of marriage, and when she does not want to commit adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, [[Krishna]] commits adultery and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=288–291 with footnotes 83, 89, 101–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is ''prema'' or "selfless, true love" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value.&lt;ref name="Bose2018p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Coleman|editor=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Oxford History of Hinduism: The Goddess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_tdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-107968-9|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of [[hadith]] that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is ''muhsan'' (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; The offenders must have acted of their own free will.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; The [[Maliki]] legal school also allows an unmarried woman's pregnancy to be used as evidence, but the punishment can be averted by a number of legal "semblances" (''shubuhat''), such as existence of an invalid marriage contract.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; These requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules.&lt;ref name=aquraishi&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quraishi | first1 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Her honour: an Islamic critique of the rape provisions in Pakistan's ordinance on zina | url = | journal = Islamic studies | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 403–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called ''qadhf'' (القذف), which is itself a ''hadd'' crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Rudolph|title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law: : Theory and Practice from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-First Century|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521796705|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DLB2004: 89-90"&gt;[[#DLB2004|DeLong-Bas, ''Wahhabi Islam'', 2004]]: 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
The Torah explicitly forbids adultery. All women were expected to be virgins upon marriage. In the case they were found not to be by a betrothed husband, the punishment was death&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:20–21|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the man to whom she married was not the man to whom she lost her virginity. Also if a man and a virgin had sex prior to marriage, then they were forced to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 22:13–29&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote two sources, "The Torah does not outlaw it—as it does many other types of sexual relationships—and the child of such a union is not considered a ''[[mamzer]]'' (illegitimate). Nonetheless, marital sex is considered ideal, and premarital sex is traditionally not approved of. The negative attitude toward premarital sex, to a large degree, reflects the overwhelmingly positive attitude toward sex within marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jewish Views on Premarital Sex |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Sex_and_Sexuality/Premarital_Sex.shtml |publisher=My Jewish Learning |accessdate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234610/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Sex_and_Sexuality/Premarital_Sex.shtml |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "The only limits placed on sexual activities in the Torah are prohibitions against adultery and incest. In Biblical times, a man was not prohibited from having sexual relations with a woman, as long as it led to marriage. The Bible never explicitly states a woman and man may not have sexual intercourse prior to marriage; therefore, no sanction was imposed for premarital sex, but it was considered a violation of custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarital Sex|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/premarital_sex.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=6 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424045758/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/premarital_sex.html|archivedate=24 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixth century, [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] formulated legislation that was to become the basis of Western marriage law for the next millennia. Under his laws, cohabiting couples were no longer recognised as married and their children were regarded as illegitimate, with the same status as the children of prostitutes. However, the status of illegitimate children could be updated if the parents later married.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

In the Victorian era, however, the English working class continued to have a different set of sexual mores from the upper-middle and upper classes.

Most of these laws either were repealed, were not enforced, or were struck down by the courts in several states as being odious to their state constitutions. See also ''[[State v. Saunders]]'', [[Court decision|381 A.2d 333]] (N.J. 1977), ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'', [[Court decision|607 S.E.2d 367]] (Va. 2005).

Some acts may be prohibited under criminal laws defining the offense of [[sodomy]], rather than the laws defining the offense of fornication. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) rendered the states' remaining laws related to sodomy unenforceable. ''Lawrence v. Texas'' is also presumed by many to invalidate laws prohibiting fornication: the decision declared sodomy laws unconstitutional, saying that they interfered with private, consensual, non-commercial intimate relations between unrelated adults, and therefore were odious to the rights of liberty and privacy, such rights being retained by the people of the United States.

==Plot==
Arun Prajapati ([[Salman Khan]]) has been trying to be a successful [[News presenter#News anchors|TV anchor]], but success has always eluded him. He blames [[God]] ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) for this lack of success. Arun is head over heels in love with Alia Kapoor ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), who is a TV anchor and a well-known star working in the same [[Television channel|channel]], but he has never been able to express his love for her.

When Rocky ([[Sohail Khan]]) is appointed as an anchor for the channel, Arun starts believing that Rocky will win Alia. Later, Arun is sacked from the channel. He has nobody to blame but God Himself, whom he later meets in person. An argument ensues between the two, at the end of which God then decides to give Arun the power over all things for ten days, wherein Arun may prove that he is a better operator of the universe.

Arun uses this power to put Rocky into an uneasy spot and win Alia's heart. After God scolds him for only making things better for himself, Arun starts listening to people's prayers. He later realizes that considering each person's wishes individually would be too time-consuming, so to save time and effort he grants ''everybody's'' wishes, including the wish of criminals to be free and Rocky's wish that Alia marries him.

Arun later asks God why is everything happening to him. God explains it is his own fault and that everyone cannot blame Him for this. Arun feels bad, but God forgives him and starts his life over again. During the game show, he tricks Rocky into lying about loving Alia Kapoor (who was present on the show, as it was the channel "Zoop"'s first game show), and Alia turns on  him. Arun wins the heart of Alia.

'''Hinduism in Réunion''' constitutes a significant part of the island's population. The island of [[Réunion]] is home to approximately 200,000 [[India]]n descendants amongst the roughly 800,000 strong population.&lt;ref name="hindutoday"&gt;{{cite journal | title =Reunion Hindus Try For a Revival | journal =Hinduism Today | last=Himalayan Academy | date =November 1991 | url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=871 | accessdate =2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; .Estimates of practicing Hindus vary from 6.7%&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf Indian diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt; to 10.7%.&lt;ref name="religiousintelligence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=151 |title=Country Profile: Reunion (Department of Reunion) |accessdate=2015-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201658/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=151 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; .Yet, uncertainty as to the exact number of Hindus in the country results from the fact that many of the members of the Indian population cross-identify with [[Roman Catholic]], [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] faiths.

==History==
The history of Hinduism in Réunion stretches back to the mid- and late-nineteenth century. Many early Indian arrivals took on [[Christian name]]s and had their children [[baptism|baptised]] in the [[Catholic Church]] at the insistence of their employers, owners or the government administration.&lt;ref name="hindutoday"/&gt; Even so, they did not abandon Hinduism in the process.The missionaries argued that the custom of lighting camphor before the Hindu God was an illustration of black magic, whereas lighting candle in the Church was a sure way to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurasiareview.com/12102018-tamils-in-re-union-losing-cultural-identity-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the Muslims who came to the island from [[Gujarat]], all Indians were routinely reassigned as Catholics, more or less by force.&lt;ref name="NIC"&gt;{{cite conference | first =L.

[[File:Défilé Tamoul à Terre-Sainte (2855521147).jpg|thumb|Tamil [[Hindus]] in [[Réunion]]]]
Although many have converted to Christianity,in the rear portion of every Tamil Christian house, there was a small structure dedicated to the Hindu goddess [[Mariamman]] where they worship.Several Hindu traditions have been subsumed by Christian traditions. The cult of Mariamman has been absorbed into the worship of Virgin Mary. Janmashtami, birth day of God Krishna, is considered to be the date of birth of Jesus Christ. Saint Expedit, worshipped locally, is identified with Goddess Kali.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurasiareview.com/12102018-tamils-in-re-union-losing-cultural-identity-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a revival of Hinduism among members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] community.&lt;ref name="hindutoday"/&gt; This has led to the establishment of many temples and [[ashram]]s. Some Gurukkals (Temple priests) were also brought from Tamil Nadu as a part of this.However the revival of Hinduism is fading.Dr Kalai Selvam Shanmugam, President of Tamil Sangham, Reunion said that Temple priests  brought from Tamil Nadu were more interested in making money than in spreading the gospels of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurasiareview.com/12102018-tamils-in-re-union-losing-cultural-identity-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting feature, likely peculiar to Réunion, is the simultaneous observance by some ethnic Indians of both Catholic and Hindu rites, a practice that has earned them the sobriquet of being "socially Catholic and privately Hindu."

The French government gathers no statistics on religious affiliation. Because of this, it is impossible to know accurately how many Hindus there are in Réunion. Most of the large towns have a functioning [[Hindu temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peoples of Africa: Réunion-Somalia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsqua-r16i4C&amp;pg=PA412|year=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7166-0|pages=412–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 59% of the Gujarati&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/11982/RE&lt;/ref&gt;,40% of the Punjabis&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14483/RE&lt;/ref&gt;,10% of the Tamils&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/19731/RE&lt;/ref&gt; in Réunion are Hindus.

That said, different educators build their own visions of education onto the concept, what some call conceptions of faith learning integration. This idea is commonly found in [[Christian]] colleges in the United States, and is considered by some to be the essence of [[Christian]] higher education. PABATS, the accrediting association for Bible colleges in the Philippines has also shown interest in faith-learning integration. Christian Colleges of Southeast Asia, Southern Philippines Baptist Theological Seminary, Halls of Life Bible College, Davao Bible College and Koinonia Theological Seminary are now practicing faith and learning integration.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of the colleges founded during the colonial period were founded and supported by the dominant [[Christian denomination]]s of the time.

Some scholars claim that the current model of American higher education is convoluted because it has worked to separate faith from learning.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an [[Yetzer harah|inclination]] to do evil "from his youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis:8:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torah.org/learning/mlife/ch1law1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"&gt;http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repentance in [[Judaism]], can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"&gt;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9670&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]], 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"&gt;Simon and Schuster, 1986, Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism, New York: Touchstone book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"&gt;http://thetorah.com/historical-uniqueness-and-centrality-of-yom-kippur/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot]] (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''karbanot'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''karbanot'' only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, ''karbanot'' cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, ''karbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely [[Repentance in Judaism|repents]] of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;

The completely righteous (means a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell).  After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in ''[[Gehenna|gehinom]]'' (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''gehinom'', because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just.&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16693.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanakh==
The first mention of sin as a noun is a [[zoomorphism]], with sin (''hattath'') crouching at [[Cain]]'s door. The first as a verb is [[Abimelech]] being prevented from sinning (''khata'') against God in a dream. In fact the whole [[Tanakh]] is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes.

People do have the ability to master this inclination ({{bibleverse||Genesis|4:7|HE}}) and choose good over evil (conscience)({{bibleverse||Psalm|37:27|HE}}).&lt;ref name="englishhandbook"&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/library/document-library/handbook/The-Jewish-Response-to-Missionaries---English/ English Handbook of Jews for Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism uses the term "sin" to include violations of [[halakha|Jewish law]] that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]: "Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will ("behirah"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: "For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to [[repent]] and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=812&amp;letter=S&amp;search=sin JewishEncyclopedia.com - SIN:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that [[God]] tempers [[justice]] with [[mercy]].

==Terminology==
Hebrew has several other words for sin beyond ''hata'', each with its own specific meaning.  The word ''pesha'', or "trespass", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word ''aveira'' means "transgression".  And the word ''avone'', or "iniquity", means a sin done out of moral failing.  The word most commonly translated simply as "sin", ''hata'', literally means "to go astray." Just as Jewish law, ''halakha'', provides the proper "way" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.

Judaism teaches that humans are born with [[free will]], and morally neutral, with both a ''[[yetzer hatov]]'', (literally, "the good inclination", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a ''[[yetzer hara]]'', (literally "the evil inclination", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that [[Satan]] is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the [[fallen angel]] of traditional Christianity.

==In rabbinical literature==
[[Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno]] suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term "when," which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words "realizes his guilt" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again.

==Transgression==
The generic [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for any kind of sin is ''avera'' (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]], Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or "B'mezid." This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called "B'shogeg," and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a "[[Tinok Shenishba]]", which is a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for his or her actions.
*''Pesha'' (deliberate sin; in modern Hebrew: crime) or ''Mered'' (lit.: rebellion) - An intentional sin; an action committed in deliberate defiance of God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H6588 (''פשע pesha', peh'shah'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H6586); rebellion, transgression, trespass.
*''Avon'' (lit.: iniquity) - This is a sin of lust or uncontrollable emotion. It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to defy God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H5771 (''avon, aw-vone'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H5753); meaning perversity, moral evil:--fault, iniquity, mischief.
*''Cheit'' - This is an unintentional sin, crime or fault. ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H2399 (''חַטָּא chate''). According to Strong it comes from the root ''khaw-taw'' (:H2398, H2403) meaning "to miss, to err from the mark (speaking of an archer), to sin, to stumble."

==States==
Judaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The [[Talmud]] says: "Everyone is responsible to be as great as [[Moses]]", But then the [[Torah]] tells us in [[Deuteronomy]] 34:10 that "No one will ever be as great as Moses". This is to clarify that [[Moses]] fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort.&lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"&gt;[http://www.aish.com/atr/As_Great_as_Moses.html As Great as Moses]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told of [[Zusha of Hanipol|Zusha]], the great [[Chassidic]] master, who lay crying on his deathbed. His students asked him, "Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the mitzvahs and good deeds you have done, you will surely get a great reward in heaven!". "I'm afraid!" said Zusha. "Because when I get to heaven, I know God's not going to ask me 'Why weren't you more like Moses?' or 'Why weren't you more like King David?' But I'm afraid that God will ask 'Zusha, why weren't you more like Zusha?' And then what will I say?!" &lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"/&gt;

[[Joseph Hertz]] said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the views of [[Rabbeinu Tam]] in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy]]:

# God is merciful before someone sins, even though God knows that a person is capable of sin. 
# God is merciful to a sinner even after the person has sinned. 
# God represents the power to be merciful even in areas that a human would not expect or deserve. 
# God is compassionate, and eases the punishment of the guilty. 
# God is gracious even to those who are not deserving. 
# God is slow to anger. 
# God is abundant in kindness. 
# God is the God of truth, thus we can count on God's promises to forgive repentant sinners. 
# God guarantees kindness to future generations, as the deeds of the righteous patriarchs ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]) have benefits to all their descendants. 
# God forgives intentional sins if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives a deliberate angering of Him if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives sins that are committed in error. 
# God wipes away the sins from those who repent.

As Jews are commanded in ''[[imitatio Dei]]'', emulating God, [[rabbi]]s take these attributes into account in deciding [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and its contemporary application.

==Role of orthopraxy==
Jews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jews have believed that [[orthopraxy|right action]] (as opposed to [[orthodoxy|right belief]]) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. [[Midrash]] ''Avot de Rabbi Natan'' states the following:

:One time, when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was walking in Jerusalem with Rabbi Yehosua, they arrived at where the Temple now stood in ruins. "Woe to us" cried Rabbi Yehosua, "for this house where atonement was made for Israel's sins now lies in ruins!" Answered Rabban Yochanan, "We have another, equally important source of atonement, the practice of ''gemilut hasadim'' ("loving kindness"), as it is stated "I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice" ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16160&amp;showrashi=true Hosea 6:6]).

In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take.  It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult.  There is almost always a "way back" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)

==Sins between man and his fellow==
Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repent in [[Judaism]] can atones for [[Sins between man and God(Judaism)|Sins between man and God]], but not for [[Sins between man and his fellow(Judaism)|Sins between man and his fellow]], that is until he has appeased his friend.([[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9).&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"/&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]],16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"/&gt;

The [[Gemara]] (87a) continues: "R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times.  And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, "I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.""

==Many small sins vs. One big sin==
Two Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. “Now go to the field once more,” he told them both, “pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.”

He who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: “Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one’s minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selflessness vs. selfishness==
{{See also|Golden mean (Judaism)}}
The rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''[[yetzer hara]]'': one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was "very good" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as "good") and explain that without the ''yetzer ha'ra'' there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that ''yetzer ha'tov'' and ''yetzer ha'ra'' are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.

Or as [[Hillel the Elder]] famously summarized the Jewish philosophy:
:"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
:And if I am only for myself, what am I?
:And if not now, [then] when?"

Another explanation is, without the existence of the ''yetzer ha'ra'', there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was "good" before, it became "very good" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's "mitzvot" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.

==Value of repentance==
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism}}
The Babylonian Talmud teaches that "Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests]." (Tractate Berachot, 55a.)

Repentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See [[Ezekiel]] 33:11, 33:19, [[Jeremiah]] 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is ''teshuvah'' which literally means to "return (to God)." The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, "Take with you words, and return to God."

Judaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as [[Malachi]] 3:7 says, "Return to Me and I shall return to you," and Ezekiel 18:27, "When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9:18, "We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy."

The [[siddur|traditional liturgy]] of the ''Days of Awe'' (the [[High Holy Days]]; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that [[prayer]], repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented.

===True repentance===
To a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9).

According to [[Maimonides]] in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atonement in the Temple period===
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism|Korban}}
Atonement for sins is discussed in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]]. Rituals for atonement occurred in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and were performed by the ''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'', the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal [[sacrifice]]s known as the ''[[korbanot]]''. The rites for [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of [[Leviticus]] chapter 16. The ritual of the [[scapegoat]], sent into the wilderness to be claimed by [[Azazel]], was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22).

===Liturgical norms===
The liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that prayer, repentance and [[tzedakah]] (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word "T'shuvah" used for atonement actually means "to return". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.

A number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a [[sin-offering]] for sins, and a [[guilt offering]] for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4 and [[Leviticus]] 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the [[sin offering]] and the [[guilt offering]] had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later.

Later Biblical [[prophet]]s occasionally make statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices - "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams" (I Samuel 15:22); "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings" ([[Hosea]] 6:6); "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart" (Psalm 51:17) (see also [[Isaiah]] 1:11, Psalm 40:6-8).

Although the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the ''only'' means of atonement. Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices.&lt;ref name="englishhandbook" /&gt; Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices.

On the High Holy Days of [[Rosh Hashana]], [[Yom Kippur]] - also known as the Day of Atonement-, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice.  An example of a common method of "sacrificing" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of [[Tashlikh]]), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.

'''Johann Andreas Eisenmenger''' (1654 in [[Mannheim]] – December 20, 1704 in [[Heidelberg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] from the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], now best known as the author of ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' (''Judaism Unmasked'').

==Studies of rabbinical literature==
The son of an official in the service of the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of the Palatinate [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles I Louis]] (who had, in 1673, offered [[Spinoza]] a chair in philosophy at Heidelberg), Eisenmenger received a good education, despite the early loss of his father to plague when he was 12 years old. He distinguished himself at the [[Collegium Sapientiae]] at Heidelberg by his zeal for [[Hebrew literature|Hebrew studies]] and [[Semitic languages]]. He eventually mastered [[Hebrew]], [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic]]. He was sent by the Elector to [[England]] and [[Holland]] to pursue his studies there. He studied [[rabbinical]] literature with Jewish assistance for some 19 years both at Heidelberg and [[Frankfort-on-the-Main]], under the pretense, it was rumoured,&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Katz |authorlink=Jacob Katz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeH_uNpWbZAC&amp;pg=PA14 |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1984 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of wishing to convert to Judaism.&lt;ref name=GotthardDeutsch&gt;{{cite Jewish Encyclopedia |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5488-eisenmenger-johann-andreas |title=Eisenmenger, Johann Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Heinrich |last=Graetz |authorlink=Heinrich Graetz |title=History of the Jews, vol.5 |date=1895 |page=187 |quote=Eisenmenger belonged to the class of insects which sucks poison even out of flowers. In confidential converse with Jew, pretending that he desired to be converted to Judaism, and in the profound study of their literature, which he learned from them, he sought only the dark side of both.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Holland he established amicable relations with figures like Rabbi [[David ben Aryeh Leib]] of [[Lida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael L. |last=Rodkinson |title=History of the Talmud, Vol 1  |orig-year=1903 |publisher=New Talmud Pub.Co. |location=New York |date=1918 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly of [[Lithuania]], and then head of the [[Ashkenazi]] community in [[Amsterdam]].  An intended sojourn in Palestine was interrupted by the death of his sponsor in 1680, who died in August of that year.

Later scholars cite two episodes during his sojourn in Amsterdam, which may or may not be apocryphal, to account for the formation of his anti-Judaic outlook. It is said that he was a witness, in 1681, to "otherwise unknown" attacks against Christianity by a senior [[rabbi]] there, identified as David Lida,&lt;ref name=GotthardDeutsch/&gt; and that he grew indignant on finding that three Christians he met had had themselves circumcised and converted to Judaism.&lt;ref name=GotthardDeutsch/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartkoch"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anton Theodor |last=Hartmann |title=Johann Andreas Eisenmenger und seine jüdischen Gegner |date=1834}} cited by {{cite book |first=Jens |last=Koch |title=Johann Andreas Eisenmenger: sein Werk und dessen Wirkung |publisher=Projekt in der Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel |date=1997 |page=10 |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/KOCHeisenmenger.pdf |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Christian polemics were, uniquely to Europe, published in Amsterdam and Eisenmenger's anger was aroused when Lida quoted [[Isaiah Horowitz|Rabbi Isaiah ben Abraham Horowitz]] to the effect that the archangel [[Samael]], king of the devils, was a celestial representation of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elisheva |last=Carlebach |chapter="Ich will dich nach Holland schicken . .": Amsterdam and the Reversion to Judaism of German-Jewish Converts |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Mulsow |editor2-first=Richard Henry |editor2-last=Popkin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjrni72sM-gC&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Secret conversions to Judaism in early modern Europe |publisher=Brill |date=2004 |pages=51–69 |isbn=9789004128835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method Eisenmenger employed in this work has been called both 'coarsely literalist and non-contextual'&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Sutcliffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjilDDXfmqEC&amp;pg=PA176 |title=Judaism and Enlightenment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2005 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'rigorously scholarly and exegetical', involving the use only of Jewish sources for references, without forging or inventing anything.&lt;ref name="Merback"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mitchell B. |last=Merback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDZKI-x4E-sC&amp;pg=PA341 |title=Beyond the Yellow Badge: Anti-Judaism and Antisemitism in Medieval and Early Modern Visual Culture |publisher=Brill |date=2008 |page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having collected citations from 193 books and rabbinical tracts not only in Hebrew and Aramaic but also in Yiddish,&lt;ref&gt;Some thirteen volumes, including ''Tsene Rene,'' ''Seyfer brantshpigl,'' ''[[:de:Ma'assebuch|Mayse-bukh]],'' ''Yudisher teryak,'' and the ''[[Isaac Tyrnau|Minhogim-buch]] ''&lt;/ref&gt; all accompanied by German translations&lt;ref name="Elya"&gt;{{cite book |first=Aya |last=Elya |title=A Goy Who Speaks Yiddish: Christians and the Jewish Language in Early Modern Germany |publisher=Stanford University Press |date=2012 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging over legal issues, [[Kabbalah|cabala]], homiletics, philosophy, ethics and polemics against both Islam and Christianity,&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; he published his ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' (English titles include ''Judaism Unveiled'', ''Judaism Discovered'', ''Judaism Revealed'', and ''Judaism Unmasked'', with the latter title most commonly used), which has served as a source for detractors of [[Talmudic]] literature down to the present day.  Eisenmenger made considerable use of works written by Jewish converts to Christianity, such as [[Samuel Friedrich Brenz]]'s ''Jüdischer abgestreiffter Schlangen-Balg'' (''Jewish cast-off snakeskin'', 1614), to bolster his anti-Jewish charges.&lt;ref name="Elya"/&gt;

The work, in two large quarto volumes, appeared in Frankfurt in 1700, and the Elector, [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Prince Johann Wilhelm]], took great interest in it, appointing Eisenmenger professor of [[Oriental languages]] in the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Eisenmenger's purpose, he avowed, was to have Jews recognize the errors of their ways and what he conceived to be the truth of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Merback: "Eisenmenger believed his work to be aimed at a single purpose: to remove the Jews' spiritual blindfold, lift them out of their abject state of ignorance, and reveal the truth of Christianity - in short, to bring them to conversion where others had failed."&lt;/ref&gt; To this end he urged that several measures be undertaken, including restricting their economic liberties and rights, banning them from writing criticisms of Christianity, and proscribing both their synagogues and law courts.&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;

The book was designed not only to reveal to Christians the existence of elements in Jewish rabbinical thought which Eisenmenger thought injurious to the Christian faith, but also to appeal to a free-thinking secular public, and to enlightened Jews whom he wished to shock by his revelations. In particular he hoped to use his evidence in order to promote the conversion of 'honest Jews' to his own faith. [[Paul Lawrence Rose]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Eisenmenger proceeded to amass quotations from the Talmud and other Hebrew sources revealing to all how the Jewish religion was barbarous, superstitious, and even murderous. All this was done in an apparently scholarly and reasonable way that belied the author's evident preoccupation (like [[Martin Luther|Luther]]) with tales of Jewish [[ritual murder]] of Christian children and poisoning of wells. While piously insisting that the Jews must not be converted by cruel methods, Eisenmenger blithely recommended abolishing their present 'freedom in trade,' which was making them 'lords' over the Germans. He demanded too an immediate ban on their synagogues, public worship, and communal leaders and rabbis.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul Lawrence |last=Rose |authorlink=Paul Lawrence Rose |title=Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany: From Kant to Wagner |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1990 |page=8f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further, if minor, element in his polemic consisted of an argument that Germans were a distinct people within Christianity, descended from the [[Canaanites]], whom 'the Jews' were intent on destroying&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pierre |last=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drTL9BQtdFcC&amp;pg=PA73 |title=The Murderous Paradise: German Nationalism and the Holocaust |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2001 |pages=72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with [[Deuteronomy]] 7:16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nils |last=Roemer |chapter=Colliding Visions:Jewish Messianism and German Scholarship in the Eighteenth Century |editor1-first=Allison |editor1-last=Coudert |editor2-first=Jeffrey S. |editor2-last=Shoulson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDFCuuXd1DkC&amp;pg=PA271 |title=Hebraica Veritas?: Christian Hebraists and the Study of Judaism in Early Modern Europe |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |date=2004 |pages=266–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Court Jew|Influential Jewish members of the Court]] of the [[House of Habsburg]], fearing that the book's publication would give additional strength to the prejudice against them, denounced it as a malicious [[libel]], and the financier and rabbi [[Samson Wertheimer]] successfully petitioned [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] to have Eisenmenger's book suppressed.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On July 2, 1700, according to Merbach p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  Only a year previously, riots against the Jews had occurred in the [[diocese]] of [[Bamberg]], and that in the same year (July 21) a mob had, with the Court's permission, sacked the house of the Jewish [[Factor (agent)|Factor]] (''Hoffaktor'') to the Court in [[Vienna]], [[Samuel Oppenheimer]]. The aim of the riot was to pressure him over huge debts the Court had contracted for his services in financing the Habsburgs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) |first=Paul |last=Johnson |title=A History of the Jews |orig-year=1987 |publisher=Phoenix |location=London |date=1996|pages=256–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer in turn succeeded in procuring an order of confiscation from the emperor, who commanded that the whole edition of 2,000 copies be placed under lock and key. However, the State refused to honour its debts to him. With him others worked for the same end, including Juspa van Geldern&lt;ref&gt;Not ''von'' Geldern, as is often printed. In his [[Memoirs]],Heine calls them ''de Geldern'' to hint at noble origins. See {{cite book |authorlink=S. S. Prawer |first=S. S. |last=Prawer |title=Heine's Jewish Comedy |orig-year=1983 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |page=674}}, and occasionally elsewhere ''von Geldern'', for similar reasons. cf. {{cite book |first=Jeffrey L. |last=Sammons |title=Heinrich Heine: A Modern Biography |publisher=Carcanet |location=Manchester |date=1979 |page=17}}. Sammons gives 'Juspa' not 'Jospa' as the correct name&lt;/ref&gt; the great-grandfather of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s mother.&lt;ref&gt;Heine himself once asked a friend to loan him a copy of Eisenmenger's book to see how he fitted into its antisemitic stereotyping. See S.S.Prawer, ''Heine's Jewish Comedy'',ibid. p.745&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] order, according to Hartmann, also complained about the book on the grounds that it slandered [[Catholicism]]. The anecdote perhaps is intended to suggest that the success of the Jewish request for the book's suppression depended on its association with the Jesuits' criticism&lt;ref name="Anton Theodor Hartmann 1834 p. 14"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anton Theodor |last=Hartmann |title=Johann Andreas Eisenmenger und seine jüdischen Gegner |date=1834}} cited by  {{cite book |first=Jens |last=Koch |title=Johann Andreas Eisenmenger: sein Werk und dessen Wirkung |publisher=Projekt in der Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel |date=1997 |page=14 |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/KOCHeisenmenger.pdf |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one report written some decades later, the Jews had offered Eisenmenger the sum of 12,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s if he would suppress his work; but he was rumored to have demanded 30,000 florins, ostensibly in compensation for the considerable outlay from his own savings which the publication of the book had caused him to contribute. If any such proposed transaction was negotiated, nothing came of it.&lt;ref name="Anton Theodor Hartmann 1834 p. 14"/&gt;  Eisenmenger died suddenly of [[apoplexy]], some say induced by grief over the suppression of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Léon |last=Poliakov |authorlink=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Antisemitism. From the Time of Christ to the Court Jews |publisher=Schocken Books |location=New York |date=1965 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1704.

Meanwhile, two Jewish converts to Christianity in [[Berlin]] had brought charges against their former co-religionists of having blasphemed [[Jesus]]. King [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] took the matter very seriously, and ordered an investigation. Eisenmenger's heirs applied to the king; and the latter tried to induce the emperor to repeal the injunction against the book, but did not succeed. He therefore ordered in 1711 a new edition of 3,000 copies to be printed in Berlin at his expense, but as there was an imperial prohibition against printing the book in the German empire, the title page gave as the place of publication [[Königsberg]], which was beyond the boundaries of the empire. Almost forty years later the original edition was released.

Of the many [[polemic]]al works written by non-Jews against Judaism, Eisenmenger's has remained the most thoroughly documented one. Precisely because of its extensive citations of primary sources in their original languages, with facing translations, it has long furnished antisemitic journalists and pamphleteers with their main arguments. Eisenmenger undoubtedly possessed a great deal of knowledge. [[Jacob Katz]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Eisenmenger was acquainted with all the literature a Jewish scholar of standing would have known ... [He] surpassed his [non-Jewish] predecessors in his mastery of the sources and his ability to interpret them tendentiously. Contrary to accusations that have been made against him, he does not falsify his sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Katz |title=From Prejudice to Destruction. Antisemitism, 1700-1933 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=1980 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no serious challenge to the authenticity of the sources Eisenmenger cited. What are often challenged are the many inferences he made from these texts, his tearing of citations from their context, the correctness of specific interpretations and, more importantly, his use of a relatively small number of texts within the huge chain of rabbinical commentary to characterise Judaism as a whole. In regard to the first two points, Siegfried, for one, argued that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 'Taken as a whole, it is a collection of scandals. Some passages are misinterpreted; others are insinuations based on one-sided inferences; and even if this were not the case, a work which has for its object the presentation of the dark side of Jewish literature can not give us a proper understanding of Judaism.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] |title=Eisenmenger, Johann Andreas |first=Carl  |last=Siegfried |authorlink=Carl Siegfried |url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Eisenmenger,_Johann_Andreas |language=de |date=1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In regard to the third point, G. Dalman wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 'it could no more be called a faithful representation of Judaism than an indiscriminate collection of everything superstitious and repulsive within Christian literature could be termed characteristic of Christianity'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=G. |last=Dalman |title=Eisenmenger, Johann Andreas |encyclopedia=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge |volume=4 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Catholic [[theologian]] [[August Rohling]] exploited the material in Eisenmenger's book in order to construct the infamous fabrications of his influential antisemitic polemic ''Der Talmudjude'' (1871).&lt;ref&gt;Merbach p. 341 n. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran biblical scholar [[Franz Delitzsch]] subjected Rohling's book to a close examination and found that he not only drew on Eisenmenger, but introduced many significant distortions. Rohling's book however coincided with a rise in antisemitism and often influenced humanist critics and/or antisemites, who often cite him, rather than Eisenmenger's own voluminous treatise. One such example is afforded by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]], who, in his antisemitic volume ''The Jew, Gypsy, and El Islam'' (1898), relied in part on Rohling's text. In recent decades the kind of material from rabbinical sources which Eisenmenger exploited to attack Judaism in general has been often discussed in contextualising certain extremist currents in modern [[Jewish fundamentalism]], of the kind observed in religious-political movements like those associated with the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]], [[Meir Kahane]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and his son [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], such as [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] and [[Gush Emunim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Lustick |authorlink=Ian Lustick |title=For The Land and The Lord |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |location=Washington |orig-year=1988 |edition=2nd. |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1-first=Israel |author1-last=Shahak |authorlink1=Israel Shahak |author2-first=Norton |author2-last=Mezvinsky |authorlink2=Norton Mezvinsky |title=Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |orig-year=1999 |edition=2nd |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

An English abridgment of Eisenmenger's volumes was published by [[John Peter Stehelin]] in 1748 under the title ''The Traditions of the Jews, with the Expositions and Doctrines of the Rabbins''.

A 19th century German edition of ''Entdecktes Judenthum'', edited by Otto Brandner, was published by [[F. X. Schieferl]], Dresden, 1893.

Eisenmenger edited with [[Johann Leusden|Johannes Leusden]] the unvocalized Hebrew Bible, Amsterdam, 1694, and wrote a ''Lexicon Orientale Harmonicum'', which to this day has not been published.

'''Jules François Camille Ferry''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒyl fɛʁi|lang}}; 5 April 1832{{spaced ndash}}17 March 1893) was a French statesman and republican. He was a promoter of [[laicism]] and [[colonial expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Western Society'', Seventh Edition. John Buckler, [[Bennett D. Hill]], [[John P. McKay]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges|Saint-Dié]], in the [[Vosges (department)|Vosges department]], France, he studied law, and was called to the bar at Paris in 1854,&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Ferry, Jules François Camille|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon went into politics, contributing to various newspapers, particularly to ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]''. He attacked the [[Second French Empire]] with great violence, directing his opposition especially against [[Baron Haussmann]], prefect of the [[Seine (department)|Seine department]]. A series of his articles in ''Le Temps'' was later republished as ''The Fantastic Tales of Haussmannlaxupa'' (1868).&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Political rise===
[[Image:Jules Ferry Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|Jules Ferry, by [[Nadar (artist)|Nadar]]]]
Elected republican deputy for Paris in 1869, he protested against the declaration of [[Franco-Prussian War|war with Germany]], and on 6 September 1870 was appointed prefect of the Seine by the [[Government of National Defense]].&lt;ref name=eb11&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Ferry, Jules François Camille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this position he had the difficult task of administering Paris during the siege, and after the [[Paris Commune]] was obliged to resign (5 June 1871).  From 1872 to 1873 he was sent by [[Adolphe Thiers]] as minister to Athens, but returned to the chamber as deputy for the Vosges, and became one of the leaders of the [[Opportunist Republicans]]. When the first republican ministry was formed under [[William Waddington|W. H. Waddington]] on 4 February 1879, he was one of its members, and continued in the ministry until 30 March 1885, except for two short interruptions (from 10 November 1881 to 30 January 1882, and from 29 July 1882 to 21 February 1883), first as minister of education and then as minister of foreign affairs. A leader of the [[Opportunist Republicans]] faction, he was twice premier (1880–1881 and 1883–1885).&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; He was an active [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Freemason]] initiated on July 8, 1875, in "La Clémante amitiée" lodge in Paris the same day as [[Émile Littré]].&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de la Franc-Maçonnerie française'' (Pierre Chevallier - ed. Fayard - 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire universelle de la Franc-Maçonnerie'' (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc Cara, ed. Larousse, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopédie de la Franc-Maçonnerie (ed. Livre de Poche, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire de la Franc-Maçonnerie'' (Daniel Ligou, Presses Universitaires de France, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jules Ferry'' (Jean-Michel Gaillard, ed. Fayard, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the "Alsace-Lorraine" Lodge founded in Paris in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Denslow, William R. and Harry S. Truman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvBjhJr9Ev0C&amp;dq 10,000 ''Famous Freemasons from A to J Part One''], p. 44, Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===School reforms===
Two important works are associated with his administration: the non-clerical organization of public education, and the major [[French colonial empire|colonial expansion of France]].  Following the republican programme, he proposed to destroy the influence of the clergy in the university and found his own system of republican schooling.  He reorganized the committee of public education (law of 27 February 1880), and proposed a regulation for the conferring of university degrees, which, though rejected, aroused violent polemics because the 7th article took away from the unauthorized religious orders the right to teach.  He finally succeeded in passing his [[Jules Ferry laws|eponymous laws]] of 16 June 1881 and 28 March 1882, which made primary [[education in France]] [[free education|free]], [[secular education|non-clerical]] ([[Laïcité|laïque]]) and mandatory.  In higher education, the number of professors, called the "Republic's black hussars" ({{lang-fr|hussards noirs de la République|links=no}}) because of their Republican support, doubled under his ministry.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;

The [[Language policy in France|education policies establishing French language]] as the language of the Republic have been contested in the second half of the 20th century insofar as, while they played an important role in unifying the French [[nation state]] and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], they also nearly caused the extinction of several regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chez.com/buan1/poignant.htm 1998 report] from Bernard Poignant, mayor of [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]], to [[Lionel Jospin]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial expansion===
[[File:La Petite Lune - 42.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[André Gill]]'s cartoon on Ferry, where he eats a gingerbread priest (1878)]]
After the [[Franco-Prussian War|military defeat of France by Prussia]] in 1870, Ferry formed the idea of acquiring a great colonial empire, principally for the sake of economic exploitation.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;
In 1882 Jules Ferry, as Minister of Public Instruction, decided to create a mission to explore the Regency of Tunisia.{{sfn|Ducloux|1913|p=241}}
The expedition was headed by the botanist [[Ernest Cosson]] and included the botanist [[Napoléon Doumet-Adanson]] and other naturalists.{{sfn|Burollet|1995|pp=111–122}}
In 1884 a geological section under [[Georges Rolland]] was added to the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission.{{sfn|Burollet|1995}}
Rolland was assisted by [[Philippe Thomas]] from 1885 and by [[Georges Le Mesle]] in 1887.{{sfn|Tawadros|2011|p=38}}

In a speech on the colonial empire before the Chamber of Deputies on 28 March 1884, he declared that "it is a right for the superior races, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatamis.info/medias/controle_citoyen/ferry-jules.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825083658/http://www.tatamis.info/medias/controle_citoyen/ferry-jules.htm |archivedate=25 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferry directed the negotiations which led to the establishment of a French [[protectorate]] in [[Tunis]] (1881), prepared the treaty of 17 December 1885 for the occupation of [[Madagascar]]; directed the exploration of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and of the [[Niger]] region; and above all, he organized the conquest of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]] in what became [[French Indochina|Indochina]].&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;

The last endeavor led to a war with [[Qing dynasty]] China, which had a claim of suzerainty over the two provinces.  The excitement caused in Paris by the sudden [[retreat from Lạng Sơn|retreat of the French troops]] from [[Lạng Sơn]] during this war led to the [[Tonkin Affair]]: his violent denunciation by [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and other radicals, and his downfall on 30 March 1885.  Although the [[Sino-French War|treaty of peace with the Chinese Empire]] (9 June 1885), in which the Qing dynasty ceded suzerainty of Annam and Tonkin to France, was the work of his ministry, he would never again serve as premier.

The desire for a monarchy was strong in France in the early years of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] – [[Henri, Count of Chambord]] having made a bid early in its history. A committed republican, Ferry proceeded to a wide-scale "purge" by dismissing many known monarchists from top positions in the [[Magistrate|magistrature]], army and civil and diplomatic service.

===Agreements with Germany===
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}
[[File:JulesFerryBonnat.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Portrait of Ferry by [[Léon Bonnat]]]]
The key to understanding Ferry's unique position in Third Republic history is that until his political critic, [[Georges Clemenceau]] became Prime Minister twice in the 20th century, Ferry had the longest tenure as Prime Minister under that regime.  He also played with political dynamite that eventually destroyed his success.  Ferry (like his 20th century equivalent [[Joseph Caillaux]]) believed in not confronting Wilhelmine Germany by threats of a future war of revenge.  Most French politicians in the middle and right saw it as a sacred duty to one day lead France again against Germany to reclaim [[Alsace-Lorraine]], and avenge the awful defeat of 1870. But Ferry realized that Germany was too powerful, and it made more sense to cooperate with [[Otto von Bismarck]] and avoid trouble.  A sensible policy – but hardly popular.

Bismarck was constantly nervous about the situation with France.  Although he had despised the ineptness of the French under [[Napoleon III]] and the government of [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Jules Favre]], he had not planned for all the demands he presented the French in 1870.  He only wished to temporarily cripple France by the billion franc reparation, but suddenly he was confronted by the demands of Marshals [[Albrecht von Roon]] and [[Helmut von Moltke]] (backed by Emperor [[Wilhelm I]]) to annex the two French provinces as further payment.  Bismarck, for all his abilities regarding manipulating events, could not afford to anger the Prussian military.  He got the two provinces, but he realized it would eventually have severe future repercussions.

Bismarck was able to ignore the French for most of the 1870s and early 1880s, but as he found problems with his three erstwhile allies (Austria, Russia, and Italy), he realized France might one day take advantage of this (as it did with Russia in 1894). When Ferry came up with a radically different approach to the situation and offered an olive branch, Bismarck reciprocated. A Franco-German friendship would alleviate problems of siding with either Austria or Russia, or Austria and Italy. Bismarck approved of the colonial expansion that France pursued under Ferry.  He only had some problems with local German imperialists who were critical that Germany lacked colonies, so he found a few in the 1880s, making certain he did not confront French interests.  But he also suggested Franco-German cooperation on the imperial front against the British Empire, thus hoping to create a wedge between the two Western European great powers. It did as a result, leading to a major race for influence across Africa that nearly culminated in war in the next decade, at [[Fashoda]] in the [[Sudan]] in 1898. But by then both Bismarck and Ferry were dead, and the rapproachment policy died when Ferry lost office.  As for Fashoda, while it was a confrontation, it led to Britain and France eventually discussing their rival colonial goals, and agreeing to support each other's sphere of influence – the first step to the [[Entente Cordiale]] between the countries in 1904.

===Later life===
Ferry remained an influential member of the moderate republican party, and directed the opposition to [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|General Boulanger]].  After the resignation of [[Jules Grévy]] (2 December 1887), he was a candidate for the presidency of the republic, but the radicals refused to support him, and he withdrew in favour of [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]].

On 10 December 1887,&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; a man named Aubertin attempted to assassinate Jules Ferry, who later died from complications attributed to this wound on 17 March 1893.  The [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] gave him a state funeral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3418">The '''Kapariya''' are a [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. They are also known as '''Khunkhuniya Bhatt''' and have [[Scheduled Caste]] status.

The word kapadiya is derived from the Hindi word kapra, which means a cloth. They claim to be a branch of the Bhatt community, that took to begging. A change of occupation led to an evolution of a distinct community. They have two sub-divisions, the Brahma Bhatta and Rao Bhatta. The Kapariya are found mainly in Fatehpur district,(Durga Prasad kapadia)Gursahaiganj kannauj, Gangaganj,Gorakhpur,kaiyamganj, where they are considered the original settlers. They speak Awadhi among themselves, and Hindi with outsiders.[1]

Present circumstances
The Kapariya are strictly endogamous and their two sub-divisions, the Brahma Bhatta and Rao Bhatta, are also endogamous. They are further divided into a number of exogamous sub-divisions, known as gotras. The main function of the gotra is to trace descent and to regulate their marriage alliances. The Brahma Bhatta claim a higher status from the Rao Bhatta, a system of hypergamy exists among these two groups.[1]

The Kapariya are a landless community, and are still involved in their traditional occupation is begging. Many have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, and are employed as day labourers. A small number have been granted land, but their land holdings are extremely small. Like other Hindu castes, each Kapariya settlement contains a biradari panchayat, an informal caste association, which acts as an instrument of social control.[citation needed]

The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Kapariya Scheduled Caste population as 20,205

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">'''Khordeh Avesta''',&lt;!-- this is how the title is rendered in the latin-script Kanga editions. There is no unified pronunciation or spelling, cf Kellens' "korda avesta" --&gt; meaning 'little, or lesser, or small Avesta', is the name given to two different collections of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religious texts. One of the two collections includes the other and takes its name from it.

*  In a narrow sense, the term applies to a particular manuscript tradition that includes only the five ''[[Avesta#Nyayesh|Nyayesh]]'' texts, the five ''[[Avesta#Gah|Gah]]'' texts, the four ''[[Avesta#Afrinagan|Afrinagan]]''s, and five introductory chapters that consist of quotations from various passages of the ''Yasna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kellens|first=Jean|year=1983|chapter=Avesta|pages=35–44|title=Encyclopædia Iranica|series=vol. 3|
|location=New York|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, &lt;!--in what is called a "''tamam''" form, from Arabic "tamam", "fat, comprehensive" --&gt; the term may also be applied to [[Avestan]] texts other than the lengthy liturgical ''[[Yasna]]'', ''[[Visperad]]'' and ''[[Vendidad]]''. The term then also extends to the twenty-one [[yasht]]s and the thirty ''[[Avesta#Siroza|Siroza]]'' texts, but does not usually encompass the various Avestan language [[Avesta#Fragments|fragments found in other works]].

* In the [[19th century]], when the first ''Khordeh Avesta'' editions were printed, the selection of Avesta texts described above (together with some non-Avestan language prayers) became a book of common prayer for lay people.&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|year=1984|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism|publisher=Manchester UP|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the texts mentioned above, the published ''Khordeh Avesta'' editions also included selections from the ''Yasna'' necessary for daily worship, such as the ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' and ''[[Ashem Vohu]]''. The selection of texts is not fixed, and so publishers are free to include any text they choose. Several ''Khordeh Avesta'' editions are quite comprehensive, and include [[Pazend]] prayers, modern devotional compositions such as the poetical or semi-poetical [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] ''monagat''s, or glossaries and other reference lists such as dates of religious events.

[[Image:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|thumb|360px|right|frame|The Laguna Copperplate Inscription ([https://www.flickr.com/photos/jayson_villaruz2008/4051845165/ key]) is inscribed with small writing hammered into its surface. It shows heavy [[Greater India|Indian cultural influence]] (by way of [[Srivijaya]]) present in the Philippines prior to European colonization in the 16th century.]]

The '''Laguna Copperplate Inscription''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Inskripsyon sa Binatbat na Tanso ng Laguna'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Prasasti keping tembaga Laguna''; often shortened into the acronym '''LCI'''), a legal document [[inscription|inscribed]] on a copper plate in 900 AD, is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines.

The plate was found in 1989 by a laborer near the mouth of the Lumbang River in Wawa [[barangay]], [[Lumban, Laguna|Lumban]] municipality, [[Laguna (province)|Laguna province]]. The inscription, written in a mix of the [[Old Malay]] language using the [[Old Kawi]] script, was first deciphered by Dutch anthropologist and [[Hanunó'o script]] expert [[Antoon Postma]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Postma"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/download/1033/1018|title=The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary|jstor=42633308|last=Postma|first=Antoon|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=40|issue=2|pages=182–203|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University|date=April–June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiongson, Jaime F. (August 8, 2010). [http://www.bayangpinagpala.org/ "Laguna Copperplate Inscription:  A New Interpretation Using Early Tagalog Dictionaries"]. Bayang Pinagpala.

The LCI documents the existence of several [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|early Philippine]] polities as early as AD 900, most notably the Pasig River delta polity of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]].&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; Scholars believe that it also indicates trade, cultural, and possibly political ties between these polities and at least one contemporaneous Asian civilization—the [[Medang Kingdom]] of the island of [[Java]].&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

The inscription was written in [[Kawi script]]—a writing system developed in Java, and using a mixture of languages including [[Sanskrit]], [[Old Javanese]], and Old Malay. This was a rare trace of Javanese influence, which suggests the extent of interinsular exchanges of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula | first = Paul Michel | last = Munoz | publisher = Continental Sales, Incorporated | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789814155670 |url = https://books.google.co.id/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=id&amp;id=NqwuAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Philippines  | page = 236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also| Indian honorifics | Greater India | Sanskritisation | Brahmi script }}

Prior to the European colonialism, [[South East Asia]] including Malaysia were under the influence of [[Indosphere]] of [[greater India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourhised for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term ''indianization''.&lt;ref name=acharya&gt;{{cite web|last1=Acharya|first1=Amitav|title=The "Indianization of Southeast Asia" Revisited: Initiative, Adaptation and Transformation in Classical Civilizations|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Indianisation%20of%20Southeast%20Asia%20Revisited.pdf|website=amitavacharya.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; French archaeologist, [[George Coedes]], defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhist|Buddhism]] and the [[Sanskritization|Sanskrit dialect]].&lt;ref name=coedes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date=1967|publisher=Australian National University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the  [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]], [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|spread of Hinduism]] and [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhism]].

==Discovery and provenance==
[[File:Inskripsyon sa Binatbat na Tanso ng Laguna.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The actual image of the LCI found in Lumbang River.]]

Suspecting that the artifact might have some value, the man sold it to an antique dealer who, having found no buyers, eventually sold it to the [[National Museum of the Philippines]], where it was assigned to [[Alfredo E. Evangelista]], head of its [[anthropology]] department.&lt;ref name="mts"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title=Expert on past dies; 82 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20081021-167699/Expert-on-past-dies-82 |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |publisher= |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024114447/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20081021-167699/Expert-on-past-dies-82 |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Antoon Postma noted that the inscription was similar to the ancient Indonesian script of [[Old Kawi|Kawi]]. Postma translated the script and found the document dated itself to the Saka year 822, an old Hindu calendar date which corresponds to 900 AD.&lt;ref name="bibingka"/&gt; This meant that the document pre-dated the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 and is from about the same time as the mention of the Philippines in the official Chinese [[Song dynasty]] ''[[History of Song]]'' for the year 972.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Scott, ''Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History'', pg.65. {{ISBN|971-10-0226-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The inscription is on a thin copper plate measuring less than 20 × 30&amp;nbsp;cm (8 × 12 inches) in size with words directly embossed onto the plate. It differs in manufacture from Javanese scrolls of the period, which had the words inscribed onto a heated, softened scroll of metal.&lt;ref name="mts"/&gt;

Inscribed on it is year 822 of the [[Saka Era]], the month of Waisaka, and the fourth day of the waning moon, which corresponds to Monday, April 21, 900 AD in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="bibingka"/&gt; The text is Old Malay with numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin may be Old Javanese. Some contend it is between Old Tagalog and Old Javanese.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; The document states that it releases its bearers, the children of ''Namwaran'', from a debt in [[gold]] amounting to 1 ''kati'' and 8 ''suwarnas'' (865 grams; 27.8 troy ounces).&lt;ref name="mts"&gt;Morrow, Paul (July 14, 2006).

| &lt;small&gt;* Line 10 of the LCI ends mid-sentence.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

== Geographical place-names identified  in the text==
Postma, who first translated the LCI, notes that place names and personal names in the LCI need to be carefully studied by scholars because “''they furnish vital clues regarding the political &amp; topographic background''” of the world around the time of the LCI.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

Going into the specifics of the text, he notes that:&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''“the toponyms or placenames are: Pailah (lines 4 and 6); Tundun (line 3); Puliran (line 6) and Binwangan (line 7). Dewata (line 8) and Mdang (line 8) could be either personal names or toponyms.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Postma identified three of these toponyms, Binwangan, Pailah and Puliran, as Malayo-Polynesian (most likely Filipino) in origin,&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; and three other toponyms, Tundun, Dewata and Mdang, as Sanskrit in origin.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

After carefully considering possible interpretations of the text, including the possibility that Pailah and Puliran were located in the Laguna Lake region, Postma concluded that he was confident that Binwangan, Pailah, and Puliran:&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''“find their equivalents within the limited area of what is now known as Bulacan Province in the Philippines, [and that] the text of this same LCI can be considered to refer indeed to these places, already existing already under identical names in the tenth century.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== LCI place-names as settlements Bulacan ===
Postma emphasized&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;  that his interpretation of the LCI placenames being in Bulacan puts these named settlements on key locations on Central Luzon’s river systems, which he referred to as ''“waterhighways”'' which allowed ''“an effective (and often only) means of transportation and communication between the different settlements”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; as well as ''“offering the seafaring traders of China and Southeast Asia of early times an easy access to interior trading centers via these riverine communication-lines.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; He also noted that Central Luzon’s rivers  were ''“much deeper and certainly were more navigable than they are today.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

Postma’s assertions have been challenged a number of times, notably by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson. But these challenges have not been fully resolved by [[Scholarly peer review|Philippine historiographers’ process of peer review]].&lt;ref name="Tiongson20061111"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.bayangpinagpala.org/2006/11/puliran-in-laguna-copperplate.html |title=Puliran in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription: Laguna de Bay or Pulilan, Bulacan? |last=Tiongson, Jaime F.

=== LCI words affirmed as place-names ===
Postma asserted that he was fairly certain that four words in the LCI were place names, or toponyms: ''"Pailah (lines 4 and 6); Tundun (line 3); Puliran (line 6) and Binwangan (line 7)."''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

==== Tundun ====
Tundun, whose name Postma believed to be "Sanskrit in origin",&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; was referenced in line 3 of the LCI.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; It is the most easily recognizable of the toponyms identified by Postma in the LCI, and scholarly consensus&lt;ref name="Patanne1996"&gt;Patanñe,E.P. Philippines in the Sixth to Sixteenth Centuries. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page="134"}}&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"&gt;Abinales, Patricio N. and Donna J. Amoroso, State and Society in the Philippines. Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page="38"}} generally agrees with Postma’s original identification of the LCI’s Tundun as Tondo, the polity located on the northern seaside of the Pasig River delta, where the Pasig River empties into Manila Bay.

Postma left an avenue for an alternative interpretation open however, saying that Mdang and Tondo:&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; ''“because of their lingual consonants (n and d) that are of Sanskrit origin might originally be toponyms existing on the Island of Java.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

==== Pailah ====
Postma identified Pailah, whose name he believed to be Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin,&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; as a ''“locality with its own leader.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; It was referenced twice, in lines 4 and 6 of the LCI. Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be ''“the village of [[Paila]], in Barangay of San Lorenzo at the eastern part of the municipality of Norzagaray, with coordinates 14-54.5 &amp; 121-06.9.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

==== Puliran ====
Postma identified Puliran, whose name he believed to be Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin,&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; as a ''“locality with its own leader”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; referenced in line 6 of the LCI. Postma asserted that  Puliran was probably located in modern-day Bulacan, on the current site of ''“[[Pulilan]], along the Angat (pronounced: Anggat) River…north of Manila, (coordinates: 14-54.2 &amp; 120-50.8)”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

==== Binwangan ====
Postma believed that the place-name of Binwangan, referenced in line 7 of the LCI as a locality with its own leader,&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; was Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt; Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be ''“the village of [[Binwangan]], belonging to the municipality of Obando, situated at the mouth of the Bulacan River, with coordinates 14-43.2 &amp; 120-543.”''&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

=== LCI words believed to be possible place-names ===
Based on linguistic analysis, Postma concluded that the words Dewata and Mdang ''“could be either personal names or toponyms.”'' He noted that their names seemed to be Sanskrit in origin, but did not go into a deep discussion of where they might have been located, other than to say Mdang was already known as a place name in Indonesia.
Abinales and Amoroso (2005) note&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"/&gt; that the leaders of Dewata and Mdang (if these words are indeed to be accepted as toponyms) were not present for the transaction but were rather invoked as authorities in certifying the cancellation of the debt in question:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Jayadewa invokes the authority of the chief of Dewata, who in turn represents the chief of Medang.”''&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mdang ====
Postma’s paper proposing his translation and interpretation of the LCI mentions that his search of the Indonesian toponym listings developed by Damais and Darmosoetopo, as well as his consultation with the 14th Congress of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association (IPPA) in August 1990, determined that Mdang was the only (possible) toponym in the LCI which matched with known Indonesian place-names.&lt;ref name="Postma"/&gt;

Abinales and Amoroso (2005), citing Patanñe (1996) note that this seems to refer to ''"a temple complex in Java, where the kingdom of Mataram was a rival to Srivijaya."''&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"/&gt;

==== Dewata ====
Scholars after Postma, such as Patanñe (1996) and Abinales and Amoroso (2005)&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"/&gt; have come to identify the Dewata of the LCI as a settlement in or near ''“present-day Mt. Diwata, near Butuan”''&lt;ref name="JojoandDonnaAbinales2005"/&gt;

While it is clear in the text of the LCI that Jayadewa of Tondo is invoking the authority of the Chief of Dewata, the precise relationship between Dewata and Mdang is less clear.  E.P. Patanñe notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"This relationship is unclear but a possible explanation is that the chief of Dewata wanted it to be known that he had a royal connection in Java.”''&lt;ref name="Patanne1996"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other proposed interpretations of place-names ===
Postma’s assertions regarding the exact locations of ''Pailah'' and ''Puliran'' and ''Binwangan'' have been challenged by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson, who assert that the place names ''Pailah'' and ''Puliran'' are more likely to refer to places close to where the plate was found - in Lumban, Laguna - given that archeological findings in nearby Pila show the presence of an extensive settlement during precolonial times.&lt;ref name="Tiongson20061111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiongson20061129"/&gt;

According to Tiongson's interpretation: ''Pailah'' refers to [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]]; ''Puliran'' refers to Puliran, the old name of the territory that occupied the southeastern part of [[Laguna de Bay]] at the time; and ''Binwangan'' refers to modern day Barangay, Binawangan in [[Capalonga, Camarines Norte]].&lt;ref name="KimuellGabriel2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bagongkasaysayan.org/ebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3.Ang-Tundo_Kimuell-Gabriel_Marked.pdf |title= Ang Tundo sa Inskripsyon sa Binatbat na Tanso ng Laguna (900 MK.-1588) |last= Kimuell-Gabriel |first= Nancy A. |date= 2013-03-03 |website= www.bagongkasaysayan.org |publisher= Bahay Saliksikan ng Kasaysayan -- Bagong Kasaysayan (BAKAS), Inc. |access-date= 2017-07-07 |quote=}} '''[[Gray literature]]''' partly based on

==Significance==
The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, among other recent finds such as the [[Golden Tara]] of [[Butuan]] and 14th century pottery and gold jewellery in [[Cebu]], is highly important in revising the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|ancient Philippine history]], which was until then considered by some Western historians to be culturally isolated from the rest of Asia, as no evident pre-Hispanic written records were found at the time. Philippine historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] debunked these theories in 1968 with his ''Prehispanic Source materials for the Study of Philippine History'' which was subsequently published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= William Henry Scott |title= Prehispanic Source materials for the Study of Philippine History |ISBN=971-10-0226-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is a document demonstrative of pre-Hispanic literacy and culture, and is considered to be a [[national treasure]]. It is currently deposited at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Manila]].

==Cultural references==
{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation}}

The transliteration of the inscription shows heavy [[Sanskrit]], [[Kawi language|Old Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] linguistic influences.&lt;ref name="mts"/&gt; Among the observations made by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] in the 16th century [[Boxer Codex]] was that [[Old Malay]] had currency amongst classical period Filipinos as a ''[[lingua franca]]''.

The use of Hindu references in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription could also suggest that the author or authors of the inscription were adherents of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="mts"/&gt; The [[Golden Tara]] statue, an ancient artifact discovered in [[Butuan]], [[Agusan del Norte]], dates from the same period and strongly suggests the presence of [[Hinduism in the Philippines|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism in the Philippines|Buddhist]] beliefs prior to the introduction (and subsequent [[Religion in the Philippines|subscription]]) to [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] amongst [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25915">There are currently about 2,300 mosques in France with a further 200 to 250 planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150405-france-double-number-mosques-islam|title=France - Muslim leader calls for doubling number of mosques in France|work=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to say when the first mosque in France was built. There is archaeological evidence of an eighth-century mosque in [[Narbonne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam Outside the Arab World'', David Westerlund, Ingvar Svanberg, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, page 342&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Mosque of Paris]] opened in 1926 is regarded as one of the oldest and largest mosque in France.

The '''Mita Congregation''' ({{lang-es|Congregación Mita}}) is a Christian denomination headquartered in [[Puerto Rico]]. The congregation has chapters only in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Spain]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, Mita's Congregation opened a new house of worship in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with a seating capacity of 6,500.

== History ==

The Mita Congregation believe that a woman named Mita, born [[Juanita García Peraza]], was chosen by [[God]] like all the prophets were chosen on earth and she became the body, the living incarnation of the [[Holy Spirit]] in its third manifestation. First, as the omnipotent father in [[Jehovah]], then in his beloved son [[Jesus Christ]] and in its third manifestation with a new name revealed Mita, name of the Holy Spirit of God.

According to their beliefs, the Holy Spirit once acted through Mita and anointed Teófilo Vargas Seín (born October 23, 1921) as the first prophet of God in what they call the new manifestation of God, the third manifestation, the Holy Trinity, the father, son and the Holy Spirit. According to the church Teófilo Vargas was renamed Aarón and before Juanita García Peraza died in 1970, she called Aarón and told him to take care of his church and he is today the spiritual leader of the Mita's Congregation. The congregation was formed in [[Arecibo]] in 1940, but in 1947 the church was relocated to Hato Rey.

==Doctrine==

The doctrine of the church is based on the original [[Reina-Valera]] Spanish translation of the Bible. They are [[Trinity|trinitarian]], believing in Jehovah, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit (Mita), who they believe "is on earth, that His new name is Mita and that, through Aarón, He guides His Church and guides it through truth and justice towards salvation."&lt;ref name=doctrinalprofile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congregacionmita.org|title=Doctrinal Profile|author=Congregación Mita |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarón is considered God's prophet for today, and through him God's message of cleansing, freedom from sin, and unity is brought to the world. ''Mita en Aarón'' (Mita in Aaron) is a popular slogan of the Mita Congregation, who believe that the Holy Ghost (Mita) lives in Aaron.

The church has the biggest marching band in Puerto Rico.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Harps, cords and the chorus emphasize love, liberty, and unity. The church counsel is for a clean life following God's [[Ten Commandments]]. At official activities, members dress in all white as a symbol of purity and cleanliness of their redeemed souls.

'''Penglai''' (Traditional Chinese: 蓬萊仙島 (''lit. Penglai Immortal&lt;ref&gt;The character 仙 literally refers to a Daoist holy person/immortal or a mythological being, but is often used to describe places which exhibit the qualities of these beings.&lt;/ref&gt; Island))'' is a legendary land of [[Chinese mythology]]. It is known in [[Japanese mythology]] as '''Hōrai'''.&lt;ref name="McCullough"&gt;[[McCullough, Helen]]. ''Classical Japanese Prose'', p. 570. Stanford Univ. Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8047-1960-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'', the mountain is said to be on an island in the eastern end of [[Bohai Sea]], along with four other islands where the immortals lived, called Fāngzhàng ({{lang|zh|方丈}}), Yíngzhōu ({{lang|zh|瀛州}}), Dàiyú ({{lang|zh|岱輿}}), and Yuánjiāo ({{lang|zh|員嬌}}).

Various theories have been offered over the years as to the "real" location of these places, including [[Japan]], Nam-Hae (南海), Geo-Je (巨濟), [[Jejudo]] (濟州島) south of the [[Korean Peninsula]], and [[Taiwan]]. [[Penglai, Shandong]] exists, but its claimed connection is as the site of departures for those leaving for the island rather than the island itself.

==In Chinese mythology==
In Chinese mythology, the mountain is often said to be the base for the [[Eight Immortals]], or at least where they travel to have a banquet, as well as the magician [[Anqi Sheng]]. Supposedly, everything on the mountain seems white, while its palaces are made from [[gold]] and [[platinum]], and jewelry grows on trees.

There is no pain and no winter; there are rice bowls and wine glasses that never become empty no matter how much people eat or drink from them; and there are magical fruits growing in Penglai that can heal any disease, grant [[eternal youth]], and even raise the dead.

Historically, [[Qin Shi Huang]], in search of the [[elixir of life]], made several attempts to find the island where the mountain is located, to no avail. Legends tell that [[Xu Fu]], one servant sent to find the island, found Japan instead, and named [[Mount Fuji]] as Penglai.

==In Japanese mythology==
The presentation of Mt. Hōrai in [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'', is somewhat different from the earlier idyllic Chinese myth. This version, which does not truly represent the Japanese views of Horai in the Meiji and preceding Tokugawa periods,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} rejects much of the fantastic and magical properties of Hōrai. In this version of the myth, Hōrai is not free from sorrow or death, and the winters are bitterly cold. Hearn's conception of Hōrai holds that there are no magical fruits that cure disease, grant eternal youth or raise the dead, and no rice bowls or wine glasses that never become empty.

Hearn's incarnation of the myth of Hōrai focuses more on the atmosphere of the place, which is said to be made up not of air but of "quintillions of quintillions" of souls. Breathing in these souls is said to grant one all of the perceptions and knowledge of these ancient souls. The Japanese version also holds that the people of Hōrai are small fairies, and they have no knowledge of great evil, and so their hearts never grow old.

In the ''[[Kwaidan]]'', there is some indication that the Japanese hold such a place to be merely a fantasy. It is pointed out that "Hōrai is also called Shinkiro, which signifies Mirage—the Vision of the Intangible".

Yet uses of Mount Hōrai in Japanese literature and art of the Tokugawa period (1615–1868) reveal a very different view than Hearn's Victorian-influenced interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The '''Mouride brotherhood''' ({{lang-wo|yoonu murit}}, {{lang-ar|الطريقة المريدية}} ''aṭ-Ṭarīqat al-Murīdiyyah'' or simply {{lang|ar|المريدية}}, ''al-Murīdiyyah'') is a large ''[[tariqa]]'' ([[Sufism|Sufi]] order) most prominent in [[Senegal]] and [[the Gambia]] with headquarters in the city of [[Touba, Senegal]], which is a [[holy city]] for the order. Adherents are called '''Mourides''', from the Arabic word ''[[murid|murīd]]'' (literally "one who desires"), a term used generally in Sufism to designate a disciple of a spiritual guide.The beliefs and practices of the Mourides constitute '''Mouridism'''. Mouride disciples call themselves ''taalibé'' in Wolof and must undergo a ritual of allegiance called ''njebbel'', as it is considered highly important to have a [[sheikh]] "spiritual guide" in order to become a Mouride. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=O'Brien|first=Donal Brian Cruise|title=The Mourides of Senegal: the political and economic organization of an Islamic brotherhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq11AAAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} The Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in [[Senegal]] by [[Amadou Bamba]]. The Mouride make up around 40 percent of the total population in Senegal. Their influence over everyday life can be seen throughout Senegal.

==History==

===Amadou Bamba===
[[Image:AhmaduBamba.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Amadou Bamba]]
The Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in [[Senegal]] by ''Shaykh'' Aḥmadu Bàmba Mbàkke, commonly known as Amadou Bamba (1850–1927). In [[Arabic]], he is known as Aḥmad ibn Muhammad ibn Habīb Allāh or by the nickname "Khadīmu r-Rasūl" ("Servant of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]]"). In Wolof he is called "Sëriñ Tuubaa" ("Holy Man of Touba). He was born in the village of [[Mbacké]] in [[Baol]], the son of a marabout from the [[Qadiriyya]], the oldest of the [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|Muslim brotherhoods]] in Senegal.

Amadou Bamba was a Muslim [[mysticism|mystic]] and ascetic ''[[marabout]]'', a spiritual leader who wrote tracts on [[meditation]], [[rituals]], work, and ''[[tafsir]]''. He is perhaps best known for his emphasis on work, and his disciples are known for their industriousness. Although he did not support the [[French West Africa|French conquest of West Africa]], he did not wage outright war on them, as several prominent [[Tijaniyyah|Tijani]] ''marabouts'' had done. He taught, instead, what he called the ''jihād al-akbar'' or "greater struggle," which fought not through weapons but through learning and fear of [[God]].

Bamba's followers call him a ''[[mujaddid]]'' (a "renewer of [[Islam]]"). Bamba's fame spread through his followers, and people joined him to receive the [[salvation]] that he promised. Salvation, he said, comes through submission to the ''marabout'' and hard work.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toubacincinnati.org/al-mouridya.php|title=Khadim Rassoul Foundation of North America|website=toubacincinnati.org|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one surviving photograph of Amadou Bamba, in which he wears a flowing white kaftan and his face is mostly covered by a scarf. This picture is venerated and reproduced in paintings on walls, buses, taxis, etc. all over modern-day Senegal.

===French colonial rule===
{{main|French West Africa}}
At the time of the foundation of the Mouride brotherhood in 1883, the French were in control of Senegal as well as most of [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]]. Although it had shared in the horrors of the [[History of West Africa#Jihad and colonization|pre-colonial slave trade]], French West Africa was managed relatively better than other African regions during the [[Scramble for Africa]] and ensuing [[colonialism|colonial era]]. Senegal enjoying small measures of self-rule in many areas. However, French rule still discouraged the development of local industry, preferring to force the exchange of raw materials for European finished goods, and a large number of taxation measures were instituted.

[[Image:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|left|260px|[[French West Africa]] around 1913.]]
At the end of the 19th century, French colonial authorities began to worry about the growing power of the Mouride brotherhood and its potential to resist French colonialism. Bamba, who had converted various kings and their followers, could probably have raised an army against the French had he wanted. Fearful of his power, the French sentenced Bamba to exile in [[Gabon]] (1895–1902) and later [[Mauritania]] (1903–1907). However, Bamba's exile fueled legends about his miraculous ability to survive torture, deprivation, and attempted executions, and thousands more flocked to his organization. For example, on the ship to Gabon, forbidden from praying, Bamba is said to have broken his leg-irons, leapt overboard into the ocean, and prayed on a prayer rug that miraculously appeared on the surface of the water. In addition, when the French put him in a furnace, he is said to have simply sat down and had tea with [[The Prophet Muhammad]]. In a den of hungry lions, it is said the lions slept beside him.

[[Image:Touba moschee.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[Great Mosque of Touba]], Senegal]]
By 1910, the French realized that Bamba was not waging war against them and was in fact quite cooperative. The Mouride doctrine of hard work served French economic interests, as addressed below. After [[World War I]], the Mouride brotherhood was allowed to grow and in 1926 Bamba began work on the great mosque at [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]] where he would be buried one year later.

==Structure==

===Leadership===
Amadou Bamba was buried in 1927 at the great mosque in Touba, the holy city of Mouridism and the heart of the Mouride movement. After his death Bamba has been succeeded by his descendants as [[Caliphate|hereditary leaders]] of the brotherhood with absolute authority over the followers. The ''caliph'' (leader) of the Mouride brotherhood is known as the ''Grand Marabout'' and has his seat in Touba. The caliphs up to Serigne Saliou Mbacké have all been sons of Bamba, starting with his oldest son:
* Serigne Mouhamadou Moustapha Mbacké (1927)
* Serigne Mouhamadou Fallilou Mbacké (1968)
* Serigne Abdoul Ahad Mbacké, (1988)
* Serigne Abdou Khadre Mbacké, (1989)
* Serigne Saliou Mbacké (1915-2007), caliph from 1990 until his death on December 28, 2007
* [[Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacké]], (1925–2010) first grandson of  Ahmadou Bamba to become caliph
* Serigne Sidi Al Moukhtar Mbacke, since July 1, 2010 until his death on January 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;"Décès de Cheikh Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacké," ''APS'', July 1st, 2010. {{cite web |url=http://aps.sn/aps.php?page=articles&amp;id_article=70149 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426040628/http://aps.sn/aps.php?page=articles&amp;id_article=70149 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Serigne Mountakha Mbacké, since January 10, 2018.

The ''Grand Marabout'' is a direct descendant of Amadou Bamba himself and is considered the spiritual leader of all Mourides. There is a descending hierarchy of lower-rank ''[[marabouts]]'', each with a regional following.

===Dahiras===
''Dahiras'' are urban associations of Mourides-based either on shared allegiances to a particular marabout or common geographical location, for example, a neighborhood or city-specific dahira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bava|first=Sophie|title=The Mouride Dahira: Between Marseille and Touba|journal=ISIM Newsletter|date=August 2001|pages=7|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17529/ISIM_8_The_Mouride_Dahira_between_Marseille_and_Touba.pdf;jsessionid=1D70597C3F726E8BF47DF6A7420D73D7?sequence=1|accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daaras===
''Daaras'' are ''madrassas'' or quranic schools. They were originally founded by the shayh, his descendants, or disciples to teach the Quran and the Khassida as well as cultivating the land. Hence they have grown to be associations of Mourides, generally based on shared allegiance to a particular ''marabout''.

===Sects===

====Baye Fall====
[[Image:Ibrahimafall.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Ibrahima Fall]]
{{see also|Ibrahima Fall}}
One famous disciple of Bamba, Ibrahima Fall, was known for his dedication to [[God in Islam|God]] and considered work as a form of adoration. Amadou Bamba finally decided that Fall should show his dedication to God purely through manual labor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Ibrahima Fall founded a sub-group of the Mouride brotherhood called the [[Baye Fall]] ({{lang-wo|Baay Faal}}), many of whom substitute hard labor and dedication to their marabout for the usual Muslim pieties like ''[[salah]]'' and ''[[sawm]]''.

Sheikh Ibrahima Fall was one of the first of Amadou Bamba's disciples and one of the most illustrious.&lt;ref name="Savishinsky"&gt;Savishinsky, J. N. (1994) The Baye Fall of Senegambia: Muslim Rastas in the Promised Land? Africa: Journal International African Institute, 64, 211-219&lt;/ref&gt; He catalysed the Mouride movement and led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride ''[[talibe]]s'' (disciples) and their guide, Amadou Bamba. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of ''Dieuf Dieul'', ("you reap what you sow").&lt;ref name="Origines"&gt;Les origines de Cheikh Ibra Fall (2000, December). Touba', Bimestriel Islamique d'Informations Générales. Retrieved May 25, 2007 from 
{{cite web |url=http://www.metissacana.sn/sites/touba/fall.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708042138/http://www.metissacana.sn/sites/touba/fall.html |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibra Fall helped Amadou Bamba to expand Mouridism, in particular with Fall's establishment of the Baye Fall movement. For this contribution, Serigne Fallou, the second ''Caliph'' (leader) after Amadou Bamba, named him "Lamp Fall" (the light of Mouridism).&lt;ref name="Fallou"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngom|first1=Fallou|title=Linguistic Resistance in the Murid Speech Community in Senegal|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|date=June 2002|volume=23|issue=3|pages=214–226|doi=10.1080/01434630208666466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ibrahima Fall earned the title {{lang|ar|باب المريدين}} ''Bab al-Murīdīna'', "Gate of the Mourides."

The members of the Baye Fall dress in colorful ragged clothes, wear their hair in [[dreadlocks]] which are called ''ndiange'' ("strong hair"), which they decorate usually with homemade beads, wire or string. They also carry clubs, and act as security guards in the annual ''[[Grand Magal of Touba|Grand Magal]]'' pilgrimages to Touba. Women usually are covered in draping coverings including their heads and occasionally are known to wear highly decorative handmade jewelry made from household or natural items. In modern times the hard labor is often replaced by members roaming the streets asking for financial donations for their ''marabout''. Several Baye Fall are talented musicians. A prominent member of the Baye Fall is the Senegalese Musician [[Cheikh Lô]].

==Beliefs==
=== The Three Pillars of Mouridism ===
Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba taught the Three Pillars of Mouridism:
* [[Islam]] by [[Fiqh]]
* [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] by The Six Articles of Faith
* [[Ihsan]] by [[Tasawwuf]] (Sufism)&lt;ref&gt;Sufi, Cheikh p: #&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a Mouride aspires to achieve Islam by following the basic recommendations of ''Shariat''. This includes (but is not limited to) performing individual obligations (''Fard Ayn'') such as prayer, ablution, fasting, pilgrimage and giving charity. A Mouride aspires to achieve ''Iman'' by the Six Articles of Faith: Belief in [[Allâh]], his [[Angels]], the [[Prophets]], the revealed Holy Books, the [[Day of Judgment]] and the Divine Decree. A Mouride aspires to achieve ''[[Ihsan]]'' by the path of ''[[Tasawwuf]]'' (Sufism) through taking initiation (''Bayat'') with a [[Sheikh]] of the ''[[Tariqat]]''.

=== The Mouride Triangle ===
Additionally to the Three Pillars of Mouridism, the Mourides follow what is called the Mouride Triangle:
* Love: Love for Allâh and his Cheikhs
* Service: Work for Allâh and service for humanity
* Knowledge: With Love and Work over time follows divine light of Allah and knowledge directly to the heart&lt;ref&gt;Sufi, Cheikh p: #&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewer of Islam (Mujaddid) ===
Amadou Bamba is considered a ''[[mujaddid]]'' (renewer of Islam) by his followers, citing a ''[[hadith]]'' that implies that God will send renewers of the faith every 100 years. The members of all the [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|Senegalese brotherhoods]] claim that their founders were such renewers. The Mouride beliefs are based on Quranic and Sufi traditions and influenced by the Qadiri and Tijani brotherhoods, as well as the works by the scholar [[al-Ghazali]]. Amadou Bamba is known to have written more than 1000 books in [[Classical Arabic]], all of which are based on the Quran and ''Hadith''. Ahmadou Bamba is known to have said "If it's not in the Qur'an or Hadith, it's not from me".&lt;ref&gt;Sufi, Cheikh p: #&lt;/ref&gt;
Mourides sometimes call their order the "Way of Imitation of the Prophet". Parents sometimes send their sons to live with the ''marabout'' as ''talibes'' rather than giving them a conventional education. These boys receive Islamic training and are instilled with the doctrine of hard work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Many Mourides consider the city of Touba as equally or even more important than Mecca. Pilgrims regularly come to Touba all year round, but the peak of the year is a mass pilgrimage called the Grand Màgal, which celebrates Bamba’s return from exile.&lt;ref name="Senegal Society and Culture Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Senegal Society and Culture Report|year=2010|publisher=World Trade Press|location=Petaluma, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

==Influence in Senegal==

===Political influence===
Senegalese politicians have courted the Mouride brotherhood since independence. Even before independence, French colonial administrators recognized that the Mouride brotherhood was well-respected among the Senegalese and partnered with them to promote political and social order. Traditional [[Wolof people|Wolof]] aristocrats had proven problematic as intermediaries for the colonial authorities, and they hoped that Mouride leaders would be more effective and legitimate.&lt;ref name=boone&gt;{{cite book|last=Boone|first=Catherine|title=Political Topographies of the African State|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=46–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Senegalese population was allowed to elect a deputy to the French Assembly during the 19th century, the Mouride brotherhood played a key role in shaping who that deputy was. This was the first instance of their role in politics.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Cruise|title=The Mourides of Senegal: The Political and Economic Organization of Islamic Brotherhood|year=1971|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} During the French colonial reign, the ''marabouts'' usually gave their support to politicians based upon their support of the brotherhood's leaders and interests.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} This successful partnership lead to future cooperation between the Senegalese government and the Mouride brotherhood.

After [[universal suffrage]] was given in 1956, Senegal saw a rapid increase in the number of voters, almost triple the number just 10 years prior. This swift increase meant more power for the marabout whose outreach spread largely over the rural and peasant communities, which now had the opportunity to vote.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} A loyal follower of the Mouride is ideologically required to follow his religious leaders instructions, if the follower decided to disregard his instructions, the follower is at risk of losing any material support that would have been given to him.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Because of the ''marabouts'' far reaching influence in Senegal, politicians made a considerable effort to attain the support from these religious leaders for their personal advancement.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} In order to attain their support in elections, bribes and material incentives were given to marabouts from political parties and potential candidates.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Many believed that no party could hope to attain political power if the marabouts were completely opposed to it, and any party who rose to power had to comply with the Marabout’s demands or lose their political support.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

While the political elite finds itself regularly in the position of working through the ''marabouts'', their ultimate goal is to function without them. ''Marabouts'' for their part seek to maintain and ensure that the state remains dependant on them for influential control over citizens.&lt;ref name=villalon&gt;{{cite book|last=Villalón|first=Leonardo|title=Islamic Society and State Power in Senegal|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Besides their influence over many rural and peasant communities, the religious leaders also have other means of maintaining political influence. One such mean is the power the religious leaders have as magicians.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} In exchange for political favors, these magicians give political leaders a powerful [[amulet]] which is thought to bring advancement for oneself or disaster for ones enemies.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} This power is believed in by many and is sought after by ministers, civil servants, and followers alike. Another aspect of influence that the religious leaders have is the material means to influence local leaders and politicians. The shaikh (religious leaders) can seek to buy the agreement through gifts and help to promote the career or threat to ruin the career of these local politicians and leaders.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

''Marabout'' very rarely themselves participate directly in the political process. What is more common is to see them exert their influence over their followers and use this in return to gain a larger presence in the Senegalese politics.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Such things as withholding seed from granaries, unless followers purchase party cards, is a way that some marabouts exert their influence in the region to attain votes.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Other marabout may actually seek out political office, but most prefer to use their influence as an intermediary of politics in Senegal.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

Although recently Mourides have become more involved in the highest level of politics. [[Abdoulaye Wade]] who is the immediate former president of Senegal is also a devout Mouride. The day after his election in 2000 Wade travelled to Touba to seek the blessing of the ''Grand Marabout'', [[Serigne Saliou Mbacké]].

===Economic influence===
[[Vigna subterranea|Groundnuts]] are the third largest export from Senegal after fish and phosphates.&lt;ref name=Koffigan&gt;{{cite web|last=Adigbli|first=Koffigan|title=Groundnut Production in Freefall|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49124|accessdate=6 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115015036/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49124|archivedate=15 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of groundnut crop which the Mourides produce has been estimated to range from one-third to three-quarters of Senegalese groundnut production, although others{{who|date=November 2015}} have now estimated it to equal around one-half of the national total of groundnuts produced.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} This partnership between the Brotherhood and the government stems from the French colonial administrators, who had viewed the production of groundnuts by the Mourides as a means of economic advantage through the increasing production of crops for export.&lt;ref name=boone /&gt;

[[Image:Touba (senegal) 2006.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Interior of the [[Touba, Senegal#Great Mosque|Great Mosque]]]]
Due to this high proportion of groundnut crop produced by the Mouride, the brotherhood has always seemed to have a large influence in the groundnut market and the economy.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Economic involvement is in fact encouraged by the religious leaders to their disciples through the use of ideology that places great value on the production labor which is performed in the service of God.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Thus the Mourides devoted themselves to prayer and unpaid agricultural labor in service to their religious leaders. They cultivated the marabout’s fields for a decade, and then returned all land profits earned from the groundnut production. After ten years of dedicated work, laborers then received a share of land (large estates were divided up among the laborers). They continued to turn a share of their agricultural output over to their spiritual guide, as groundnut production was the community’s only means of sustenance.&lt;ref name=boone /&gt;

The large share of the Mouride's control over the groundnut production has placed them in the center of the nation's economy.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} The government's economic planners in turn have kept the brotherhood in their minds when establishing policies about groundnut production.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Although the government places an importance on the Mouride cultivators, the disciples do not have efficient ways of cultivating groundnuts, and their techniques are often destructive to the land.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt; Rather than looking out for the best use of the land, the Mouride cultivators are more interested in a fast payback. The methods used by the marabout have led to a constant depletion of the forests in Senegal and have taken much of the nutrients out of the soil. Government agencies have made attempts to help the marabout become more efficient in groundnut production, such as providing incentives for the workers to slow down their production.&lt;ref name=obrien /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

Because of their emphasis on work, the Mouride brotherhood is economically well-established in parts of Africa, especially in Senegal and the Gambia. In Senegal, the brotherhood controls significant sections of the nation's [[economy]], for example the [[transportation]] sector and the peanut plantations. Ordinary followers donate part of their income to the Mouridiya.

===Cultural influence===
{{further|Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|Islam in Senegal}}
Islam is central to the political sociology of Senegal: the religious elite carry great weight in national politics; political discourse is replete with references and appeals to Islam. There is virtually no opposition to the principle of the secular state, socio-political cleavages based on religion, whether between Muslim and non-Muslim or between Sufi orders, are also virtually non-existent.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Within Muslim discourse we find constant reference to such concepts as Islamic government, Islamic economics, or Islamic social order. The essential Islamic core lies in the shared belief in the fundamental unity of the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} The sense of belonging to a larger community, felt by many Muslims, is reinforced by the common use of Arabic as the language of prayer and religious learning.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

Islam is a powerful mobilization instrument and provides the rhetoric for the formulation of ideological movements, and serves as a force for mobilizing people in the pursuit of goals defined by those movements.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} The role of local Islamic social structures, the nature of leadership and the relations between leaders and followers, the nature and sources of power and authority and the limits and constraints of the economy are all factors, which mediate and direct the impact of Islam on Politics.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} Senegalese elites have not found appeals to ethnic solidarity a productive means of building a mass following. Common religious affiliation has played a role in defusing the potential for tensions that arise from other social cleavages. There however remains a potential for ethnic and caste divides to enter the Senegalese socio-political organization.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

The Senegalese have a mystical aspect to Islam, much like other Sufism brotherhoods. In Senegal, Islamic practice usually requires membership in religious brotherhoods that are dedicated to the marabouts of these groups. Marabouts are believed to be the mediators between Allah and the people. The people seek the help of marabouts for protection from the evil spirits, to improve one’s status (in terms of career, love or relationship, finances etc.), to obtain a cure or remedy for sickness, or even to curse an enemy. Marabouts are believed to have the ability to deal with the spirit world and seek the spirits’ help in things impossible for humans. The spirits’ help is sought since they are thought to be a source of much ''baraka'' "blessings, divine grace".&lt;ref name="Senegal Society and Culture Report"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

The marabouts of the Mouride Brotherhood devote less time to study and teaching than other brotherhoods. They devote most of their time to ordering their disciples’ work and making amulets for their disciples' work and making amulets for their followers. Devout Mourides’ homes and workplaces are covered with pictures and sayings of their marabout, and they wear numerous amulets prepared by them. These acts are believed to bring them a better life and solve their problems as well. Even taxi and bus drivers fill their vehicles with stickers, paintings and photos of the marabouts of their particular brotherhoods.&lt;ref name="Senegal Society and Culture Report"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

The marabout-talibe relationship in Senegal is essentially a relationship of personal dependence. It can be a charismatic or a clientelistic relationship. In a charismatic relationship demonstrations of devotion and abnegation towards the marabouts can only explained because their talibes see them as intercessors or even intermediaries with god. This charismatic relationship is reinforced and complemented by a parallel clientelistic relationship between marabout and follower. The results is that marabouts are expected to provide certain material benefits to their follower in addition to the spiritual ones.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

This patronage function has been important in the distribution of land, especially during periods of expanding peanut cultivation. Mouride social organization was developed in the context of the expanding peanut economy and its unique formulation was adapted to the economic imperatives of that context. The most distinctive institutional expression of Mouride agro-religious innovation is the daara, an agricultural community of young men in the service of a marabout. These collective farms were largely responsible for the expansion of peanut cultivation.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}} A Mouride peasant may submit to a marabout’s organization of agricultural work because it is the best option available to him, independently of the ideology which supports it.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

In contrast to a vision of masses blindly manipulated by a religious elite, the ties of talibes to their marabouts are frequently far more contingent and tenuous than assumed. As a result, marabouts confront the problem of recruiting and retaining followers. People at times confront a choice of which marabout to follow, the level of attachment to that marabout, and the domains or situations in which to follow him. While there is a widespread belief in the marabout system in Senegal and a strong commitment to it, it is not necessarily accompanied by an absolute attachment to any one living marabout.&lt;ref name=villalon /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

===Influence outside Senegal===
The brotherhood has a sizable representation in certain large cities in Europe and the United States. Most of these cities with a large Senegalese [[Immigration|immigrant]] population have a ''Keur Serigne Touba'' (Residence of the Master of Touba), a seat for the community which accommodates meetings and prayers while also being used as a provisional residence for newcomers. In [[Paris]] and [[New York City]], a number of the Mouride followers are small street merchants. They often send money back to the brotherhood leaders in Touba.

In 2004 Senegalese musician [[Youssou N'Dour]] released his [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album|Grammy Award]] winning album ''[[Egypt (album)|Egypt]]'', which documents his Mouride beliefs and retells the story of Amadou Bamba and the Mouridiya.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Off the derech''' ('''OTD'''), from the Hebrew word {{transl|he|derech}} (meaning 'path'), is an expression used to describe someone who leaves an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community. The term applies to a broad range of ex-Orthodox Jews, including those who leave [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities, ultra-Orthodox or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities, and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] communities. At times, individuals who move from a stricter form of Orthodoxy to a more lenient form of Orthodoxy are considered "off the derech" by their original communities.

OTD is not a movement per se, as there are no leaders, established groups, single philosophy, or organized outreach. OTD individuals find their own paths in life, ranging in degrees of connection to Judaism or to spirituality, while some embrace other religions and some are secular and/or atheist.

There are three broad groups of those who have left Orthodoxy. There are the "kids at risk" – those people who behave badly, do drugs, engage in criminal activity, and do not keep [[halacha]]; those who are well-adjusted and have stopped keeping halacha; and those who still keep halacha, but do not share the beliefs of their previous form of Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Off the Derech|last=Margolese|first=Faranak|publisher=Devora Publishing Company|year=2005|isbn=|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term was originally derogatory, coined by Orthodox Jews to denote that someone had left what they considered to be the one true path. However, OTD individuals and groups have reclaimed the term and often use it to describe themselves, despite the previous negative connotations. Some use it simply as a convenient shorthand, while others use it in the sense of being off a narrow path and on a wider one. Some use ''OTD'' to cheekily mean '{{em|on}} the derech', arguing that they have found their own paths. Within the broad range of OTD individuals and groups, there is a difference of opinion on whether it is better to reclaim the term or to use a new one altogether. One alternative is ''XO'', a term coined by an OTD individual to signify 'ex-Orthodox' while also playing on [[Hugs and kisses|a term for 'love']].

Though people have left religious Judaism throughout history, the term is anachronistic if used to describe an individual who lived before the 20th century. The contemporary phenomenon of OTD shares some similarities with the [[Haskalah]] movement in its disaffection with traditional modes of religion, its secularization and interest in secular education, and in experimenting with a secular Jewish culture. Like Haskalah, its members tend to be secularists and religious [[Decentralization|decentralists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/stepping-off-the-path-and-redefining-faith.html?_r=0|title=Stepping off the Path and Redefining Faith|last1=Samuel|first1=Freedman|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for leaving ==
Nishma Research carried out a survey of OTD individuals in 2016, which revealed a widely-varied and complex set of reasons people leave, and the process in which they do so.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nishmaresearch.com/social-research.html|title=Social Research |publisher=Nishma Research|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dominant Orthodox perspective is that people leave because of ''ta'avos'', temptations, which they are too weak to resist. The Nishma study, as well as a study by [[Faranak Margolese]], found that not to be the case. Rather, "Most formerly observant Jews today seem to have left, not because the outside world pulled them in, but rather because the observant one pushed them out. They experienced Judaism as a source of pain ... so they did what was natural: run in the other direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Off the Derech|last=Margolese|first=Faranak|publisher=Devora Publishing Company|year=2005|isbn=|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies point to the social and emotional aspect of Orthodox Judaism, and individuals' feelings of being silenced, marginalized, or ignored within the rigid social structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/becoming-un-orthodox-9780199380503?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Becoming Un-Orthodox: Stories of Ex-Hasidic Jews|date=2014-12-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199380503|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional and intellectual factors in an individual's decision to continue practicing Orthodox Judaism or to leave cannot be separated. As Margolese writes, "Observance = Positive feelings + Belief + Ability to implement (in that order)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Off the Derech|last=Margolese|first=Faranak|publisher=Devora Publishing Company|year=2005|isbn=|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some selected reasons revealed by these studies:
* bad behavior in the community, especially from community leaders
* oppressive community norms
* experiencing religious observance as a condition for parents' or teachers' love or approval
* difficulty reconciling strict interpretations of Torah and Talmud with knowledge of natural sciences

== Processes of leaving ==
One study by Roni Berger found four milestones common in the narratives of study participants: 1) initial questioning; 2) growing doubts; 3) beginning to share selectively with a small group of trusted others; 4) revealing a new and altered identity.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Roni. [http://www.jewishjournalofsociology.org/index.php/jjs/article/download/83/79 "Leaving an Insular Community: The Case of Ultra Orthodox Jews."] ''Jewish Journal of Sociology 56'', no. 1/2 (2014): 75-98.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of [[religious disaffiliation]] is echoed by Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh (1988) in an article about ex-nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16356164|title=Falling from the faith : causes and consequences of religious apostasy|date=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|others=Bromley, David G.|isbn=0803931883|location=Newbury Park, Calif.|oclc=16356164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nuns, Ebuagh says the process is 1) first doubts; 2) seeking and weighing role alternatives; 3) a turning point; 4) establishing an ex-role identity.

Lynn Davidman's book acknowledges the often messy process of leaving, including a period of "passing" when individuals would move between two worlds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This period is characterized by confusion, doubts, depression, and defiance, but also by self-confidence and courage to leave the regimented world they grew up in and begin to live in another world.

== Traumatic effects of leaving ==
Individuals who leave Orthodox Judaism often face rejection from friends and family members. This knowledge often leads individuals who have doubts to first try to reconcile their doubts, in order to avoid the risk of losing family and friends. At this stage, individuals often experience anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Leaving any faith-based community has its traumatic effects, including the need to come to grips with losing a sense of reliance on a god, and reconciling one's self to the idea that one must stand on one's own two feet.&lt;ref&gt;Baier, K.E.M. The Meaning of Life; in Angeles, P. (1976). Critiques of God. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books. P. 318&lt;/ref&gt; OTD individuals also struggle with ideas ingrained about god's punishment, often leading to extreme feelings of guilt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Leaving a close-knit community where every member of the community is taken care of is often financially challenging as well.

The suicide rate among those who have left Orthodox Judaism is disproportionately high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/off-the-path-of-orthodoxy|title=Off the Path of Orthodoxy|last=Lavin|first=Talia|date=2015-07-31|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faigy Mayer's 2015 suicide was covered by many media outlets, which led to a spate of think-pieces about OTD suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/news/317900/the-brave-life-and-shocking-death-of-faigy-mayer/|title=Faigy Mayer's Brave Life and Shocking Death|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to communities ==
Individuals who leave Orthodox communities often have difficulty extricating themselves from the religious life while still maintaining contact with families, and they often have difficulty adjusting to the secular world after leaving the insularity of the Orthodox enclaves. Many individuals form groups of friends who get together for shabbat dinners and other practices with cultural significance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ewing|first=Heidi|title=One of Us|date=2017-10-20|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7214842/|last2=Grady|first2=Rachel|others=Etty, Chani Getter, Ari Hershkowitz|accessdate=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]] never leave the community despite losing their faith, and they are sometimes referred to as [[Reverse Marranos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fader|first1=Ayala|date=2014|title=Anthropology and History|journal=American Jewish History|volume=98|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1353/ajh.2014.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Introduction%3a+an+anthropological+approach+to+Jews+and+Judaism-a0358314512|title=Introduction: an anthropological approach to Jews and Judaism.|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; double-lifers,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or [[Orthopraxy#Judaism|Orthoprax Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/secretly-seduced-by-science-hasidic-atheists-lead-a-double-life|title=Secretly seduced by science, Hasidic atheists lead a double life – Batya Ungar-Sargon - Aeon Essays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to stay is often influenced by fear of being ostracized and having to rebuild community, or by fear of losing one's spouse and/or children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many OTD individuals become [[Activism|activists]] for various causes. Some examples: ZAAKAH works to prevent [[child sexual abuse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-hold-rally-on-internet-at-citi-field.html|title=Ultra-Orthodox Jews Rally to Discuss Risks of Internet|date=21 May 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hareiani.com/2017/06/27/why-we-protested-in-midwood-last-suday-zaakah/|title=Why We Protested In Midwood Last Sunday – ZAAKAH|date=2017-06-28|work=Some People Live More in 20 Years...|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[YAFFED]] advocates for basic secular education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yaffed.org/|title=Yaffed|work=Yaffed|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; among ultra-Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, and [[JQYouth|JQY]] focuses on [[LGBTQ+]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jqyouth.org/|title=Home Page - JQY|last=JQY|website=JQY|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many OTD individuals are also involved in "Unchained at Last",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unchainedatlast.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Unchained at Last which works to end child marriages and forced marriages.

== Orthodox communities' responses ==
The perspective of Orthodox individuals and leaders toward those who left range from considering them apostates to be shunned and derided, to wayward people in pain who need to be shown love.

[[Agudath Israel of America]], a leading ultra-Orthodox organization, addresses the topic of individuals leaving Orthodox Judaism often. At their national conventions in 2015 and 2016, they addressed the topic in panels titled "OTD: Why Do They Leave? And What Can We Do About It?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agudahconvention.org/videos-d/2015/1284037/|title=Agudath Israel of America Convention 2017|website=www.agudahconvention.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Diving Off The Derech The Emerging Adult At Risk Phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Israel|first=Agudath|title=Agudah Convention 2016 Diving Off The Derech The Emerging Adult At Risk Phenomenon|date=2016-11-22|url=https://vimeo.com/192635382|accessdate=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse breathing''' is a breathing technique associated with [[yoga]] and [[qigong]].  It consists of expanding the abdomen while breathing out through the nose, and then compressing it while inhaling via the mouth – the opposite of what an abdomen would do during natural, instinctive breathing.  Via this process there can be paid especially close attention to the act of breathing.  A pure, inner type of thought focus may thus arise.

The technique is also widely practised in a number of martial arts notably Chinese systems such as [[Baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], and other styles of [[Chinese Martial Arts|Kung Fu]].
The reverse breathing is believed to activate healing and protective Chi as the practitioner is consciously controlling the breath in a way opposite to normal breathing. By expanding the abdomen while delivering some technique (e.g. punch), the martial artists also protects the inner organs from any received counterattack.

== Murders ==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
The first victim of the gang was 28-year-old Linda Sutton, who was abducted on May 23, 1981. Ten days later, her body was found in a  field in Villa Park, Illinois. Her body had been mutilated and her left breast amputated.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost a year before the gang struck again. On May 15, 1982, they abducted Lorraine Borowski, just as she was about to open the realtor's office where she worked. Her body was discovered five months later, in a cemetery in Clarendon Hills.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 142"/&gt; On May 29, they abducted Shui Mak from Hanover Park, a village northwest of Villa Park. Her body was not found for four months. Two weeks after they abducted Mak, they picked up Angel York in their van, handcuffed her and slashed her breast before throwing her out of the van, still alive.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 142"/&gt; Unfortunately, York's description of her attackers failed to produce any leads.  

The gang did not strike again for two months.  On August 28, 1982, the body of Sandra Delaware was discovered on the bank of the [[Chicago River]]. She had been stabbed, strangled, and her left breast was amputated.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 142"/&gt; On September 8, 31-year-old Rose Davis was found in an alley, having suffered almost identical injuries as Delaware.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 142"/&gt;   A month later, the gang committed their last crime. Their victim, Beverley Washington, was found by a railroad track on December 6.&lt;ref name="truetv"&gt;{{cite web

She survived the attack, and was able to give descriptions of her attackers and the van they had used to abduct her.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 143"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men were suspects in the disappearance of Carole Pappas, wife of [[Chicago Cubs]] [[pitcher]], [[Milt Pappas]].  She disappeared on September 11, 1982.  Her body was recovered five years later, and the death was ruled an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-08-09/news/8702280450_1_mrs-pappas-carole-pappas-milt-pappas|title=Pappas Identified – No Sign Of Foul Play|last=Houston |first=Jack |publisher=articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1987-08-09 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and convictions==
When Gecht was first arrested, he had to be released because the police had little evidence connecting him to the crimes. After further investigation, though, the police discovered that in 1981, he had rented a room in a motel along with three friends – each with adjoining rooms. The hotel manager said that they had held loud parties and appeared to be involved in some kind of cult. Police then tracked down the other men, Edward Spreitzer and the Kokoraleis brothers.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 143"/&gt; When interrogated, Thomas Kokoraleis confessed that he and the others had taken women back to Gecht's place – what Gecht called a "satanic chapel."&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 143"/&gt; There they had raped and tortured the women, and amputated their breasts with a wire [[garrotte]]. Kokoraleis went on to say that they would eat parts of the severed breasts as kind of a sacrament, and that Gecht would masturbate into the breasts before putting them in a box. Kokoraleis claimed that he once saw 15 breasts in the box.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 143"/&gt;

The Kokoraleis brothers and Spreitzer confessed to their crimes, but Gecht protested his innocence. After a series of trials, Thomas Kokoraleis was convicted of murder but only sentenced to life imprisonment as his reward for his initial confession. Since then his life sentence has been commuted and he was scheduled to be released on September 29, 2017, but his parole was denied by Illinois officials. His current release date is September 30, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BABWIN|first1=DON|title=Illinois officials deny release for parole-eligible killer|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/29/illinois-officials-deny-release-for-parole-eligible-killer.html|accessdate=30 September 2017|work=Associated Press|agency=Fox News|publisher=FOX News Network, LLC.|date=30 September 2017|location=CHICAGO, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently located in the Illinois River Correctional Center.&lt;ref name="truetv" /&gt; Gecht is serving 120 years in the Menard Correctional Center for the attempted murder and rape of Beverly Washington and will be eligible for parole in 2022. Andrew Kokoraleis was sentenced to death and was executed by lethal injection on March 16, 1999.&lt;ref name="hri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/mpa/1999/99-03-17.mpa.html |title=Greek-American Executed in Illinois for 1982 Murder |work=Macedonian Press Agency |publisher=Hellenic Resources Network |date=1999-03-17 |accessdate=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Spreitzer was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted in [[George H. Ryan]]'s last-minute commutation of all death sentences in Illinois in 2003.  Incidentally, Andrew Kokoraleis' was Governor Ryan's only execution, just over two months into his administration.  Kokoraleis was also the last inmate executed in Illinois, almost 12 years before [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] signed legislation to abolish the death penalty on March 9, 2011, and commuted 15 death sentences to life imprisonment without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2011/03/quinn-signs-death-penalty-ban-commutes-15-death-row-sentences-to-life.html |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Quinn signs death penalty ban, commutes 15 death row sentences to life |last=Long |first=Ray |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kokoraleis brothers were raised [[Greek Orthodox]]. The Orthodox Church attempted unsuccessfully to keep Andrew Kokoraleis from being executed. Dimitrios Kantzavelos, at that time a chancellor (later a bishop) of the [[Greek Orthodox Diocese of Chicago]], became an anti-death-penalty activist as a result of the execution, and helped lobby in favor of ending the death penalty in the state.&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ocl.org/?id=17758|title=Last Person to Receive Illinois Death Penalty Was Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cathedral"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-15/news/9903150092_1_death-row-executions-andrew-kokoraleis|title=Religious Leaders Call For Halt To Executions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Magid grew up as a non-observant Jew in New York when, at the age of 20, he became interested in learning more about Judaism. He became involved with the [[Haredi]] movement and studied [[Modern Orthodoxy]], but after several years he "...abandoned Orthodoxy more generally yet remained fascinated by, and deeply invested in, the complex nexus of Judaism and the American counter-culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Radical Banjo: About Shaul |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318003356/http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |archivedate=March 18, 2015 |url=http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often quoted on such issues in the popular press; for instance, he recently discussed [[Jerry Garcia]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] in relation to Judaism, speaking from the perspective of "an ordained rabbi and a professor of Jewish and religious studies at Indiana University who was also present for the Dead’s legendary performance on the grounds of Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey on Sept. 3, 1977."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rosen |first=Armin |date=August 1, 2017 |title=Happy Birthday, Jerry Garcia.

The '''Soulmother of Küssnacht''' (died 1577) was a Swiss [[Mediumship|medium]] and an alleged [[witch]] in the city of [[Küssnacht]] in the canton of [[Luzern]] in [[Switzerland]].

In 1573 the priests of Luzern sent a formal complaint to the bishop of [[Konstanz]] about the great superstitions and beliefs in wise women, the occult and such. They pointed out one of these occultists, the very center of all superstition they disliked: a woman known as "The Soulmother" or "The mother of souls" in Küssnacht. Her case is a known example of a witch trial toward a medium.

== Activity as a medium ==

This woman, whose real name is not known, had for a period of thirteen years, since 1560, had a lucrative business as a medium. It is said that when someone died the mourners ran to the soulmother, who had visions and could speak to the dead and tell the mourners how to set the dead to rest. Through the spirits with whom she spoke she received news from the other world about what the customers asked her about and then recommended what they should do. When the customers arrived, she could tell them what they wanted before they had the time to state their business, and then she consulted the spirits during the following nights, while the clients stayed the night at the boarding-house of her companion, Verena Lifibach.

When she summoned a spirit, she measured the windows and the doors with thread, holy water and palms were placed out, if it was Saturday, a circle was drawn out, and then with fifteen words "out of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ", the spirit was summoned. According to her assistant Riss, the good spirits were white, the evil ones yellow. 

The Soulmother received visitors every day and had a very lucrative business. Her reputation had been damaged lately during a consultation when she claimed she saw a missing man as dead, after which he returned alive to his home six months later.

== Witch trial ==

The bishop of Konstanz contacted the governments of Luzern and [[Schwyz]], and she was put before the council of Schwyz for her "non Christian fantasies". The court first thought the accusations were slander. But after having questioned her, they dealt swiftly with her. She was [[torture]]d to confess to witchcraft. Although she tried to claim that she was not as dangerous as a known alleged witch, the so-called [[Die Sagerin]], she was judged guilty. She was [[Death by burning|burned alive at the stake]] in November 1577. 

Verena Liefbach was banished, and assistant Riss, who seems to have been released, was arrested again a couple of years later accused of claiming to be able to tell the cause of a miscarriage or stillbirth by burning the hair of the dead infant in the light of a candle: if it was human, the hair turned blue when it burned, if it was a spirit, the hair turned black.

Within [[Christianity|Christian]] communities, a '''spiritual attack''' is a perceived use of supernatural powers by the [[Devil]] to discourage the targeted Christian from their belief in [[God]].
Such attacks can come in many forms, all of which can have a lasting, even permanent and detrimental effect on the recipient's religious life. Spiritual attacks can include possession, fear of holy objects, such as bibles or other holy books, discouragement, and temptation.

==History==

In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', co-founder Malcolm Jarry stated that the idea of starting a Satanic [[faith-based organization]] was first conceived as one "that met all the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s criteria for receiving funds, but was repugnant to them". The idea was inspired by then–president [[George W. Bush]]'s formation of [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships]], for which he thought something should be done to counter it.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The Satanic Temple was founded in 2012, and began public demonstrations in 2013.&lt;ref name="MSNBC1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bashir: Satanists hail Florida Gov. Rick Scott |url=https://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/watch/bashir-satanists-hail-florida-gov-rick-scott-14650947887 |website=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 14, 2013 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esquire1"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Satanic Temple describes its mission as follows:
{{quote|The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will. Politically aware, Civic-minded Satanists and allies in The Satanic Temple have publicly opposed The [[Westboro Baptist Church]], advocated on behalf of children in public school to abolish [[corporal punishment]],  applied for equal representation where religious monuments are placed on public property, provided religious exemption and legal protection against laws that unscientifically restrict women's reproductive autonomy, exposed fraudulent harmful pseudo-scientific practitioners and claims in mental health care, and applied to hold clubs along side other religious after school clubs in schools besieged by [[proselytizing]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us |website=The Satanic Temple |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tenets===
The Satanic Temple has seven fundamental tenets:
{{quote|
# One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.
# The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.
# One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone.
# The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own.
# Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs.
# People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and resolve any harm that may have been caused.
# Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tenets |url=https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets |website=The Satanic Temple |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Valerie Tarico of [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] wrote that the tenets were egalitarian and "truer to the words of [[Jesus]] than most Christians," referring to the tenets as expressing the primacy of compassion and empathy and conducive to a path to [[equanimity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2015/11/28/the_greatest_trick_the_satanists_ever_pulled_they_may_be_truer_to_the_words_of_jesus_than_most_christians_partner/ |title=The greatest trick the satanists ever pulled: They may be truer to the words of Jesus than most Christians |first=Valerie |last=Tarico |website=Salon |date=November 28, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was echoed in an article for ''[[Patheos]],'' wherein editor Michael Stone called the tenets "morality superior to [the] [[Ten Commandments]]," referring to them as "a more moral, and more optimistic stance, emphasizing positive, pro-social values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2016/01/satanic-temples-seven-tenants-are-morally-superior-to-ten-commandments/ |title=Satanic Temple's Seven Tenets Are Morally Superior To Ten Commandments |date=January 22, 2016 |website=Patheos.com |first=Michael |last=Stone |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
[[File:LucienGreavesSASHAcon2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lucien Greaves]], spokesperson for The Satanic Temple, at SASHAcon, March 2016]]
Individual chapters hold gatherings with rituals and activities designed to highlight and push back against the right-wing religious establishment and archaic traditions and norms. For example, one group in Detroit held a gathering that included [[dance music]], a porn room, "surprisingly good hors d'oeuvres", and "a statue that's either a penis and testicles or a woman gazing into a mirror, depending on your point of view", and a wine ceremony involving three naked participants.&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-the-satanic-temple-save-america |title=Can the Satanic Temple Save America? |date=February 17, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2018 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |last=Kaffer |first=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Satanic Temple has taken part in several public activities that have been the focus of public scrutiny.

===Grey Faction===
The Grey Faction is a project of The Satanic Temple with the goal of exposing malpractice and pseudoscience associated with [[Satanic ritual abuse]] conspiracy theories. The Grey Faction protests medical conferences, initiates legal action, and petitions medical boards. The faction has protested conferences held by the [[International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation]], which advocates for the discredited practice of [[recovered-memory therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Malcolm |title=Satan Has No Interest in Molesting Your Kids |url=https://psmag.com/news/satan-has-no-interest-in-molesting-your-kids |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=Pacific Standard |date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nguyen |first=Gary |title=How Science Created A Panic About Satanic Cults |url=https://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/science-created-panic-satanic-cults |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=World Religion News |date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Laycock |first=Joseph |title=Satanic Temple Protests Pseudoscientific Therapies for Satanic Abuse and Witchcraft |url=http://religiondispatches.org/satanic-temple-protests-pseudoscientific-therapies-for-satanic-abuse-and-witchcraft/ |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=Religion Dispatches |date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also petitioned for investigation into the killing by Gigi Jordan of her child, which was connected to the discredited practice of [[facilitated communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saint Thomas |first=Sophie |title=Satanists Call for Investigation into 'Satanic Panic' Killing of 8-Year-Old Boy |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/d7am3a/satanists-call-for-investigation-into-satanic-panic-killing-of-8-year-old-boy |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=Broadly |date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shewan |first=Dan |title=Conviction of Things Not Seen: The Uniquely American Myth of Satanic Cults |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/make-a-cross-with-your-fingers-its-the-satanic-panic |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=Pacific Standard |date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer in schools===
The organization first gained media attention in January 2013 after a group of Satanists assembled at the [[Florida State Capitol]] to show their approval over a bill [[Rick Scott|Governor Rick Scott]] signed into law the prior year, Senate Bill 98, which allowed student-led prayer at school assemblies.&lt;ref name="Trolling" /&gt; The group further stated that as the bill did not specify a religion, the prayers could be led by a student from any religion—including Satanism. The TST members announced they "were coming out to say how happy we were because now our Satanic children could pray to Satan in school."&lt;ref name="MSNBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esquire1"/&gt;

===“Adopt-a-highway” campaign===
One of the projects launched by The Satanic Temple was an attempt to raise enough money to "adopt-a-highway" in New York City. The adopt-a-highway program would have involved the group to maintain and beautify part of the public highway for up to two years. Their goal was to raise awareness about religious diversity. The group stated that “The campaign will do more than keep our highways clean. It will help send a clear message to the world reaffirming American Religious Plurality”. The group raised just over $2,000 between June 10 and August 15, 2013; short of their goal of $15,000. If their goal had been reached, the [[New York State Department of Transportation|New York Department of Transportation]] would have approved the plan, and the funds would have been put toward the campaign. In the event that the department did not approve the project, the funds were to support contesting that decision. The organization offered different incentive levels for donations, ranging from ten dollars, for which the donor would receive a button, to ten thousand dollars, for which the donor would receive a full “Membership Package,” including the ability to choose the location of and to participate in the next Pink Mass that The Satanic Temple performed.

===Pink Mass===
In July 2013, The Satanic Temple held a "Pink Mass" over the grave of Catherine Johnston, the mother of Westboro Baptist Church founder [[Fred Phelps]].&lt;ref name="GayForever"&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple Makes Deceased Westboro Baptists "Gay Forever" In Pink Mass Ceremony |url=https://www.queerty.com/satanic-temple-makes-deceased-westboro-baptists-gay-forever-in-pink-mass-ceremony-20130720 |first=Matthew |last=Tharrett |website=Queerty |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass was held after the Westboro Baptist Church announced their intention to picket the funerals of the victims of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple Turns Westboro Baptist Church Founder's Mom Gay, 'Pink Mass' Performed On Catherine Idalette Johnston [PHOTO] |url=https://www.ibtimes.com/satanic-temple-turns-westboro-baptist-church-founders-mom-gay-pink-mass-performed-catherine-idalette |first=Zoe |last=Mintz |website=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queerty.com suggested they had based the idea of the mass on similar activities held by factions of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], where they would perform [[Baptism for the dead|proxy baptisms]].&lt;ref name="GayForever" /&gt; The Pink Mass was officiated by Greaves and consisted of two gay men kissing over Johnston's grave while Greaves placed his genitals on the tombstone and  chanted an incantation intended to change the deceased's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More Photos of Fred Phelps' Moms Gravesite |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/28321/More-Photos-of-Fred-Phelps-Moms-Gravesite |website=The Gauntlet |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warrant"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arrest Warrants Issued For Satanists That Performed Ritual At Westboro Gravesite |url=https://www.queerty.com/arrest-warrants-issued-for-satanists-that-performed-ritual-at-westboro-gravesite-20130725 |website=[[Queerty]] |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A misdemeanor charge was issued against Greaves and he was told that if he returned to [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]], Mississippi (where Johnston's grave is located), he would be arrested.&lt;ref name="Warrant" /&gt; Shortly before Phelps's death on March 19, 2014, The Satanic Temple expressed interest in holding a similar ceremony for the church founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NY Satanic Temple Wants to Posthumously Make Fred Phelps Gay |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/ny-satanic-temple-wants-to-posthumously-make-fred-phelps-gay/ |first=Josh |last=Feldman |date=March 18, 2014 |website=[[Mediaite]] |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Group Plans to Turn Westboro Baptist Church Founder Gay in the Afterlife |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/satanic-group-plans-to-turn-westboro-baptist-church-founder-gay-in-the-afterlife-116382/ |website=Christian Post |first=Michael |last=Gryboski |date=March 19, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, a [[black mass]] was scheduled to be held by The Satanic Temple at the [[Harvard University]] campus, sponsored by the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club, but had to be relocated off campus due to significant opposition by [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]] and school administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/response-organizers-black-mass/ |title=A Response from the Organizers of the Black Mass |work=[[Harvard Political Review]] |date=May 11, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/12/cardinal-sean-malley-expresses-disappointment-harvard-decision-allow-black-mass-campus/tUjYx2817C65LAHousRIeP/story.html |title=Amid outcry, black mass at Harvard is called off |first1=Travis |last1=Andersen |first2=Derek J. |last2=Anderson |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=May 13, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/12/black-mass-relocated-controversy/ |title=Even after Harvard Group Drops Sponsorship, Black Mass Takes Place at Hong Kong |first1=Theodore R. |last1=Delwiche |first2=Alexander H. |last2=Patel |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protect Children Project===
The Protect Children Project is an initiative launched by The Satanic Temple in the spring of 2014. The project's aims are stated to offer "[[First Amendment]] protection to support children who may be at risk for being subjected to mental or physical abuse in school by teachers and administrators through the use of [[solitary confinement]], restraints, and corporal punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protect Children Project |url=https://protectchildrenproject.com/ |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protect Children Project's website asked participants to print out pre-written letters to send to their respective school boards on a day designated as "Protect Children Day" as a form of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Temple, Now Wooing Kids and Moms |url=https://www.vocativ.com/culture/religion/satanic-temple-now-wooing-kids-moms/ |website=[[Vocativ]] |access-date=November 29, 2018 |first=Emily |last=Levy |date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple launches school campaign to "protect" children and permit them to pray to Satan |first=Brownie |last=Marie |date=April 11, 2014 |url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/satanic-temple-launches-school-campaign-protect-children-permit-pray-satan/36749.htm |website=[[Christian Today]] |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, The Satanic Temple launched an anti-spanking campaign against corporal punishment in schools, as part of the Protect Children Project.

===Planned Parenthood protests===
On August 22, 2015 the Detroit chapter of The Satanic Temple held a [[counter-protest]] outside of a [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] [[Planned Parenthood]] location in response to anti-abortionist groups that were planning to protest Planned Parenthood on that same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Temple countered Planned Parenthood protests with some guerrilla theatre |url=https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2015/08/24/the-satanic-temple-countered-the-planned-parenthood-national-day-of-protest-with-some-guerrilla-theatre |website=[[Detroit Metro Times]] |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=August 24, 2015 |first=Lee |last=DeVito}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the protest the Temple held a [[guerrilla theatre]] performance that included two men dressed as clergy pouring milk on kneeling actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanists drench women with milk for Planned Parenthood counter-protest |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/satanists-drench-women-with-milk-for-planned-parenthood-counter-protest |website=[[Washington Examiner]] |first=Barbara |last=Boland |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first protest of this type that the Temple had held in support of the organization, as they had previously held a 2013 protest where they brought children to the [[Texas State Capitol]] who chanted "Fuck You" and "Hail Satan", while holding signs reading "Stay Out Of My Mommy's Vagina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planned Parenthood Supporters: Satanists Drench Women in 'Breast' Milk To Stand Against 'Forced Motherhood' (VIDEO) |url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/123118/20150826/planned-parenthood-satanists-drench-women-breast-milk-stand-against-forced.htm |website=Headlines &amp; Global News |date=August 26, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2016, members of the Detroit chapter of the Temple counter protested the Citizens for a Pro-Life Society's protest of Planned Parenthood. Temple members dressed in bondage [[fetish clothing]], wearing baby masks and diapers while engaging in [[flagellation]]. The Temple said that the reason for the protest was to "expose the anti-choice protest as an act of fetal [[idolatry]], highlighting the fetishization and abstraction of the 'baby.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2016/04/23/the-satanic-temple-plans-to-interrupt-some-planned-parenthood-in-classic-satanic-temple-fashion |title=The Satanic Temple will interrupt Planned Parenthood protests in classic Satanic Temple fashion |first=Alysa |last=Zavala-Offman |website=Detroit Metro Times |date=April 23, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple's Los Angeles Chapter has also protested the [[canonization]] of [[Junípero Serra]] by [[Pope Francis]] and in October 2015 they held a ceremony where they "demonized" the [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nice try, Pope Francis, but to many, Junipero Serra is no saint |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/11/4/1442738/-Nice-try-Pope-Francis-but-to-many-Junipero-Serra-is-no-saint |website=[[Daily Kos]] |date=November 4, 2015 |first=Samuel |last=Vargo |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that Serra helped enslave thousands of Native Americans and that he "also led The [[Spanish Inquisition]] in his territories, trying residents of the Missions for the crimes of sorcery, witchcraft and devil worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Temple Is 'Demonizing' St. Junipero Serra Next Week|url = http://laist.com/2015/10/06/satanic_temple_vs_junipero_serra.php |website=[[LAist]] |access-date=November 29, 2018 |first=Juliet Bennett |last=Rylah |date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pentagram Ritual ===
On June 6, 2016, the Temple performed a Pentagram Ritual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.laweekly.com/news/satanists-plan-to-celebrate-6-6-16-in-la-6963630 |title=Satanists Plan to Celebrate 6/6/16 in L.A. |last=Romero |first=Dennis |date=May 26, 2016 |newspaper=L.A.

=== After School Satan ===
{{Main article|After School Satan}}

After School Satan is an [[After-school activity|after school program]] sponsored by The Satanic Temple. It was created in July 2016 as an alternative to the [[Christian]]-based after school group called the [[Good News Club]].&lt;ref name="AfterSchoolSatan"&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ |url=https://afterschoolsatan.com/educatin-with-satan/faq/ |website=After School Satan |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Rick |title=Yes, an after-school Satan Club could be coming to your kid's grade school |url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-satanic-after-school-20160928-snap-story.html |date=September 28, 2016 |website=LA Times |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-port"&gt;{{cite web |title=Portland OKs "After School Satan" for elementary kids |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-school-satan-satanic-temple-portland-approved/ |website=CBS News |date=September 28, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Los Angeles Satanic Mass ===
On January 14, 2017, a week before the Trump presidential inauguration, the Temple hosted what it billed as the largest Satanic gathering in history, hoping to double the attendance of the 2015 gathering in Detroit for the Baphomet unveiling. Film crews from VICE and NatGeo were on hand to document the event. The mass included three parts: Invocation Ritual, Destruction Ritual and a Bloodletting Ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/events/1829019433995074/ |title=Satanic Mass ft. 3teeth, Author &amp; Punisher, Coven of Ashes |website=Facebook |date=January 14, 2017 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Los Angeles media was also on hand to cover the event, calling the event "a bloody good time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.laweekly.com/slideshow/the-satanic-temples-black-mass-was-a-bloody-good-time-7826667 |title=The Satanic Black Mass was a Bloody Good Time |website=LA Weekly |date=January 13, 2017 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership in The Satanic Temple is free and open to anyone and can be obtained by signing up on the official website.&lt;ref name="Join Us"&gt;{{cite web |title=Join Us |url=https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/join-us |website=The Satanic Temple |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership cards can be purchased for $25. Additionally, members can apply to join local chapters, though according to Draco Ignis and Hofman A Turing, members of the NYC chapter, the requirements for each chapter may differ. "If there's a local chapter where you are, to join you do have to be accepted, but there's no initiation or anything. You don't even have to be a Satanist, you can just be a strong ally who believes in the political and secular actions without being super stoked about all the aesthetic aspects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Temple of NYC is Fighting For Your Liberty and Your Uterus |url=https://brokeassstuart.com/2016/11/22/103831/ |website=Broke Ass Stuart |date=November 22, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is subject to renewal, revocation, or termination "for a member's failure to conduct him or herself in a manner consistent with the spirit of The Satanic Temple and its tenets."&lt;ref name="Join Us" /&gt;

==Chapters==
The Temple has chapters across the United States, with the largest group in Detroit, Michigan. 

In September 2014, Jex Blackmore launched a chapter of The Satanic Temple in Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple launches Detroit chapter; same-sex wedding ceremonies, location in city part of plans |date=September 6, 2014 |first=Eric |last=Lacy |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/09/satanic_temple_launches_detroi.html |website=[[MLive.com]] |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a membership and information booth at the community festival [[Dally in the Alley]], where she reported that she received good support and turnout.&lt;ref name="JexBlackmore"&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A: Satanic Temple of Detroit's Jex Blackmore explains group's purpose, growth potential |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2015/02/qa_satanic_temple_of_detroits.html |date=February 19, 2015 |website=MLive.com |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21 of that same year the chapter constructed a holiday display for "Snaketivity" on the lawn of the [[Michigan State Capitol]] as a way to counteract and protest a [[nativity scene]] that was placed on the state grounds only days earlier.&lt;ref name="Snaketivity"&gt;{{cite web |title='Snaketivity' display set up at Michigan Capitol draws supporters, opponents |url=https://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2014/12/snaketivity_on_display_at_mich.html |website=MLive.com |date=December 21, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday display depicted a snake, a [[pentagram]], a book, and a cross with the words "Knowledge is the Greatest Gift of All" prominently displayed.&lt;ref name="Snaketivity" /&gt; In 2015 the chapter commented that they were interested in re-erecting the Snaketivity display or a similar live display after learning that United States Senator [[Ted Cruz]] planned to host a live nativity scene at the Capitol on December 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple to counter Ted Cruz nativity in Lansing |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/12/02/cruz-campaigns-nativity-lansing-spurs-snaketivity/76661818/ |website=Detroit Free Press |date=December 2, 2015 |first=Justin A. |last=Hinkley |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmore has stated that the chapter has a core group of about 15 to 20 followers, depending on the project, and that "there's another group, depending on the activity or what we're doing, that's about one tier larger -- probably about 50 or more."&lt;ref name="JexBlackmore" /&gt; The chapter does not have a physical office or building and operates primarily out of rented or borrowed spaces along with other locations.&lt;ref name="JexBlackmore" /&gt;

In a statement posted to her Twitter account in February 2018, Blackmore stated that she has stepped down from her role as spokesperson and chapter head to focus on her personal artistic endeavors.{{cite tweet |user=JexBlackmore |number=965704440211804160 |date=February 19, 2018 |title=Announcement! |access-date=November 29, 2018}} In August 2018, Blackmore amended her statement with an editorial on Medium claiming her resignation was not voluntary and made claims of long term gender, sexual, and racial diversity problems within the organization as well as claims of being harassed personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Struggle for Justice is Ongoing: On my departure from The Satanic Temple |url=https://medium.com/@JexBlackmore/the-struggle-for-justice-is-ongoing-6df38f8893db |first=Jex |last=Blackmore |website=Medium |access-date=November 29, 2018 |date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Blackmore's statement, other members resigned citing similar complaints &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Temple In Engulfed In A Civil War |first=Anna |last=Merlan |url=https://jezebel.com/the-satanic-temple-is-engulfed-in-a-civil-war-over-a-de-1828130997 |website=Jezebel |date=August 7, 2018 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the entire [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] chapter which rebranded as "The Satanic Collective"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BmFaw1WFO5i/ |website=Instagram |title=Please read our statement.

==Comparison to LaVeyan Satanism==
Lucien Greaves has described the Temple as being a progressive and updated version of [[LaVeyan Satanism|LaVey's Satanism]].{{sfn|The Invention of Satanism|Dyrendal, Lewis, Petersen|2016|page=220}} The Temple sees itself as separate and distinct from LaVeyan Satanists, and feels that its principles and tenets represent "a natural evolution in Satanic thought". Greaves has said that the elements of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Nietzscheanism]] within LaVeyan Satanism is incongruent with [[game theory]], [[reciprocal altruism]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://davidpakman.com/interviews/douglas-mesner/ |title=Satanic Temple Founder Talks Atheistic Religion |work=[[The David Pakman Show]] |date=October 9, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized the [[Church of Satan]] for its lack of [[political lobbying]] and what he sees as their exclusivity, referring to them as [[autocratic]] and [[hierarchical]], and saying that the Church fetishizes [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref name="greaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AfterSchoolSatan" /&gt; Conversely, the Church of Satan has made statements claiming that The Satanic Temple are only "masquerading as Satanists&lt;ref name="COS1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Third Side Intelligence: Missouri Abortions |url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/third-side-intelligence-missouri-abortions-the/ |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not represent Satanism.&lt;ref name="COS2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reverend Joel |last=Ethan |title=The Satanic Temple Fact Sheet |url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/the-satanic-temple-fact-sheet/ |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Satanic Temple has received criticism for their actions, most notably from religious organizations and figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanic Temple Group Raising Money for On-Demand Abortions Echos Satanist History of 'Child Sacrifice,' Says Theologian |first=Stoyan |last=Zaimov |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/satanic-temple-group-raising-money-for-on-demand-abortions-echoes-satanist-history-of-child-sacrifice-says-theologian-142087/ |website=[[Christian Post]] |date=July 30, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics state that they believe that the Temple is not a serious organization and is instead meant to be a prank, form of satire, or elaborate [[trolling]] attempt. Greaves and Blackmore have both dismissed these claims, as Greaves stated in a 2013 interview with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that the Temple could be both satanic and satirical.&lt;ref name="greaves"/&gt; Blackmore has also stated that people believe that they are only "trying to cause trouble for no reason except to just be shocking", but the Temple says they are "adding to the dialogue that's already there and asking for rights -- just like anyone else."&lt;ref name="JexBlackmore" /&gt;

Both Greaves and Blackmore have stated that they have received [[death threat|death threats]] in response to their activities with The Satanic Temple.&lt;ref name="JexBlackmore" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucien Greaves of the Satanic Temple |url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/lucien-greaves-of-the-satanic-temple/Content?oid=2201492 |website=[[Detroit Metro Times]] |date=May 27, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4525">The '''Union of Welsh Independents''' ({{lang-cy|Undeb yr Annibynwyr Cymraeg}}) is a [[Reformed]] [[congregationalist]]  denomination in [[Wales]].

== History ==
Welsh congregational churches or Independents stand in the [[Puritan]] tradition. The first congregational congregation was founded at [[Llanfaches]] in 1639. Early founders were in the puritan tradition. Later several churches were founded and formed separate denominations. They embraced different theological positions. Finally the denomination was founded in 1872 as a voluntary association of churches. They called it Independent because each congregation claims to be under the authority of [[Christ]]. Individual congregations cooperate through associations. Now the Union works through six departments: finance, [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]], [[Christian ministry|ministry]], education, churches, communication. The Union churches have much in common with other free churches in Wales. Ministers can freely move their ministry among them. The Unions council met once a year. ''The Union is a free and voluntary body, its aims to help to make churches a fellowship that serve Jesus Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/union-of-welsh-independents|title=Union of Welsh Independents — World Council of Churches|website=www.oikoumene.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has high emphasis on preaching the [[Gospel]], and education, empowering church members. The denomination currently is working on a new mission strategy, the AGAPE program, started in 2005. The latest strategy is the Welsh Independents Development Program.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.cwmeurope.org/en/about-cwm-europe/union-of-welsh-independents www.cwmeurope.org/en/about-cwm-europe/union-of-welsh-independents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831072751/http://www.cwmeurope.org/en/about-cwm-europe/union-of-welsh-independents |date=August 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
In 2004 it had 12 associations of churches and 500 congregations and 34,884 member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1470&amp;lg=eng|title=Address data base of Reformed churches and institutions|first=Christoph|last=Fasse|website=www.reformiert-online.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now it has 450 churches, 31,000 members and 16 associations and about 107 ministers in 2006.

==Teaching philosophy==

Shaare Torah is affiliated philosophically with the [[Haredi Judaism|haredi]] branch of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Its stated goal is "to promote and foster the development of a Ben Torah, a young [person] capable of actively and wholesomely interacting with his fellow Jews and citizens".

==Student demographics==

Shaare Torah primarily caters to the [[Sephardic]] Jewish community of Brooklyn, but also has students from around the [[New York City metropolitan area|Tri-State area]].

==After high school graduation==

Graduates are encouraged to participate in year-long programs at [[yeshivot]] and seminaries in Israel. &lt;ref name=Welcoming/&gt; Afterwards, some continue their studies in similar institutions, while others enroll in university, or go straight into the workforce. Some of the most popular universities among Shaare alumni, such as [[Brooklyn College]] and [[Baruch College]], grant up to one year's worth of credit to students who study in Israel, allowing them to apply these credits to their undergraduate degree.

==History==
